So have you ever been to a wedding?

149

No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

We'll just do a short one real quick.

Hey, Rob, Marlena.

153

I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

154
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,938
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

155
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,025
so I don't really even know what to say.

156
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,985
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

157
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,320
- Like you're president of something!
- Vice president!

158
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,864
Also really cool.

159
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,034
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

and fun for you when you come back.

Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

like a card or something?

Well, my agency... We're leaving.
