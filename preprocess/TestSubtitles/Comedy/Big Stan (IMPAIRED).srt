1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,918
[man] Think about it.
Right on the beach,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,436
ocean breezes, blue skies, seagulls.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,956
- All yours for the taking.
- [woman] It's a timeshare.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,112
[man] Well, it's called a timeshare,

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,238
but the truth is,
for the two weeks you're at the condo,

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,992
you're not sharing anything.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,630
You're not sharing the bathroom,
not sharing the toaster, nothing.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,950
<i>Nada.</i> Zip.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,193
You are the mistress of all you survey.
[chuckles]

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,072
My nephew looked up the neighbourhood
on the computer.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,274
Your nephew?

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,989
Mrs Darby.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,630
He said the condo was
in a bad neighbourhood.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,994
[whispers] Blacks.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,752
You're right. You're right.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,196
The condo is in a rather
poor majority black neighbourhood.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,511
And you know what?
I'm glad you brought it up.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,477
Seriously.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,270
Otherwise, I might have done something
that I'd be ashamed of later.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,877
And that would be
to sell you that timeshare.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,157
- You would not feel safe there.
- No, I wouldn't.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,791
Of course you wouldn't.
How could you?

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,552
We all know,

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,998
and I say this at the risk
of sounding a little racist,

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,233
black dudes love white women.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,188
Love 'em. I don't know
if it's genetic or if it's society.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,035
We can argue nature versus nurture
all day, but it's a scientific fact

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,749
that black men can't get enough
of white women.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,117
Don't think a woman of your age
would be safe from their advances.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,759
No, ma'am.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,196
These big black bucks
don't care whether you're young or old,

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,634
skinny or fat,

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,078
walking or with two wrinkled stumps
right below the knees.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,949
They want your white flesh.
They want it bad.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,033
Truth be told, I'm part black myself.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,351
And if it wasn't for my wife,
I'd be bending you over the desk

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,192
doing you doggy-style right now.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,151
I can just imagine you there,
all alone in that big condo,

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,710
awash in a sea of Negro cock.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,711
I'll... I'll take it.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,758
Smart move. Sign your Jane Hancock
on the dotted line.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,718
- You can't go in there.
- Here you go.

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,110
- Stan Minton.
- I'll be with you in a second.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,269
Go on. Sign it.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,715
Stan Minton,
you're under arrest for fraud.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,394
Anything you say will be
used against you in a court.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,028
It's just a little mix-up.
Go on, sign it.

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,316
- You white Jezebel!
- [woman] I'll call Mal!

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,950
[Stan] You're gonna regret this!
Call my attorney!

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,800
Madam Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,872
- We have, Your Honour.
- Please hand it to the bailiff.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
[judge] Will the defendant please rise?

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,875
Madam Foreman,
how do you find the defendant?

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,828
[woman] We, the jury,
find the defendant guilty.

55
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,354
- What?
- [judge] Thank you, Madam Foreman.

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,988
- That bitch!
- Stanley, please, quiet.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,038
Sentencing will be tomorrow at 10am.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,437
- What the fuck just happened in there?
- You lost, Stanley.

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,989
I didn't lose.
You're the lawyer, you lost.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,752
I'm truly sorry.

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,275
Damn it, man! I'm rich!

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,317
I wanted some of that O.J. justice.

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,357
Maybe the judge will give probation.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,910
No. In this state, first-degree fraud

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,548
carries a minimum
of three to five years.

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,472
I got it!

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,279
- We bribe the judge.
- I'm not gonna bribe the judge.

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,431
- Bribe him.
- I'm not gonna bribe him.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,033
- Bribe him!
- Oh, please.

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,792
- Bribe him!
- No!

71
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,520
I don't practise that kind of law,
and I never will.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,875
You wanna bribe the judge?
Be my guest.

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,272
I'm sure any shyster on the street
will be happy to do it for you.

74
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,829
[Stan] Mal? You're fired.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,312
[judge] Mr Popper,
is your client ready for sentencing?

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,550
He is, Your Honour.

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,190
[judge] Anything you'd like to say
before the court passes sentence?

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,035
Your Honour, my client
has been convicted

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,395
of fraud in the first degree.

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,836
A crime of which he is innocent.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,276
But even if he were guilty

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,079
and his customers were defrauded,

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,438
isn't it better that Mr Minton,
as a resident of Los Angeles,

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,990
receive the money,
thereby keeping it in the community,

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,709
as opposed to some gypsies
or travelling Mexicans,

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,839
who would have taken the money
out of the community?

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,359
Please take that into consideration.

88
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,953
Mr Minton, you are hereby sentenced to
serve a term of no less than three years

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,759
at the Verlaine State
Correctional Facility.

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,912
Normally, your sentence
would begin immediately.

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,710
However, I'm going to delay
your incarceration for six months

92
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,032
so that you may...
reorganise the charity

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,239
that you've established
to teach music to retarded children.

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,956
Thank you, judge.

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,268
Court is adjourned.

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,239
- Teach music to retarded children?
- It sounded good at the time.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,516
- I thought you were gonna bribe him.
- I did.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,274
Hundred grand in Krugerrand
doesn't go too far now.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,112
- Did we win?
- No. I don't get it.

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,316
You bribe the judge
and I get three years?

101
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,436
Mandatory.
The judge couldn't fix that.

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,068
Now you got six months
to set your affairs in order.

103
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,832
My affairs are already in order.

104
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,194
My legal opinion is that you take
a Brazilian vacation. Permanently.

105
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,555
Sounds like fun. [laughs]

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,233
I can't do that.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,868
Those Krugerrands were the last
liquid asset I had.

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,076
The rest of my money
is frozen in the bank.

109
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,708
I'm not gonna run
and leave seven million behind.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,792
Well, Stan,
my old man had a saying:

111
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,509
"You walk through a locker room,
you're gonna see some dick."

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,832
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you rip off enough people,

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,911
eventually you're gonna go to jail.

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,798
Thanks, that's really comforting.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,238
Hey, I'm a crooked lawyer.
I know I'm going to jail someday.

116
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,631
You don't see me crying about it.
[laughs]

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,753
Stan, slow down. You're gonna choke.

118
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,151
I gotta eat now.
I hear that prison food is real crap.

119
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,270
I'm real glad we have six months
together before you have to go to...

120
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,237
- You know.
- Tell me about it.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,597
I could be in jail right now.
Popper's one hell of a lawyer.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,754
I'm gonna be awfully lonely
while you're gone.

123
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,879
I know, sweetheart.
But I think I get conjugal visits.

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,918
I can probably stick it to you
once a month or so. Pretty good.

125
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,036
Oh, sure, that's great.

126
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,838
- But I was thinking...
- Mm-hm.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,028
...maybe we could do something now
so I wouldn't be so lonely later.

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,918
Like what?

129
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,471
Like maybe we could make a baby.

130
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,959
Mindy, are you crazy?

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,190
- I just...
- I'm gonna be gone three years.

132
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,477
Five at the max. What are we gonna do
with the kid when I get out?

133
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,551
Give it up for adoption?
That's cruel.

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,632
I thought maybe we could keep it.

135
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,836
Mindy, how many times
have we gone over this?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,275
It's selfish to bring
a child into this world.

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,159
A world full of suffering
and hunger and war.

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,959
- It's just... selfish!
- I know.

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,793
Plus, a kid would totally
cramp our lifestyle.

140
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,839
We couldn't go on vacation when we
wanted, they break stuff, they cry.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,434
You'd get stretch marks.

142
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,160
That's right. Stretch marks.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,389
Scary stuff, huh?

144
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,632
[sobbing] I just let you
walk all over me.

145
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,951
- Oh, Mindy, come on.
- [sobbing]

146
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,315
OK, Mindy, you can get a dog.

147
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,278
After I leave!

148
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,271
Your other steak, sir.

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,712
[thunder rumbles]

150
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,750
[rock music playing]

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,152
- What do you want, doll?
- Put some Scotch in this.

152
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,598
- We got whiskey.
- Not as good, but it'll have to do.

153
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,469
All right. That'll be 75 cents.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,115
Good deal.

155
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,154
- Keep the change.
- Ooh! [laughs] Well...

156
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,998
Ah! Give me another one, honey.

157
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,953
Do you got a problem?

158
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,472
No. No, I...

159
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,474
I was just wondering...
you've been to prison, right?

160
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,358
You do have a problem.

161
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,592
No, I... I'm going to prison.

162
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,752
But I've never been there before
and I was just thinking maybe

163
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,512
you could give me some pointers.

164
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,594
- I'll pay you 100 bucks.
- Just for talking?

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,712
- How much time did you get?
- Three to five.

166
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,155
- Where at?
- Verlaine.

167
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,155
Verlaine? That's fucked, Stan.
Guards just don't give a damn.

168
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,790
They let the cons beat the shit
out of one another all day.

169
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,439
How am I gonna do in there?

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,910
I mean, if you saw me,
would you beat the shit out of me?

171
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,759
I'd probably rape ya.

172
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,709
- You'd rape me?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,715
So it's true, huh?
A lot of guys turn gay in prison?

174
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,429
I'm always gay.
I only rape people in prison.

175
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,990
- You're gay?
- Yeah. This is a gay bar.

176
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,754
Whoo!

177
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,512
[man] Let's do this thing.

178
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,349
Whoo!

179
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,877
Look, rape isn't an act of sex.
Rape is an act of violence.

180
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,077
And in prison society,
it's all about violence.

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,470
You're judged by how bad
other cons fear you.

182
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,598
Raping a dude is the ultimate way
of beating him down.

183
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,751
It means you're one bad motherfucker.

184
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,912
So you rape people?

185
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,992
Well, now that's something
I'm not real proud of.

186
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,835
I don't condone the practise,
to be honest. But I do do it some.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,117
Just to keep up with the Joneses.
You know what I mean.

188
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,955
Little dude like you,
be an easy mark.

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,113
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't there anything I could do?

190
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,111
You could join a gang.

191
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,714
- Are you a racist?
- Not really.

192
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,030
That leaves out the Nazis.

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,760
- Got any Mob connections?
- No.

194
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,354
- Wouldn't happen to be Latino?
- Uh-uh.

195
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,080
Looks like everybody's gonna rape you.

196
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,074
OK. OK, I... I bet I can be a racist
for three to five years.

197
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,913
- A real racist. Hardcore.
- Well, good.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,310
- Then you can join the Nazis.
- Excellent.

199
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,357
You'll only be raped by other Nazis.

200
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,035
Raped by Nazis? No way!

201
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,394
Anything else I can do?

202
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,438
Isn't there some way I can
cultivate some outlaw image?

203
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,831
- You have to kill a dude.
- Without killing a dude?

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,197
In your case,
it'd be a real long shot, Stan.

205
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,272
- Wouldn't happen to have any tats?
- Tats?

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,078
Ink.

207
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,074
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
I didn't grow up with my mom. So I...

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,038
When I was 18, I got a tattoo.

209
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,514
"Mommy".

210
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,070
You might as well buy a welcome mat,
strap it to your asshole.

211
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,958

Stan, honey.
You wanna wake up?

218
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,238
It's 2.00.

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,034
- Good morning, dear.
- Good afternoon, Stan.

It was all a bad dream.

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,317
- Just a horrible dream.
- What was your dream, baby?

224
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,913
It was awful!

225
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,437
I was gonna go to prison
and big men were gonna rape me.

226
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,956
But here I am, safe in my bed.

227
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,712
It was all a bad dream.

228
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,314
But you are gonna be going
to prison, right?

229
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,677
- Huh?
- You're going to prison in six months.

230
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,595
No! [sobbing]

231
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,876
Oh! Oh!

232
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,350
Honey, it's OK.
A lot can happen in six months.

233
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,559
What's gonna happen, Mindy?
Is my anus gonna grow teeth?

234
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,116
No, silly! You'll find a way.
You always do.

235
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,713
What'd you just say?

236
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,269
You always find a way.

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,434
That's right. I always do.

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,991
My baby ready to eat breakfast?

239
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,989
Mindy...

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,639
...did I have a lot growing up?

241
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,713
No, I did not.
I had nothing growing up.

242
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,316
I had a drunk father
who was emotionally unavailable to me.

243
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,710
I had a summer job at Dairy Queen.

244
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,314
I had tomato soup for dinner.

245
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,391
Nobody ever gave me anything.

246
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,553
Truly, mine was
a hardscrabble existence.

247
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,472
Yet look at me today.

248
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,596
I own a palatial estate,

249
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,398
I drive a Lamborghini,

250
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,312
I have a summer house on the lake,

251
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,597
a complete Bang & Olufsen
home theatre system,

252
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
- a beautiful wife.
- [giggles]

253
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,870
And whom do I have to thank
for all this stuff?

254
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,759
Me. Nobody else.

255
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,230
Me. I am a winner.

256
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,154
I set my mind to do something,
and I do it.

257
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,710
And so when I say to you
that I will make myself un-rapeable,

258
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,270
I will be un-rapeable!

259
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,353
Yay!

260

I got a couple of things in mind. But
first I got kind of a weird question.

266
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,472
Do you have anything you could tattoo
around my sphincter

267
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,073
to make it less attractive?

- Stanny, come to bed.
- Not... Not now, Mindy.

Not now, honey.

- [growling]

312
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,675
- All right.
- Fighting stance!

313
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,070
All right, Seymour.
See what you got.

314
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,753
- [grunts]
- [grunts]

315
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,679
Ah! Ah!

316
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,273
Oof!

317
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,749
- [chuckling]
- [grunting]

318
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,953
- How do you like that, huh, Seymour?
- Stanley!

319
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,913
[grunts]

320
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,514
- Uh!
- You can forget about your refund!

321
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,318
[both grunt]

322
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,433
Is that all you got?

323
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,433
Ah!

324
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,113
Pussy.

325
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,874
[groaning]

326
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,790
That's some technique you got.

327
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,318
[cat yowls]

328
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,474
You couldn't knock a shit
out of a paper bag full of shit.

329
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,149
Oh, and you could do better?

330
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,717
Any questions?

331
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,036
- [Stan] Mindy!
- Dinner's almost ready!

332
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,191
- I got great news!
- What happened to you?

333
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,874
Never mind that.
I just met the best guy. Guess what?

334
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,191
- He's agreed to be my trainer.
- Really? What's his name?

335
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,269
The Master.

336
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,233
- How do you do?
- The Master.

337
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,838
He's gonna live with us and train me.

338
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,355
I have to pay him
when my accounts get unfrozen.

339
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,112
- Oh.
- [The Master] Ahem.

340
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,872
And the contract.

341
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,270
Yeah, I'll write it up right now.

342
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,758
I'm so sorry, The Master,
but there's no smoking in the house.

343
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,199
Yes, there is.

344
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,948
I better heat up another Lean Cuisine.

345
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,829
Honey, you've done it again.
You heated it just perfect.

346
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,876
[Mindy] So...

347
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,998
...The Master, where are you from?

348
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,912
Hell.

349
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,552
Oh! What brought you to LA? A job?

350
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,712
I travel where the wind takes me.

351
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,833
- Isn't he great?
- [laughs]

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,037
Well, how long have you been
teaching the art of self-defence?

353
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,474
Young lady,
what I teach is not art.

354
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,517
It is science.

355
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,515
A careful amalgam of the most
deadly parts of karate, kung fu,

356
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,992
Wing Chun, Krav Maga, Muay Thai,

357
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,948
savate and Filipino Kali.

358
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,314
My favourite.

359
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,948
Ooh! [laughs] Wow!

360
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,319
I find weakness

361
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,040
and turn it into strength.

362
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,078
I find fat and turn it into muscle.

363
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,756
I find blisters
and turn them into canker sores.

364
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,311
I find doubt
and I turn it into will.

365
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,630
You can stop doing that now.

366
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,075
- Doing what?
- Your hand.

367
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,355
Oh. I forgot it was there.

368
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,631
I'm gonna take a shit.

369
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,788
- Enjoy yourself.
- Mm.

370
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,154
Stan, honey,
does he really have to live here?

371
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,515
- The Master?
- He scares me.

372
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,389
I know. He scares me too. That's exactly
why he's the perfect guy to teach me.

373
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,154
- But, Stan...
- Look, want me to survive in prison?

374
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,357
- Of course I do.
- Then don't argue with me about this.

375
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,999
You'll see, he'll grow on you.

376
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,669
Wake up, weakling.

377
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,037
- [both scream]
- What the hell you doing in here?

378
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,397
It's time to begin your training.

379
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,755
- But it's five in the morning.
- [The Master growls]

380
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,718
- Is that liver?
- It's your breakfast.

381
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,908
And every moment you delay,
I squeeze out more of its vital juices.

382
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,310
Trust me, you'll need them later.

383
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,711
- OK, I'm up.
- [The Master] But are you ready?

384
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,440
Look what I found beside your bed.

385
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,717
This is weakness.

386
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,111
This is defeatism.

387
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,794
Actually, we were kind of enjoying that.

388
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,871
Eat this.

389
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,030
And follow me.

390
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,600
[The Master] Punch!
All right, now kick.

391
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,750
[The Master] Punch!
All right, now kick.

392
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,115
- Kick!
- [blender whirring]

393
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,439
Kick like you mean it!

394
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,473
[glass shatters]

395
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,030
- Oh!
- I blended that gross stuff you wanted.

396
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,715
I got it all in Koreatown. I didn't
even know there was a Koreatown.

397
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,632
[sniffing]

398
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,117
Too many eggs.

399
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,590
The fish oil is nice.
Ox pancreas is good.

400
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,639
- Next time, use more tongue.
- That's what she said.

401
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,472
- Ooh!
- Oh, Stan!

402
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,437
- I'm all right.
- Get away from him!

403
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,798
- I'm OK.
- Rise and drink your lunch.

404
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,872
[slurping]

405
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,155
Don't I get to eat anything
that tastes good?

406
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,108
- You like hot dogs?
- Yeah, sure.

407
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,510
If you don't drink that,

408
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,955
the boys in prison will feed you...

409
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,435
...many hot dogs.

410
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,557
I can kick your ass so fast
you wouldn't even feel it.

411
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,076
- I'd like to see that.
- [whooshing]

412
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,312
You didn't kick me in the ass.
I didn't feel anything.

413
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,198
[sighs]

414
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,031
[sniffs]

415
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,556
[Stan] Ow! Ow!

416
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,075
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

417
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,037
Ow! Ow! Ow!

418
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,599
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

419
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,149
- [The Master] Pain is interpretation.
- OK.

420
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,711
I'm gonna call a time-out here. You're
beating my husband with a flaming stick.

421
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,838
Isn't there some kind
of role-playing exercise you can do?

422
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,389
Run along, honey.
This is man stuff here.

423
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,232
Go ahead, Master.

424
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,550
Ow! Ow! Ow!

425
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,110
Ow! Ah! Oh!

426
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,316
Ow! Ah!

427
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,040
[grunting]

428
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,755
No disrespect, I realise this
is strengthening my nipples.

429
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,639
And believe me, I can feel the burn.

430
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,679
I was wondering,
just how important are strong nipples?

431
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,354
- Someday these nipples...
- Ah!

432
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,273
...may save your life.
- Ah!

433
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,916
You are what you eat.

434
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,231
[Mindy] Um, are you sure
that's Eastern mysticism?

435
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,278
Because I learned that
in health class in third grade.

436
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,998
Silence, woman.

437
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,948
I mean, all that stuff about pain
and illusion sounds totally mystical.

438
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,271
But "you are what you eat"?
Even I know that. And I am from Omaha.

439
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,110
What part of Omaha?

440
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,794
- Oh!
- Dundee.

441
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,353
Happy Hollow.

442
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,753
You're Oscar?

443
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,388
I should have known.

444
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,235
Those womanly, childbearing hips

445
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,235
could not be a product
of this perfidious coast.

446
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,551
Uh, do you mind?
I'm trying to eat scorpion here.

447
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,756
Insolent fool!

448
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,993
- [Mindy screams]
- You have lost the right

449
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,594
to eat scorpion.

450
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,389
- [sighs]
- Great. There goes my lunch.

451
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,118
- Thanks.
- This is not working.

452
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,952
- Master says...
- Master's a jerk.

453
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,553
- Shh!
- He is!

454
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,111
And he is a creep. The house smells.
Does he have to smoke in every room?

455
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,955
The only time I see you alone is in bed
and you're too tired to...

456
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,351
Hey! I got five months, and then
it's prison. I gotta stay focused.

457
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,798
I gotta think, eat, breathe prison.
I don't have time for anything else.

458
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,838
Not even time for me?

459
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,116
[sighs]

460
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,554
Tell you what.

461
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,951
After I'm done working out
with The Master, I'll rent some movies,

462
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,351
and we'll cuddle around the TV
like old times, OK?

463
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,238
Really?

464
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,189
- Mindy!
- [gasps]

465
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,079
Some men broke into the house!
They wanna rape you!

466
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,356
- What?
- Big men!

467
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,512
- They wanna rape you! Repeatedly!
- What about The Master?

468
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,036
They have guns! They killed him!

00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,629
Sergeant Bullard will lead you
to the medical office where you'll strip

628
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,713
and have your cavities searched.
You're gonna enjoy that.

629
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,998
Now, gentlemen! Single file.
Come on! Get up there.

630
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,149
Pecker to butthole.

631
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,631
All right, assume the position.

632
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,715
- [screams]
- Why you screaming like a little girl?!

633
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,792
Sarge, look.

634
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,678
Sweet Jesus!

635
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,358
It's like an alien
staring into my soul.

636
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,192
[door buzzes]

637
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,592
Welcome home. New luxury condos,
compliments of the state.

638
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,398
Step it up, boys.

639
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,992
- [blues plays]
- [men shouting]

640
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,038
- Come on, sweet meat!
- [yelling]

641
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,397
Hello there, young fella.
I guess we're cellmates.

642
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,679
My name's Larry.
But you can call me Shorts.

643
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,274
Shorts, you're in my bunk.

644
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,194
- What?
- That's my bunk. Get out.

645
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,557
[laughing] You hold on there
just a second.

646
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,951
This is my bunk.
What gives you the right to?

647
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,633
Ow!

648
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,320
- I said that's my bunk.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

649
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,629
Whoo!

650
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,991
Uh, you might wanna change the sheets.

651
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,638
I'm kind of a compulsive masturbator.

652
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,879
Shorts, that's your bunk.

653
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,112
- Really?
- Absolutely.

654
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,034
Thanks, buddy.
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

655
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,428
Hey, put her here.

656
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,116
- I don't shake hands.
- Well, whatever.

657
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,875
[grunts, sighs]

658
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,349
Ah, good to be back.

659
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,039
Tell me, Shorts,
who's the toughest guy here?

660
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,350
Who's the biggest bad-ass
in the cell block?

661
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,637
Biggest bad-ass?
There's a lot of contenders.

662
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,588
There's Cleon. He's leader
of the Diamond Kings, the black gang.

663
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,356
- I seen him kill a man with his fist.
- That's right! Yeah!

664
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,718
Then there's Juanito.
He's head of the Mexican gang.

665
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,791
Hey, get back. Hey!

666
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,475
And whatever you do,
don't go near those guys.

667
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,589
- The goal is to express ourselves...
- They're Scientologists.

668
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,150
- They don't look so tough.
- Yeah. They'll talk your ear off

669
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,709
- and then sue your ass.
...distinguish fear.

670
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,668
Then there's the Nazis.
None of them are too tough.

671
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,753
They don't fight fair and don't fight
alone. They always gang up on you.

672
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,718
Their leader, Patterson,
he's a real bastard.

673
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,190
His uncle's the head
of the Aryan Nation.

674
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,112
Let me clarify my question, Shorts.

675
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,840
Who's the most
dangerous sexual predator?

676
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,877
Oh, that's easy.

677
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,077
It's Big Raymond.
Absolutely insatiable.

678
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,118
Crazy. The other black guys
don't go near him.

679
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,795
But they'd back him up
if it came to a fight.

680
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,110
Big Raymond it is.

681
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,077
- Can I borrow that?
- Yeah.

682
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,673
Thanks.

683
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,914
Hey, Stan. Stan, where you going?

684
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,833
You think that cigarette was free?
Is that what you think?

685
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,560
I'll pay you back, man.
I don't have any money.

686
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,075
You think I want money?

687
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,355
Mmm...

688
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,956
- Excuse me.
- Bug off, bitch!

689
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,429
I'll get to you later.

690
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,397
Did you just call me bitch?

691
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,677
Yeah, I said it.

692
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,396
Hey, everybody! Did you hear that?

693
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,632
Big Raymond, for no reason,
just called me bitch!

694
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,438
Now, was that nice?

695
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,239
- [muttering]
- It's not like I called him fat.

696
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,472
It's not like I said I seen pig shit
prettier than he is.

697
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,509
It's not like I said his mother's pussy
smells like egg salad.

698
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,118
Which it does.

699
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,033
[men shouting]

700
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,192
[man] Oh, hell nah! Ohhh, hell nah!

701
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,432
Hell nah! Oh, hell nah!

702
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,397
Ho-ho! Yeah!

703
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,869
[shouting]

704
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,228
[cracking]

705
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,558
[screaming]

706
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,996
- [snapping]
- Ah! Ah!

707
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,674
Ahhh!

708
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,637
[screaming]

709
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,358
Who's the bitch now, bitch?

710
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,999
[continues screaming]

711
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,434
[all] Ooh!

712
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,398
I told you Raymond was gonna get
his ass beat. I told you!

713
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,677
[cheering]

714
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,513
[laughing] My cracker!

715
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,035
Laying the boot to the big nigga.
Give it up!

716
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,953
Don't use that word around me.
It's ugly and racist.

717
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,995
- [all laugh]
- [man] Yeah, dawg!

718
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,157
He's funny too, man.

719
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,039
All right, listen here, player.
All right?

720
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,670
We want you to join up with us,
nah mean? Them niggas is gonna tear...

721
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,876
[man] Ooh!

722
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,837
I said don't talk that way around me.

723
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,319
Let me get some of that!

724
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,438
- [man] Let's kill him.
- No, I got it, I got it. I got it!

725
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,037
Handle your business, Cleon.

726
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,029
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're gonna
stick up for that fat son of a bitch.

727
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,397
You happen to see the colour
of that fat son of a bitch's skin?

728
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,676
Hey, aren't we over that?

729
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,513
Didn't you see that <i>Nova</i> episode?
Huh, you guys?

730
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,636
They did that DNA test.

731
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,155
- We all come from Africa.
- [man] Kick his ass.

732
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,393
It's a proven fact. Under the skin,
I'm just as black as you are.

733
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,959
- [man] Fuck that.
- Get him!

734
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,669
- [man] Get him, man! Get him! Get him!
- Motherfucker!

735
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,593
[grunting]

736
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,717
- Get him!
- Ah!

737
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,876
[shouting]

738
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,118
Man, get that fool!

739
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,634
Dumb bitch!

740
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,478
Hold on. See what happens.

741
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,712
- [shouting]
- [grunts]

742
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,076
- Oh!
- Ah!

743
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,596
[all] Oh!

744
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,673
- [man] Take the stick!
- [man 2] No, don't take it!

745
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,998
- [man 3] Take the stick!
- [man 2] No, don't take it!

746
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,477
Oh, he did it again.

747
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,916
- [man] Take the stick! Take it!
- Mm-hm?

748
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,640
- [all shouting]
- [man 2] No, no, don't take it!

749
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,672
Whoo!

750
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,195
[man 2] I told him
not to take that stick.

751
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,717
[man] Even the Asian!

752
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,191
Where the hell did that guy come from?

753
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,157
- Whoo!
- [man] Damn!

754
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,436
- [man 2] That guy's good.
- [man 3] All right.

755
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,397
[man 4] Come on, Cleon.

756
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,120
[man 5] It's your time, baby.
Don't be scared.

757
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,396
[man 6] It's your time to shine, Cleon.

758
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,548
[all] Ooh!

759
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,356
[Stan] Cleon.

760
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,479
If you wanna fight me,
you're gonna have to fight me.

761
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,632
- I understand.
- Pick up your gold teeth.

762
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,156
I'm gonna let you keep them this time.

763
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,276
But if you come at me again...

764
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,189
...l'm gonna hang onto them
like a Swiss banker.

765
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,355
[Cleon] Ya'll ain't gonna help me?

766
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,080
I'm missing a bicuspid.

767
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,789
We should have killed him.

768
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,748
[sobbing] Somebody,
call an orthodontist.

769
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,590
Hm. I see Mr Minton
has acquainted himself

770
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,876
with his new surroundings.

771
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,713
I believe it's time I had
my little chat with him.

772
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,999
Ow!

773
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,510
- [indistinct chatter]
- Whoa, whoa, look out.

774
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,636
Beat it. All of you.

775
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,638
Oh, man, this stuff's good. I don't know
what everybody's complaining about.

776
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,518
You're kidding me.

777
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,638
Hey, man.
I just wanna say thanks.

778
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,869
For what?

779
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,359
You know, for helping me before.

780
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,669
With Big Raymond.

781
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,593
I wasn't helping you.
I was helping me.

782
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,274
I had to beat up the biggest shithead.
He happened to be talking to you.

783
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,639
OK.

784
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,757
But, you know, I... I mean, I...

785
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,831
I think that guy wanted to fuck me.

786
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,354
Trust me, in your case,
I was just putting off the inevitable.

787
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,878
[speaking Spanish]

788
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,191
- [man makes kissing sound]
- Yeah.

789
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,713
Well, thanks anyway.

790
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,790
[man] What's your name, girl?
Don't be shy, just say hi.

791
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,949
Come here. Kick back, baby girl!

792
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,998
Little hard on the kid, weren't you?

793
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,311
That's got nothing to do with me.
And I'm gonna keep it that way.

794
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,630
- You got that?
- Mm-hm.

795
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,116
[Bullard] One-one-five!

796
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,116
Minton, warden wants to see you.
Get up.

797
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,555
- Me?
- Now! Walk!

798
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,358
Put your hands behind your back.

799
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,757
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

800
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,395
Minton, I'm glad you could make it.

801
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,791
- You can take the cuffs off him.
- Sure you wanna do that, Boss?

802
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,951
I said take 'em off.

803
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,588
It's all right.

804
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,988
I already got 'em.

805
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,916
It's a matter of dislocating the wrists.

806
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,672
[snaps]

807
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,472
[cracks]

808
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,349
Ew! Ew, that is creepy!

809
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,637
- You can wait outside.
- [shudders]

810
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,709
Have a seat.

811
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,999
Warden, if this is about me
fighting in the yard, it...

812
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,593
Cigar?

813
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,719
Thank you.

814
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,469
Brandy?

815
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,236
Sure.

816
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,676
You know, you wardens should complain.

817
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,879
'Cause in the movies,
they always make you look like assholes.

818
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,909
[laughs] Well,
I don't plan on being a warden forever.

819
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,594
- Is that right?
- Tell me, Minton.

820
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,035
What do you think of this place?

821
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,749
It's OK, for a prison.

822
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,959
Not the prison. The land.

823
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,996
It's a nice sized property. Great views
of the foothills and city. Level grade.

824
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,357
I'm assuming there's
bedrock beneath us.

825
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,071
Easy access to downtown.
I see some nice development potential.

826
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,277
- Too bad you got a prison on it.
- Exactly.

827
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,592
You know, it's no accident
you came to Oaksburg.

828
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,513
I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

829
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,072
What made you wanna do that?

830
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,759
Come here.

831
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,472
Oaksburg Estates.

832
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,872
I'm a silent partner, so to speak,
with some private investors

833
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,114
who would like to develop this land
into timeshare condominiums.

834
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,989
I believe that's
your field of expertise.

835
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,436
- True.
- 'Course, all this is only possible

836
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,273
in the event the prison
ever closes down.

837
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,955
- Makes sense.
- You know, I'm in the prison business.

838
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,680
I know how to break a man's will,
crush his spirit.

839
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,879
But them real estate contracts,
those things put a real hurt on you.

840
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,519
That's where you come in.

841
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,913
- What's in it for me?
- How would you like to be out of here

842
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,069
in a year?

843
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,352
- But I've got a mandatory minimum.
- Wardens have great discretion

844
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,150
getting early parole, especially
to non-violent, first-time offenders.

845
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,791
- Prisons are crowded, you know.
- The system is corrupt.

846
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,154
Me likey.

847
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,756
But you gotta move the luxury units
closer to the lagoon.

848
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,480
That'll double rents.
Parking goes underground.

849
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,916
Wasting space. Eight extra units.
Whoever designed this is a moron.

850
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,958
- How will you get rid of the prison?
- Let me worry about that.

851
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,350
Tell me more about them parking spaces.

852
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,598
[Stan singing in Spanish]

853
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,155
You strapped?

854
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,595
He ain't gonna know what hit him,
nah mean?

855
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,509
Ah!

856
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,510
That's gonna scar, you psycho.

857
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,356
- Whoo!
- [grunts]

858
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,557
You want that shiv, don't you?

859
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,913
You made that with a melted toothbrush
and a razorblade?

860
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,752
- That's very creative.
- Ah!

861
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,797
Look what I made
with three bars of soap and a shoelace.

862
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,831
[chuckles] Cracker, please.

863
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,310
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

864

[high-pitched warbling]

[high-pitched warbling]

866
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,751
Come on, race traitor.

867
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,390
- Ah!
- Ooh!

868
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,795
[high-pitched warbling]

869
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,278
Oh!

870
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,554
- [neck cracks]
- Ha!

871
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,790
Hee-yah!

872
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,238
He's all yours.

873
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,678
This gonna be fun.

874
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,115
[all shouting]

875
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,789
Hey, Stan. What'd you do to Patterson?

876
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,235
I just roughed him up a little bit.

877
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,995
- Why?
- Somebody took a shiv to his ass.

878
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,676
They say he'll be shitting sideways
for a month. [laughs]

879
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,559
Now I know
what schadenfreude feels like.

880
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,517
- What?
- Schadenfreude.

881
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,275
It's German for when you feel good
because your enemy's anus is violated.

882
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,317
Oh.

883
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,958
You know you're getting that on me.

884
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,598
<i>[Stan on phone] I'm doing great.</i>
<i>You guys are pussies.</i>

885
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,038
That's terrific. Hey, listen, pal.
I need your help.

886
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,317
I can't get Mindy's lawyer
to return my call.

887
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,789
If we wanna go through
with this divorce,

888
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,191
you're going to have
to contact her personally.

889
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,308
<i>Stan.</i>

890
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,072
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

891
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,516
<i>- How's the appeal coming?</i>
- [laughs]

892
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,435
Believe it or not, I'm looking
at the Madam Foreman right now.

893
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,318
- [laughs]
- <i>That's great.</i>

894
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,679
[stammering] I gotta go now.
You know, duty calls.

895
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,035
All right. Thanks, Lew.
I'll talk to you soon.

896
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,874
[grunting, farting]

897
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,751
Ain't you Charlize Theron?

898
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,158
Oh, look what fell out there.

899
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,550
[laughing] So I had them
exchange the beef for horse meat.

900
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,632
- Clever.
- That's Stan.

901
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,109
Minton, I'd like for you
to meet Mr Dang.

902
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,236
He's on the prison's board of governors.

903
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,279
They let Vietnamese mafia on
the prison board of governors?

904
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,115
Your finger tats.

905
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,833
[laughs] Like you say, Stan,
the system is corrupt.

906
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,993
Mr Dang's family happens to be
my partners in Oaksburg Estates.

907
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,799
Oh, good, 'cause I was just
going over the contracts.

908
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,952
The language gets rather vague
on gross versus net liability.

909
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,476
I'm sure it's unintentional, but that
could screw you in the long run.

910
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,430
Could it? I'll have my lawyers
correct that immediately.

911
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,910
I got an excellent lawyer for that.
He specialises in it. Lew Popper.

912
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,390
Popper? I'll be sure to contact him.

913
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,269
[laughs] Come on, Dang,
let's check out the floor show.

914
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,638
[shouting]

915
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,190
It looks like the savages
are ready for the inspection.

916
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,876
[Gasque] Well, give me a few more weeks.
I'll even have 'em readier.

917
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,917
[Dang] I'm counting on that.

918
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,436
Would you like a strawberry?

919
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,792
- I grew them in my own garden.
- Thank you.

920
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,349
Minton? Strawberry?

921
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,469
No, I'm good.

922
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,112
[Gasque] Maybe I picked 'em
a little too soon.

923
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,877
I don't think that's it.

924
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,708
<i>[Stan on phone] People</i>
<i>are scared shitless of me.</i>

925
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,154

<i>Is there anyone there</i>

What's the matter, Stan?

929

You sound... distant.

Don't you ever find yourself
feeling sorry for anybody?

932
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,955
You might as well ask me
if I feel sorry for the maggots

I grind into my morning coffee.

934
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,470
[laughs] That's how I feel too.
Listen, I gotta go.

935
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,393

01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,510
- [Popper] Oh, yeah!
- [woman] Are you using me?

938
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,796
- [Popper] No!
- [woman] Don't you love me?

939
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,951
- [Popper] Yeah!
- [woman] Show me!

940
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,351
- [phone rings]
- [shouting]

941
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,792
- Do you love me?
- Yeah. Hello. Hey!

942
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,758
Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah.

943
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,639
Hi, Stan. Yeah.
I think I have good news.

944
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,588
- [woman] Do you love me?
- Yeah. I think the... I think the...

945
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,959
The Madam Foreman is just one orgasm
away from giving you your appeal.

946
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,793
<i>[Stan] That's great, Lew.</i>
<i>And gross.</i>

947
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,916
Heard from Mindy or her attorney?

948
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,071
Uh, no.

949
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,915
But don't say I don't earn my money.
[laughs]

950
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,915
Hi, fellas.
I don't believe I ordered Chinese.

951
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,790
I guess I could go
for a little pot-sticker.

952
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,198
[Shorts] Who are you writing to?

953
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,590
No one special.

954
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,037
You've been sitting there for a while
writing to no one special.

955
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,995
You know, Stan, I've been here for a
long time. I can handle a lot of things.

956
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,709
Like having to spend the rest
of my life in this shithole.

957
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,997
But there's one thing I do regret.

958
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,516
I could never make it work
with Miyoshi.

959
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,437
Oh, she was the only person
who ever loved me for me.

960
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,278
I was too pigheaded to realise it.

961
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,560
[sighs] I'd give anything
to change the way I behaved.

962
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,078
How did you behave?

963
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,275
I killed her.

964
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,154
Oh.

965
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,950
Alcohol wasn't something that always
brought out the best in me, Stan.

966
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,193
<i>[Stan] Dear Mindy, I've been</i>
<i>thinking a lot about you lately.</i>

967
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,078
<i>About us.</i>

968
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,310
<i>I realise now that you were right.</i>

969
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,711
<i>I was pigheaded and selfish.</i>

970
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,316
<i>Leaving me was probably</i>
<i>the best thing for you.</i>

971
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,391
<i>And I'm truly sorry.</i>

972
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,154
<i>I never should have hurt you.</i>

973
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,232
<i>I know now why you wanted</i>
<i>to have a baby with me.</i>

974
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,595
<i>It's just another way</i>
<i>for us to love each other</i>

975
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,399
<i>even more deeply.</i>

976
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,950
<i>I hope, someday,</i>
<i>you'll be able to forgive me.</i>

977
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,918
<i>Love always, Stan.</i>

978
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,758
[The Master] Hey, baby.

979
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,954
Now, I know all of you want to get back
to your weightlifting and basketball

980
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,430
and masturbating, so I'm gonna
try to keep this short. All right?

981
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:43,879
I am throwing away all of these
violent video games and movies.

982
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,598
[all groaning]

983
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,115
Don't do that! No! Come on, man!

984
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,670
From now on, I want you guys
watching more wholesome entertainment.

985
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,196
And frankly, a lot of the rap music
you brothers listen to

986
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,715
- was too hateful towards women.
- [all laughing]

987
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,838
What is up with that?
You like women, right?

988
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,149
[all] Yeah!

989
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,992
Now, on the other hand,

990
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,232
the Mexicans are onto something
with mariachi and salsa music.

991
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,516
[cheering]

992
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,197
It's positive, easy to dance to
and you never get tired of it.

993
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,113
- Shorts, give us a taste.
- Here we go.

994
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,876
<i>[salsa music plays]</i>

995
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,031
<i>[man singing in Spanish]</i>

996
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,958
[cheering, whistling]

997
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,073
[cheering]

998
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,838
Holy shit.

999
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,798
- All right. All right, all right.
- [music stops]

1000
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,350
That's Afro-Cuban. I asked
for mariachi. But you get the point.

1001
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,592
All right? Now, lastly,
and most importantly,

1002
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,558
from now on, there will
be no more rape at this prison.

1003
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,154
- [all shouting]
- No, no!

1004
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,551
That's right.
Anyone who rapes another inmate

1005
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,473
- will have to answer to me.
- [man] Boo!

1006
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,278
[Stan] I will not be kind.

1007
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,193
- Excuse me, Big Stan.
- Yes, Juanito.

1008
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,715
Why you putting your nose
where it don't belong?

1009
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,030
My men are aggressive and hard.

1010
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,909
Sometimes they need a way to work off
that excess energy. What's it to you?

1011
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,958
- OK. Well, first off, good question.
- Thank you.

1012
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:37,159
What is it to me?
Well, frankly, I just don't like it.

1013
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,029
And let me show you why.
Robbie, come up here.

1014
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,997
You, Robbie the hippie.
Come up here.

1015
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,390
[all whistling]

1016
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,434
All right, all right. Robbie, how long
is your sentence here at Oaksburg?

1017
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,354
- Five to ten.
- Five to ten years.

1018
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,273
What exactly did you do
to earn that sentence?

1019
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,796
- I sold marijuana.
- [laughter]

1020
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,475
- A shitload of marijuana.
- [cheering]

1021
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,670
Thanks, Robbie. Go sit down.

1022
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,230
He sold marijuana.
He was a marijuana dealer.

1023
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,154
I'm not here to argue about drug policy.
I don't think they're tough enough.

1024
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,869
- [protesting]
- Whatever.

1025
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,271
But just because Robbie was guilty
of selling dope

1026
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,230
doesn't mean he deserves to get raped
up the ass every day for ten years.

1027
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,550
I just don't think that's fair.

1028
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,632
- [murmuring]
- Some of you are here

1029
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:40,511
because you're habitual drunk drivers.
Some of you have a fondness for crack.

1030
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,717
- [laughing, murmuring]
- Some of you robbed a bank.

1031
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,395
- I'm talking to you, Lee Otis.
- [laughing]

1032
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,315
But that doesn't mean you should
get raped. It's just not fair.

1033
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:58,276
- Yes, Carnahan.
- What about guys convicted of rape?

1034
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,637
- Can we rape them?
- [all] Yeah!

1035
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,791
Rape the rapists.
Seems appropriate.

1036
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,394
Punishment fitting the crime and all.
Go ahead.

1037
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,313
- [cheering]
- [man] That's what I'm talkin' about.

1038
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,871
- How about them child molesters?
- [all] Yeah!

1039
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,315
Yeah, them too. Good point.
Anyone else?

1040
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,869
[cheering]

1041
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,589
[Big Raymond] Big Stan!

1042
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,912
- What about the counterfeiters?
- [all] What?

1043
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,232
Counterfeiters? Big Raymond,
you're the only counterfeiter here.

1044
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,119
[man] Yeah!

1045
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,317
Wait a minute.
Do you just want somebody to?

1046
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,755
[all] Aw!

1047
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,990
OK, here's another thing
we gotta clear up.

1048
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,152
There's a difference
between homosexual sex and rape.

1049
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,756
- Now, Big Raymond.
- Hm?

1050
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,639
There's someone here
who wants to have sex with you.

1051
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,189
- [man] Not me!
- OK? How about it, anyone?

1052
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,078
Yeah. Yeah.

1053
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,549
[laughter]

1054
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,151
Tyler!

1055
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,677
- Great!
- Man! [giggles]

1056
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,792
You two have fun.
But wear protection.

1057
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,871
- [cheering]
- [Big Raymond] OK.

1058
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:28,556
All right, grow up. Look, if you've got
a problem with that, then that's...

1059
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,950
[farting, groaning]

1060
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,719
Nurse!

1061
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,672
[farts]

1062
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,589
[farts]

1063
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:43,469
Now, those two are about to have
consensual homosexual sex.

1064
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,518
A beautiful, beautiful thing.
The total opposite of rape,

1065
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,752
- which is not allowed.
- Except for rapists and molesters?

1066
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,036
- We can still rape them.
- No, you can't.

1067
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,476
- [all] What?
- I changed my mind.

1068
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,153
Bad habit. Quit cold turkey.

1069
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,596
- [all yelling]
- If you're not happy with it,

1070
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,355
- you're welcome to fight me.
- [groaning]

1071
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,708
I didn't think so.
All right, you're dismissed.

1072
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,996
Beat it.

1073
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,749
- Good speech.
- You think?

1074
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,718
- I should have opened with a joke.
- No, it was good.

1075
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,031
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sorry about the mariachi.

1076
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,349
Let it go.

1077
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,512
Hey, Big Stan.
Check out the lovebirds.

1078
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,798
- One for you!
- [giggles]

1079
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,758
Mm! One for you.

1080
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,029
Good for them.

1081
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,750
I have something important to show you.

1082
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,035
Let me eat, will you?

1083
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,394
Hey, Big Stan.

1084
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,636
- Can we talk?
- Make it quick.

1085
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,916
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

1086
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,311
- I didn't do anything...

1087
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,517
Because you did, didn't you?

I like what you said.

I wanna join your gang.

- [Big Raymond] Yes, you did!
- He's gotta eat.

No, really. It was my fault.

It's Minton.

- What do you mean, it's Minton?
- Well, first he banned rape.

1132
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,635
It's to the point
that anybody gets beat up,

1133
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,917
they run and join Minton's gang
and Minton beats up the bad guy.

The truth, he's got them too scared

Oh, no, that was more in the nature
of a lovers' quarrel.

Ingleberg forgot their
two-week anniversary.

That wasn't very nice of him, was it?

Well, they made up. You should
have seen the cake Ingleberg made.

one week from today.

01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,757
The board of governors
is gonna come to inspect the prison.

1165
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,879
And something awful happens.

1166
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,272
Some prisoners find a way
to smuggle weapons into the yard.

1167
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,954
And a full-scale riot breaks out.

1168
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,113
And as the prison board watches
in absolute horror,

1169
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,239
my men are forced to shoot
into the yard in order

1170
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,278
to end the melee.

1171
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,309
In the ensuing scandal,
the Board chooses to sell the property

1172
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,756
to a Vietnamese family

1173
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,559
based in San Pedro.

1174
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,871
And everybody lives happily ever after.

Especially me.

1176
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,798
Now, if the events that I foretold

1177
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,315
do not come to fruition...

1178
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,151
...I will be very disappointed.

1179
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,311
And when I get disappointed,

1180
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,596
Mr Deng over there

1181
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,311
likes to stomp on men's spines
like they was bubble wrap.

1182
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:36,071
I spent 35 years of my life

1183
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,630
in this stinking cesspool.

1184
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:44,191
And I will not walk away
without something to show for it.

1185
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,352
Your little prison reform
ends right now.

attractive older woman?

No, I can't say I have, Lew.

1194
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,789
Madam Foreman won't return
any of my calls.

1195

You better go for that deal
the warden offered you.

1196

01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,435
D-block houses some
of our most hardened offenders.

1240
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,037
But here, we have Oaksburg's
greatest rehabilitation story.

1241
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,671
Stan Minton. Stan, I'd like for you
to meet the board of governors.

1242
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,514
Not going in the yard today, Stan?

1243
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,831
- I don't feel well, warden.
- Maybe this will make you feel better.

1244
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,754
Due to Stan's exemplary behaviour,
the parole board has agreed

1245
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,229
to meet with him today.

1246
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,428
Well, we better be moving along.

1247
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,638
The shit goes down at 12.30.

1248
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,998
At 12.35,
I'm in the real estate business.

Stan! Honey!

1252
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,917
- I'll deal with you in a minute.
- Everything OK?

1253
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,513
Both of you.

1254
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,553
[woman] Next up is prisoner 5824.

1255
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,879
In the matter of Stanley Minton.
You have your files.

1256
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,188
[woman] In his time here, Minton
has accrued an exemplary record.

1257
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,716
And let it be noted,
he's a first-time non-violent offender.

1258
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,311
[ticking]

1259

Hold up!

1260
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,077
Before we vote, Mr Minton, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1261
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,357
I'd just like to say, um...
[clears throat]

1262
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,556
...l've really learned a lot.

1263
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,075
And I'm ready to get back to work.

1264
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,750
[woman] Good, we like to hear that.

1265
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,157
Here's the yard where the prisoners
come to exercise.

1266
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,756
That's where Charlie the Fly
tried to fly over the wall. [laughs]

1267
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,071
Well, in light of Warden Gasque's
recommendation,

1268
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,596
I think we have a pretty
clear-cut case for parole.

1269
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,275
Mr Minton?

1270
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,797
How would you feel
about getting out of here today?

1271
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,512
Mr Minton?

1272
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,192
Did I mention I'm in real estate?

1273
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,796
[laughs] I got my eye on some property
real close by here

1274
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,999
- I can't wait to develop.
- Hm. That's commendable.

1275
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,630
You know, while I was in here,
also, I joined a biker gang.

1276
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,519
Satan's Paedophiles.

1277
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,671
Anyway, they said when I get out,

1278
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,673
they'd love to camp next
to the grammar school near here.

1279
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,193
I hope that's not a problem.

1280
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,672
They're pretty cool guys, except
when they drink and do crystal meth.

1281
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,353
Which is almost every weekend.

1282
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:50,116
But most of the people I sell to,
they don't need to know about that.

1283
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,239
'Cause, uh, they're old ladies, mostly.
Not too good with fine print,

1284
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,469
if you get my drift.

1285
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,675
Tell me, is your grandma still alive?
I bet I could make her a sweet deal.

1286
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,831
By the time I'm through with her,

1287
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,596
she'll give handjobs behind the pharmacy
to pay for arthritis medication.

1288
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,232
Two at a time, you know?
Stuff you see in pornos.

1289
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:18,159
Anyway, that's a nice top you have on.
Seriously.

1290
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,914
Mind lowering it?
I'd love to see some boobage.

1291
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,958
Let me see that, woman. That's sexy.
Let me see that.

1292
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,271
Let me touch one of them.
Let me touch one of them. Can I? Please?

1293
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,954
Parole denied!
Take him back to his cell!

1294
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,795
What colour are your nipples?
I bet they're pink! Light brown?

1295
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,393
Dollar size or quarter?

1296
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,235
Stan, did we win?

1297
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,152
Let go of me. I'm in a hurry.

1298
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,639
Have no fear, Stanley.

1299
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,349
I will continue to take care
of your wife while you're gone.

1300
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,034
- Thanks a lot, pal.
- No thanks needed.

1301
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,873
I cherish Mindy's company.

1302
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:57,794
Since my addiction to cigarettes
made me impotent,

1303
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,872
I've had very little contact
with the fair sex.

1304
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,153
Impotent?

1305
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,470
I used to think smoking was cool,

1306
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:11,158
but a limp dick spells nerd
in any language.

1307
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,232
- You're impotent. That's great!
- Not really.

1308

Baby, I love you.
I'll write to you as soon as I can.

Don't tell me.
You studied with The Master too?

1318

- I am his number one.
- [scoffs] I didn't see that coming.
