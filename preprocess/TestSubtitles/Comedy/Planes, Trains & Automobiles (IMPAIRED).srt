00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,798
How would you like
a mouthful of teeth?

336
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,394
Oh, and hostile, too.

337
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,870
Nice personality combination...

338
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,463
hostile and intolerant.

339
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,803
That's borderline criminal.

340
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,900
Screw you.

341
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,810
You spilled beer
all over the bed,

342
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,814
you mess up
the bathroom...

343
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,315
Who let you stay?

344
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,317
I even let you pay,

345
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,081
so you wouldn't feel
like an intruder.

346
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,087
An intruder?

347
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,681
Right. You ruined a nice trip.

348
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,693
Who talked my ear off
on the plane?

349
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,695
Who was that?
I'm curious.

350
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,324
Who told you to book a room?
I did.

351
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,833
You're an ungrateful jackass.

352
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,335
Sleep in the lobby.

353
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,997
I hope you wake up so stiff

354
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,562
you can't even move.

355
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,769
You got a free cab,
a free room,

356
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,778
and someone
who will listen

357
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,780
to your boring stories.

358
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,282
Didn't you notice on the plane

359
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,817
when you started talking,

360
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,319
I started reading
the vomit bag?

361
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,822
Didn't that
give you some clue

362
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,324
that this guy's
not enjoying it?

363
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,826
Everything's not an anecdote.

364
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,384
You have to discriminate.

365
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,931
You choose things
that are funny

366
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,522
or mildly amusing

367
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,033
or interesting.

368
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,227
You're a miracle.

369
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,863
Your stories
have none of that.

370
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,464
They're not even
amusing accidentally.

371
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,974
Honey, meet Del Griffith.

372
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,977
He's got some
amusing anecdotes.

373
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,573
Here's a gun so you can
blow your brains out.

374
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,617
You'll thank me for it.

375
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,416
I could tolerate
any insurance seminar.

376
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,892
For days,
I could listen to them go on and on.

377
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,054
They'd say,
"How can you stand it?"

378
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,963
And I'd say,
"'Cause I've been with Del Griffith.

379
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,830
I can take anything."

380
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,836
You know what they'd say?

381
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,838
"I know what you mean.

382
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,897
The shower curtain
ring guy."

383
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,206
It's like going on a date

384
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,212
with a Chatty Cathy doll.

385
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,249
There should be
a string on your chest

386
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,749
that I pull out.

387
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,787
Except I wouldn't
pull it out, you would.

388
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,344
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

389
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,889
By the way,

390
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,017
when you're telling
these little stories,

391
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,755
here's a good idea.

392
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,262
Have a point.

393
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,265
It makes it more interesting
for the listener.

394
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,148
You want to hurt me?

395
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,151
Go ahead if it
makes you feel better.

396
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,846
I'm an easy target.

397
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,952
Yeah, you're right.

398
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,788
I talk too much.

399
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,090
I also listen too much.

400
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,758
I could be a cold-hearted
cynic like you,

401
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,825
but I don't like to
hurt people's feelings.

402
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,100
Well, you think
what you want about me.

403
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm not changing.

404
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,676
I like... I like me.

405
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,802
My wife likes me.

406
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,006
My customers like me.

407
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,140
'Cause I'm the real article.

408
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,344
What you see
is what you get.

409
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:20,430
# I'm back
in baby's arms #

410
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:24,958
# How I miss
those lovin' arms #

411
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,200
# I am back
where I belong #

412
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:34,337
# Back in baby's arms #

413
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,973
# Don't know
why we quarreled #

414
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,576
# We never did before #

415
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,920
# Since we found out
how it hurts... ##

416
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,117
Del.

417
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,922
Hmm? Yeah.

418
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,428
Why did you kiss my ear?

419
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,660
Why are you holding my hand?

420
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,269
Where's your other hand?

421
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,169
Between two pillows.

422
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,274
Those aren't pillows!

423
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,537
Aah!

424
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,578
Oh, no!

425
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,580
Ooh!

426
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,615
Oh!

427
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,514
Oh! Oh!

428
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,329
See that Bears' game
last week?

429
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,955
Hell of a game.

430
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,227
They're going all the way.

431
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,134
Ohh, yeow.

432
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,965
Neal, take my socks
out of the sink

433
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,524
if you're going
to brush your teeth.

434
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,041
Where are you?

435
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,543
I'm in Wichita.

436
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,169
I'm at a motel

437
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,511
with this guy
I met on the plane.

438
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,484
You shared a motel room
with a stranger?

439
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,850
Are you crazy?

440
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,149
I'm getting there.

441
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,156
Did you call the airline?

442
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,591
I have a good chance
of getting on standby.

443
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,094
If they told you

444
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,027
wolverines make
good house pets,

445
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,394
would you believe them?

446
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,899
I'm not spending
Thanksgiving in Wichita.

447
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,458
I'll get home.

448
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,935
Mmm.

449
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,437
Not by airplane.

450
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,942
They got 18 hours of air traffic
backed up.

451
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,944
We're going to be having
our turkey roll

452
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,775
right here.

453
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,282
If we wait
for the flight.

454
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,716
How else can we get home?

455
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,721
Burt Dingman.
He works for the railroad.

456
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,724
I sold them all their
shower curtain rings.

457
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,487
He owes me a favor.

458
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,864
I'll get that.
I paid for everything else.

459
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,399
Why break precedent?

460
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,061
You're making me feel
like a freeloader.

461
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,071
Get me on the train,
we're square.

462
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,869
You got it.
That's the easy part.

463
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,848
What?

464
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,748
You know goddamn well what.

465
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,150
I'm sorry. I don't.

466
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,519
I had over
$ 700 in here.

467
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,526
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a thief.

468
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,563
You went into my stuff
last night, right?

469
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,565
I didn't take your money.

470
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,066
I had over $ 700.

471
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,103
You went into
my wallet for pizza.

472
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,071
Just maybe
when you went into...

473
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,232
Count it!

474
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,742
Like you'd keep it
in there.

475
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,243
There's $263 in there.

476
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,770
If there's more,
you can call me a thief.

477
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,146
Count it!

478
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,185
263, right?

479
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,515
Empty.

480
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,557
What?

481
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,689
We were robbed.

482
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,791
Do you think so?

483
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,562
I've been thinking.

484
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,069
What we're dealing with

485
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,867
is a smalltime crook.

486
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,374
He didn't take
the credit cards,

487
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,376
so we charge
our way home.

488
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,242
I've got a Visa
and a gasoline card.

489
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,248
Oh, and a Neiman-Marcus card

490
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,183
in case we want
to buy a gift.

491
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,617
What have you got?

492
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,087
Chalmer's Big and Tall
Men's Shoppe,

493
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,784
a seven-outlet chain in
the Pacific Northwest.

494
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,452
Unfortunately,
it does us no good here.

495
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,962
Get me to the train station,

496
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,624
and I'll take care
of everything else.

497
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,066
Gus' son is picking us up.

498
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,872
This is not him, is it?

00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,426
You missed it.

665
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,969
I'm sorry. Those...

666
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,471
those are the precious moments, too.

667
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,505
They don't come back again.

668
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:38,708
I've been spending too much time
away from home.

669
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,216
I haven't been home
in years.

670
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,378
What, seriously?

671
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,319
It's a figure of speech.

672
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,822
I'm away so much,

673
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,824
it's like not being there.

674
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,225
I called a friend of mine
at Eastern Airlines.

675
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,695
It doesn't look good.

676
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,597
I know.
I called all the airlines.

677
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,470
Well, at least we're
sitting on over 100 beans

678
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,200
from my brilliant idea.

679
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,208
You're a terrific salesman.

680
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,574
You know, uh...

681
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,707
I've been thinking that when we put
our heads together,

682
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,011
we really...

683
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,915
we've really gotten nowhere.

684
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,044
And, uh...

685
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,056
you know,
I think I'm holding you up.

686
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,058
Don't say that
about yourself.

687
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,923
That's not true, Neal.

688
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,987
I think we'll get
where we're going a lot faster

689
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,499
if, uh...
we were alone.

690
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:31,625
OK?

691
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,297
OK.

692
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,670
I see.

693
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:47,208
I think I'll just
take care of this

694
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,615
and get going.

695
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,948
I appreciate that.

696
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,784
It's just harder for two people
to travel.

697
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,823
Yeah, sure.

698
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,324
If you've got
reservations...

699
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,518
I understand.

700
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,992
Thanks for the meal.

701
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,495
Yeah, that's all right.

702
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,430
And I owe you
some of this, too.

703
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,932
No, no, no, no.

704
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,434
This is your cut.

705
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,935
Take the money.

706
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,438
Buy your kids
a chocolate turkey.

707
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,031
I'm just going
to leave it there.

708
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,633
Then leave it. Fine.

709
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,406
I'm done, OK?

710
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,573
I've got to go,
so if you'll excuse me,

711
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,015
uh, I got things
to do, uh...

712
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,280
so, uh...

713
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,285
good luck,

714
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,289
and I hope
you get home soon.

715
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,722
I'll see you.

716
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,123
Yeah, sure you will.

717
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,234
It's a white
Lincoln town car,

718
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,638
space v-5.

719
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,085
V-5.

720
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,718
V-5.

721
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,659
V-5.

722
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,371
Hey! Hey!

723
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,142
Hey! Hey!

724
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,011
Hey! Hey! Hey!

725
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,520
The car's not there!

726
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,557
I need a ride back!

727
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,356
You...

728
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,661
God!

729
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,102
Goddamn it!

730
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,604
Goddamn it!

731
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,703
# You're messin'
with the wrong guy #

732
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,640
A-a-aah!

733
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:27,933
Whoo!

734
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,986
# You're messin'
with the wrong guy ##

735
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,102
Oh, gee, Marie,
you're a stitch.

736
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,647
No, mom's doing
the turkey.

737
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,149
Yeah, dad wants ambrosia,

738
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,152
so I guess we'll get
those miniature marshmallows.

739
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,154
I'll do the crescent rolls,

740
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,655
you do the cranberries.

741
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,555
You know I can't cook.

742
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,454
Ohh...

743
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,190
Ahem.

744
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,062
I'll see you
tomorrow then.

745
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,361
Gobble gobble.

746
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:25,458
[Imitates Turkey]

747
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,766
Ohh... bye-bye.

748
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,648
Welcome to Marathon.
May I help you?

749
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,774
Yes.

750
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,342
How may I help you?

751
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,481
You can start by wiping
that fucking dumb-ass smile

752
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,754
off your rosy
fucking cheeks.

753
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,227
Then give me
a fucking automobile.

754
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,730
A fucking Datsun,

755
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,231
a fucking Toyota,

756
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,528
a fucking Buick.

757
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,933
Four fucking wheels
and a seat.

758
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:03,029
I don't care for the way
you're speaking.

759
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,267
I don't care for the way

760
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,072
your company left me
in fucking nowhere

761
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:11,444
with keys to a fucking car
that isn't fucking there.

762
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,417
I didn't care to fucking walk
down a fucking highway

763
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,214
and across a fucking runway

764
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,256
to get back here
to have you smile

765
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,621
at my fucking face.

766
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:25,526
I want a fucking car

767
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,826
right fucking now.

768
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,702
May I see your
rental agreement?

769
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,365
I threw it away.

770
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,137
Oh, boy.

771
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,042
Oh, boy, what?

772
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,638
You're fucked.

773
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,798
# You're messin'
with the wrong guy ##

774
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,302
OK, 86, wake up.

775
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,305
You're going
to block the line.

776
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,806
Yeah, where you going?

777
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,171
Chicago.

778
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,174
Chicago?

779
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,175
Chicago.

780
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,474
You know you're
in St. Louis?

781
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,878
Yes, I do.

782
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,178
The airlines are faster,

783
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,515
and you get
a free meal.

784
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,952
If I wanted jokes,

785
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,422
I'd watch you
take a leak.

786
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,625
Don't just stand there

787
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,390
like a slab of meat
with mittens.

788
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,376
What are you doing?

789
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,346
I almost crushed your head
like a melon.

790
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,383
Del?

791
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,917
Move your car!

792
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,850
Just a minute, OK?

793
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,581
Get outta here!

794
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,523
What is your problem?

795
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,116
You insensitive asshole.

796
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,525
There's an injured man

797
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,926
down on the street.

798
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,897
Now, I'll move my car,

799
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,865
but you help him up.

800
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,196
No!

801
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,293
My pleasure.

802
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,368
Ohh...

803
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,854
I had a feeling
that when we parted ways,

804
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,854
somehow, someday,

805
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,686
our paths
would cross again.

806
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,090
Are you all right?

807
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,651
I've never seen
anyone get lifted

808
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,162
by his testicles before.

809
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,664
Lucky thing for you

810
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,962
that cop came when he did.

811
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,265
Otherwise,
you'd be lifting your schnutz

812
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,599
to tie your shoes.

813
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,698
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

814
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,505
You know,
I'm glad I didn't kill you.

815
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,376
I'd be glad if you had.

816
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,574
Oh, you don't mean that.

817
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,516
Remember what I said?
Go with the flow.

818
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,521
How can I when
the rental car agency

819
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,854
leaves me keys
to a car that isn't there,

820
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:12,258
then I find out they
don't have any more cars?

821
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,093
I got a car,
no sweat at all.

822
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,565
Well, Del,
you're a charmed man.

823
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,964
Nope.

824
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,593
Oh, I know.

825
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,104
You just go
with the flow.

826
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,471
Like a twig
on the shoulders

827
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,839
of a mighty stream.

828
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,172
# Pulled out
of Pittsburgh #

829
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,440
# Rollin' down
the eastern seaboard #

830
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,680
# I got my diesel

close this conversation

1144
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,526
by saying you are
one unique individual.

1145

01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,278
This little guy's
Neal Jr.,

1322
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,779
my little gem Marti,

1323
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:56,544
and somewhere around here
is my baby boy Seth.

1324
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:13,027
Honey, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

1325
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,204
Hello, Mr. Griffith.

1326
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,367
Hello, Mrs. Page.

1327
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,843
# Every time you go away #

1328
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:40,053
# You take
a piece of me with you #

1329
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,621
# Every time you go away #

1330
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:51,336
# You take
a piece of me with you #

1331
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,874
# Ooh-hoo #

1332
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,313
# Go on and go free #

1333
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:14,793
# Maybe you're
too close to see #

1334
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:20,530
# I can feel
your body move #

1335
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:25,164
# Yeah, it doesn't
mean that much to me #

1336
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:32,306
# Can't go on
sayin' the same thing #

1337
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:37,246
# Can't you see
we've got everything #

1338
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:40,412
# Even though, you know,
you know, yeah #

1339
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,151
# Every time you go away #

1340
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,052
# You take
a piece of me #

1341
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,655
# Take a piece
of me with you ##

1342
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,338
[Neal] You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1343
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,548
I can take anything.

1344
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,094
Who's that?

1345
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,098
You're no saint.

1346
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:26,724
[Del] I never did
introduce myself.

1347
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:27,733
Del Griffith.

1348
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,727
Del Griffith.

1349
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,736
Del Griffith.

1350
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,738
Del Griffith.

1351
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:34,172
I can take anything.

1352
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:39,804
Wow! Ha ha ha!

1353
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,679
Ha ha ha!

1354
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,308
I mean, that was close.

1355
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:47,879
You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1356
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,286
We can laugh
about it now.

1357
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:52,884
We're all right.
Ha ha ha!

1358
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:57,126
Del Griffith. Del Griffith.
D-D-D-Del...

1359
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:01,634
Who's that?

1360
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:03,861
You're no saint.

1361
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,208
Del Griffith.

1362
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,209
Who's that?

1363
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:13,937
I can take anything.

1364
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:27,791
We can laugh about it.

1365
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:32,288
How can you stand it?

1366
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:36,395
How can you stand it?

1367
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:38,904
Del Griffith.

1368
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:44,878
Who's that?

1369
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,450
Wow!

1370
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,290
How can you stand it?

1371
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:01,886
Del Griffith.

1372
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,260
How can you stand it?

1373
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,595
Ha ha ha!

1374
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,361
I mean, that was close.

1375
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,795
You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1376
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,237
We can laugh
about it now.

1377
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:15,366
We're all right.
Ha ha ha!

1378
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,108
Del Griffith. Del Griffith.
D-D-D-Del...

1379
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:24,550
Who's that?

1380
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:26,952
No saint.

1381
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:31,790
Del Griffith.

1382
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:32,791
Who's that?

1383
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,053
I can take anything.

1384
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,256
Here's two.

1385
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,268
You're three.
