[ Narrator ]
My name is Chance.

2
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,700
I know it sounds odd, but most names
do if you think about 'em long enough...

00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,831
maybe even yours.

4
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,307
I was abandoned
when I was very young.

5
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:48,006
I lived on the streets, scrounging
for food, sleeping wherever I could.

6
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,207
That seemed like fun at first...

7
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,580
but pretty soon
it landed me behind bars.

- But I don't like to talk about that.

00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,018
Let's talk about after that
when I got my second chance...

10
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,026
and my name.

11
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,494
You see, this family came along...

12
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,724
and, I guess you could say,
they rescued me...

13
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,496
'cause they adopted me and brought me
to live with them at their house.

14
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,663
But it was their home, not mine.

15
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,800
Still, it sure was an improvement over,
well, over that other place.

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,176
Lots of space, fresh air...

17
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,806
plenty of interesting things
to explore...

18
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,852

- Sassy?

You've just woke me up
from a very deep catnap.

22
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,662
What's the matter, Sassy? You get up
on the wrong side of the litter box?

23
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,633
Even a very great beauty
needs her beauty sleep!

24
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,262
Beauty sleep? You'd have
to sleep for like... a month.

Oh, you are such
a typical dog.

[ Chance ] Indeed. The house was
full of new clothes to be shredded...

27

on account of

28
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,409
You see, Bob was joining
the family by marrying Laura.

29
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:02,147
- Her little girl was Hope.
Hope belonged to Sassy.
-Jamie!

was supposed to belong to me,

[ Chance ] Still, I had to admit it,
he did have a lot of very good ideas.

He was the one
who named me Chance.

35

Laura's older boy was Peter.

36
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,669
He belonged to Shadow.
Shadow was faithful.

37
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,677
Shadow was loyal.
Shadow was a chump.

I had all the fun upstairs.

The blouse is dead.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,881
That's right,
but I gotta shred it...

I swallowed a button.

00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,985
It's happened before...
to me. People use you and lose you.

298
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,251
Shame on you
for betraying your boy.

299
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,021
Me betray him?
Who ditched who?

300
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,689
I mean, not that I care.
I can get along just fine without him.

301
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,530
- How dare you call yourself a dog.
- A cat would know better.

302
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,163
[ Shadow ] Dogs are supposed
to be faithful, loyal and true.

303
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,264
Hmph!

304
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,206
To people? Why?

305
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,713
Didn't you even notice how sad
Jamie looked when he left?

306
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,942
Sheesh! I'm sorry.

307
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,985
Man, I didn't know
anybody cared so much.

308
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,453
- [Jamie ] Ask her about Chance.!
- They're doing just fine.

309
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,363
- Let me talk to Shadow.
- Peter wants to talk to Shadow.

310
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,063
Peter, somebody here
wants to say hello to you.

311
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,868
- [ Peter] Shadow. Shadow?
- [ Whimpering ]

312
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,240
Can you hear me, boy?
Look, I know I promised
we'd be back tomorrow...

313
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,506
but we can't make it
for another week, okay?

314
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,845
I never understand a thing
when they do this.

315
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,887
- Me neither, but you
might as well humor them.
- [ Barking ]

316
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,252
Did you hear that?
He said hello.

317
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,554
What'd he say?
What'd he say?

318
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,761
He said Chance ate Sassy.

319
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,528
Nah, I'm just kidding.
He said Sassy loves it there.

320
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,162
[ Muffled ] You know,
I don't even miss the old place.

321
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,763
I mean, there's a lot
more stuff to do here.

322
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,241
Ugh! I miss it.

323
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:09,178
It's so much harder for
a lady to keep clean here.

324
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,777
[ Sighs ]

325
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,190
Thanks again,
Kate.

326
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,210
How much longer? Peter
should've been here by now.

327
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,612
Why don't you relax, Gramps?
Find yourself a shoe.

328
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,982
- Oh, pups.
- Do you have any idea
where that's been?

329
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,817
Oh, yeah. That's why I love it.
You want some?

330
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,620
- I'm not into leather.
- [ Neighing ]

331
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,957
- Now, where's she going?
- Huh?

332
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,793
Okay, you guys.
I'll be back in a couple of days.

333
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,960
A car ride! We're goin' on
a car ride! Let's go! All right!

334
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,664
- Ow!
- [ Kate ] No, no, no.
Sorry, boy.

335
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,673
Not this time.
You stay here and be good.

336
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,175
Okay? Bye-bye.
Frank'll be by to feed you later.

337
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,246
- Something's happening.
- What? What do you think it is?

338
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,783
I don't know,
but I don't like it.

339
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,011
[ Neighing ]

340
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,348
That's peculiar.

341
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,358
[ Whining ]

342
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,656
Locked in.
I hate being locked in.

343
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,392
This is just like it was
back at the pound.

344
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,128
- Chance, calm down.
- You don't get it, do ya?

345
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,967
The pound is where humans lock you up
when they don't want you anymore.

346
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,372
- Not want me? Impossible.
- Don't listen to him.

347
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,376
He's just makin' it up
to scare you.

348
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,141
Oh, yeah. You two pampered pets haven't
been out on the streets like I have.

349
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,208
I've been to the pound, remember?
Don't tell me there's no pound.

350
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,617
I know about the pound.

351
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:01,284
Something doesn't smell right.
They've been gone way too long.

352
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,885
Much longer than they should've been.
Something's really wrong.

353
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,626
- Wake up and smell the kibble.
They dumped us.
- No! It isn't true!

354
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,669
- They love you, and they dump you.
- Not Peter!

355
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,571
You could be right, Shadow.
It's-- It's been too much time,
way too much time.

356
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,940
Something is keeping Peter from coming
to me, so I'm gonna go to him.

357
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:24,744
- You guys kill me. She
locked the gate, remember?
- I don't care about gates.

358
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,214
- I'm going home.

359
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,687
- What?
- What'd he say?

360
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,029
- No way!
- Shadow, wait!

361
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,395
It's too far.
You don't know the way.

362
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,491
What if they come back here
looking for us?

363
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,662
It's time to go, Sassy.
I'm going home.

364
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,002
It's crazy!
Who'll feed you?

365
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:53,373
You won't make it on the road!
That's where they catch you
and take you to the pound!

366
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,106
- I'm stayin' right here. Huh?
- [ Gobbling ]

367
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,614
- [ Gobbling ]
- Oh! Birdzilla returns!

368
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,619
Hey, guys, wait up! Wait up!
I'm comin'!

369
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,916
Don't let him
eat me! Oh!

370
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,014
[ Gobbling ]

371
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,958
- Aah! Oh! Ugh!
- [ Gobbling ]

372
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,361
Whoa! Ow!
Did that hurt.

373
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,265
Look out, chicken broads.
Comin' through! Pardon me.

374
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,376
Home is just over that mountain.
We'll be there before dark.

375
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,645
How do you figure?
It took us ages to get this far.

376
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,779
That was the long way.
We'll take the shortcut,
straight up and over.

377
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,416
Hey! Wait up!
Hey, guys, wait up!

378
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,587
- Here I am.
- I thought you were gonna stay, pup.

379
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,689
I thought I better come along
in case you two needed protection.

380
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,134
[ Sassy ] My hero.
Guess I'm gonna have to stare
at your butt the whole way.

381
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:57,038
[ Shadow Laughing ]
I'll race you to the trees.

382
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,805
[ Chance ] And so began
the most perilous journey of our lives.

383
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,574
-[ Whack ]
- The Sierras extend...

384
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,412
to over 250 miles
north and south...

385
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,578
and to over 50 miles
east and west.

386
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,920
This makes them the second
largest mountain range in
the Western United States.

387
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,599
- [ Sassy ] Ow.! I broke a nail.!
- Not much further now.

388
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,670
I think Little Miss Fur Ball
needs a rest, don't you think?

389
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,138
What's the matter, pup?
Too much for a tough guy like you?

390
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,143
What are you talkin' about?
I'm just sick of hearin' her whine.

391
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,646
This ground isn't nearly
soft enough. Ah! Ah!

392
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,776
- Almost there, Sassy.
- I hate these package tours.

393
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,851
[ Whistling ]
Here, dogs!

394
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,054
Come on!
[ Whistles ]

395
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,667
Kitty?
Here, kitty, kitty!

396
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,931
That's funny.

397
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,348
""Thanks for feedin' them--

398
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:21,086
Old dog seems really homesick.
Taking him and the other two--''

399
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:27,187
Taking 'em where?
Cat on a stock drive?
You gotta be kiddin' me.

400
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,065
- [ Braying ]
- Okay, okay. I know
you're hungry. I'm comin'!

401
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:37,333
I wanna be home where the tallest thing
I have to climb is a bookshelf.

402
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:41,776
Top's just ahead. You'll be able to see
our house from there. Keep marching.

403
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,577
Don't worry. I'm gonna be glad
to put this place behind me.

404
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,551
First of all, there's way too many
new smells to learn.

405
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:53,113
Not to mention, I got about
ten million trees to mark,
and I am running on empty.

406
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,352
Finally.

407
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,294
Oh, Shadow.

408
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,230
Whoa!
Get a load of this.

409
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,573
You could see everything
from up here.

410
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,043
Except the house. I don't see
the house. Where's the house?

411
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,910
[ Sassy ]
Well, thank you, Shadow.

412
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,450
It's been simply
a divine vacation...

413
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,919
but I think I'll just stay here
and wait for the bus.

414
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,320
Okay.

415
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,619
- Hey, where's he goin'?
- Shadow?

416
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,127
I told you.
I'm going home.

417
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:35,563
- You can't be serious.
- I have to go.
Peter might be in trouble.

418
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:39,467
Look around. We're in trouble.
Home's not that way.
Can't you smell straight?

419
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:43,837
Oh, it's out there.
I have a sixth sense.
You'll have it... one day.

420
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,844
- Shadow, you're not as young
as you used to be.
- I'm going home, that's all.

421
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,005
Now, you two coming
or not?

422
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,448
Look, there's no way I'm gonna let
an old-timer like you go it alone.

423
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,679
I'll be your guard dog.

424
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:59,655
This isn't a game, pup.
If you're coming, you're
gonna have to keep up.

425
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,125
All right. Don't worry about me.
It's you I'm worried about.

426
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,287
You two are really gonna
go off and leave me here?

427
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,991
You wait for that bus.
You'll do fine.

428
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,693
We'll send you
a dead bird when we get there.

429
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,863
- I prefer to do my own shopping.
- [ Shadow ] Au revoir, Sassy.!

430
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:18,932
Hey.! All right.
All right. Wait up.!

431
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,410
Ooh! I can't believe
I'm following...

432
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,882
a couple of irresponsible,
misguided, mangy canine plague lifters.

433
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,442
[ Chance ]
There was more to that old boy
than I'd given him credit for.

434
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,647
I was soon to learn
Just how much more...

435
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,659
but even in that moment
I had to admire his faith
wherever it might lead us.

436
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,696
Check it out.!
What kind of animal made that?

437
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,897
That? You
don't wanna know.

438
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,475
Whoa! That's
as big as Sassy.

439
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,010
- [ Sassy ] Thanks, darling.

Where is she?

but we've got to keep trying.

Hurry! Maybe she made it
to the other side.

I-I don't see her,

No. It
swallowed her up.

00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,462
I shouldn't have
made her come.

It's not your fault.
She wanted to come.

But it's
my responsibility.

for this job.

We didn't have to.
It's built in.

took it upon themselves

I was in love with you
Bum-bum-bum-bum

1041
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,431
And then the witch doctor
he told me what to do

1042
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,559
He said that
oo-ee-oo-ah-ah

1043
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,831
Ting-tang
Walla-walla-bing-bang

1044
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:53,204
Sure, cats are agile,
but dogs have brute strength.

1045
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,073
- [ Sassy ] Well, that may be, but--
- Hey, hang on just a minute.

1046
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,043
- Come on. Let's go, guys.
- No, wait.

1047
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:03,210
- What is it, Shadow?
- I don't know. I got a
funny feeling all of a sudden.

1048
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:07,847
Like something's telling me
to go back the other way.

1049
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:11,984
- Strange, huh?
- What, back to the pound?
What is he, crazy?

1050
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,153
[ Shadow ]
Yeah, you're right.

1051
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,809
[ Narrator ]
Shadow and Sassy had
risked their lives for me.

1052
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,784
I never knew I'd
have friends like that.

1053
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,981
The feeling was all
very new to me.

1054
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,424
I liked it.

1055
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,588
[ Thunderclap ]

1056
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:52,292
I'm sorry this worked
out this way, sir.

1057
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,029
Yeah, me too.
Thanks.

1058
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:00,265
Let's keep looking, Mom.
They werejust here.!

1059
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,469
Honey,
that was hours ago.

1060
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,014
I mean, they could be
miles away by now.

1061
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:10,984
Listen to me, the people here have
promised to do everything they can.

1062
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:15,023
And, and they'll call us
the minute they get word.

1063
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,554
We came so close
to gettin' 'em back.

1064
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,961
[ Bob ]
At least we know they're alive.

1065
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:28,332
If the animals made it this far,
they might make it all the way home.

1066
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,806
- [ Peter ] Shadow.!
- We can't give up.

1067
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:38,179
Shadow!

1068
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,680
Shadow!

1069
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:51,256
[ Chance ] We goin' in circles?
That tree smells familiar.

1070
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,022
- Of course it does. It's pine.
- Oh.

1071
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,834
[ Gasp ]
Hurry up!

1072
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:04,269
Oh, look, you guys.
We made it!

1073
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:16,345
Wow! Shadow, this is incredible.
You were right all along.

1074
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:19,319
Oh, isn't that the most
beautiful sight you ever saw?

1075
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,551
Come on, you two,
let's go home.

1076
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:32,064
[ Narrator ] Even now I don't
really know how he did it.

1077
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,466
But there we were,
finally...

1078
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:38,438
looking down at the road
that would lead us home.

1079
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:48,917
[ Shadow ]
Home is just beyond these tracks.

1080
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,043
We should be there
before dark.

1081
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:54,020
- [ Sassy ] I've heard that before.
-Just be very careful.

1082
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:57,752
[ Train Horn Blowing ]

1083
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,496
[ Train Horn Blowing ]

1084
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:07,797
Come on, you two.
Watch carefully where
you're going. Look both ways.

1085
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,106
- Stay with me. Hurry up.
- Not so fast.

1086
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,507
Come on, hurry up.

1087
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:18,171
Come on! Come on!

1088
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,339
I'm coming!
Wait up!

1089
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,949
You all right, Sass?

1090
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,579
Me? I laugh at danger.

1091
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,182
Me too, but I'll laugh later.
Let's get outta here.

1092
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,659
I'm so sick of nature
I could puke.

1093
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,992
After this I intend to live
indoors on a velvet cushion...

1094
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:39,864
filled with bird feathers and be served
filet of mouse on a silver platter--

1095
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:43,837
All right, Sassy.
We're nearly home. Come on--

1096
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,842
- [ Yelping ]
- Shadow!

1097
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,315
- Shadow?
- Oh, Shadow.

1098
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:13,666
- Poor old guy.
- Huh?

1099
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,703
[ Groaning ]

1100
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,204
- Shadow?
- Are you okay?

1101
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:22,971
Yeah. My leg hurts
pretty badly.

1102
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:28,175
- Is it broken?
- I don't know. It's hard to move it.

1103
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:33,085
Hey, hey, look at this.
It's not as steep over here, Shadow.

1104
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:36,555
- Maybe you can climb out here.
- I'll try.

1105
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,559
[ Whimpering ]

1106
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:41,653
Come on, come on, you can do it!
You got us this far.

1107
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,996
- [ Whimpering ]
- Yeah, that's it.

1108
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:49,036
That's it.
Great, keep comin'.

1109
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:54,303
- [ Whining ]
- Come on. If you can jump
in a river to save me...

1110
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,345
this should be easy.!

1111
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,040
Yeah, that's right. And after outrunning
a mountain lion! Come on.

1112
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,174
- [ Sassy ] Come on, Shadow.!
- That's good.!

1113
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,309
That's good.
Take it slow now, take it slow.

1114
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,753
One step at a time.
One step at a time, Shadow.

1115
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:11,087
[ Sassy ]
Oh, oh, hang on.!

1116
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:14,128
[ Chance ]
Come on. Come right back.
Come right back.!

1117
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,562
Come on,
you're so close.

1118
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:21,432
Shadow! Shadow!

1119
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,233
[ Sassy ]
Oh, Shadow.!

1120
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,535
[ Chance ]
No, no, no, don't lie down.
Don't lie down.!

1121
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,611
Sorry, I can't make it.

1122
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:33,944
- Why not? Of course you can make it.
- Try, Shadow, please try.

1123
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:38,418
- I just can't.
- [ Whining ]

1124
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,393
Look, you pushed me this far.
Now I'm pushin' you the rest of the way!

1125
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,936
You know, back there in the woods
even when things looked really bad...

1126
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,166
I always believed we'd make it 'cause
I thought you were too stubborn to quit.

1127
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:02,641
Well,you're not gonna quit.
Not now, not when we're this close.!

1128
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,440
Now try again!

1129
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:08,414
Do you think it's easy for me
to admit I can't do it?

1130
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,417
I'm too old.

1131
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:13,488
That's not true.
There's nothing you can't do.

1132
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:19,050
I have nothing more to give, Chance,
and it's time for you to be on your own.

1133
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:23,530
But I want you with me.

1134
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,260
I love you, Shadow.

1135

You've learned everything
you need, Chance.

1136
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:37,911
Now all you have to learn
is how to say good-bye.

[ Whimpering ]

1138
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,853
I won't let you
give up.

1139
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:06,140
Now, I can't stay but a minute,
but here's a welcome home pie for you.

1140
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,641
Oh, thank you.

01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,406
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, they're out
in the backyard with Bob.

1142
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,447
I know he's gonna
break his neck.

1143
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,677
- How are they doing?
- Um...

1144
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,912
they're much better
now that we're back at home.

- Me next! Me next!
- Hope, I think I'm gettin'
too old for this stuff.

[ Bob ] Family's all comin'
back together, huh?

1187
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,028
[ Sighing ]

1188
01:16:57,079 --> 01:17:00,571
Come on, Shadow.

1189
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:25,300
He was old.

1190
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:28,137
It was too far.
He was just too old.

1191
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,212
Oh, Peter, honey.

1192
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,088
[ Gasps ]

1193
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:53,398
- Peter.
- Shadow!

1194
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:59,099
Oh, Peter.
I worried about you so.

1195
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:08,444
- Shadow!
- Peter, you're okay!

1196
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,916
- Shadow!
- He's here! Oh, I'm so happy!

1197
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,886
I thought about you
all the time.

1198
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,753
[ Peter ]
Missed you.!

1199
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,656
I missed you, Peter,
and I love you.

1200
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:23,128
[ Barks ]

1201
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:26,166
[ Barking ]

1202
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,370
[ Chance ]
It was Shadow's victory, really.

1203
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:34,101
His belief was the thing
that got us through.

1204
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:38,043
And in that moment
I saw the years lift from him.

1205
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,912
He was a puppy again,
reunited with his best friend.

1206
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:47,352
[ Barking ]

1207
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:52,291
[ Laughing ] Shadow!
It's good to see you, boy.

1208
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,487
[ Chance ] As we turned
to go inside the house...

1209
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:57,156
a strange new feeling
came over me.

1210
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:02,601
I had a family and I had
found out that sacrifice...

1211
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:06,572
and friendship
and even love...

1212
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,734
were more than
Just the mushy stuff.

1213
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,074
Come on, Chance.
Come inside.

1214
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:14,910
At last, for
the first time in my life...

1215
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,280
I was home.

1216
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,614
[ Barking ]

1217
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:28,055
[ Chance ] Turkey.! Turkey,
turkey, turkey, turkey.!
