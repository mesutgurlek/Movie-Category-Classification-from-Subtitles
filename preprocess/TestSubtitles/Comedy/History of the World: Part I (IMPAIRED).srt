1
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,995
20 million years ago,

2
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:17,998
an apelike creature
inhabited the earth.

3
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:21,024
[Also Sprach Zarathustra
playing]

4
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:44,547
And the ape stood
and became man.

5
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:04,010
-Rrr!
-Arrgh!

6
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,523
-Ahh...
-Ahh...

7
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,519
The greatest calamity
that could befall early man

8
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:59,032
was the loss of fire.

9
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,967
Fire-- the mysterious phenomenon
that cooked his food,

10
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,971
heated his cave,
and kept him alive.

11
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,974
If he could not
start a fire,

12
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,499
he and his would surely die.

13
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,000
Even in most primitive man,

14
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:37,492
the need to create
was part of his nature.

15
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,506
This need,this talent

16
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,509
clearly separated
early man from animals,

17
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:45,205
who would never know this gift.

18
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,017
And here, in a cave

19
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:53,519
somewhere in
the North American continent

20
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:55,613
about 2 million years ago,

21
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:58,557
the first artist was born.

22
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:19,969
And, of course,
with the birth of the artist,

23
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,609
came the inevitable
after birth...

24
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,175
The critic.

25
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:45,505
In the year 1 million BC,

26
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,031
it is thought the first
homo sapien marriage occurred.

27
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:02,989
It was shortly followed by
the first homosexual marriage.

28
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:10,952
One of the first weapons
man invented

29
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,989
was the spear.

30
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,489
[Pfftt!]

31
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:16,825
[Pfftt!]

32
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:35,646
Aah!

33
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:41,020
Aah...Ah ah...

34
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,498
Ohh...Ah--

35
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,510
In ancient times,
man was ignorant

36
00:05:57,544 --> 00:06:00,513
as to the cause
and nature of death,

37
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:04,449
so death was greeted
with a certain degree of awe.

38
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:07,113
-Aw...
-Aw...

39
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,452
Bungwa.

40
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,459
But because man
did not have the time

41
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:14,461
for complicated rituals,

42
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:17,259
funeral services
were often brief.

43
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,959
-Aah!
-Aah!

44
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:19,966
[Thud]

[Ptooey]
[Ptooey]

46
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,973
Even in early man,

47
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:31,000
the need to laugh was vital
for emotional survival.

48
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:45,517
Rrrr!

49
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,963
Aaaghh! Aah!

50
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:53,023
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!

51
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,443
Aahhhh!

52
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:06,446
Music began
long before it was formalized

53
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,448
into notes and phrases.

54
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,940
For mankind, it began
with an accident.

55
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:14,955
Goonga heard the sound
and liked it.

56
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,958
Goonga begged Gowi
to repeat the beautiful scream,

57
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,960
but Gowi could not.

58
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,962
So Goonga thought and thought,

59
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:24,464
and finally he found the answer.

60
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:27,956
Ahha aha ah--

61
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,494
Aaahhh--

62
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:36,507
Aah ah ah ah!

63
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:39,475
Aaahh--

64
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:40,980
Aaahhh!

65
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,983
Aahahah!

66
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,008
Wooh ahhh...

67
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,819
And so, music was born.

68
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:51,825
Hallelujah

69
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,952
Hallelujah

70
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:55,985

Owh owh owh owhh!

73
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,941
Moses went to the mountain,

74
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,966
and God spoke unto him.

75
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,948

thy God,

76

commanding you to obey my law!

Nothing. Forget it.

Oh, Lord,why have You
chosen me?

What would You
have me do for you?

unto the people.

00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:11,758
He'll never survive!

676
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,681
-Ooh!
-Oh!

677
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:26,646
The jig is up!

678
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,014
And gone!

679
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,486
After him!

680
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:33,115
Go on, men, get him!

681
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:34,988
Quick. Back through
the corridor.

682
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,993
He's heading for the Senate.

683
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:40,019
We can meet him
near the cloakroom.

684
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:01,447
In pectorum, quid pro quo.

685
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:04,454
In pecuniam,
sic transit gloria.

686
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:07,423
I didn't know
Gloria was sick.

687
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,948
Where is he?

688
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:11,961
Don't worry.
He has to come this way.

689
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,963
He should have been here.

690
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:15,988
The Senate is in session.

691
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:19,594
All fellow members
of the Roman Senate, hear me.

692
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:22,469
Shall we continue
to build palace after palace

693
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,973
for the rich,

694
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:27,465
or shall we aspire
to a more noble purpose

695
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,979
and build housing
for the poor?

696
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:32,140
How does the Senate vote?

697
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:35,481
ALL: Fuck the poor!

698
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,146
Good.

699
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:43,015
Oh! Josephus.

700
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,996
The man was dead
when I got there, I swear!

701
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,999
Where you been? Who was dead?

702
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:53,002
How do we get out of here?

703
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:54,503
Put this on.

704
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:57,996
I'll find Swiftus then meet you
at the theater.

705
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,942
The theater just
across from the baths.

706
00:39:00,978 --> 00:39:02,468
Good-bye.

707
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:04,447
Stop with the good-byes!

708
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:08,383
If we do escape,
will you come with us?

709
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:10,010
Of course.

710
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,953
Of course. Of course!

711
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,456
Good-bye.

712
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,958
Of course! She's coming with us!

713
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:18,257
She's coming with us.

714
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:20,456
There's some of the senators.

715
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:23,466
Right behind these guys.
Here we go.

716
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,967
Bullshit.

717
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:26,492
Bullshit.

718
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:41,985
Give to Oedipus!

719
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:43,987
[Bang]

720
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:46,489
Give to Oedipus!

721
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:47,990
[Bang]

722
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,993
Hey,Josephus!

723
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:51,517
Hey, motherfucker.

724
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,262
SONG: Funky town

725
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:57,130
Won't you take me to

726
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,192
Funky town?

727
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:01,136
Won't you take me to

728
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,763
Funky town?

729
00:40:16,753 --> 00:40:20,553
They should have been here
over 30 grains ago!

730
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,356
What could be keeping them?

731
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:26,021
I don't know.

732
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:30,496
There they are! Come on!

733
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:32,024
Come on.

734
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:34,060
Now, hurry. Walk this way.

735
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:47,243
Hurry. Get into
these Trojan costumes.

736
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,052
...punching a hole
in the left.

737
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:55,058
Keep punching a hole
in the right.

738
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:57,617
Keep punching a hole,
let's fight!

739
00:40:58,328 --> 00:41:01,491
Relax. Casual. Casual.

740
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:04,500
No matter what happens,
don't panic.

741
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:06,365
Don't panic.

742
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:09,497
Keep punching a hole
in the left.

743
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,871
Keep punching a hole
in the right.

744
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:13,500
There they are!

745
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,010
Panic!

746
00:41:15,045 --> 00:41:16,512
-Oh!
-Aah!

747
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:19,515
Keep punching a hole
in the left.

748
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:21,540
Keep punching a hole...

749
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:26,021
Captain Mucus!
Let's get after them.

750
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:28,024
You take the left flank.

751
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:29,525
[Bang]

752
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,993
Don't you know your left flank
from your right flank?

753
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:35,021
I flunked flank.

754
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:37,556
Get the funk out of here.

755
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:43,562
Here. This way.

756
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:55,010
Chemist, help me. I'm looking
for a pack of Trojans.

757
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:57,350
Gee, I just ran out.

758
00:41:57,387 --> 00:42:00,049
Captain Mucus.

759
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,581
Captain Mucus,
have you found anything?

760
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,594
Nothing, Commander, nothing!

761
00:42:04,628 --> 00:42:06,994
Search all the market places,
the square.

762
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,488
Half you men search
that area over there.

763
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:13,526
And the others
will run with Mucus.

764
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:19,270
We've got to get out of Rome.

765
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:19,968
But how?

766
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,208
The streets are crawling
with soldiers.

767
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:31,012
Oh,we'll never get out of Rome.

768
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:33,249
Only a miracle can save us.

769
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,520
Neigh!

770
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,026
Miracle!

771
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,527
Miracle!

772
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:39,426
Miracle!

773
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:41,021
Neigh!

774
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:43,328
We gotta get to that wagon.

775
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:44,833
Wait here.

776
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:46,995
[Whinny]

777
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:49,562
Come on. Hurry!

778
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:58,648
Aha!

779
00:42:58,682 --> 00:43:01,014
No,you don't!

780
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:05,214
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha ha!

781
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:06,586
Oh, my God!

782
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,717
I'm fighting with card board!

783
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,387
Good-bye, head!

784
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:13,760
Hello, balls!

785
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:15,492
Oh! Ah! Oh!

786
00:43:15,532 --> 00:43:17,022
Ahh haa haa!

787
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:18,398
Come on, Comicus!

788
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,528
Waa!

789
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,003
Hurry,take off!

790
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,029
Let's go, Miracle!

791
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:31,013
What--Commander.

792
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:32,514
Where are they?

793
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:34,517
[High voice]
Get the horses!

794
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:37,520
Get the chariots. Get the men.

795
00:43:37,554 --> 00:43:39,522
Onward!

796
00:43:39,556 --> 00:43:42,491
Get me an ice pack. Hurry!

797
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:46,859
Where you going?

798
00:43:46,897 --> 00:43:48,330
I don't know!

799
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:59,540
Uh-oh. Here come the bad guys.

800
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:03,478
Come on, Miracle, hurry.
They're gaining on us.

801
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:04,980
Hurry!

802
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:07,449
Come on, Miracle. Go, boy!

803
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:09,884
Come on! We're gaining on them!

804
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,650
They're gaining on us!

805
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:15,283
Come on, Miracle!

806
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:19,193
Go, boy, go! Stretch out
those long white legs!

807
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:26,659
We're pulling away!
We're losing them!

808
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:29,228
Ya! Ya!

809
00:44:29,272 --> 00:44:33,140
Quickly! Go to the left!
Go to the right!

810
00:44:33,176 --> 00:44:34,700
Stop!

811
00:44:39,549 --> 00:44:41,517
I smell something familiar!

812
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:44,019
Yes! Yes! I got an idea!

813
00:44:44,054 --> 00:44:46,022
Pull over!

814
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:47,546
Pull over!

815
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:51,522
I knew I smelled something.

816
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:54,086
Are you crazy?
They're right behind us!

817
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,030
The nose knows.

818
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:58,364
What the heck is he--

819
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:00,837
Why is he picking flowers?

820
00:45:00,837 --> 00:45:02,202
Roman red.

821
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,570
Roman red?

822
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:06,735
A whole field of wacky weed.

823
00:45:06,776 --> 00:45:08,209
He's picking weeds!

824
00:45:08,245 --> 00:45:11,510
Papyrus. Rolling papyrus.

825
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:13,982
Paper! Paper!

826
00:45:14,017 --> 00:45:16,485
What kind of paper? Like this?

827
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,009
That's good.

828
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:22,616
E-Z Widers. These people
don't know the value.

829
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:24,320
Josephus, hurry!

830
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:36,497
Hold this.

831

Yes, indeed!

832
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:40,509
They'll be here any minute!

833
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:44,502
Not to worry. We are now armed
with mighty joint.

834
00:45:44,547 --> 00:45:46,014
Mighty joint?

835
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:47,812
Let's go, Miracle!

836
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:50,217
Hurry! You've got to catch them!

837
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,745
Quickly! After them!

838
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:06,227
We've got to--
We've got to--

839
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,635
get...moving.

840
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:10,867
It's working!

841
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,238
It's working!

842
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:15,244
We got to stay loose,you know.

843
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:16,745
Let it cool--

844

01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:39,963
-Food!
-Food!

1178
01:05:39,997 --> 01:05:41,658
Count de Money!

1179
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,991
Count de Money!

1180
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,397
Count de Money!

1181
01:05:48,439 --> 01:05:50,464
Count de Money!

1182
01:05:50,507 --> 01:05:52,566
Count de Money!

1183
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,443
De Monet! De Monet!

1184
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:57,811
-Count de Money!
-Count de Money!

1185
01:05:57,848 --> 01:05:59,509
Aah!

1186
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,211
Aah!

1187
01:06:02,286 --> 01:06:06,450
Aaaaah!

1188
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,926
We should get rid
of your tailor.

1189
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,928
I don't like your cuffs.

1190
01:06:11,962 --> 01:06:15,420
I don't like your cuffs,
I don't like your cuffs.

1191
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:17,934
A man's cuffs should be even

1192
01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:20,436
with the tip of his pee-pee.

1193
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:24,430
Yours are all the way down
to your balls.

1194
01:06:24,475 --> 01:06:26,943
At least I have them.

1195
01:06:26,977 --> 01:06:28,467
You bitch!

1196
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:32,175
Lackey!

1197
01:06:32,216 --> 01:06:34,946
Count de Money.

1198
01:06:34,985 --> 01:06:36,953
De Monet.

1199
01:06:36,987 --> 01:06:38,955
Monet. Say it.

1200
01:06:38,989 --> 01:06:40,547
Mo-nay.

1201
01:06:40,591 --> 01:06:42,889
Mo-nay.

1202
01:06:42,927 --> 01:06:44,792
Perfect. Don't forget it.

1203
01:06:44,828 --> 01:06:46,227
Say it again.

1204
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:47,560
Monet.

1205
01:06:47,598 --> 01:06:49,065
Where's His Majesty?

1206
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:50,532
Playing chess.

1207
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:51,898
Chess?

1208
01:06:51,936 --> 01:06:53,927
I hate chess.

1209
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,430
Th-th-th!

1210
01:07:01,111 --> 01:07:03,443
It's your move,Your Majesty.

1211
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:09,943
I'm quite aware of that,
you petite putz.

1212
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:14,447
I see.

1213
01:07:18,462 --> 01:07:21,954
Knight to rook4!

1214
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:31,274
Your move, Popinjay.

1215
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:32,935
Yes, sire.

1216
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:34,808
Oh...

1217
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:41,952
Pawn threatens bishop!

1218
01:07:41,986 --> 01:07:44,454
What the hell did you say?

1219
01:07:44,488 --> 01:07:46,888
Pawn threatens bishop!

1220
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:49,119
All right! I understood.

1221
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:52,219
Pawn threatens bishop.
All right, Popinjay,

1222
01:07:52,262 --> 01:07:54,389
I'm invoking
the King's privilege.

1223
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,524
Three moves to one.

1224
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,567
Knight jumps Queen!

1225
01:08:02,606 --> 01:08:03,800
Whoops!

1226
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:05,570
Bishop jumps Queen!

1227
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:06,940
Ah!

1228
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:11,976
Pawns jump Queen!

1229
01:08:12,016 --> 01:08:13,574
-Oh!
-Ah!

1230
01:08:13,617 --> 01:08:16,415
Gang bang!

1231
01:08:16,453 --> 01:08:19,445
Come on, let's all
jumpthe Queen.

1232
01:08:21,225 --> 01:08:24,626
Whip out those little dicks!
Here we go!

1233
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,870
What a spectacle.

1234
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:36,600
-Oh!
-Oh!

1235
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,301
-Oh!
-Oh!

1236
01:08:38,342 --> 01:08:40,936
Isn't the Queen a good sport?

1237
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:42,946
And he's such a fool.

1238
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,881
Nevertheless,we must
do everything we can

1239
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:49,374
to save the thing
that divine right and history

1240
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,388
have placed on his head.

1241
01:08:51,422 --> 01:08:52,889
His wig?

1242
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:54,891
No,you twit, his crown--

1243
01:08:54,925 --> 01:08:57,223
the symbol
of "might makes right,"

1244
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:00,719
the thing our fortunes
and titles are attached to,

1245
01:09:00,764 --> 01:09:01,958
the monarchy.

1246
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:03,830
-Ah!
-Oh!

1247
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:06,392
Will you speak to His Majesty?

1248
01:09:06,437 --> 01:09:09,406
Perhaps later. We've had
such a bouncy journey.

1249
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,908
Where is the garcon de piss?

1250
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:14,638
There he is.

1251
01:09:16,947 --> 01:09:18,346
Merci, monsieur.

1252
01:09:18,382 --> 01:09:19,212
Piss boy!

1253
01:09:19,249 --> 01:09:21,444
Ah, oui, monsieur!

1254
01:09:23,353 --> 01:09:24,911
Oui, oui.

1255
01:09:24,955 --> 01:09:26,923
Yes, a lot of it.

1256
01:09:26,957 --> 01:09:28,618
S'il vous plait.

1257
01:09:33,964 --> 01:09:35,932
Keep searching.
You'll find it.

1258
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:38,958
Leave me alone.
I can handle this.

1259
01:09:40,304 --> 01:09:41,931
[Tinkling]

1260
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:43,462
Ah!

1261
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:52,272
You look familiar.
Who do you look like?

1262
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:54,216
Je ne sais pas.

1263
01:09:55,886 --> 01:09:57,683
Who is that girl?

1264
01:09:57,721 --> 01:10:00,189
She's gorgeous.

1265
01:10:05,596 --> 01:10:07,393
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

1266
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:08,898
Yes?

1267
01:10:08,932 --> 01:10:11,400
You are pissing on my shoe.

1268
01:10:11,435 --> 01:10:13,403
Sorry. Mind your pail!

1269
01:10:13,437 --> 01:10:14,927
Sorry.

1270
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:19,409
[Tinkling stops]

1271
01:10:19,443 --> 01:10:21,411
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

1272
01:10:21,445 --> 01:10:24,073
Wait for the shake.

1273
01:10:24,114 --> 01:10:25,445
[Tinkle]

1274
01:10:27,618 --> 01:10:29,176
There,there.

1275
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:31,414
That's for you.

1276
01:10:31,455 --> 01:10:33,423
Piss off.

1277
01:10:33,457 --> 01:10:35,948
Thank you. I'll get it later.

1278
01:10:39,296 --> 01:10:41,196
Oh,that's better.

1279
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:43,096
Let the Queen up!

1280
01:10:43,133 --> 01:10:45,931
She's been so good to all of us!

1281
01:10:47,404 --> 01:10:49,497
Ooh!

1282
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,371
Ooh!

1283
01:10:51,408 --> 01:10:53,899
There's a naughty bit
of crumpet!

1284
01:10:58,248 --> 01:10:59,909
Mmm!

1285
01:11:01,919 --> 01:11:03,045
Oh!

1286
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:04,383
Your Majesty.

1287
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:06,412
How's it going, Marie?

1288
01:11:11,428 --> 01:11:13,919
It's good to be the King.

1289
01:11:15,766 --> 01:11:17,427
Ah!

1290
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:20,927
Hmmm.

1291
01:11:25,442 --> 01:11:27,910
[Sniff]

1292
01:11:27,945 --> 01:11:29,435
[Sniff]

1293
01:11:31,949 --> 01:11:34,417
Everything's so green.

1294
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:37,420
Majesty, may I have
a word with you?

1295
01:11:37,454 --> 01:11:39,479
Ooh! Care for a toot?

1296
01:11:39,523 --> 01:11:40,922
Non. Merci.

1297
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,927
Don't indulge? Well,
that leaves more for us.

1298
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:45,519
Who are you?

1299
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:49,362
Your Majesty, I am
Mademoiselle Rimbaud.

1300
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:51,867
Mmm. Nice names.

1301
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:55,360
Tell me, my dear,
what can I do for you?

1302
01:11:55,405 --> 01:11:57,373
My father, Monsieur Rimbaud,

1303
01:11:57,407 --> 01:12:00,376
for 10 years has languished
in the Bastille.

1304
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,868
If I don't get him out soon,
he will surely die.

1305
01:12:03,914 --> 01:12:07,441
I throw myself on your mercy.
Please release him.

1306
01:12:07,484 --> 01:12:10,385
Why was he put
into the Bastille?

1307
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,389
He said something
at a royal dinner party.

1308
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:15,391
What did he say?

1309
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:18,394
He said,
"the poor ain't so bad."

1310
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:20,396
"The poor ain't so bad"!

1311
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,625
You're lucky he's still alive.

1312
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:25,567
Please,Your Majesty,
don't let him die.

1313
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,571
I'll do anything to gain
his pardon. Anything.

1314
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:30,402
Anything?

1315
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,409
Your Majesty!
I was raised in a convent.

1316
01:12:33,443 --> 01:12:37,004
I don't indulge
in pleasures of the flesh.

1317
01:12:37,047 --> 01:12:40,847
You don't put out,
he don't get out.

1318
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:43,978
But Your Majesty,
I simply don't do it.

1319
01:12:44,021 --> 01:12:47,923
Come on. You do it.
You know you do it.

1320
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:50,927
We love to do it. You do it.

1321
01:12:50,961 --> 01:12:52,428
No, I don't.

1322
01:12:52,462 --> 01:12:53,952
You want to do it.

1323
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:57,763
I do it. I love to do it.

1324
01:12:57,801 --> 01:13:01,464
I just did it, and I'm ready
to do it again.

1325
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:04,440
Don't tell me
you don't do it.

1326
01:13:04,474 --> 01:13:08,467
You do it, or your father dies.
Hump or death.

1327
01:13:08,512 --> 01:13:09,945
Humperdinck?

1328
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,448
Not Humperdinck.
Hump or death.

1329
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:14,450
You got 10 seconds

1330
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:16,452
to make up your mind.

1331
01:13:16,486 --> 01:13:18,784
Hump, death. Hump, death.

1332
01:13:18,822 --> 01:13:20,414
Hump, death.

1333
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:23,051
Your time is running out!

1334
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:25,459
All right, all right!
Hump! Oh!

1335
01:13:25,495 --> 01:13:28,464
Very good. I'm glad
you thought it over.

1336
01:13:28,498 --> 01:13:31,126
Be at my chambers at midnight.

1337
01:13:31,168 --> 01:13:32,965
A tout a I'heure.

1338
01:13:33,003 --> 01:13:34,868
Wait.

1339
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:37,965
Don't wear anything...

1340
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:39,999
complicated.

1341
01:13:47,951 --> 01:13:49,919
Ah.
