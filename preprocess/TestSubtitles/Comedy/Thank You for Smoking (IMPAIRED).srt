1
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,467
Robin Williger.

2
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,017
He is a 15-year-old freshman
from Racine, Wisconsin.

3
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:11,747
He enjoys studying history.

4
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,409
He's on the debate team.

5
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:16,645
Robin's future looked
very, very bright,

6
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,501
but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer,

7
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,095
a very tough kind of cancer.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,615
Robin tells me he has
quit smoking, though,

9
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,819
and he no longer thinks
that cigarettes are cool.

10
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,286
( applause )

11
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,996
Whoo!.

12
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:36,226
And our final guest today
is Nick Naylor.

13
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:40,702
Mr. Naylor is the vice president
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

14
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,708
Now, they are the tobacco
industry's main lobby

15
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,058
in Washington, D.C.

16
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:48,092
and Mr. Naylor is
their chief spokesman.

17
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:51,296
( audience murmuring )

18
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:03,808
( booing, hissing )

19
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:07,072
NICK:
Few people on this planet know

20
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,211
what it is to be truly despised.

21
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,454
Can you blame them?

22
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,824
I earn a living
fronting an organization

23
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:17,054
that kills 1,200 human beings a day.

24
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,300
1,200 people.

25
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,791
We're talking
two jumbo jet plane loads

26
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,484
of men, women and children.

27
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,568
I mean, there's Attila,

28
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,135
Genghis,

29
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:27,103
and me,

30
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,412
Nick Naylor,

31
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:29,495
the face of cigarettes...

32
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,252
the Colonel Sanders of nicotine.

33
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:33,760
This is where I work,

34
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:36,278
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

35
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,457
It was established
by seven gentlemen

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,087
you may recognize from C-SPAN.

37
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,713
These guys realized quick
if they were going to claim

38
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:43,863
that cigarettes were not addictive,

39
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:46,040
they better have proof.

40
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,900
This is the man they rely on,

41
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,039
Erhardt Von Grupten Mundt.

42
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,315
They found him in Germany.

43
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:53,877
I won't go into the details.

44
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,095
He's been testing the link

45
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,377
between nicotine
and lung cancer

46
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,609
for 30 years and hasn't found
any conclusive results.

47
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:00,572
The man's a genius.

48
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,264
He could disprove gravity.

49
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:03,959
Then we've got our sharks.

50
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:05,752
We draft them out
of Ivy League law schools

51
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,057
and give them time-shares
and sports cars.

52
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:09,651
It's just like
a John Grisham novel

53
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,213
you know, without all the espionage.

54
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:15,415
Most importantly,
we've got spin control.

55
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,273
That's where I come in.

56
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:18,682
I get paid to talk.

57
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,274
I don't have an MD or law degree.

58
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,241
( shutter clicking )

59
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,517
( machine gun firing )

60
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,653
I have a bachelor's in
kicking ass and taking names.

61
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:28,090
You know that guy
who can pick up any girl?

62
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,202
I'm him

63
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:30,355
on crack.

64
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,426
( cheers, applause )

65
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:35,440
This is obviously a heated issue

66
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:38,132
and we do have a lot
that we want to cover today.

67
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,244
Nick, do you have a question?

68
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,393
Joan,

69
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:45,142
how on earth would
Big Tobacco profit

70
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,576
off of the loss of this young man?

71
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:49,778
Now, I hate to think
in such callous terms,

72
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:52,848
but, if anything,
we'd be losing a customer.

73
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,920
It's not only our hope,
it's in our best interest

74
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,163
to keep Robin alive and smoking.

75
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,858
- That's ludicrous.
- Let me tell you something,

76
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,716
Joan, and please,
let me share something

77
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,296
with the fine, concerned
people in the audience today.

78
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,814
The Ron Goodes of this world...

79
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,375
want the Robin Willigers to die.

80
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,526
- What?
- NAYLOR: You know why?

81
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:14,157
So that their budgets will go up.

82
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,012
This is nothing less than
trafficking in human misery,

83
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,801
and you, sir, ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

84
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,331
I ought to be ashamed of myself?

85
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,438
As a matter of fact,
we're about to launch...

86
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,411
a $50 million campaign

87
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:30,510
aimed at persuading kids
not to smoke.

88
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,685
Because I think
that we can all agree

89
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,828
that there is nothing
more important

90
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,209
than America's children.

91
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:37,617
LUNDEN: All right, now,
that's something that

92
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,407
we're going to want
to know more about.

93
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:40,620
but I have to take a short break.

94
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,731
Hang on, a lot more coming.

95
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,486
( applause )

96
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:48,402
$50 million??!. Are you
out of your fucking mind??!.

97
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,360
Everyone has a boss.

98
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,320
BR just happens

99
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,880
to be mine.

100
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,775
He came from the vending
machine world.

101
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,468
This made him tough.

102
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:59,852
The name BR came
from his tour in Vietnam.

103
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:02,921
The people who know
its meaning are all dead.

104
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:04,400
The deal was five m i I l ion!

105
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,149
$ 5 million will get you
a couple of subway posters.

106
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,143
It's not going to impress anyone.

107
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,353
That's the idea, Nick.

108
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:10,351
You'll be thanking me soon.

109
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,562
This'll probably get you great press.

110
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:13,934
I gotta call the captain
and see if this is gonna fly.

111
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,040
Get your ass back to D.C.

112
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,758
( applause nearby )

113
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:27,976
( door opening )

114
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,183
Thank you so much for coming.

115
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:33,803
Mr. Naylor?

116
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:34,851
It's your turn.

117
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,195
Ah.

118
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:39,268
Joey is such a bright young man.

119
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:40,301
We all look forward

120
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,089
to his coming out
of his shell a little.

121
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:43,367
He's a bit shy.

122
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,193
Yeah, he gets that from his mother.

123
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:56,615
( whisper ): Hey, Joey.

124
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,985
Please don't ruin my childhood.

125
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,059
Come on,Joey. Trust me.

126
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,586
How many of you want to be
lawyers when you grow up?

127
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,640
Right.

128
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,176
How about...

129
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,940
movie stars?

130
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,220
( laughing )

131
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:18,402
How about lobbyists?

132
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,400
What's that?

133
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,353
It's kind of like being a movie star.

134
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,140
It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

135
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,354
What do you talk about?

136
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,432
I speak on behalf of cigarettes.

137
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:27,715
My mom used to smoke.

138
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:30,337
She says that cigarettes kill.

139
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,742
Really? Now, is your mommy a doctor?

140
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,702
No.

141
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,459
A scientific researcher of some kind?

142
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,738
No.

143
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:37,734
Well, she doesn't exactly sound

144
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,174
like a credible expert,
now, does she?

145
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,509
Don't feel bad.

146
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,429
It's okay to listen to your mom.

147
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:45,796
I mean, it's good to listen
to your parents...Joey.

148
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:48,099
All I'm suggesting

149
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,501
is that there will always
be people trying to tell you

150
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,671
what to do and what to think.

151
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:54,083
There probably already are
people doing that.

152
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,043
Am I right?

153
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,036
KI DS: Yes.

154
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:57,825
I'm here to say

155
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:01,221
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

156
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,666
you can respond, "Who says?"

157
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,399
So, cigarettes are good for you?

158
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,324
- No!
- No, that's not...

159
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,534
That's not what I'm getting at.

160
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,874
My point is that you have
to think for yourself.

161
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,630
You have to challenge authority.

162
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:15,903
If your parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

163
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,466
would you just take their word for it?

164
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:18,619
KIDS: No.

165
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:19,673
Exactly.

166
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,536
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

167
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:22,563
when it comes to cigarettes,

168
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,034
you should find out for yourself.

169
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,212
Okay, then.

170
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,584
Thank you, Mr. Naylor,
for joining us.

171
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:28,860
( light applause )

172
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:39,129
NICK:
Every week we meet here at Bert's.

173
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,143
Together, we represent
the chief spokespeople

174
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,097
for the tobacco, alcohol and
firearms industries.

175
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,274
We call ourselves the M�D Squad.

176
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:46,238
All right.

177
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:48,890
M-O-D, Merchants of Death.

178
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,106
So, my day's ruined.

179
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,069
Why?

180
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,346
Dateline's doing a segment

181
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,975
on fetal alcohol syndrome.
Thank you.

182
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,935
Polly works
for the Moderation Council.

183
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,236
A casual drinker
by the age of 14,

184
00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:59,547
Polly quickly developed

185
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,910
a tolerance usually reserved
for Irish dockworkers.

186
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,763
In our world, she's the woman

187
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:06,935
that got the pope
to endorse red wine.

188
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,685
We're gonna get creamed.

189
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:11,993
Any ideas?

190
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,338
I don't know.

191
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,675
Deformed kids are tough.

192
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,945
I'm lucky my product only makes
them bald before it kills them.

193
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,868
You could hug the kids.

194
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,853
They're not going
to let me hug the kids.

195
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:23,443
Who's doing the segment,
Donaldson or Sawyer?

196
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,411
Sawyer, probably.

197
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,371
You're fucked.

198
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,331
Why?

199
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,509
Cause she's gonna hug them.

200
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,718
Look, if you see her going in
for a hug,

201
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,537
maybe just box her out,
get in there before she does.

202
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,163
NICK:
Bobby Jayworks for SAFETY,

203
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,406
- ( ricochet )
- the Society for the Advancement of Firearms

204
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,231
and Effective Training for Youth.

205
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,536
You want me to smile?

206
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,537
After watching the footage
of the Kent State shootings,

207
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:47,352
Bobby Jay, then 1 7, signed up
for the National Guard

208
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,458
so he, too, could shoot
college students.

209
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:51,930
But the National Guard
recruiter was out to lunch,

210
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:55,060
so Bobby Jay ended up
shooting Panamanians instead,

211
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,755
which was almost as good
as college students.

212
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:57,840
( gunshot )

213
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,669
Only they shoot back.

214
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,363
You know, you can beat
a Breathalyzer

215
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,335
- by sucking on activated charcoal tablets?
- Really?

216
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,935
Maybe we should change
our campaign to

217
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,928
"If You Must Drink and Drive,
Suck Charcoal."

218
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,039
Yeah, but don't the police wonder

219
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:10,006
why you're sucking on charcoal?

220
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:11,828
There's no law against charcoal.

221
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,357
- Yet.
- Yet.

222
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,909
Dad, why is the American
government the best government?

223
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,477
Because of our
endless appeals system.

224
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:27,884
Joe, you're not writing down
what I just said are you?

225
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,103
Mm-hmm.

226
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,116
Joey, stop for a second.

227
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:32,651
What is the subject of your essay?

228
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,442
Why is American government
the best government in the world.

229
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,103
Your teacher crafted that question?

230
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:38,897
Yeah. Why?

231
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:41,681
Well... I'll look past
the obvious problems

232
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,025
in syntax for a moment,

233
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,132
and I'll focus more on the core
of the question.

234
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:46,382
I mean, "A,"

235
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:49,005
does America have
the best government in the world?

236
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,701
And "B," what constitutes
a "best government"?

237
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:53,138
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?

238
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,610
Hmm?

239
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,602
And America - definitely not best.

240
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,845
Perhaps not even better than most.

241
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,257
We do have a very
entertaining government...

242
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,600
Dad.

243
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:01,455
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:05,042
Are you familiar with the term "B.S."?

245
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,633
Bullshit.

246
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:07,949
Yes, exactly.

247
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,833
B.S., if I may, is what
questions like the one

248
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,752
your teacher posed are made for.

249
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,705
Because even if America
had the best government,

250
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:16,263
there'd be no way to prove it.

251
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,646
And how many pages are you writing?

252
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:18,607
Two pages.

253
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,232
Two pages...

254
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:21,832
Definitely not in two pages.

255
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:24,009
So what am I supposed to write?

256
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,738
You can write whatever you want.

257
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:27,183
Okay.

258
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,229
Write about...

259
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,639
write about America's
amazing ability

260
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,606
to make profit by breaking down
trading tariffs

261
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:35,981
and bringing American jobs
to Third World countries.

262
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,934
Or how good we are
at executing felons.

263
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,592
They're all correct answers.

264
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,583
I can do that?

265
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,140
See, Joey, that's the beauty
of argument.

266
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,548
'Cause if you argue correctly,
you're never wrong.

267
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:55,725
Dad, if I finish
this essay within an hour,

268
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,513
can we stay up all night?

269
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:02,086
That's a negotiation,
not an argument.

270
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,807
( over TV ):
Well, Conway, see you made it.

271
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,851
Yeah, I guess that little
voice was wrong.

272
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:08,004
I feel better.

273
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:09,221
I feel a lot better, too.

274
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:11,779
As a matter of fact, I never
felt so good in my life.

275
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,411
How about a cigarette?

276
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:14,923
( gunshot )

277
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,809
( dramatic music playing )

278
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,436
( gunfire )

279
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:30,625
MAN 1 : Is he...?

280
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:31,778
MAN 2: Yeah.

281
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:37,097
Hey.

282
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:40,489
Nick, you still own a watch, don't you?

283
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,730
J ill, I can't help feeling

284
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,295
Joey's getting the wrong idea
about his dad.

285
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,863
It would be great if I could spend

286
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,431
a little more time with him,
you know?

287
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:49,886
To give him a fair
and balanced perspective.

288
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,781
Nick, you had plenty
of time for that.

289
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,287
Now you're his weekend guardian.

290
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,326
Besides, he has Brad.

291
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:56,479
He still needs his father.

292
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,689
Nick.

293
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,839
You have a second?

294
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,756
Sure, Brad.

295
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:06,467
Nick, your job
and everything aside,

296
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,421
I hope you understand
that secondhand smoke's

297
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,144
a real killer.

298
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,034
What are you talking about?

299
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:13,694
I just hope you're providing

300
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:16,253
a smoke-free environment
for Joey, that's all I'm saying.

301
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,462
Brad, I'm his father.

302
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,802
You're the guy fucking his mom.

303
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,313
That was unnecessary.

304
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:28,772
Thank you all.
Thank you all for coming.

305
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,235
Tobacco is winning the war.

306
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:34,398
The war against our children.

307
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,663
They like to use cartoons
and symbols to hook our kids.

308
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:40,513
Well, now we have
a symbol of our own.

309
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,716
Doctor.

310
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:45,470
It is my hope that
within the year

311
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,196
every cigarette package

312
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,200
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

313
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:52,444
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

314
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,513
appropriately as poison.

315
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,406
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

316
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:00,123
to discuss the inclusion
of the skull and crossbones

317
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:01,632
in the next two weeks.

318
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,070
As usual, I extend
an open invitation

319
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,558
to big tobacco.

320
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:09,493
Perhaps this time they will
grace us with their presence.

321
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,844
And their answers.

322
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,286
Thank you very much.

323
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,423
( reporters clamoring )

324
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,094
People, what is going on out there?

325
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:23,671
I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

326
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,295
Our numbers are down
all across the board.

327
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,187
Teen smoking -
our bread and butter,

328
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,945
is falling like a shit from heaven.

329
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,591
We don't sell Tic Tacs,
for Christ's sake.

330
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:35,287
We sell cigarettes.

331
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,164
And they're cool and available
and addictive.

332
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,821
The job is almost done for us.

333
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:47,227
This environmentalist
is challenging us.

334
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,780
We have to have an answer.

335
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:51,509
I'm asking you,

336
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,368
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

337
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:54,929
what the fuck are we going to do?

338
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:57,490
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

339
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,741
If l may.

340
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,178
In 1910,

341
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,664
the U.S. was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

342
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,850
By 1930,

343
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,842
we were up to 123 billion.

344
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,826
What happened in between?

345
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,515
Three things.

346
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,546
A world war,

347
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:15,352
dieting... and movies.

348
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:16,627
Movies?

349
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,631
1 927- talking pictures are born.

350
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,875
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

351
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:23,832
something to do
while they're talking.

352
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,514
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

353
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,023
Bette Davis - a chimney.

354
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,364
And Bogart -
remember the first picture

355
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:30,479
with him and Lauren Bacall?

356
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:32,951
Well, yea... not specifically.

357
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,258
Oh, she sort

358
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,367
of shimmies in
through the doorway,

359
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,478
1 9 years old.

360
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,990
Pure sex.

361
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:40,948
She says,

362
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,185
"Anyone got a match??"

363
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:44,912
And Bogie throws
the matches at her...

364
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:48,180
and she catches them.

365
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:51,693
Greatest romance of the century.

366
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:53,870
How'd it start?
Lighting a cigarette.

367
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:56,341
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

368
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:59,536
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

369
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:01,460
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

370
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,445
is smoking is cool.

371
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,744
We need the cast of Willand Grace

372
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,154
smoking in their living room.

373
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:09,391
Forrest Gump puffing away
between his box of chocolates.

374
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,753
Hugh Grant earning back
the love of Julia Roberts

375
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:16,975
by buying her favorite brand -
her Virginia Slims.

376
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:20,457
Most of the actors smoke already.

377
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,701
If they start doing it on-screen,

378
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:25,388
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

379
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,946
Well, it's a thought.

380
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,773
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

381
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:30,856
but at least you're thinking.

382
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,270
Rest of you people,
slam your fucking brains

383
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,231
against your desks

384
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,818
until something useful comes out.

385
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:37,743
That was awesome.

386
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:38,823
Thank you.

387
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,839
Nick, you've been summoned.

388
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:41,893
Captain wants to see you.

389
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,277
He saw the Joan show.

390
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,424
What'd he think?

391
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,252
Get your ass on the next flight
to Winston-Salem.

392
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:51,503
Most people have this image
in their heads

393
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,607
of tobacco executives
jet-setting around the world

394
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,816
on private planes,
eating foie gras

395
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,228
as they count their money.

396
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:59,367
Not me.

397
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,674
I like to ride with the people.

398
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,237
Know your clients.

399
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:05,448
My people cram themselves
into a tiny seat,

400
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:07,339
pop a Xanax and dream
of the moment

401
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:10,252
they can stuff their face
with fresh tobacco.

402
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,001
If I can convince just one of
these kids to pick up smoking,

403
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:15,272
I've paid for my flight round-trip.

404
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:27,016
The Captain is the last great
man of tobacco.

405
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,774
He introduced filters

406
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:32,192
when cigarettes first got
slammed by Reader's Digest.

407
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,489
Later, he founded
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

408
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,337
The club was founded
by the tobacco barons in 1 890

409
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,730
so they'd have a place
to get away from their wives.

410
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:48,449
Here, the Captain is a legend -

411
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:50,791
a self-made man who started
from nothing,

412
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:53,573
and ended up with everything...

413
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,739
except, evidently, a son.

414
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,980
Nick, my boy.

415
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:02,048
You're just i n ti me for mud.

416
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:03,679
Thank you.

417
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:05,410
Sit down there. Yeah.

418
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:09,761
Yeah.

419
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,773
You know the secret
to a really good julep?

420
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,505
No, sir.

421
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:15,877
Well, you crush the mint

422
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:18,942
down onto the ice with your thumb

423
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,381
and you grind it in, see?

424
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,999
And it releases the menthol.

425
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:26,491
Hmm.

426
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,940
Now you know who taught me that?

427
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:28,932
No, sir. Who?

428
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,753
Fidel Castro.

429
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,052
Do you remember 1952?

430
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,256
Well, sir, I wasn't alive in 1952.

431
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:44,895
Good Lord, I was in Korea
shooting Chinese in 1952.

432
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,068
Really?

433
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:49,343
Today they're our best customer.

434
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,964
Next time we won't have to shoot
so many of them, will we?

435
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,725
- ( chuckles )
- No, sir.

436
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:57,657
1 952 was the year
Reader's Digest

437
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,513
nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

438
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,999
As Churchill said,

439
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,277
that was perhaps the end
of our beginning.

440
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,574
Tell me,

441
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:10,529
do you enjoy your current work, Nick?

442
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:11,553
Yes, sir.

443
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,024
It's challenging...

444
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:16,569
If you can do tobacco,
you can do anything.

445
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:19,389
Yes, sir, I like that.

446
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:21,790
You know, Nick, you remind me

447
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:24,027
just a little bit
of myself when I was your age.

448
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,649
Well, thank you, sir.

449
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:28,508
Like that Joan Lunden show you did.

450
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,779
You could have given up,
cried, apologized,

451
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:31,828
but you didn't.

452
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:33,790
You stayed loyal.

453
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:38,557
And you gave it
to that son of a bitch good.

454
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:41,109
- ( chuckles )
- My pleasure.

455
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:47,159
Now, BR's come under the idea

456
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:49,912
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

457
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,527
to make the actors smoke on screen.

458
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:56,498
You know, like in the old days.

459
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:58,776
Say, that's, uh...

460
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,048
that's a great idea.

461
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:02,523
Mm-hmm.

462
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,082
Smart man, that BR.

463
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,650
Oh, yeah, yeah.

464
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,218
And loyal.

465
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:26,935
Yes, sir?

466
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,823
Have a seat, Ron.

467
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:43,351
You, see, Ron, I can't be
everywhere I'm needed.

468
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:45,270
That's why I send
people like you

469
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,645
to speak on my behalf.

470
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:50,257
When you're there,
you're not Ron Goode,

471
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,247
the guy your friends probably like,

472
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:54,798
you're Senator Finistirre's aide,

473
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:58,034
and your name really doesn't matter.

474
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,957
So, when

475
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,640
Ron Goode acts
like a complete asshole

476
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:05,328
on the Joan Lunden Show,

477
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,397
I am being an asshole
on the Joan Lunden Show.

478
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,095
Senator, sir, he sprang on me like...

479
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:13,263
Where in the hell
did you find cancer boy?

480
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,700
He was supposed to be quite reliable.

481
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:18,514
The Pulmonary Council
was one of his references.

482
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,238
Fucking nonprofits.

483
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,446
When you're looking
for a cancer kid,

484
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:27,792
he should be hopeless.

485
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,386
He should have a wheelchair.

486
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,563
He should have trouble talking.

487
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,285
He should have
a little pet goldfish

488
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:35,914
he carries around
in a ziplock bag-

489
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,033
hopeless.

490
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,310
I apologize, sir, but if it wasn't

491
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,687
- for Nick Naylor...
- Nick Naylor?

492
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:46,704
Don't you even think
of using him as an excuse.

493
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:48,711
The man shills bullshit for a living.

494
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,705
You work for a fucking senator.

495
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:52,973
A senator who is supposed
to be tough on tobacco.

496
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:55,823
Have a little... pride,
for God's sake.

497
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:59,979
It won't happen again, sir,
I promise.

498
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:05,894
All right, you're excused.

499
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:12,811
Sometimes I feel like

500
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,496
a Colombian drug dealer.

501
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,126
( chuckles )

502
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:21,606
The other day, my own granddaughter,
flesh of flesh of my own loins,

503
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,939
asked me, "Granddaddy, is it true

504
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:27,787
cigarettes are bad for you??"

505
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:32,548
We got to do something, Nick.

506
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,863
I think you're our man.

507
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,623
Thank you, sir.

508
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:37,895
I want you to work
on this Hollywood project.

509
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:40,386
Get out there the next
few weeks, stir things up

510
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:44,267
and report directly to me.

511
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,378
Sir, about the,

512
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:48,418
the $50 million.

513
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:51,305
Anti teen-smoking advertising.

514
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,752
Well, shit, I sure hope
it's not too persuasive.

515
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:56,266
( laughs )

516
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:57,442
I hope.

517
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:58,692
( laughs )

518
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,383
Nick,

519
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,269
you're family now.

520
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,889
Tobacco takes care of its own, eh?

521
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,847
Thank you, sir.

522
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,125
Mr. Naylor?

523
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:30,172
Hi.

524
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,654
Hi. Welcome to Tobacco One.

525
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:32,962
Thank you.

526
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,583
The captain told me to take
extra special care of you today.

527
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:38,021
So if there is anything
at all I can do

528
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,328
to make your flight
more pleasant,

529
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,562
you be sure and let me know now.

530
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:55,292
BR.

531
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:56,257
Pleasant flight?

532
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:58,363
Oh! You could say that.

533
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:00,159
Came up on the Captain's plane.

534
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,082
Oh, it's quite the way to travel.

535
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,968
I wouldn't know.

536
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,278
No? You never been on Tobacco One

537
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,478
with those seats, that kitchen,

538
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,173
that stewardess, Tiffany?

539
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:12,217
Haven't had the chance yet.

540
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:13,566
Oh, well, you really must try it.

541
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,641
It's the only way to travel.

542
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,845
What'd he think of your $50 million
anti-smoking campaign?

543
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,801
Oh, the $50 million
anti teen-smoking campaign?

544
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:21,759
Yeah.

545
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:22,971
Yeah, he gave that the go-ahead.

546
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,187
Oh, and he loved your idea

547
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,534
to put cigarettes back into movies.

548
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,089
- That was your idea.
- Oh, yeah?

549
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:30,233
- He must have gotten confused.
- Hmm.

550
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:34,559
Yeah. Well, either way,
he was pretty blown away.

551
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:37,209
Right. Well, get a flight to L.A.

552
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:38,360
I'll get you a meeting
with Jeff Megall.

553
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:39,446
Who?

554
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:40,762
Hollywood super agent.

555
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:44,377
Runs the agency EGO:
Entertainment Global Offices.

556
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,974
This guy is the entertainment business.

557
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,250
And you are cigarettes, BR.

558
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,139
Whatever.

559
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,718
Yeah, but it's not a vacation,
it's a learning experience.

560
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:55,797
And California is one
of the fastest-growing

561
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:57,048
states, it's got

562
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,776
the largest number of electoral
votes in the country.

563
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:01,561
I mean, this could be
a very good trip for Joey.

564
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:02,938
You know what?
Don't smooth-talk me.

565
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:03,987
You're not going to
take him sightseeing.

566
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:05,109
You're probably going

567
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,123
to take him
to some lung cancer symposium

568
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,084
where a guy with an electronic
voice box will tell him

569
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:10,294
that his father is the devil.

570
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:11,509
That's unfair.

571
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:12,857
Unfair? What about Virginia?

572
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:14,265
And what about Virginia?

573
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:16,055
You took him to a cigarette factory.

574
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:17,945
No, I took him to a tobacco farm.

575
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:19,190
That's hardly the same thing.

576
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:21,202
This conversation's over.

577
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,929
( sighs ): Oh, fuck.

578
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,652
Last week we had another
disgruntled postman.

579
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:30,704
Of course,

580
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:31,923
an hour later the Washington Post

581
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:34,710
is calling me on the phone,
godless swine.

582
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:36,272
I said to 'em, I says,

583
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:40,240
"Now if a plane crashes
on account of pilot error,

584
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:41,655
do you blame the Boeing Corporation??"

585
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:42,702
Nice.

586
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,118
- That's a good one.
- Thank you.

587
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:46,673
If some booze-besotten drunk
runs someone down,

588
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:48,632
do you go banging on the doors
at General Motors?

589
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:50,005
Tell me you didn't say that.

590
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:51,414
Mm-hmm.

591
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,422
Have either of you heard of a
reporter named Heather Holloway?

592
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:56,562
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Irish type.

593
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:57,973
Brown hair, big blue eyes.

594
00:25:58,072 --> 00:25:59,119
Nice skin.

595
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,206
Amazing tits.

596
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:02,963
Tits? Why are tits relevant?

597
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,340
Hmm, let's see.

598
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,090
World-class tits on a reporter
interviewing a man

599
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,908
with privileged information
are relevant.

600
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:11,916
How about it, Nick?
Are you a tit man?

601
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,746
Don't answer that.
That's a trap.

602
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:16,530
Depends whose tits.

603
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,354
Look,just don't get screwed,
all right?

604
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:21,301
Bobby, I think I can handle
a good-looking girl reporter.

605
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:22,958
Thank you.

606
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:32,779
Heather Holloway.

607
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,542
Nick Naylor, big tobacco.

608
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,285
Is this kosher?

609
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,242
Only if l can call you Heather.

610
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,511
By all means.

611
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:45,960
So, Mr. Naylor...

612
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,074
- Nick.
- Nick.

613
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,120
Let's start with...

614
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:51,503
An '82 Margaux.

615
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:53,545
Okay. Is it good?

616
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,945
Good? It'll make you believe in God.

617
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,518
So what is the focus of your piece?

618
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,381
- You.
- Really?

619
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:16,236
You want to know how I live
with myself.

620
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:19,914
No. I don't imagine
that's much of a problem.

621
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:22,154
I want to know how you see yourself.

622
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:23,401
I'm...

623
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:26,154
a mediator between two sects
of society

624
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:27,881
that are trying
to reach an accommodation.

625
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:29,772
Interesting.

626
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:33,383
My other interviews have pinned
you as a mass murderer,

627
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,421
bloodsucker, pimp,
profiteer, child killer,

628
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:39,658
and my personal favorite
"yuppie Mephistopheles."

629
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,758
Wow, that sounds
like a balanced article.

630
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,836
Who else should I talk to?

631
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:46,981
55 million American smokers,
for starters

632
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:49,835
or perhaps
the American tobacco farmer

633
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,972
who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler.

634
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:53,418
I actually do plan on speaking
to a tobacco farmer.

635
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:54,465
Good.

636
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,546
They're fine people,
salt of the earth.

637
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:58,953
Nick, why do you do this?

638
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,645
What motivates you?

639
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:08,898
You really want to know?

640
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:10,116
Mm-hmm.

641
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:11,201
Really?

642
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:13,030
Mm-hmm.

643
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,570
( whispers ): Population control.

644
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,845
( chuckles )

645
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:22,401
You're bad.

646
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,785
Everyone's got a mortgage to pay.

647
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:29,028
NICK: The yuppie Nuremberg defense.

648
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:32,510
So is a mortgage that much
of a life goal?

649
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:36,738
Well, 99%%% of everything done
in the world, good or bad,

650
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,260
is done to pay a mortgage,
so perhaps the world

651
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:41,308
would be a better place
if everyone rented.

652
00:28:41,414 --> 00:28:43,421
Then why don't you rent?

653
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:45,249
Mm. Well, I rent as well.

654
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,756
- Really?
- Yeah.

655
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:49,025
My son and his mother
and her boyfriend

656
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,053
live in my house.

657
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,228
I live in my apartment.

658
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,681
What does Nick Naylor's
apartment look like?

659
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,123
I don't know.
It's nothing impressive.

660
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,529
It wouldn't make
the real estate section.

661
00:28:58,628 --> 00:28:59,490
( chuckles )

662
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:01,279
Can I see it?

663
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:05,470
You want to see my apartment?

664
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:08,353
I'd like to see
where the devil sleeps.

665
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:16,442
NICK: I know what
you're probably thinking.

666
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:20,954
This is a bad idea, right?

667
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:25,146
I mean, come on.

668
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,297
It's not that bad of an idea.

669
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:30,489
( sizzling )

670
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:32,894
( pots clattering )

671
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:41,846
Mom, why can't I go

672
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:43,926
to California?

673
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,327
Because California's
just not a... safe place.

674
00:29:47,423 --> 00:29:49,845
And besides,
I'm not sure it's appropriate

675
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:53,049
for your father to bring you
on a business trip.

676
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,524
Appropriate for who?

677
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:56,509
What?

678
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,810
Mom, is it possible that
you're taking the frustration

679
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,698
of your failed marriage out on me?

680
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:04,093
Excuse me?

681
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,361
This California trip seems like
a great learning opportunity

682
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:09,144
and a chance for me
to get to know my father.

683
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:10,903
But if you think it's more important

684
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,793
to use me to channel your frustration

685
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:14,715
against the man you no longer love,

686
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,406
I'll understand.

687
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:23,098
How'd you convince her?

688
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,301
It was an argument,
not a negotiation.

689
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:26,963
That's my boy.

690
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,367
( soft music playing )

691
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:12,975
Nick?

692
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:15,118
Nick, Jack, Jeff's assistant. Hey.

693
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:17,393
How was your flight?
Are you jet-lagged at all?

694
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:19,119
It's, like, 2:00 in D.C.
right now.

695
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,629
You know what?
Take some vitamin B.

696
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:21,903
Jeff swears by it, in fact,

697
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,599
I'm gonna hook you up
with an injection.

698
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,043
Who's this with you?
How are you, dude? What's going on?

699
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,189
You guys ever been to L.A. before?

700
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:28,049
You want to head back
to Jeff's office?

701
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:30,418
In fact, we probably should -
He's a punctual being.

702
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:33,233
We actually had some problems at first
with the exterior mirrored glass.

703
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,787
The reflection of the sun was causing
head-on collisions on Wilshire.

704
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:37,419
Oh, is everybody all right?

705
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,596
Yeah, they got three-picture deals
at Paramount- I'm sure they'll live.

706
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:40,877
- It's a nice building.
- Yeah?

707
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,768
Hey, tell Jeff you think so, okay?

708
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,289
'Cause he just put a lot
of himself into this building.

709
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:48,690
And you know something?
It really shows.

710
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:50,281
What's up, Hiroshi?

711
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:53,998
Keep going - that sand's
not gonna rake itself.

712
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:56,040
All right, come here,
this is my favorite part.

713
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:59,245
That one right there?
It's $7,000.

714
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:01,288
- $7,000 for a fish?
- ( laughs ): Yep.

715
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:03,215
Kind of makes you want
to stop eating sushi,

716
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:04,874
but I guess you kind of have to.

717
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,733
Hey, you see that
big white one right there?

718
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,483
Swear to you - $1 2,000,
gift from Oprah.

719
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:13,229
It's a Chamberlain - office-warming gift
from Matthew McConaughey.

720
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,637
Generous gift.

721
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:16,678
( laughs ): Yeah. Right!

722
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:19,500
Don't get me wrong, Matthew is
a tremendously talented individual

723
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,029
and an extremely decent human being,

724
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,557
however, before Jeff
took him on, he was a face.

725
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:24,841
Now he's a name.

726
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,310
( elevator bell dings )

727
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:31,117
Do you hear that?

728
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:35,498
No.

729
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,665
Exactly.

730
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:40,140
( bell dings )

731
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:48,490
Hey, Neal.

732
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:50,760
Neal, I'm gonna impale
your mom on a spike,

733
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:53,413
and I'm gonna feed her dead body
to my dog with syphilis.

734
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:55,207
( laughs ): Aw,Jack, you got me!

735
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,901
NEAL: That guy!

736
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:59,589
It's an inside joke.

737
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:01,863
( sighs ):
So, as you can see,

738
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:04,068
Jeff just really loves Asian shit.

739
00:33:04,171 --> 00:33:05,829
Uh, Candace, is he ready?

740
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,524
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

741
00:33:07,627 --> 00:33:09,798
( quietly): Okay,Joey,
I'm gonna bring your dad in now.

742
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:11,840
Is there anything I can get
you while  you're waiting,

743
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:14,051
Like an orange juice
or a coffee or a Red Bull?

744
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:16,456
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

745
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,745
Wow, it's a great office.

746
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,750
Yeah. Jeff basically designed
the whole thing.

747
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,680
The architect just made the drawings.

748
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:27,046
Jack, stop it.

749
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:28,389
Next you're gonna be telling him

750
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,917
what position I played
for the Bruins.

751
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:30,886
( quietly ): Quarterback.

752
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:32,195
Jeff Megall.

753
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,474
Nick Naylor.

754
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,714
Mr. Naylor's here to see
if we can't get cigarettes

755
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:38,237
- into the hands of somebody
other than the usual RAVs.
- Sure.

756
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,732
- RAVs?
- Russians, Arabs and Villains.

757
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,498
Oh, well, then yes, I guess
that is why I'm here.

758
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,704
Good. I think we can help.

759
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,814
Jeff invented product placement.

760
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,806
NICK: I feel I have to ask, uh...

761
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:51,772
Are you concerned at
all about the, um...

762
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:53,372
about the health element?

763
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:56,227
I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.

764
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,536
I bring creative people together.

765
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,742
Whatever information there is,
exists, it's out there.

766
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:00,990
People will decide for themselves.

767
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:03,428
They should. It's not
my role to decide for them.

768
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,347
It'd be morally presumptuous.

769
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,900
NICK: I could learn a lot
from this man.

770
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,274
Now, what we need is
a smoking role model,

771
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:11,266
a real winner.

772
00:34:11,364 --> 00:34:12,989
Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire.

773
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,106
Right, on two packs a day.

774
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:16,154
Only he can't live
in contemporary society.

775
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:17,120
Why not?

776
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,128
The health issue's way too prevalent.

777
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:21,090
People would constantly
be asking the character

778
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,358
why he's smoking -
and that should go unsaid.

779
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,314
How do you feel about the future?

780
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,515
The future?

781
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,277
Yeah, after the health thing's
blown over.

782
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:30,655
A world
where smokers and nonsmokers

783
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,096
Live together in perfect harmony.

784
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:34,463
Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie
they're looking to make.

785
00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:36,416
Message From Sector Six.

786
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:38,456
All takes place in a space station.

787
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:40,350
They're actively looking
for some co-financing.

788
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,856
So cigarettes in space?

789
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:43,993
It's the final frontier, Nick.

790
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,006
But wouldn't they blow up
in an all-oxygen environment?

791
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,698
Probably.

792
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,288
But it's an easy fix -
one line of dialogue:

793
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:53,279
"Thank God we invented the..."
you know,

794
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:54,620
whatever device.

795
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,508
Brad Pitt.

796
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:58,102
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

797
00:34:58,207 --> 00:34:59,549
They've just finished ravishing

798
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:02,135
each other's bodies
for the first time.

799
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:04,181
They lie naked, suspended in air

800
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:05,661
underneath the heavens.

801
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:08,028
Pitt lights up.

802
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:09,785
He starts blowing smoke rings
all around

803
00:35:09,886 --> 00:35:11,610
Catherine's naked, flawless body,

804
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,743
as the galaxies go whizzing
by over the glass-domed ceiling.

805
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,820
Now, tell me that
doesn't work for you.

806
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:18,170
I'd see that movie.

807
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:19,480
I'd buy the goddamn DVD.

808
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:22,167
You know, if the academy
didn't send them to me for free.

809
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:23,676
You know,

810
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,845
you guys ought to think
about designing a cigarette

811
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,607
to be released simultaneously
with the movie.

812
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,202
Sector Sixes.

813
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:30,803
No one's ever done it
with a cigarette.

814
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:31,988
Wow.

815
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:33,914
Well, where do we go from here?

816
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:36,728
You enjoy the rest of your day
in L.A. with your son

817
00:35:36,828 --> 00:35:38,682
while I find out
the answers to these questions.

818
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:41,299
Hey, where can I get
a bite to eat with my son?

819
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:42,864
You ought to try Nobu's new place.

820
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:45,272
- He only serves food that's white.
- Oh, great.

821
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,629
JOEY: So, you go to an office,

822
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,250
then you go on TV
and talk about cigarettes.

823
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:53,110
Then you fly out to L.A.

824
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:55,576
to talk to some guy who
works with movie stars.

825
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:58,837
- What is that?
- That's my job;, I'm a lobbyist.

826
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:01,490
I know, but did you study to do that?

827
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,982
No. No, I just kind of figured it out.

828
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:06,096
Then can't anyone just do that?

829
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,975
No, it, uh, requires a...

830
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:13,650
a moral flexibility
that goes beyond most people.

831
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:17,429
Do I have flexible morals?

832
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,113
Well, let's say
you became a lawyer, right?

833
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:21,775
And you were asked
to defend a murderer.

834
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,340
Worse than that - a child murderer.

835
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,691
Now,

836
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,659
the law states that every person
deserves a fair trial.

837
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:29,773
Would you defend them?

838
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:31,504
I don't know.
I guess every person

839
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,361
- deserves a fair defense.
- Yeah, well,

840
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:35,502
so do multinational corporations.

841
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:38,769
So, what happens when you're wrong?

842
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,462
( chuckles ):
Well,Joey, I'm never wrong.

843
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,972
But you can't always be right.

844
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,883
Well, if it's your job to be right,
then you're never wrong.

845
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:47,086
But what if you are wrong?

846
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:49,261
Okay, let's say that
you're defending chocolate

847
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:50,641
and I'm defending vanilla.

848
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,042
Now, if l were to say to you,

849
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,921
"Vanilla's the best flavor
ice cream," you'd say...?

850
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:57,994
- "No, chocolate is."
- Exactly.

851
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:59,626
But you can't win that argument.

852
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:02,186
So, I'll ask you -
So you think chocolate

853
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,974
is the end-all and be-all
of ice cream, do you?

854
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:07,049
It's the best ice cream;
I wouldn't order any other.

855
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:08,977
Oh. So it's all chocolate
for you, is it?

856
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:10,601
Yes, chocolate is all I need.

857
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:11,950
Well, I need more than chocolate.

858
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,959
And for that matter,
I need more than vanilla.

859
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,756
I believe that we need
freedom and choice

860
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,247
when it comes to our ice cream,
and that, Joey Naylor,

861
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,814
that is the definition of liberty.

862
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,776
But that's not what
we're talking about.

863
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,175
Ah, but that's what
I'm talking about.

864
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:27,087
- But... you didn't prove that vanilla's the best.
- I didn't have to.

865
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,901
I proved that you're wrong -
and if you're wrong, I'm right.

866
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,928
But you still didn't

867
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:32,038
convince me.

868
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:33,420
'Cause I'm not after you.

869
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,683
I'm after them.

870
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:47,374
( phone ringing )

871
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,517
Hello?

872
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,435
Thought I'd give you a little update.

873
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,420
Jeff. You still at the office?

874
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,939
Do you know what time it is
in Tokyo right now?

875
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,736
- No.
- 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

876
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:03,560
It's the future, Nick.

877
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,374
Anyway, for Pitt to smoke,

878
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:08,615
it's $1 0 million;
for the pair, it's 25.

879
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:11,749
25??!. Usually when I buy two
of something, I get a discount.

880
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:12,997
What's the extra five for?

881
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,212
Synergy.

882
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:16,966
These are not stupid people;
they got it right away.

883
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,206
Pitt and Zeta-Jones lighting up
after some cosmic fucking

884
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:21,674
in the bubble suite's
gonna sell a lot of cigarettes.

885
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:23,145
Well, for that kind of money,

886
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:25,065
my people will expect
some very serious smoking.

887
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,591
Can Brad blow smoke rings?

888
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:28,039
I don't have that information.

889
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,764
Well, for $25 million,
we'd want smoke rings.

890
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,295
Oh, one other thing -
you'll be co-financing

891
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:33,256
the picture
with the Sultan of Glutan.

892
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:34,499
The Sultan of Glutan?

893
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:36,543
The one who massacred
and enslaved his own people?

894
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:39,038
Aren't they calling him
the Hitler of the South Pacific?

895
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:41,479
No, I can't speak to that -
All my dealings with him,

896
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:43,235
he's been a very reasonable
and sensitive guy.

897
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:44,514
He's fun. You'll like him.

898
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:45,762
I better run it by my people.

899
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:46,911
No problem.

900
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,325
- ( beep )
- Oh, that's London calling.

901
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:50,463
7;:00 a.m. in the Old Empire.

902
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:52,062
Jeff, when do you sleep?

903
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,345
Sunday.

904
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,106
( line hangs up )

905
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,597
( laughs softly)

906
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:47,288
( groans )

907
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:51,201
( line ringing )

908
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,319
- Operator.
- Yeah, my light is blinking.

909
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:58,523
- There's a package downstairs for you.
- Okay, send it up.

910
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:04,027
Captain, I'm sitting in front
of an open briefcase.

911
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:06,070
I don't suppose this is a raise.

912
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:09,820
Now, Nick, do you know
who Lorne Lutch is?

913
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,545
Yeah, of course.
He's the original Marlboro Man.

914
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:14,014
He's dying.
He was on Sally last week.

915
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,216
Not exactly our biggest fan.

916
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,497
Well, the money's for him.

917
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,119
Now, he has a ranch
out there in California.

918
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:21,815
I want you to bring it to him.

919
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,595
He's a cowboy, sir,
and cowboys don't like bribes.

920
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:27,766
It's not a bribe. No, sir.

921
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,521
You're going out there
on wings of angels, son.

922
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:33,436
You mean we're just going
to give him the money?

923
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,875
Well, I think Christ himself
would say,

924
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,111
"That's mighty white of you boys."

925
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:39,187
No gag agreement?

926
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:41,594
Hopefully, he'll be so damn
overcome with gratitude

927
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,928
he'll... he'll have to shut up.

928
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:56,471
Hey, kiddo, I got to go do
a little bit more work

929
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,618
this afternoon, all right?

930
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:58,584
Can I come?

931
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:00,057
No. Not this time.

932
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,227
But I want to see what you do.

933
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,373
You stay here, okay?

934
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:04,204
What the fuck are you doing here?

935
00:42:04,308 --> 00:42:06,796
Uh... uh...

936
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,525
Do you have a minute?

937
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:15,052
What do you want?

938
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:16,332
Dad!

939
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:17,515
Joey, get back in the car.

940
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:25,767
Just want to talk.

941
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:29,032
All right.

942
00:42:29,138 --> 00:42:30,545
Let's talk.

943
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:48,622
Pearl, we got company.

944
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,217
Mister, you got a lot of nerve
walking in here after...

945
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,548
Honey, why don't you show
this young man some iced tea?

946
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:01,988
I'll be right back, tiger.

947
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:09,929
( hissing )

948
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:20,196
Saw you on...

949
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,649
Weren't you on that TV show?

950
00:43:23,756 --> 00:43:26,440
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

951
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:29,954
You're lucky you made it
out of there alive.

952
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,263
Yeah. Tobacco used to be
all over the television.

953
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:36,192
Now TV is leading the witch hunt.

954
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,087
Strange business.

955
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:40,969
Last year, after I was diagnosed,

956
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:46,368
flew east to attend the
annual stockholders' convention.

957
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:49,961
Stood up and told them
I thought

958
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:54,497
they ought to cut back
on their advertising.

959
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:57,088
You know what your boss said to me?

960
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,135
He said, "We're certainly sorry

961
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,851
"to hear about your medical problem.

962
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:10,247
"However, without
knowing more

963
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:13,856
"of your medical history,

964
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:15,966
we can't comment further."

965
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,577
But then they tried to pretend

966
00:44:20,678 --> 00:44:22,336
I never worked for 'em.

967
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:26,336
Yeah, I got the pay stubs.

968
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:29,088
But, hell,
I was on the damn billboards.

969
00:44:30,757 --> 00:44:32,415
I never
even smoked

970
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:34,458
Marlboro.

971
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:36,932
I smoked Kools.

972
00:44:41,156 --> 00:44:44,155
You look like a nice-enough fella.

973
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,463
What are you doing
working for these assholes?

974
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,266
I'm good at it.

975
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,549
Better at doing this

976
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,244
than I ever was
at doing anything else.

977
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:55,201
Aw, hell, son.

978
00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:57,754
I was good at shooting VC.

979
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:59,746
I didn't make it my career.

980
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:05,467
I suppose we all
got to pay the mortgage.

981
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,225
Your dad always bring
you along like this?

982
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,947
No. I live with my mom.

983
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:15,706
He tell you why he's here today?

984
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:19,486
He said that your husband
was the Marlboro Man.

985
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:20,926
( phone rings )

986
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:24,668
Yeah, well, not anymore.

987
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,174
Hello.

988
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:28,343
Yeah. Hey, can you hold on a second?

989
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,375
You need anything else,
grab it out of the fridge.

990
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,072
So I'm standing here
minding my own business,

991
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:35,963
filling up pill bottles...

992
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:41,725
So you're here to talk me
into shutting up?

993
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:45,689
That what's in that case of yours?

994
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:48,342
Yeah, basically.

995
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:50,843
No, not basically.

996
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,079
That's... that's exactly it.

997
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:56,661
My dignity ain't for sale.

998
00:45:56,765 --> 00:45:59,131
It's not an offer.
It's a gift.

999
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:00,308
Taxes have all been paid.

1000
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:03,030
You get to keep it
no matter what you do.

1001
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:04,506
The idea is that, somehow,

1002
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:07,124
your guilt will prevent you
from bad-mouthing us.

1003
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:08,951
Are you supposed to be

1004
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:10,677
telling me all that?

1005
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:13,201
No, sir. Just apologize,

1006
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:14,997
give you the money, and leave.

1007
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,789
Why are you telling me this?

1008
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:21,113
Because, this way,
you'll take the money.

1009
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,420
Why would I do that?

1010
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:23,470
Because you're mad.

1011
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:24,952
Damn straight I am.

1012
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,998
The first thing you'll do,

1013
00:46:26,105 --> 00:46:28,112
is you'll call the L.A. Times,
and CNN...

1014
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:29,558
- Huh?
- and insist on Bonnie Carlton.

1015
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:30,518
She does really good

1016
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:31,478
controlled outrage.

1017
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:32,755
Tell them, "No Bonnie, no story."

1018
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:33,839
Watch it on MSNBC.

1019
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:35,188
- Okay.
- When they get here,

1020
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:38,103
you open up the case...

1021
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:43,729
and you pour all the cash
out onto the floor.

1022
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:44,846
- Why?
- Trust me.

1023
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:46,096
It'll look more effective that way.

1024
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,093
Don't forget to shake
every last bundle out.

1025
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,359
If you can, you know,
give a cough or two.

1026
00:46:53,463 --> 00:46:56,245
Once it's all
out on the floor,

1027
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:57,750
tell them what you're
going to do with it.

1028
00:46:57,846 --> 00:46:58,774
What am I going to do with it?

1029
00:46:58,871 --> 00:46:59,852
You're going to donate it.

1030
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:02,063
Yeah. Start the Lorne Lutch
Cancer Foundation.

1031
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:03,442
You're going to have
a ranch and a fair

1032
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:06,062
and a 5K.
A 5K is a must. Television...

1033
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:07,147
Wait a minute.

1034
00:47:07,254 --> 00:47:09,392
What about my family?

1035
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,838
But, Lorne, you can't keep the money.

1036
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,369
Why the hell not?

1037
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:16,654
What do you mean?

1038
00:47:16,757 --> 00:47:19,244
Denounce us,
and then keep the blood money?

1039
00:47:19,348 --> 00:47:20,592
I mean, look at it.

1040
00:47:27,572 --> 00:47:28,433
I got to think this over.

1041
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:29,360
Lorne, whoa.

1042
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:31,368
News doesn't work that way.

1043
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:33,416
You can't denounce us next week.

1044
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:42,893
I don't suppose I can
denounce you for half of it.

1045
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:46,222
No, Lorne. Either you keep
all the money,

1046
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,971
or you... you give it all away.

1047
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:01,065
Dad, how did you know

1048
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:02,957
he would take the money?

1049
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,982
You'd have to be crazy
to turn down all that money.

1050
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,446
When I saw he wasn't crazy,
I knew he'd take it.

1051
00:48:11,886 --> 00:48:14,253
Would you have taken it?

1052
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:16,806
If I were him? Sure.

1053
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,845
So would I.

1054
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:32,931
I don't think you understand, sir.

1055
00:48:33,037 --> 00:48:34,281
He's like a wild animal.

1056
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,973
You'll have to be
on your guard at all times.

1057
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:37,025
He has this trick.

1058
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:38,277
Ron, shut up.

1059
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,136
I've tangoed with presidents,
lawyers and Indian chiefs.

1060
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:42,691
I think I can handle Mr. Nick Naylor.

1061
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,487
( clears throat )

1062
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:45,732
DENNIS MI LLER:
All right, welcome back, kids.

1063
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,657
We've got two guests
on the show tonight.

1064
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:49,664
First,joining us
from our Washington studio...

1065
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,625
I must have that tie clip!

1066
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:54,210
...is the senator from
the great state of Vermont.

1067
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:56,387
Please welcome Ortolan Finistirre.

1068
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,351
Welcome, Senator.

1069
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,944
Good to be here, Dennis.

1070
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,675
And, joining us here
in our Los Angeles studio,

1071
00:49:00,778 --> 00:49:02,567
he is the chief spokesperson

1072
00:49:02,665 --> 00:49:04,770
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1073
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:06,303
Quite an august chamber, might I add?

1074
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,100
- Nick Naylor. Nick, welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

1075
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,819
All right, I understand you were
on Joan Lunden's show recently.

1076
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:12,447
Didn't make a lot
of friends over there, did you?

1077
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:13,862
I will say that I don't think

1078
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:15,204
I'll be getting
my annual invitation

1079
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:17,955
to the Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.

1080
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,358
Well, I continue to offer
an open invitation to Mr. Naylor

1081
00:49:20,456 --> 00:49:22,692
to join us in Congress
to talk about the inclusion

1082
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,410
of our new poison label which,
if l might say...

1083
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:27,583
Nick, ready to trek up
the Hill and testify

1084
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:28,832
before Congress?

1085
00:49:28,935 --> 00:49:31,007
Well, I'd love to, Dennis,
but not as long as the senator

1086
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,419
is calling for me to be fired.

1087
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:34,722
It's not exactly
a welcome invitation.

1088
00:49:34,823 --> 00:49:37,244
Yeah. Bit of a mixed message,
Senator.

1089
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,521
Well, not as mixed as the stance
that Big Tobacco has taken

1090
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:41,313
about the dangers
of smoking cigarettes.

1091
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:42,787
- Oh, no.
- Now what are you laughing...?

1092
00:49:42,885 --> 00:49:44,892
You're a wind-up artist.
Give the man his due.

1093
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,720
He's got a bit of a point there,
doesn't he?

1094
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:48,609
Sorry. I just can't
help myself, Dennis.

1095
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:50,302
I... I... I'm just tickled by the idea

1096
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,030
of the gentleman from Vermont

1097
00:49:52,132 --> 00:49:54,587
calling me a hypocrite
when, uh... this same man,

1098
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,480
in one day, held a press
conference where he called

1099
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,969
for the American tobacco fields
to be slashed and burned,

1100
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:00,603
then he jumped on a private jet

1101
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:03,096
and flew down to Farm Aid
where he rode a tractor on stage

1102
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:06,073
- Oh, come on.
- as he bemoaned the downfall
of the American farmer.

1103
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:07,902
Care to comment, Senator?

1104
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:09,858
He... I... No.

1105
00:50:09,954 --> 00:50:12,093
Eloquent in its brevity.

1106
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:13,274
Emotional issue.

1107
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:14,556
Let's take some phone calls now.

1108
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:16,862
Herndon, Virginia.
Go ahead. You're on the show.

1109
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:19,351
MAN: Dennis, has anyone ever
announced that they're going

1110
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:21,148
to kill someone live on your show?

1111
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,348
My demo's been called quirky
but, no, at this point,

1112
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:26,456
we're not skewing
to the emotionally unstable.

1113
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:28,601
Then it's your lucky day.

1114
00:50:28,705 --> 00:50:30,297
Because I'm here to tell
you that, within a week,

1115
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:32,888
we're going to dispatch
Mr. Naylor from this planet

1116
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:36,537
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused in the world.

1117
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,582
( click )

1118
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,548
As I said, emotional issue.
We're going to break now.

1119
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:44,346
I got to fire a call screener.

1120
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,579
Let's go.

1121
00:51:40,345 --> 00:51:41,654
( chuckling )

1122
00:51:41,753 --> 00:51:43,062
( moans )

1123
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:48,338
This is Nick Naylor
telling you kids,

1124
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,506
"Don't do drugs, smoke cigarettes."

1125
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,720
That's really great.

1126
00:51:52,824 --> 00:51:54,384
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

1127
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:56,527
New idea:

1128
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:58,901
cigarettes for the homeless.

1129
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,047
We'll call them "hobos."

1130
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:01,428
( chuckling )

1131
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:02,836
Uh, that's awful.

1132
00:52:02,935 --> 00:52:04,397
Any better than "Sector Sixes"?

1133
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:06,390
Right.

1134
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:09,204
Oh, my God, Nick, you're on TV.

1135
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:10,230
( TV playing )

1136
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,847
"Lobbyist on the lookout."

1137
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,016
You got to be kidding me.

1138
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:20,783
I want to fuck you
while I watch you on TV.

1139
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,544
And they call me sick.

1140
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:23,506
Hurry.

1141
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:25,514
Before your segment ends.

1142
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:27,475
All right.

1143
00:52:33,012 --> 00:52:35,052
Tell me more about Los Angeles, baby.

1144
00:52:35,156 --> 00:52:36,268
Huh?

1145
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:42,030
NICK: He says he wants
to trail me everywhere,

1146
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:43,243
I said, "Who's paying for it??"

1147
00:52:43,347 --> 00:52:44,776
He says the tobacco company's
paying for it.

1148
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:46,345
I said, "I don't need a bodyguard."

1149
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:47,945
I'm a man of the people.

1150
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:49,839
Rock on, Kennedy.

1151
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:51,564
Listen, we're all going to
need bodyguards soon enough.

1152
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,389
Did you see the coverage
the fetal alcohol people

1153
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,504
got themselves over this weekend?

1154
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,366
They made it seem like
we were encouraging

1155
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,545
pregnant women to drink.

1156
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,697
I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped

1157
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,078
on my way to work this morning.

1158
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,526
I don't think people from
the alcoholic beverage industry

1159
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:05,543
need to worry about
being kidnapped just yet.

1160
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:08,615
Pardon me?

1161
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,964
Look, I mean,

1162
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:11,973
nothing personal,
but tobacco generates

1163
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,218
a little more heat than alcohol.

1164
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,727
Oh, this is news.

1165
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:19,303
My product puts away 475,000 a year.

1166
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:21,960
Oh, okay, now 475 is a legit number.

1167
00:53:22,063 --> 00:53:23,241
Okay, 435,000.

1168
00:53:23,343 --> 00:53:24,357
That's 1,200 a day.

1169
00:53:24,463 --> 00:53:25,739
How many alcohol-related deaths
a year?

1170
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,878
- Well, does that...
- 1 00,000 tops?

1171
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:31,463
That's, what, 270 a day?

1172
00:53:31,566 --> 00:53:32,679
Wowee.

1173
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:35,051
270 people, a tragedy.

1174
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,059
Excuse me if I don't exactly see
terrorists getting excited

1175
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,726
about kidnapping anyone
from the alcohol industry.

1176
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:40,040
- Well, you haven't even
- Okay,

1177
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:41,897
- taken into account the number of deaths
- let's just

1178
00:53:41,997 --> 00:53:44,582
- breathe.
- How many gun deaths a year in the U.S.?

1179
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:46,343
1 1,000.

1180
00:53:46,444 --> 00:53:48,681
1 1,000, are you kidding me?

1181
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,635
30 a day.

1182
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:52,106
That's less than passenger car
mortalities.

1183
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:53,731
No terrorist would bother
with either of you.

1184
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:08,549
Okay, look...
stupid argument.

1185
00:54:08,651 --> 00:54:10,593
I'll say.

1186
00:54:10,698 --> 00:54:13,545
I'm sure both of you warrant
vigilante justice.

1187
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:15,333
Thank you.

1188
00:54:21,034 --> 00:54:22,659
( motor revs )

1189
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:24,167
( tires screech )

1190
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:28,831
( grunting, groaning )

1191
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,529
( engine racing,
overlapping voices )

1192
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:36,545
Hey... please.
Stop... hey.

1193
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,695
Who are you guys?

1194
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,360
( tires screeching )

1195
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,651
GIRL: And freedom means
that we can do what we want.

1196
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:46,020
And that's really important.

1197
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,566
Because otherwise,
we couldn't be free.

1198
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:53,532
And that's why America is
the best government in the world.

1199
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,132
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

1200
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:57,823
Hey, no need for that,
no need for that.

1201
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,234
Whoa, whoa, hey.

1202
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,260
Hey, wait.

1203
00:55:00,357 --> 00:55:01,502
Can we get a dialogue going here?

1204
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:04,256
Nick, we want you
to stop killing people.

1205
00:55:04,357 --> 00:55:06,015
So many people.

1206
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:07,610
Half a million people a year
in the U.S.

1207
00:55:07,717 --> 00:55:09,342
That, there's no data
to support that.

1208
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:11,484
Nick... you're not on TV anymore.

1209
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:16,381
Okay, Joey, it's your turn.

1210
00:55:18,884 --> 00:55:20,094
Hey!

1211
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,537
Nick, how much do you smoke a day?

1212
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:23,129
Hey, what are you doing?

1213
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:25,405
According to the box,
each one of those patches

1214
00:55:25,506 --> 00:55:27,578
contains 21 milligrams of nicotine.

1215
00:55:27,682 --> 00:55:28,609
That's, like, what?

1216
00:55:28,706 --> 00:55:30,048
One pack?

1217
00:55:30,147 --> 00:55:32,350
Our industry has been working
hand in hand with...

1218
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,304
Nick! Just listen, all right?

1219
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:35,895
What makes America
the best government?

1220
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:38,205
The passion that doesn't exist
anywhere in the world.

1221
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:40,127
Says here there are
many adverse reactions

1222
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:41,240
from those things.

1223
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:43,167
Let's see, "arrhythmia,

1224
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:44,672
"constipation, dyspepsia,

1225
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:47,190
- "nausea...
- My industry does $48 billion in revenue.

1226
00:55:47,296 --> 00:55:48,922
pharyngitis, sinusitis..."

1227
00:55:49,024 --> 00:55:51,741
Sure you can call it capitalism,
a free market,

1228
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,400
a celebration of tariff breakdowns...

1229
00:55:53,503 --> 00:55:56,056
"dysmenorrhea..."

1230
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,047
I don't even want to know
what that means.

1231
00:55:58,143 --> 00:55:59,833
Hey, look, I guess you could
start by, you know,

1232
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:01,658
asking for five million,
working your way up from there.

1233
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03,133
But I don't want any money, Nick.

1234
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:04,125
Well, what do you want?

1235
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:05,466
I mean, I'm all ears here.

1236
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:08,566
I have another word for it -

1237
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,848
Love.

1238
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,511
What does any man want?

1239
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:13,108
The love of a woman,

1240
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:14,359
crisp bacon...

1241
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:19,130
an average life span over 80 years.

1242
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:21,498
Oh, Nick...

1243
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:23,484
( filtered applause )

1244
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,555
...you don't look so good.

1245
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:33,975
WOMAN:
lf you should smell smoke,

1246
00:56:34,075 --> 00:56:36,442
please dial zero for the operator.

1247
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:40,499
Before leaving the room,
check the door for heat.

1248
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:43,156
Find your nearest
emergency exit,

1249
00:56:43,258 --> 00:56:47,153
then soak a washcloth
and cover your nose and mouth.

1250
00:56:48,474 --> 00:56:50,579
Do not remove your washcloth.

1251
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:54,293
Try at all times to avoid
breathing in the smoke.

1252
00:56:54,394 --> 00:56:57,524
If necessary, crawl on
your hands and knees

1253
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,829
to avoid the inhalation of smoke.

1254
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:01,554
Do not be alarmed.

1255
00:57:01,657 --> 00:57:03,860
There are still
no conclusive studies

1256
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:06,579
that link smoking to emphysema.

1257
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,055
( machine beeping )

1258
00:57:12,856 --> 00:57:14,798
( monotone ) : You woke up.

1259
00:57:14,903 --> 00:57:16,976
N I CK:
Perhaps a bad choice of inflection.

1260
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:20,592
Is she implying that l
could've just as easily not?

1261
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,495
I was so scared.

1262
00:57:32,598 --> 00:57:33,808
Hey, Joey.

1263
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,251
( sighs heavily )

1264
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:36,559
What happened?

1265
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,279
No nonsmoker
could've ever withstood

1266
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:41,291
the amount of nicotine
you had in your bloodstream.

1267
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:43,284
Hate to say it, but...

1268
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,835
cigarettes saved your life.

1269
00:57:48,021 --> 00:57:49,482
Can I quote you on that, doc?

1270
00:57:49,588 --> 00:57:51,759
You're a real trooper, my boy.

1271
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,616
Hey, Captain,

1272
00:57:53,716 --> 00:57:54,992
where are you?

1273
00:57:55,092 --> 00:57:56,750
Winston-Salem General.

1274
00:57:58,195 --> 00:58:00,529
Damn heart failing me again.

1275
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:02,285
I thought we could be roommates.

1276
00:58:02,386 --> 00:58:03,564
Nick, before
we get sidetracked,

1277
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,292
there is one thing.

1278
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:07,783
All right, don't get
all dramatic on me, doc.

1279
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,832
You can't smoke.

1280
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:14,472
That's no problem.

1281
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:16,039
I've quit before.

1282
00:58:16,145 --> 00:58:17,967
I did during the pregnancy.

1283
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:19,080
How long, you think?

1284
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:21,160
I don't think you understand.

1285
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,720
It's a miracle you came
out of this alive.

1286
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:25,351
Any smoking-one cigarette -

1287
00:58:25,457 --> 00:58:27,464
could put you right back
into a paralytic state.

1288
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:30,056
Your body just can't handle it.

1289
00:58:35,152 --> 00:58:37,061
Nick, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

1290
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:38,923
but we got a camera crew
waiting out there.

1291
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:40,965
If we want to make
the evening news...

1292
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,525
You want to unhook me here?

1293
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:47,372
This just goes to prove what
I've been saying for so long.

1294
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:51,431
These nicotine patches
are just deadly.

1295
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,224
Smoking saved my life.

1296
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:55,813
Considering your condition,
will you still be able to appear

1297
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:57,892
before Senator Finistirre's
subcommittee hearing

1298
00:58:57,997 --> 00:58:59,938
on the usage of poison labels
on cigarette packaging?

1299
00:59:00,045 --> 00:59:01,571
Oh, I think now more than ever

1300
00:59:01,677 --> 00:59:03,433
it is imperative that I be there.

1301
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:05,474
Nothing will keep me from testifying.

1302
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,514
Fucking kidnapping.

1303
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,961
I don't understand, sir.

1304
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,191
Aren't we considering
the kidnapping a good thing?

1305
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:14,884
Well, he didn't die.

1306
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:17,223
He was almost killed, sir.

1307
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:18,435
That's the point.

1308
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:20,546
Now he looks like a victim,
lucky bastard.

1309
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:24,418
The way I heard it,
D.C. police found you naked

1310
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:26,115
laying in Lincoln's crotch

1311
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:29,763
covered in nicotine patches
with a sign across your chest

1312
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,255
- that said...
- He doesn't need to hear the details.

1313
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:34,597
It was some pretty fucked up shit.

1314
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:35,624
Shh!

1315
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:36,670
How are you feeling?

1316
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:39,973
I don't know.

1317
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:42,494
First time I'm thinking these
cigarettes are pretty dangerous.

1318
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:44,488
You might be right about that.

1319
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:45,958
What are you doing?

1320
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:49,511
It may be small,
but it'll do the trick.

1321
00:59:49,608 --> 00:59:50,688
One shot, bam.

1322
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:52,962
Listen, Nick is not
going to shoot anyone.

1323
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:54,143
Cool.

1324
00:59:54,247 --> 00:59:55,141
Yeah, huh?

1325
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:56,416
I mean, uh...

1326
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:58,275
guns are to be treated with
respect, you understand that?

1327
00:59:58,374 --> 01:00:00,262
You'll make a great father.

1328
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,667
Thanks.

1329
01:00:03,815 --> 01:00:05,375
( applause )

1330
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:06,907
Hey, there he is!

1331
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:08,639
Hey, he's back!

1332
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,116
Hey!

1333
01:00:10,214 --> 01:00:11,588
Welcome back.

1334
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:13,693
- You okay?
- Great.

1335
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:15,455
Good, 'cause you're booked on
all the Sunday talk shows.

1336
01:00:15,557 --> 01:00:18,240
For once we got public sympathy
on our side.

1337
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:20,893
We can start our own little
celebrity victim tour.

1338
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:23,266
I mean, we couldn't have planned
this thing better ourselves.

1339
01:00:23,365 --> 01:00:25,120
Oh, maybe next time
I can lose a lung.

1340
01:00:26,692 --> 01:00:29,059
Oh. Uh, I heard the, uh...

1341
01:00:29,156 --> 01:00:31,260
Heather Holloway article
is coming out tomorrow.

1342
01:00:31,363 --> 01:00:33,218
Really?

1343
01:00:33,315 --> 01:00:34,395
Yeah, anything I should be
worried about?

1344
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:36,865
Uh, yeah, the Cancer Association.

1345
01:00:36,963 --> 01:00:38,272
Apparently, they have it in for us.

1346
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:40,509
Fuckers.

1347
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:51,425
What?

1348
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:54,074
I got a call from the paper.

1349
01:00:54,177 --> 01:00:56,250
Really?
What'd they want?

1350
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:59,288
They wanted the correct spelling
of my name and job title.

1351
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:01,149
You didn't tell her
about us, did you?

1352
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:02,841
Who?

1353
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:04,089
Heather?

1354
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:05,981
No.

1355
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,785
I mean, maybe in passing, I...

1356
01:01:09,888 --> 01:01:11,448
In passing.

1357
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,729
Oh, God, he fucked her.

1358
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:14,141
I tried to warn you.

1359
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,573
Hey, he didn't fuck her.
You didn't fuck her, did you?

1360
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,317
When?

1361
01:01:20,414 --> 01:01:21,308
In passing.

1362
01:01:21,406 --> 01:01:22,486
Look, she's a really nice girl.

1363
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:23,572
Oh, God.

1364
01:01:23,678 --> 01:01:25,587
We're really fucked.

1365
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:45,847
NICK: "Nick Naylor,
lead spokesman for big tobacco,

1366
01:01:45,948 --> 01:01:48,850
"would have you believe he
thinks cigarettes are harmless.

1367
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:52,251
"But really, he's doing it
for the mortgage.

1368
01:01:52,347 --> 01:01:56,208
BAILEY: The MOD squad - meaning,
of course, merchants of death -

1369
01:01:56,315 --> 01:01:59,446
is comprised of Polly Bailey
of the Moderation Council

1370
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:00,888
and Bobby Jay Bliss

1371
01:02:00,986 --> 01:02:04,760
of the gun business's
own advisory group, SAFETY.

1372
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:08,240
BLISS: As explained by Naylor,
the sole purpose of their meetings

1373
01:02:08,346 --> 01:02:10,168
is to compete for
the highest death toll

1374
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:11,760
as they compare strategies

1375
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:14,767
on how to dupe the American people.

1376
01:02:14,873 --> 01:02:17,361
MEGALL:
The film, Message from Sector Six,

1377
01:02:17,464 --> 01:02:19,569
would emphasize the sex appeal
of cigarettes

1378
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:21,582
in a way that only floating, nude,

1379
01:02:21,689 --> 01:02:25,201
copulating Hollywood stars could.

1380
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:28,402
LUTCH: This did not stop Nick
from bribing the dying man

1381
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:31,351
with a suitcase of cash
to keep quiet on the subject

1382
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,407
of his recent lung cancer diagnosis.

1383
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:38,893
JILL: Nick's own son, Joey Naylor,
seems to be being groomed

1384
01:02:38,998 --> 01:02:40,908
for the job as he joins his father

1385
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:43,829
on the majority of his trips.

1386
01:02:48,918 --> 01:02:50,128
( beep )

1387
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,237
RECEPTIONIST:
I have Heather Holloway on line one.

1388
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:53,421
Heather.

1389
01:02:53,525 --> 01:02:55,248
Hey, Nick, what did you think?

1390
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:56,941
Heather, uh... I...

1391
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:59,434
I mean, there's a lot
of information in here, Heather,

1392
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,969
that is off the record.

1393
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:03,247
You never said anything
about off the record.

1394
01:03:03,348 --> 01:03:07,603
I presumed anything said while
I was inside you was privileged.

1395
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,106
Nick...

1396
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:11,243
If you wanted to talk on a plane

1397
01:03:11,347 --> 01:03:14,576
or at a movie or over dinner,
that would have been fine.

1398
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:16,617
But you wanted to fuck.

1399
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:18,096
That's fine by me.

1400
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,136
You used me.

1401
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:21,803
Oh, Nick, come on.

1402
01:03:21,906 --> 01:03:23,848
Now we're being children.

1403
01:03:23,954 --> 01:03:25,928
Look, we both love our jobs.

1404
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:28,489
I'm just a reporter,
and you're just a lobbyist.

1405
01:03:28,593 --> 01:03:30,732
How can you do this to me?

1406
01:03:32,913 --> 01:03:34,855
For the mortgage.

1407
01:03:42,928 --> 01:03:43,856
Bitch.

1408
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:44,966
Whore.

1409
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,170
You should have been
more careful, Nick.

1410
01:03:48,272 --> 01:03:50,955
You've destroyed all the good
will created by your kidnapping.

1411
01:03:51,055 --> 01:03:52,299
Well, we'll work up a rebuttal.

1412
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:55,017
Heather Holloway isn't
the only reporter in town.

1413
01:03:55,118 --> 01:03:56,231
No, there isn't going
to be any rebuttal.

1414
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:57,349
What do you mean?

1415
01:03:57,454 --> 01:03:58,731
Don't talk to anyone.

1416
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,521
We're pulling you
from the congressional hearing.

1417
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:02,116
No, no, no. You can't pull me
from the congressional hearing.

1418
01:04:02,222 --> 01:04:03,499
All you'll be doing is giving
credence to her article.

1419
01:04:03,597 --> 01:04:04,775
I'm ready to testify.

1420
01:04:04,878 --> 01:04:06,470
Look, Nick, half of my job
is damage control.

1421
01:04:06,574 --> 01:04:07,621
Today, that consists

1422
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:10,246
of distancing ourselves
from you entirely -

1423
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:13,927
letting you take
all the heat on this article.

1424
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:15,687
Your job relied on your ability
to keep secrets

1425
01:04:15,788 --> 01:04:16,836
and spin the truth.

1426
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,566
I just cannot imagine a way

1427
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:20,228
in which you could have fucked
up more.

1428
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:23,049
There's just no way I could
possibly keep you on staff.

1429
01:04:23,148 --> 01:04:24,872
Then I assume you've run this
by the captain.

1430
01:04:24,971 --> 01:04:26,826
Captain died this morning.

1431
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,842
( mellow, jazzy intro plays )

1432
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:44,996
( man singing slowly )

1433
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:13,954
( singing ends )

1434
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:22,270
( beep )

1435
01:05:22,374 --> 01:05:24,228
( over answering machine ): Mr. Naylor,
this is Pete in Security from the Academy.

1436
01:05:24,326 --> 01:05:26,114
Your things are waiting for you

1437
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,806
at the information kiosk
in the lobby.

1438
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,055
Look, if you don't pick your
stuff up by Friday,

1439
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:31,393
we're instructed to throw it out.

1440
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:32,987
( beep )

1441
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:35,842
Mr. Naylor, this is Special
Agent Johnson with the FBI.

1442
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:38,493
Having not found any leads in
your kidnapping investigation,

1443
01:05:38,596 --> 01:05:39,840
we're going to be
handing over the case

1444
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:40,955
to the local D. C. police,

1445
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,164
so please refer to them
in the future

1446
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:44,795
for any updates and questions.

Nick, Jack in Jeff Megall's office.

1449
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:52,546
Jeff really enjoyed
meeting you the other day

1450
01:05:52,643 --> 01:05:54,617
and he's just... he's torn up
about the fact

1451
01:05:54,723 --> 01:05:56,413
that you two couldn't find
a project to work on.

1452
01:05:56,514 --> 01:05:58,554
He's really just... I don't know.

1453
01:05:58,658 --> 01:06:00,349
So, listen,
but we should hang, at least,

1454
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,338
so you drop me a line
whenever you're in town.

1455
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:05,750
Uh... my e-mail is, uh...

[ Man Singing ]

1457
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:12,149
( knocking on door )

1458
01:06:16,928 --> 01:06:18,935
( pounding on door )

1459
01:06:20,704 --> 01:06:22,264
Who is it?

1460
01:06:22,368 --> 01:06:24,190
JILL: It's me, Nick.

1461
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:28,469
Jill, this is a bad time.

1462
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:30,102
Let me in.

1463
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:31,287
( sighs softly )

1464
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:33,081
No.

1465
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:36,030
I brought someone
who needs to talk to you.

1466
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:42,265
Hey, buddy.

1467
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,220
Hey, Dad.

1468
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:46,259
Coke in the fridge.

1469
01:06:52,444 --> 01:06:57,016
So, this Heather Holloway,
she must have been pretty hot.

1470
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:59,898
Yes. She's pretty hot.

1471
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:01,938
Don't take it so hard.

1472
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:04,563
A few flaws can be appealing.

1473
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:05,714
Makes you human.

1474
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,194
Who wants to be human?

1475
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,601
Well, I know one person

1476
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:11,546
who still thinks you're a God.

1477
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:29,971
Why did you tell that reporter
all your secrets?

1478
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,601
You're too young to understand.

1479
01:07:35,704 --> 01:07:38,671
Mom says it's because
you have dependency issues

1480
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:40,204
and it was all just
a matter of time

1481
01:07:40,312 --> 01:07:42,384
before you threw it all away
on some tramp.

1482
01:07:42,488 --> 01:07:45,651
Well, that's one theory.

1483
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:47,507
Why are you hiding from everyone?

1484
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:52,975
It has something to do with
being generally hated right now.

1485
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:54,507
But it's your job to be
generally hated.

1486
01:07:54,615 --> 01:07:57,265
It's more complicated
than that, Joey.

1487
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:59,537
You're just making it
more complicated

1488
01:07:59,637 --> 01:08:01,131
so that you can feel
sorry for yourself.

1489
01:08:01,238 --> 01:08:02,896
Like you always said,

1490
01:08:02,998 --> 01:08:06,161
"If you want an easy job,
go work for the Red Cross."

1491
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:07,821
You're a lobbyist.

1492
01:08:07,925 --> 01:08:10,892
Your job is to be right, and
you're the best at what you do.

1493
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:13,810
You're the sultan of spin.

1494
01:08:14,964 --> 01:08:16,306
"Sultan of spin"?

1495
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:17,866
Mom subscribes to Newsweek.

1496
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:20,528
Who cares what the Brads

1497
01:08:20,628 --> 01:08:21,610
of the world think?

1498
01:08:21,715 --> 01:08:22,925
He's not my dad.

1499
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:25,970
You are.

1500
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:29,165
NICK: And right there,
looking into Joey's eyes,

1501
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:32,528
it all came back in a rush.

1502
01:08:32,626 --> 01:08:34,993
Why I do what I do -
defending the defenseless,

1503
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:37,294
protecting the disenfranchised
corporations

1504
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:39,368
that have been abandoned
by their very own consumers -

1505
01:08:39,474 --> 01:08:41,645
the logger...

1506
01:08:41,746 --> 01:08:43,884
the sweatshop foreman...

1507
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,928
the oil driller...

1508
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:48,105
the land mine developer...

1509
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:51,372
the baby seal poacher...

1510
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:52,814
Baby seal poacher?

1511
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:54,221
Even I think that's kind of cruel.

1512
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,327
All right, you're missing the point.

1513
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,122
I must be, because I thought
you were apologizing.

1514
01:08:58,224 --> 01:08:59,151
I'm getting to that.

1515
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,938
When?

1516
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,406
Look.

1517
01:09:03,503 --> 01:09:08,140
The two of you, you're
basically my only friends,

1518
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,443
and the last thing that
I would ever want to do

1519
01:09:10,543 --> 01:09:12,168
would be to hurt you.

1520
01:09:12,271 --> 01:09:14,059
And, I can only imagine...

1521
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,140
Why are you smiling?

1522
01:09:15,246 --> 01:09:16,839
Why is he smiling?

1523
01:09:16,942 --> 01:09:18,949
He won a hundred bucks off of you.

1524
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:21,955
I bet Polly you'd spill the beans
to that reporter.

1525
01:09:22,062 --> 01:09:24,428
That goes against everything
that we stand for.

1526
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:26,696
Oh, please! You've ratted us out
to some reporter with tits!

1527
01:09:26,797 --> 01:09:28,619
Glorious tits.

1528
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:30,920
Only after you created a betting
pool testing my incompetence?

1529
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:32,995
Do you have any idea the beating
I'm taking at Moderation?

1530
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,718
Well, look, I'm sure both of
you are under a lot of scrutiny.

1531
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,925
You know what?
You can stop using the plural.

1532
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:41,094
The guys at Safety actually liked
the name "Merchants of Death."

1533
01:09:41,195 --> 01:09:42,439
They're gonna have
some bumper stickers made up.

1534
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,362
I'll make sure you get one.

1535
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,314
Thank you.

1536
01:09:48,395 --> 01:09:50,151
That is disgusting.

1537
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,125
It's American.

1538
01:09:53,226 --> 01:09:54,720
Can I have a bite?

1539
01:09:54,826 --> 01:09:56,287
Mmm.

1540
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:58,368
So I guess this means

1541
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:01,572
you won't be appearing
at Finistirre's subcommittee.

1542
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:03,812
Hmm. I was kind of looking
forward to it, too.

1543
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:06,564
It's kind of cool in
a Jimmy Stewart sort of way.

1544
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:09,086
More like an Ollie North sort of way.

1545
01:10:09,193 --> 01:10:11,331
Finistirre would have
torn you a new asshole

1546
01:10:11,433 --> 01:10:12,894
in a House of Parliament, no less.

1547
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,244
I could have taken him.

1548
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,937
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah? What would you have said?

1549
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:17,217
I don't know.

1550
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,418
I'd just like him to feel
immeasurable pain,

1551
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,926
humiliation.

1552
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,430
Yeah, well, that would be
kind of tough.

1553
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:24,836
I mean, he's already a Senator.

1554
01:10:24,935 --> 01:10:26,593
( chuckles )

1555
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:28,800
I mean, how would you get
back in even if you wanted to?

1556
01:10:32,678 --> 01:10:33,790
Uh-oh.

1557
01:10:39,493 --> 01:10:40,737
You're not gonna like this.

1558
01:10:40,838 --> 01:10:43,620
( reporters clamoring )

1559
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:44,797
Hello.
Thanks very much for coming.

1560
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:47,137
First of all, I'd like to say
a few words

1561
01:10:47,237 --> 01:10:48,317
to all the people who
are mentioned

1562
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:50,396
in the recent newspaper article.

1563
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,929
Please take comfort in knowing

1564
01:10:52,036 --> 01:10:55,648
that I will not rest until
your names are cleared.

1565
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:57,755
This experience has taught me
an important lesson -

1566
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,583
having sexual affairs
with members of the press

1567
01:10:59,684 --> 01:11:01,113
is just unfair.

1568
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:02,975
It's not unfair to me, mind you,

1569
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:06,391
but to all the people in my life
whose only crime is knowing me.

1570
01:11:06,499 --> 01:11:09,565
It was your names, not mine,
that suffered

1571
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:12,088
from a meaningless affair
with a seductress

1572
01:11:12,194 --> 01:11:15,510
in the form of a young
brunette Washington reporter

1573
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:17,112
whose name I won't mention

1574
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:19,073
because I have dignity.

1575
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,795
( reporters clamoring )

1576
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:21,880
Mr. Naylor!

1577
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:23,708
Are you still planning
on testifying

1578
01:11:23,809 --> 01:11:25,816
at tomorrow's subcommittee
hearing on tobacco?

1579
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,092
I'm glad you asked that question.

1580
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:29,883
There have been wide accusations of me
dropping out of tomorrow's hearing.

1581
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,162
Let it be known

1582
01:11:31,265 --> 01:11:32,923
that unless Senator Finistirre
has withdrawn my invitation

1583
01:11:33,024 --> 01:11:34,399
- to speak, it is my plan
- It's called a subpoena.

1584
01:11:34,496 --> 01:11:36,252
to be in Congress tomorrow
to share my knowledge

1585
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:38,523
of big tobacco and all those
who enjoy its products.

1586
01:11:38,624 --> 01:11:39,834
Thank you very much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1587
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:41,462
( all clamoring )

1588
01:11:41,568 --> 01:11:43,455
( TV shuts off)

1589
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:44,696
( phone rings )

1590
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:49,433
( cacophony of phones ringing )

1591
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,705
( indistinct, distorted
roaring and shutters clicking )

1592
01:12:37,049 --> 01:12:39,537
Still l feel like Jimmy Stewart?

1593
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:51,053
Good.

1594
01:12:52,312 --> 01:12:55,214
( beeping )

1595
01:12:57,303 --> 01:12:58,710
( electronic squealing )

1596
01:12:58,808 --> 01:12:59,855
Why don't you al I go ahead?

1597
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,421
This could be a while.

1598
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,001
( electronic squealing
continues )

1599
01:13:06,102 --> 01:13:10,924
If we could, um... if we could
take our seats, please.

1600
01:13:12,214 --> 01:13:13,457
( clears throat )

1601
01:13:13,558 --> 01:13:16,013
Gentlemen, ladies.

1602
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:18,735
If I may call this meeting to order.

1603
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:23,408
We'll do everything we can to
keep things brief and concise

1604
01:13:23,509 --> 01:13:24,970
so that we can all
get out of here on time.

1605
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:28,426
The skull and crossbones
means one thing:

1606
01:13:28,532 --> 01:13:29,939
Poison.

1607
01:13:30,037 --> 01:13:32,622
Thus, the message is quite clear.

1608
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:34,796
Like any other product
that carries the branding,

1609
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:37,998
if you take it, you will die.

1610
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:41,034
Yes, but isn't this overkill?

1611
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:44,270
Why don't we just use words,
as we currently do?

1612
01:13:44,371 --> 01:13:48,015
Something that describes the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

1613
01:13:48,115 --> 01:13:49,097
Well, the American public
is not affected

1614
01:13:49,202 --> 01:13:50,609
by masthead anymore.

1615
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:51,818
They need images.

1616
01:13:51,922 --> 01:13:54,190
We've done studies
which show that consumers react

1617
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:56,745
up to 80% more to imagery
rather than words.

1618
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,093
The stats are there.

1619
01:13:58,193 --> 01:13:59,916
It's just sad

1620
01:14:00,017 --> 01:14:02,253
that the Academy of Tobacco
Studies did not release

1621
01:14:02,353 --> 01:14:03,695
this type of information earlier.

1622
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:06,639
When you say
the Academy of Tobacco Studies,

1623
01:14:06,736 --> 01:14:08,013
you're referring to...

1624
01:14:08,112 --> 01:14:09,192
Yes.

1625
01:14:09,296 --> 01:14:10,954
to the coalition...

1626
01:14:11,056 --> 01:14:11,950
Yes, the coalition.

1627
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,575
The big... big tobacco...

1628
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,890
...that is represented by...

1629
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,169
By, um...

1630
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:17,351
And specifically

1631
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:18,317
Mr...

1632
01:14:18,415 --> 01:14:19,430
Um...

1633
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,062
Mr., uh, Nick Naylor.

1634
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,029
Nick Naylor?

1635
01:14:22,127 --> 01:14:23,055
Thank you very much.

1636
01:14:24,974 --> 01:14:25,836
WITNESS:
The current use

1637
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:27,495
of words instead of imagery

1638
01:14:27,598 --> 01:14:31,046
is an obvious move against
the non-English-speaking population

1639
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:32,557
of the United States.

1640
01:14:32,654 --> 01:14:34,693
The skull and crossbones

1641
01:14:34,798 --> 01:14:38,027
speak loudly in all languages.

1642
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,613
By not using it,
they're saying

1643
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:44,579
they want those who can't
read English to die.

1644
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:46,375
Hmm. Senor Herrera,

1645
01:14:46,477 --> 01:14:49,194
could you clarify "they"?

1646
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:50,536
NICK:
Let it be known,

1647
01:14:50,636 --> 01:14:53,002
the public beating
has not gone out of style.

1648
01:15:00,043 --> 01:15:02,115
Nick Naylor, please step forward.

1649
01:15:11,434 --> 01:15:13,954
You go sit with him.

1650
01:15:21,993 --> 01:15:24,862
Please state your name,
address and current occupation.

1651
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:26,049
My name is Nick Naylor.

1652
01:15:26,152 --> 01:15:27,843
I live at 6000
Massachusetts Avenue

1653
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:29,766
and I am currently unemployed,

1654
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:31,904
but until recently,
I was the vice president

1655
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:33,436
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1656
01:15:33,544 --> 01:15:34,405
Mr. Naylor,

1657
01:15:34,504 --> 01:15:37,820
as vice president
of the Academy

1658
01:15:37,927 --> 01:15:39,814
of Tobacco Studies,
what was required of you?

1659
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,089
What did you do?

1660
01:15:41,191 --> 01:15:44,540
I informed the public
of all the research performed

1661
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:46,556
in the investigation
on the effects of tobacco.

1662
01:15:46,662 --> 01:15:47,742
Mm-hmm,
and what,

1663
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:50,301
so far,
has the Academy concluded

1664
01:15:50,406 --> 01:15:52,740
in their investigation
into the effects of tobacco?

1665
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:55,009
Well, many things, actually.

1666
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:56,800
Why, just the other day
they uncovered evidence

1667
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:58,657
that smoking can offset
Parkinson's disease.

1668
01:15:58,757 --> 01:16:00,415
( amused buzz )

1669
01:16:00,517 --> 01:16:01,694
I'm sure the health
community

1670
01:16:01,797 --> 01:16:02,877
is thrilled.

1671
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,762
Mr. Naylor, who provides
the financial backing

1672
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,747
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies?

1673
01:16:07,844 --> 01:16:10,975
Uh... Conglomerated Tobacco.

1674
01:16:11,076 --> 01:16:12,701
That's the cigarette companies.

1675
01:16:12,804 --> 01:16:14,778
For the most part, yes.

1676
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:17,666
Do you think that...

1677
01:16:17,763 --> 01:16:19,651
might affect their priorities?

1678
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:21,023
No,just as I'm sure

1679
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:22,878
campaign contributions
don't affect yours.

1680
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:23,960
Ohh.

1681
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:25,757
( all laughing )

1682
01:16:25,858 --> 01:16:28,956
Senators, Mr. Naylor is not here
to testify on the goings-on

1683
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:30,781
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1684
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:32,856
We're here to examine
the possibility

1685
01:16:32,962 --> 01:16:34,303
of a warning logo on cigarettes.

1686
01:16:34,401 --> 01:16:35,328
Now, Mr. Naylor,

1687
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:36,887
I have to ask you,
out of formality,

1688
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:38,880
do you believe that smoking
cigarettes, over time,

1689
01:16:38,977 --> 01:16:42,076
can lead to lung cancer and
other respiratory conditions

1690
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:43,321
such as emphysema?

1691
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,549
Yes.

1692
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,141
In fact, I think you'd be
hard-pressed

1693
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,287
to find someone
who really believes

1694
01:16:51,392 --> 01:16:53,279
that cigarettes are not
potentially harmful.

1695
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:55,514
I mean, show of hands,
who out here thinks

1696
01:16:55,615 --> 01:16:57,044
- that cigarettes aren't dangerous...
- Mr. Naylor.

1697
01:16:57,151 --> 01:17:00,151
There's no need for theatrics.

1698
01:17:00,255 --> 01:17:02,710
Sir, I just don't see the point in a warning
label for something people already know.

1699
01:17:02,815 --> 01:17:04,058
The warning symbol

1700
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:07,638
is a reminder, a reminder of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes.

1701
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:09,497
Well, if we want to remind
people of danger,

1702
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:11,060
why don't we slap
a skull and crossbones

1703
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,093
on all Boeing airplanes,

1704
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:13,563
Senator Lothridge?

1705
01:17:13,661 --> 01:17:14,555
And all Fords, Senator Dupree?

1706
01:17:14,654 --> 01:17:16,890
That is ridiculous.

1707
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:19,192
The death toll from airline
and automobile accidents

1708
01:17:19,293 --> 01:17:21,268
doesn't even skim the surface
of cigarettes.

1709
01:17:21,373 --> 01:17:22,388
They don't even compare.

1710
01:17:22,492 --> 01:17:24,467
Oh, this from a senator
who calls Vermont home.

1711
01:17:24,572 --> 01:17:26,612
I don't follow you, Mr. Naylor.

1712
01:17:26,716 --> 01:17:28,309
Well, the real

1713
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:30,867
demonstrated number one killer
in America is cholesterol,

1714
01:17:30,972 --> 01:17:31,920
and here comes
Senator Finistirre,

1715
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:34,166
whose fine state is,
I regret to say,

1716
01:17:34,267 --> 01:17:37,169
clogging the nation's arteries
with Vermont cheddar cheese.

1717
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:38,649
( audience murmuring )

1718
01:17:38,747 --> 01:17:41,365
If we want to talk numbers,
how about the millions of people

1719
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:42,394
dying of heart attacks.

1720
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,701
Perhaps Vermont cheddar

1721
01:17:43,803 --> 01:17:46,072
should come
with a skull and crossbones.

1722
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,926
That is lud...

1723
01:17:48,026 --> 01:17:48,953
The great state of Vermont

1724
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:50,544
will not apologize for its cheese.

1725
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:51,577
Mr. Naylor,

1726
01:17:51,674 --> 01:17:53,103
we are here to discuss cigarettes.

1727
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:56,689
Not planes, not cars - cigarettes.

1728
01:17:56,793 --> 01:17:59,345
Now, as we discussed earlier,
these warning labels

1729
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:02,515
are not for those who know, but
rather for those who don't know.

1730
01:18:02,616 --> 01:18:04,307
( sighs )

1731
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:06,318
What about the children?

1732
01:18:06,424 --> 01:18:08,366
Gentlemen...

1733
01:18:08,472 --> 01:18:10,326
it's called education.

1734
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:12,212
It doesn't come off the side
of a cigarette carton.

1735
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:13,326
It comes from our teachers,

1736
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:15,406
and more importantly, our parents.

1737
01:18:15,511 --> 01:18:18,511
It is the job
of every parent

1738
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:22,095
to warn their children of all
the dangers of the world,

1739
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,654
including cigarettes, so that
one day, when they get older,

1740
01:18:24,758 --> 01:18:26,514
they can choose for themselves.

1741
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,695
I look at my... son

1742
01:18:31,798 --> 01:18:33,139
who...

1743
01:18:33,237 --> 01:18:34,993
was kind enough
to come with me today,

1744
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:37,481
and I can't help but think

1745
01:18:37,589 --> 01:18:39,760
that I am responsible
for his growth

1746
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:41,900
and his development.

1747
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:43,466
And I'm proud of that.

1748
01:18:43,573 --> 01:18:44,783
Well, having
said that,

1749
01:18:44,885 --> 01:18:47,339
would you condone him smoking?

1750
01:18:47,444 --> 01:18:49,680
Well, of course not.
He's not 18.

1751
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,795
That would be illegal.

1752
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,915
( chuckling )

1753
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,026
Yes, I-I heard you deliver
that line on 20-20,

1754
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:55,441
but enough dancing.

1755
01:18:55,539 --> 01:18:57,776
What are you going to do
when he turns 18?

1756
01:18:59,379 --> 01:19:00,873
Come on, Mr. Naylor.

1757
01:19:00,978 --> 01:19:04,393
On his 18th birthday, will
you share a cigarette with him?

1758
01:19:04,498 --> 01:19:06,636
Will you spend
a lovely afternoon,

1759
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:08,810
like one of your ludicrous
cigarette advertisements?

1760
01:19:08,914 --> 01:19:10,375
You seem to have a lot to say

1761
01:19:10,482 --> 01:19:11,758
about how we
should raise our children.

1762
01:19:11,858 --> 01:19:12,785
What of your own?

1763
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,248
What are you
going to do

1764
01:19:15,345 --> 01:19:17,549
when he turns 18?

1765
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:27,401
If he really wants a cigarette,
I'll buy him his first pack.

1766
01:19:27,504 --> 01:19:28,965
( audience mutters softly )

1767
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:34,668
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Naylor. You're excused.

1768
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,604
I'll meet you outside, okay?

1769
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:56,163
Great.

1770
01:19:56,269 --> 01:19:57,349
Well done, my boy.

1771
01:19:57,453 --> 01:19:59,492
Were you in the same room as me?

1772
01:19:59,597 --> 01:20:00,644
The whole personal choice thing?

1773
01:20:00,748 --> 01:20:01,828
They ate that shit up.

1774
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:03,689
( laughing ):
Just checked the whip count.

1775
01:20:03,788 --> 01:20:05,130
That bill is going down in flames.

1776
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:07,944
Your speech was unorthodox,
but you did it, boy.

1777
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:08,905
You crushed the fucker.

1778
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,084
That's good news for you guys.

1779
01:20:10,187 --> 01:20:11,529
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1780
01:20:11,628 --> 01:20:14,410
We're still a team, right?

1781
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:16,395
What about damage control?

1782
01:20:17,835 --> 01:20:19,144
Look, Nick.

1783
01:20:19,243 --> 01:20:22,690
Winston-Salem is ready
to do whatever it takes

1784
01:20:22,795 --> 01:20:24,256
to keep you on board.

1785
01:20:28,521 --> 01:20:32,067
( crowd clamoring )

1786
01:20:32,169 --> 01:20:35,104
Nick, will you continue
fighting for cigarettes?

1787
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:36,485
Of course he will.

1788
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:38,472
This man here is our general.

1789
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:40,259
We're not just gonna let him retire.

1790
01:20:40,361 --> 01:20:41,342
REPORTER:
Is that correct, Nick?

1791
01:20:41,448 --> 01:20:42,877
You're sticking with tobacco?

1792
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,108
NICK: Now, I know what
you're probably thinking.

1793
01:20:50,216 --> 01:20:51,328
What a great opportunity for me

1794
01:20:51,432 --> 01:20:52,958
to teach Joey
how to use leverage against

1795
01:20:53,063 --> 01:20:54,589
a backstabbing boss.

1796
01:20:54,695 --> 01:20:57,990
But I actually meant what
I said about responsibility.

1797
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,567
Some things
are just more important

1798
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:02,783
than paying a mortgage.

1799
01:21:02,886 --> 01:21:05,374
So I did the only responsible
thing I could.

1800
01:21:05,478 --> 01:21:08,129
I turned down the job.

1801
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:10,466
And my timing
couldn't have been better.

1802
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:12,769
Within a few months,
the cigarette companies

1803
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,210
settled
with the American smoker

1804
01:21:14,309 --> 01:21:16,862
to the tune of $246 billion.

1805
01:21:17,988 --> 01:21:20,225
And the Academy
of Tobacco Studies

1806
01:21:20,324 --> 01:21:22,015
was permanently dismantled.

1807
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:24,319
For the first time in decades,

1808
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,046
BR found himself out of work.

1809
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:29,755
Otherwise, not much has changed.

1810
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:31,932
The MOD squad still meets every week.

1811
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:33,279
Nice.

1812
01:21:33,379 --> 01:21:35,550
We even added a few new members.

1813
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:38,333
The things I could learn
from you, Bobby Jay.

1814
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,383
POLLY: Right.

1815
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:40,864
BOBBY JAY:
Stick around. Stick around.

1816
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,580
Senator Finistirre is still
fighting for his causes.

1817
01:21:43,682 --> 01:21:45,373
What do you say
to the people who claim

1818
01:21:45,474 --> 01:21:47,328
you are destroying cinema classics?

1819
01:21:47,425 --> 01:21:48,985
Mmm, no. All
we're doing

1820
01:21:49,089 --> 01:21:50,682
is using
digital technology

1821
01:21:50,785 --> 01:21:53,818
to tastefully update
movies of the past...

1822
01:21:53,921 --> 01:21:55,415
by removing cigarettes.

1823
01:21:55,521 --> 01:21:58,619
I believe that if these
stars were alive today,

1824
01:21:58,721 --> 01:22:01,055
they would agree that
we're doing the right thing.

1825
01:22:01,152 --> 01:22:02,810
But, in essence, aren't
you changing history?

1826
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:06,686
No, I think we're improving history.

1827
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,756
Even Heather is still reporting.

1828
01:22:09,855 --> 01:22:11,164
The whole town has been evacuated.

1829
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:16,348
They're calling this
the storm of the century.

1830
01:22:16,447 --> 01:22:17,723
Not much changes at all.

1831
01:22:17,823 --> 01:22:22,329
And this year's Foggy Bottom
Debating Society Champion is...

1832
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:23,379
Joey Naylor.

1833
01:22:23,486 --> 01:22:24,599
- Yay!
- Yay!

1834
01:22:24,702 --> 01:22:25,563
NICK: Joey!

1835
01:22:25,662 --> 01:22:26,523
POLLY: Joey!

1836
01:22:26,622 --> 01:22:27,483
NICK: Joey, Joey!

1837
01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:29,043
That's my boy.

1838
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,644
Hold it up. Hold it up.

1839
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:32,505
( Polly whooping )

1840
01:22:34,141 --> 01:22:36,083
And me?

1841
01:22:36,188 --> 01:22:38,774
Well, there's still a place
for guys like me.

1842
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:41,396
So, be straight with me.

1843
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,118
Is it true?

1844
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,561
- It could be.
- Come on.

1845
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,667
We know of very few cases.

1846
01:22:47,771 --> 01:22:48,851
There's no scientific proof at all.

1847
01:22:48,956 --> 01:22:49,817
There was an unfortunate
incident out in Iowa...

1848
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:50,843
It's really a complicated situation.

1849
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:52,084
NICK:
Gentlemen,

1850
01:22:52,187 --> 01:22:54,675
practice these words
in front of the mirror.

1851
01:22:54,778 --> 01:22:57,626
"Although we are constantly
exploring the subject,

1852
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:00,308
"currently,
there is no direct evidence

1853
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:01,752
"that links cell phone usage

1854
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,638
to brain cancer."

1855
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:07,568
( relieved sigh )

1856
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:11,604
Michael Jordan plays ball.

1857
01:23:11,705 --> 01:23:13,199
Charles Manson kills people.

1858
01:23:13,305 --> 01:23:14,712
I talk.

1859
01:23:16,312 --> 01:23:17,438
Everyone has a talent.
