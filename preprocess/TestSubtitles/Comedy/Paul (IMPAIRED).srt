Thanks.

01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,031
I ruined your life, Tara.

1744
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,315
I think it's only right I give you a new one.

01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,235
Oh.

1746
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,912
I don't have my toothbrush.

That's right. Right on. Get in there, girl.

Yeah, she's cool. She's with me.
Let her in. Yeah. No.

I meant to ask,
what did you think of the book?

1755
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,796
I liked it, actually. I really liked it.

1756
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,440
There's lot of good ideas in it.

I kind of found it hard to finish, to be honest.

It's safe to say
we've all learned something from this.

Be yourselves. Speak from your heart.
Some shit like that, I don't know.

Yeah, you know,
I certainly feel a bit different.
