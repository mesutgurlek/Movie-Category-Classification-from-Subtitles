153
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:42,636
Well, at first I did, but I think this situation offers a great 
opportunity for a father and daughter to discuss their feelings...


154
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:49,010

Quite forgot to lock his door

He ran off swiftly to pursue

 those Boxtrolls 

221
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:28,447

But the Boxtrolls did what Boxtrolls do 


222
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:34,247
They snatched him up and began to chew 
Until there was no residue Of Trubshaw. 

223
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,173
They pulled him down into their nest 
Hardly pausing to digest

256
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:29,319

because a boxtroll does not aspire to be anything more than a weak, lowly pest.

and power together in brotherhood, no, I do not know what...

294
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:02,121
Mr. Trout : Stay with us, boss. 
Mr. Pickles : Tell us more about when you’ll be king. 

295
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:08,500
Snatcher : He won’t let me! That pompous Portley-Rind and his gaggle of
 giggling sycophants. 

296
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:15,346
Mr. Pickles : Now, now Boss, you be careful up there. 
Snatcher : Father always said if you worked hard, you’d get a white hat! 

297
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,930

Eggs & Winnie : AHHH! 

345
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:28,980
Mr. Pickles : Don’t make no sense. That’s evil prevailing over good. 
Snatcher : If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I’ve worked for! 

346
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:31,465
Mr. Trout : You mean, we worked for?

347
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:40,781

Mr. Trout : I don’t think we are. 

348
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:44,666

they ripping out our eyeballs and eating our faces?

360
00:46:56,534 --> 00:47:04,206
Winnie : And where are the rivers of blood 
and mountains of bones?! I was promised mountains of bones!! 

361
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:14,905
Eggs : I told you, we don’t eat people!

something....But he refused... 
Herbert : I-- I’m an inventor, not a killer! 

383
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,402
Eggs : And when the Redhats tried to take me away from him... 

384
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:50,415
Snatcher : Maybe if I hold on to your son... 
Herbert : Not my boy!

Winnie : They what? 
Eggs : They killed him.

389
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:44,489
Winnie :I think that kind man was your father. 

390
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:46,777
Eggs : What’s a father?

391
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,673
Winnie :Um... well... a father is the one who raises you...

392
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,373
looks after you... Loves you...

393

Eggs : Oh! Like Fish....
Winnie : Yes... 

394
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:11,772
Winnie :  No. They’re supposed to be like that man in the story. Someone who’ll do 
anything to help you. They always listen and never get angry...

395
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:16,201
Winnie : They guide you when you don’t know what to do. 
They’re there when it’s dark 

396
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:22,337
and you’re scared or lonely, and they are never, ever too busy 
to talk to you... 

397
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,560
Eggs : You have a father! 

398
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:30,400
We can tell him I’m the Trubshaw Baby... and the boxtrolls didn’t 
eat me. And he’ll stop Snatcher! 

399
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,305
Winnie :Well, he doesn’t really listen to children. 
Eggs : He’s a father, isn’t he? 

400
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:37,081
Winnie :You don’t know what he’s like. 
Eggs : But he’s the only father we have

401
00:51:41,302 --> 00:51:43,075

00:51:54,037 --> 00:52:01,742
Winnie :All right, first thing’s first... off with the box. 
Boxtrolls terrified : AAAAAAAAh! 

404
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:04,594
Winnie : Stop that! 

405
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:08,418
Alright, you petty thieves. Bring me your loot!

406
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,141
Oh, thanks. 

407
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:17,382
No.

408
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,561
This might work.

Oh yes!

00:52:29,322 --> 00:52:29,892
No! 

413
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:33,678
Yes! 

414
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,941
Winnie : You look like a proper boy


415
00:52:40,085 --> 00:52:42,385
Eggs : Me... a proper boy. 

416
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:44,280
Winnie : How do we get out of this place? 

417
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,459
Winnie : AHHHHHHHH! 

418
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:00,651
Winnie : Come on Eggs

419
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:23,555
Winnie : STOP! You don’t scratch there in public! 
That’s why they’re called... (whispered)... privates. 

420
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,641
Eggs : (whispered) Okay

421
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:32,958
Winnie : For this is to work, there are a few things you need to know. 
When you meet someone, you must look them in the eye and shake hands. 


422
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:38,228
Winnie : What are you doing?! Put those down!

423
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:41,162
Like this.

424
00:53:42,964 --> 00:53:44,686
Winnie : The other one. 
Eggs : Oh, right. 

425
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,121
Winnie :Then you say, “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” 
Eggs : “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” 

426
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:53,158
Winnie : And you say that even if you’re not pleased to meet them.

427
00:53:58,676 --> 00:53:59,946
Winnie : Just stick close, okay? 

428
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:07,516
Eggs : Which one is your father? 
Winnie : Lord Portley-Rind 

429
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:10,122
He’s usually making speeches about cheese.

430
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:12,518
Lady Cyhthia : Oh, Winifred! 
Winnie : Hello, mommy dear.

431
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,361

433
00:54:19,985 --> 00:54:25,046
Lady Cyhthia : Eggsbert. How nice, I... umm, adore names from the bible.

434
00:54:25,486 --> 00:54:31,317
Eggs : Its a pleasure to meet you. 
Winnie : No, no. You kiss a lady’s hand.

435
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:39,567
Lady Cyhthia : Darling, it’s time to take off that dress and... burn it. 

436
00:54:40,124 --> 00:54:44,594
Winnie : Don’t move. I’ll be right back. 
Eggs : But which ones are the ladies?! 

437
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:47,686
Lady Broderick : Oh!

Sir Broderick : What? Well, I never! 

440
00:54:57,351 --> 00:55:09,242

Butler : Ladies and Gentlemen... Lord Portley-Rind! 

448
00:56:08,253 --> 00:56:16,512
Lord Portley-Rind : Distinguished members of the cheese guild
We were here to celebrate the successful fund-raising for a new children’s hospital!

449
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:29,605
But my fellow White Hats and I decided the money would be better spent on 
this. I present: The Briehemoth!

450
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,833
Madame Frou Frou : Zere you are! 

451
00:56:34,242 --> 00:56:38,923
Madame Frou Frou : Come. Such a naughty boy! We have 
so much to discuss. (Snatcher's voice) Alone

452
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:42,101
Madame Frou Frou : (Snatcher’s voice)
Come to snitch on old Snatcher did you?

453
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:45,978
SIR Broderick : Hello, Frou Frou! 
Madame Frou Frou : Nice to see you, too! 

454
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:56,948
Madame Frou Frou : You really think Portley-Rind will help a nobody like YOU? In this town, 
you want help, you’ve got to help yourself! That’s what a man does! 

455
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:01,102
Eggs : You’re a liar! When I tell Winnie’s 
father the truth, he’ll-- OOF! 


456
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:09,792
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : He’ll THANK ME! Because all your 
little boxtroll friends are going to die...tonight.

457
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,231
Eggs : What?! 
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : That will make me the most respected man in this town.

458
00:57:14,728 --> 00:57:17,063
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : They’ll have no choice but to give me a white hat. 

459
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:20,368
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : They’ll parade me into the tasting room on their shoulders!

460
00:57:21,424 --> 00:57:26,587
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : And I’m not going to let that be 
ruined by some little boxtroll sewer rat

461
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:36,815
Sir Langsdale : Yoo hoo, Madame Frou Frou... You promised your snookums a dance! 
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : I did? I did! Ha! But of course! 


462
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,786

467
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:21,488
Winnie : Just make a box. 
Eggs : You made me get out of my box! 

468
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:24,265
Winnie : With your feet, silly! 



469
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:32,862
That’s it, Eggs ... You’re dancing! 
(Both Laughing)

Eggs : Lord Winnie’s Father...

480
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:27,943
Eggs : People of the upper world

481
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:32,035
- Archibald Snatcher has lied to you all!

482
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:40,313
Eggs : He told you that boxtrolls are monsters 
-- that they steal children -- but they don’t. 


483
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:44,087
They would never hurt anyone. I know because... 

484
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,221
Eggs : Because... I am the Trubshaw Baby! 

485
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,137
Lord Portley-Rind : Do you know how expensive that cheese was? 
Eggs : What?!

486
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,975
Lord Portley-Rind : We might as well have built a children’s hospital! 
Winnie :Did you hear a word he said?! 

487
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:04,262
Lord Portley-Rind : Not now. 
Winnie : But father-­

488
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,730
Lord Portley-Rind : Have you any idea how long it will take my men to 
Fish it out of the river?! 

489
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,448
Langsdale : Ahh. What? 
Boulanger : Eww... the river?

490
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:14,460
Eggs : If you won’t listen to me, ask Snatcher himself.

491
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,894
(Crowd shock)
(GASP!)

492
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:20,339
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : You have me. I am not a true red head.

493
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,231
Lady Cynthia : Poor woman. 
Lord Portley-Rind : You insult our guest of honor? 

494
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:27,470
Lord Portley-Rind : Who are you?! 
Eggs : A proper boy. 

495
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,693
Winnie : He is with me father. 
Lord Portley-Rind : You know this... creature?

496
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,256
Winnie : He’s my friend. What he said is true-­
Lord Portley-Rind : Enough! 

497
01:01:35,664 --> 01:01:37,434
Winnie :But... 
Lord Portley-Rind : Winifred! 

498
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:40,208
Lord Portley-Rind : I don’t want to see you again, do you hear me? 
Eggs : But he’s not a..

499
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:42,464
Lord Portley-Rind : Leave my house

500
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:44,982
Now

501
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:02,535
Snatcher : Zees parties are so confusing. No? 
Lord Portley-Rind : There, there. You poor, poor dear. 

502
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:12,968
Winnie : Eggs, wait! 

503
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:18,212
Eggs : You said fathers were supposed to 
help. That they took care of kids.

504
01:02:20,557 --> 01:02:26,300
Winnie :(sigh) Well, they’re supposed to. 
Eggs : People are just mean and selfish. 

505
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:27,899
 They’re monsters

506
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:33,803
Winnie : Not all of us. You aren’t. 


507
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,520
Eggs : Well, I don’t want to be a boy anymore.

508
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:46,191
Eggs : It was a pleasure meeting you. 
Winnie : Eggs... 

509
01:02:47,757 --> 01:02:50,187
Eggs : And, Winnie I really do mean it. 

510
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,840
BOXTROLLS : Eggs! 

511
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:11,408
Eggs : We have to leave the cavern. 

512
01:03:12,108 --> 01:03:13,678
(The boxtrolls stop drumming) 

513
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,358
Eggs : We’re not safe down here anymore.  Come on... 

514
01:03:21,693 --> 01:03:23,723
Eggs : I said, we have to leave now! 

515
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:28,282
Eggs : Snatcher is planning something! We 
have to get out of here. 

516
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,979
Eggs : Come on let’s go. Now! 

517
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:38,391
Eggs : Get up! No! No! 
Don’t don’t just hide! What are you doing?!

Eggs : Fish, help me.

519
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:45,342
Eggs : No! I’m not a boxtroll!

520
01:03:54,105 --> 01:04:01,325
Eggs : I’m sorry. I... I didn’t mean it. 
Please come out. Fish... 

521
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:03,991

522
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:06,406
Eggs : He’s here. 

523
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:11,820
Boxtrolls : AHHHHHHHH!!!!! 

524
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:29,963
Snatcher : How’s that for an entrance! 

525
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:32,989
Mr. Pickles : Dramatical! 
Mr. Trout : Don’t you mean “dramatic”? 

526
01:04:33,398 --> 01:04:34,838
(Mr. Gristle laughs insanely)

527
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:43,122
Eggs : AHH! 



528
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:56,978
Eggs : Get up! That thing will kill you! 
Snatcher : My, my, what a surprise. Don’t look

529
01:04:58,092 --> 01:05:00,996
like your little friends wanna run, does it? 

530
01:05:01,406 --> 01:05:07,045
How strange, how peculiar. No, 
wait, it’s exactly as I expected! 

531
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:14,629
Eggs : You have to get up. Please! 
Snatcher : NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, TRUBSHAW! 

532
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:25,263
Snatcher : Time to earn my white hat! 

533
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,185

Eggs : No! Please! 

536
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:03,713
Snatcher :Give up, Trubshaw! Boxtrolls lost 
looooong time ago. 


537
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:11,679
These miserable pests will never be a match for a
 man with dream! Mr. Gristle! 


538
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:22,445
Fish : Eggs? Eggs? 
Snatcher : Acquire them! 

539
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,263
Fish : (SNARLS FEROCIOUSLY) 


540
01:06:34,756 --> 01:06:38,831
Mr. Pickles : Never seen one do that before! 
Mr. Gristle : That Boxtroll was mad! 

541
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:49,587
Mr. Pickles : Goodness always triumphs over 
evil... right Mr. Trout? Mr. Trout? 

542
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:55,974
Mr. Pickles : I’m still sixty to seventy percent certain that’s us. 
A couple of goodguys vanquishing evil and all that.

546
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:58,271
Eggs : (whispers) Who are you? 
Prisoner : Who am I? Who are you? 

547
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:05,026
Eggs : 
(confused, defeated)
I don’t know. 


548
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:07,666
Prisoner : Boy? Or Boxtroll? 

549
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,601
Prisoner : Dresses like a boxtroll, but, uh... 
looks like a boy.

550
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:20,813
A boy-troll? Yes, or a box-boy?
A new species. Never seen before. 

551
01:08:26,886 --> 01:08:36,254
Snatcher : 
(humming... then in normal voice)
Ohhh... nooo boxtrolls! 

552
01:08:37,426 --> 01:08:41,078
Snatcher : Trubshaw senior loved his kid, same 
as regular faaaaathers did.... 

553
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:48,925
Eggs : He’s my, you’re my... are you my father? 
Herbert : JELLY!

554
01:08:51,415 --> 01:08:58,797
Snatcher : He was once. Won’t get much out of him now, though. 
A decade hanging upside down scrambled his noodles good. 

555
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,851
Snatcher : Still, did a fine job designing this beauty. Best inventor in town,
your dad. Working with the best little builders.

556
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,384
Eggs : No, no no, don’t hide. Fish! Shoe! RUN! Get up, get up and run!
 Sparky. Sweets, run! 

557
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:26,345
Snatcher :Yell all you want, boy. They ain’t 
gonna run. You can’t change nature. 


558
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:34,341
Snatcher : I’m coming down, men! I want to pull the crushing lever myself!

559
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,311
It’s the little moments. 

560
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:49,671
Herbert : Yes. I see it now! A mutation of 
nature. Self-imposed metamorphosis.

561
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:52,644
Boxboy! You did it! 

562
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:58,281
Eggs : I don’t understand. 
Herbert : You changed your nature. Tell them. 

563
01:10:01,128 --> 01:10:03,657
Eggs : I tried. They won’t listen. 

564
01:10:06,043 --> 01:10:10,333
Herbert You did it. You made you. Tell them. 

565
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:14,343
Tell them!

566
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:19,215
Herbert : Boxboy! BOXBOY! 
My son.

567
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:23,519
Eggs : Father? 
Herbert : Son!

568
01:10:24,143 --> 01:10:28,690
Herbert : Son! They can change. They can do it! Tell them. 

569
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:35,661
Eggs : Fish, Fish, everyone! Listen!

570
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:51,200
 I’m a boxtroll and I stopped hiding, so you can too! Stand up for yourselves! We can 
fight back! Don’t be afraid anymore. Sparky! Fragile! Get up! Get up and fight! 

571
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:56,020
Eggs : Just stand up and take a step.
Please! Do it for me! 



572
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,934
Snatcher : Well, good speech. 

573
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:03,133
Eggs : No! No! No! NOOOOOO! 

574
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:09,660
Fish, Shoe, Sparky... 

575
01:11:10,126 --> 01:11:18,299
Herbert Look what you did. Look what you did! (laughs) 
Eggs : Yeah. Yeah look what I did. They’re crushed. 

576
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:22,398
Mr. Trout : Hey, Boss, your monsters are all loaded. 

577
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:27,566
Snatcher : All.... but.... one.... 

578
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:41,296
Snatcher : Hear ye! Hear ye!

579
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:44,615
Good citizens of Cheesebridge, 

580
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,714
come out of your homes!

581
01:11:48,219 --> 01:11:51,340
The curfew has been lifted! 

582
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,400
Townsfolk Boy : Whoah! What is it? 



583
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:58,978
Snatcher : Fear not, the monsters have been vanquished! 

584
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:04,033
Snatcher : Your streets are SAFE! 
Mr. Gristle : SAAAFE! 

585
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:07,404
Male Townsfolk : The curfew is over? 
Mr. Trout : Yeah... 

586
01:12:11,562 --> 01:12:18,848
Snatcher : Join me! Your purger of pests! 
Your white knight who has taken back the night! 

587
01:12:21,442 --> 01:12:24,184
Snatcher : Lord Portley-Riiiiind! 

588
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,499
(Door Squeks)

589
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:30,320
Snatcher : I come bearing the most delightful news. 

590
01:12:33,466 --> 01:12:36,357
Lord Portley-Rind : Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is this? 

591
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:39,343
Snatcher : Show him lads.

592
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:43,711
Snatcher : Flattened to extinction. Every last, slimy one of them. 

593
01:12:45,256 --> 01:12:55,315
Snatcher : Your lordship, I said I would not rest until I caught every last 
boxtroll and I am a man of my word

594
01:12:55,976 --> 01:12:58,874
Snatcher : With this boxtroll, I will end their reign of terror. 



595
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:00,060
Winnie : Eggs! 

596
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:02,783
Snatcher : I’d say that deserves a white hat, don’t you? 

597
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:05,091
Shopkeeper Women : A.. A white hat for Mr. Snatcher ! 

598
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:10,861
Lord Portley-Rind : Yes, well. I’m not sure... 
We’d have to take a vote...

599
01:13:11,247 --> 01:13:13,496
(Crowd in unison, chanting)
WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! 

600
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:17,843
Lord Portley-Rind : There’s probably some, uh,  paperwork... 
then have a hat shipped in... 

601
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:27,114
Snatcher :No. Me thinks a deed of this magnitude 
deserves something a bit more... significant. 

602
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:32,266
Snatcher : I want YOUR hat. 
Lord Portley-Rind : My hat? 

603
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:35,831
(Crowd in unison, chanting)
WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! 

604
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:50,958
Lord Portley-Rind : All right. All right. As soon as that boxtroll is dead, 
you may have... my... hat.

605
01:13:51,371 --> 01:13:57,188
Snatcher : Yes. And then we can eat cheese together. 
In the Tasting Room. 


606
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:03,828
Snatcher : Do the honors. 


607
01:14:04,256 --> 01:14:09,000
Mr. Pickles : I thought this was all gonna be a show, like with Frou Frou. 
I brought my mustache and everything. 

608
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:12,003
Mr. Trout : This really does stretch the limits 
of the term “hero”, doesn’t it? 

609
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:14,254
Mr. Gristle : HAT! (CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY) 

610
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:23,227
Snatcher : Musician, drum-roll! 

611
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:28,139
Snatcher : Mr. Trout! Lower the beast down. 

612
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:49,406
Lord Portley-Rind : Repeat after me: With this hat, I, state your name... 
Snatcher : With this hat, I, Archibald Penelope Snatcher

613
01:14:57,047 --> 01:15:00,665

Winnie : Father! Father! 
Lord Portley-Rind : Not now, Winifred! 

615
01:15:03,585 --> 01:15:04,204
Winnie : STOP! STOP! 

616
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:07,170
Mr. Trout : I can’t, miss. Apologies. 
Mr. Pickles : We’re just doing our jobs. 

617
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:14,822
Winnie :Your JOBS? Are you pest exterminators or evil henchmen?! 
Mr. Pickles : I knew that’s how people saw us. 


618
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:24,404
Winnie :You don’t have to do this! 
Mr. Trout : She has a point, Mr. Pickles,This could be our chance for redemption. 

619
01:15:24,972 --> 01:15:27,633
Mr. Pickles : A second chapter! 
Mr. Trout : People love a flawed hero! 

620
01:15:30,024 --> 01:15:31,756
Winnie : Sure, yes, whatever! Just let him go!

Snatcher : I... I am befuddled as your lordship! I... I crushed them myself! 

630
01:16:35,405 --> 01:16:40,783
Lord Portley-Rind : Evidently not! That was the closest 
you will ever come to a White Hat.


631
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:42,613
I hope you enjoyed it.
