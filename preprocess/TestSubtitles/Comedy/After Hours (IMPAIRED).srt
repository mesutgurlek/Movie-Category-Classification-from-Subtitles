1
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:14,524
- Punch. Punch it in.
- Okay. Right.

2
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:19,163
Okay. Let's... First of all,
refresh the screen here...

3
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:22,359
...all right, and go in a format ruler.

4
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:27,193
- There.
- All right.

5
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,521
- Now, file?
- Right.

6
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,036
- And it's in memory?
- Right.

7
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,517
And...

8
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,840
...mark this down
in the prefix file codes.

9
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:42,279
- Prefix code. Right.
- Okay.

10
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,362
Good. Yeah, you got it.
Another week, you'll have it down.

11
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,038
It's temporary anyway.

12
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:50,844
I said, it's temporary anyway.

13
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:53,883
I do not intend to be stuck doing this
for the rest of my life.

14
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:57,003
- Don't tell Mr. Digman I said that.
- Okay.

15
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:00,714
Because what I really wanna do is,
I'd really like to get into publishing.

16
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,523
There aren't any openings right now.

17
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:07,475
But what I would love to do is just
create a magazine, my own magazine...

18
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,921
...which would be, like,
a forum for writers and intellectuals...

19
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,122
...who can't get into print
anywhere else, who could, you know...

20
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,277
I'm not into editing or trying
to reach a particular audience.

21
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:20,164
Getting it out there,
they would get some momentum going...

22
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:23,840
...and, you know, do something with...

23
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,477
- With, you know...
- Excuse me, one second.

24
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:24,397
I love that book.

25
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:33,443
I love that book.

26
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,881
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

27
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,317
I think Miller's really great.

28
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,716
"This is not a book.
This is a prolonged insult.

29
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:45,604
A gob of spit in the face of art.

30
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,438
A kick in the pants to truth,
beauty, God..."

31
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:49,879
Something like that.

32
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,724
That's very good.

33
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:53,443
That's all I remember.

34
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:58,077
I've read this before. I mean, I don't...
I'm just rereading it.

35
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,918
I don't reread books that often...

36
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:02,924
...but this one's my favorite.

37
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:06,839
I like it better than <i>Capricorn</i>
or <i>Plexus...</i>

38
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,283
...or <i>Sexus.</i>

39
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:12,837
You know, he used to kiss himself
after he ate a good meal.

40
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,798
It's mostly...

41
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:22,041
Let me ask you. Does that cashier
seem a little weird to you?

42
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:26,402
He keeps making
these strange movements.

43
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:35,398
God!

44
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,799
I think he's just waiting
to be discovered.

45
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,318
Do you want another coffee?

46
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,283
No. I'm gonna head over
to my friend's house.

47
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,919
- Which way you headed?
- Downtown, SoHo.

48
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:53,394
Oh, nice. Nice. A loft?

49
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:55,954
Yeah. She's a sculptress.

50
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,595
Lately, she's been making these
plaster-of-Paris bagels and cream cheese.

51
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,199
Really.

52
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,323
She's trying to sell them as
paperweights. You wanna buy one?

53
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,964
Paperweight?

54
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,760
Yeah, I would. How much are they?

55
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,197
I don't know.

56
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:16,721
If you think you might be interested,
her number's 243-3460.

57
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,762
243-3460. Okay.

58
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:24,601
- Her name is Kiki Bridges.
- Kiki Bridges. Okay.

59
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,644
- Nice talking to you.
- Yeah. Great talking to you.

60
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:41,684
Excuse me. Can I borrow your pen?

61
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,677
Thank you.

62
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:04,083
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yes. Is Kiki Bridges there, please?

63
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,042
- <i>This is her.</i>
- Hi.

64
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:10,084
You don't know me. I'm calling because
I'm interested in your paperweights.

65
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,558
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- You're the sculptress, right?

66
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,874
A girl I met tonight in a coffee shop
told me that she was staying with you...

67
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,478
<i>Oh, you mean Marcy.</i>

68
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:24,682
- I don't know. She didn't say her name.
- <i>Hold on. I'll get her.</i>

69
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:28,633
She told me about these paperweights
and the work that you do.

70
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,238
<i>Hello?</i>

71
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:33,203
- Hello? Marcy?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

72
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:36,880
Hi, this is Paul Hackett.
We met earlier tonight.

73
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:41,120
<i>Hi. Sure, I remember.</i>

74
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,322
- <i>How are you?</i>
- All right. I'm all right.

75
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:46,077
I just got in...

76
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:49,920
...and I opened up my book
and saw your number and...

77
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,164
<i>Good.</i>

78
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:54,283
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

79
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,797
<i>So...</i>

80
00:06:57,405 --> 00:07:01,683
So do you work near that coffee shop
or live in the neighborhood or...?

81
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:05,719
<i>No, I was just over</i>
<i>at a good friend of mine's.</i>

82
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,797
<i>Actually, we had a terrible argument.</i>

83
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,077
That's too bad.

84
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,805
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

85
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:21,123
I'm sure, whatever it was,
I'm sure you'll straighten it out.

86
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:25,198
<i>You think so?</i>
<i>Do you think I should try to make up?</i>

87
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,274
Well, I don't know, I mean...
You know... Maybe you're better off.

88
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:32,801
You know, I don't know what the
circumstances were, but sometimes...

89
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:37,514
You know, I don't... It's not even...
It's not my business.

90
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,077
- <i>Maybe you should come over, Paul.</i>
- What?

91
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:44,835
- <i>Maybe you should come on over.</i>
- Sure. Sure. Now?

92
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,279
<i>Yeah. Why not?</i>

93
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,479
Where to?

94
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:52,637
<i>I'm at 28 Howard Street.</i>
<i>Near the corner of Crosby.</i>

95
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,073
<i>It's in SoHo.</i>

96
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:57,078
- <i>The name on the buzzer is Franklin.</i>
- Not Bridges?

97
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,361
<i>Bridges is crossed out.</i>

98
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,083
<i>Just press the buzzer.</i>

99
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:04,724
Okay. About 45 minutes?

100
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:07,359
- <i>Yeah, great. I'll see you later.</i>
- All right.

101
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,481
- <i>Paul?</i>
- Yes.

102
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,515
<i>I'm really glad you called.</i>

103
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:15,119
Me too. Me too.

104
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,435
Okay. I'll see you later.

105
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,163
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

106
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:32,080
- I've only got a 20. Can you break it?
- Yeah, sure. No problem.

107
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,238
No hurry.

108
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:06,799
Oh, shit!

109
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:10,435
Excuse me, I just...
Damn! Oh, my God!

110
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,039
Excuse me.

111
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,481
My money flew out the window.

112
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,758
Okay, that'll be $6.50.

113
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:49,156
Listen, my money
just flew out the window.

114
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,758
I put it in this cradle...

115
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:55,043
...and you went so fast around
that corner that I don't have any...

116
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:59,840
What I'm saying is, I don't have
any money. I'm really sorry.

117
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:02,235
Look, let me show you something.

118
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,198
Look, that was... I had $20.

119
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:08,084
And now I don't have any more.

120
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:09,724
I'm really sorry.

121
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:24,561
Franklin. Franklin.

122
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,278
Franklin.

123
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,318
Franklin.

124
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,963
- Are you Paul?
- Yeah.

125
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,399
Here, catch.

126
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,796
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,840
- Your keys.
- You can just put them on the table.

128
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,004
I like that.

129
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:27,878
- Do you?
- Yeah. Very much.

130
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:31,204
It reminds me of that
Edvard Munch painting.

131
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:33,476
What's it, <i>The Shriek?</i>

132
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:37,282
- <i>The Scream.</i>
- <i>The Scream.</i> Right.

133
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:39,958
Yeah.

134
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,561
Sort of like a three-dimensional version
of that painting.

135
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,443
Is Marcy here?

136
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:49,883
She had to go out
to the all-night drugstore.

137
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:54,118
- Is she all right?
- It's under control.

138
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,036
This place is huge.

139
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,794
Do you share it with anyone?

140
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:03,354
Hey, would you like to
work on this for a while?

141
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,284
- I could use a break.
- What?

142
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,563
It's not hard.

143
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:13,794
What are you talking about?
This is yours.

144
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:17,079
- How would I know what you want?
- Look, it's real easy.

145
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,760
Just take some of this stuff
and slap it on like this.

146
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,322
All right, I'm coming.

147
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:28,764
Yeah?

148
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:32,277
Of course he's here.
You invited him.

149
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:38,074
That's your problem, Marcy.
I'm not gonna tell him.

150
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,156
I'm not telling him.

151
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,077
I can't talk any louder.

152
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,518
All right, hurry up.

153
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,718
- How's it going?
- It's great.

154
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:49,916
I'm just giving him a shoulder.

155
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,361
Look what you did to your shirt.

156
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:57,684
Oh, good.

157
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:01,875
- Give it to me, I'll throw it in the wash.
- No, that's all right.

158
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,116
It'll only take 20 minutes.

159
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,718
That's okay.

160
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:10,638
Come on.

161
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,558
You wanna look nice
for your big date, don't you?

162
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,764
All right.

163
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,678
Twenty minutes, huh?

164
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:30,364
- Put this on while you're waiting.
- Thanks.

165
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,996
You do that all day
and your own shoulders get pretty sore.

166
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,524
Want a massage?

167
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,199
- You read my mind. Would you?
- Sure.

168
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:51,162
I'm not too good at this.

169
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,885
Just know a few basic moves.

170
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,594
Just make it hurt
and you're on the right track.

171
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,562
That's all I know.

172
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,884
Okay.

173
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:13,682
- You have a great body.
- Yes.

174
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,396
Not a lot of scars.

175
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,644
That's true.

176
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:23,724
Never occurred to me.

177
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:27,036
I mean, some women I know
are covered with them head to toe.

178
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,277
Not me.

179
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,283
Scars?

180
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,353
Horrible, ugly scars.

181
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,481
I'm just telling you, now.

182
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,804
I don't know.

183
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,356
I know, when I was a kid...

184
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:57,395
...I had to have my tonsils taken out.

185
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:02,637
And after the operation...

186
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,875
...they didn't have enough room
in Pediatrics.

187
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:08,242
So they had to put me
in the burn ward.

188
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,881
But before they wheeled me in...

189
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:15,761
...this nurse gave me...

190
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,316
...this blindfold to put on...

191
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:21,275
...and she told me never to take it off.

192
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,603
If I did...

193
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,519
...they'd have to do the operation
all over again.

194
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:32,637
I didn't understand what my tonsils
had to do with my eyes either.

195
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:36,763
But anyway...

196
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:40,884
...that night...

197
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:44,035
...at least I think it was night...

198
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,323
...I reached up...

199
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,959
...to untie the blindfold...

200
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,716
...and...

201
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,557
...I saw...

202
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,038
Hello again.

203
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:46,954
- Sorry about this. I was detained.
- Don't worry about it.

204
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,400
- So how are you?
- Good.

205
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,834
Well, I made it.
You wouldn't... I'm here.

206
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,919
Let's go into my room
and get away from all this mess.

207
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,359
Sure.

208
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,598
Your roommate was just
dipping all day.

209
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,604
Put me to work.

210
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,359
I feel like a real SoHo artist.

211
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,642
What did you do to her?

212
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,883
I didn't do anything to her.
She was asleep.

213
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,605
I mean, she just... She was tired.

214
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:34,123
- What do you mean, what did I do?
- Easy, easy. It was an innocent question.

215
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,804
Look, I'm gonna take a quick shower.
I'll be right back, okay?

216
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:42,993
Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think a shower
would probably do you good.

217
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,962
You had a tough day.

218
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,958
I knew there was something special
about you.

219
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,678
I hope you don't have to get up early
tomorrow or anything.

220
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:54,154
No. No, I don't.

221
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:57,753
Because I think you're somebody
I can really talk to.

222
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:01,163
And tonight I feel like...

223
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,759
I feel like I'm gonna let loose
or something.

224
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,324
I feel like...

225
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:11,034
I feel like something incredible
is really gonna happen here.

226
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:15,281
I feel so excited
and I don't know why.

227
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:16,719
I feel it.

228
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,363
I'm glad you came.

229
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,923
Me too.

230
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,757
If you wanna smoke a joint,
there's some in there, feel free.

231
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,677
No. Maybe later.

232
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,758
- Hello?
- <i>Is Marcy there?</i>

233
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:13,597
She can't come to the phone right now.
May I take a message?

234
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,996
- <i>Could you just tell her Greg called?</i>
- Sure.

235
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,963
Is she back?

236
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,833
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

237
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:06,800
- You want me to close the window?
- No, I got it.

238
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,923
Boy! Whoever used to live here
must have been a bodybuilder.

239
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,643
Jesus.

240
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,834
Who's Franklin?
The buzzer, when I came over...

241
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:18,803
Hey, I thought I told you
to stay on the bed.

242
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:21,038
Right.

243
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:27,716
I'm gonna ask you to wait here
just one more minute. I promise.

244
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:30,763
- All right.
- You're the best.

245
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:03,236
- What, Paul?
- What?

246
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,244
What did you say?

247
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:07,442
I didn't say anything.

248
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,885
You didn't just say something
just now?

249
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:12,956
No, I didn't say anything.

250
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:19,161
I could have sworn I thought
I heard you say something in here.

251
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:21,557
Well...

252
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,604
...I didn't.

253
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:26,554
I don't think I'll be able
to sleep at all tonight.

254
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,473
What's that smell? Is that linseed?

255
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,994
- It's skin moisturizer. I have dry skin.
- Really?

256
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,482
Feels pretty soft to me.

257
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,118
Please.

258
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,877
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

259
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,082
I think you're very nice, I do.
Could we just talk a little while?

260
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:52,282
Of course. Sure.

261
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,444
Greg called.

262
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:01,762
How did that little faggot find out
I was staying here tonight?

263
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:04,962
Probably wants to whine to me
about his latest boyfriend.

264
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:09,957
Friends like that
are hard to deal with sometimes.

265
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,002
Well, that's what friends are for.

266
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:16,763
- I know that, but I meant...
- I just can't deal with it tonight.

267
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,516
Does he want me to call him back?

268
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,163
He didn't say.

269
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,637
Well...

270
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,360
Since you answered the phone...

271
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,161
...he probably figured I was...

272
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:36,958
I'm scared.

273
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:42,204
Why don't you just tell me
what's wrong.

274
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:49,036
I was raped once.

275
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:53,122
As a matter of fact,
it happened right here in this room.

276
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:55,563
I lived here once.

277
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,959
He came in through there,
off the fire escape.

278
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,995
He held a knife to my throat
and said...

279
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,838
...if I made any noise
he'd cut my tongue out.

280
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,242
He tied me to the bed.

281
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:16,322
He took his time. Six hours.

282
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:22,997
My God.

283
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,557
Was he...

284
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:30,636
Did they get this guy?

285
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:32,644
No.

286
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,033
Actually, it was a boyfriend of mine.

287
00:23:40,405 --> 00:23:43,317
To tell you the truth,
I slept through most of it.

288
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:48,078
So there you are.

289
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:24,723
You wanna get some coffee?
I feel like getting out of here.

290
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:28,161
Absolutely.
Say, is there a place open this late?

291
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:30,595
Sure, it's not even 2 yet.

292
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,518
Ready?

293
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:19,715
Can I ask you something?
I've wanted to ask you this all night.

294
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:23,038
- Who's Franklin?
- Franklin?

295
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,276
Franklin is my husband.

296
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:28,684
Really.

297
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,154
Is that his loft, then?

298
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:36,444
He owns it, yes.

299
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:43,721
- Do you live with him?
- No. He's in Turkey.

300
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:50,044
I stayed with my husband for three days.
I was very young when I got married.

301
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:53,041
My husband was a movie freak.

302
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,476
Actually, he was particularly obsessed
with one movie:

303
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:01,043
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

304
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:03,682
He talked about it constantly.

305
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,876
I thought it was cute at first.

306
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:11,761
On our wedding night, I was a virgin.

307
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,639
When we made love...
You've seen the film, haven't you?

308
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:17,836
<i>The Wizard of Oz?</i> Yeah, I've seen it.

309
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,273
Well, when we made love...

310
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:23,363
...whenever he...

311
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,402
...you know, when he came...

312
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:27,197
...he would just...

313
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:30,478
...scream out "Surrender Dorothy!"

314
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,923
That's all. Just "Surrender Dorothy!"

315
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:40,123
I know. Instead of moaning or saying
"Oh, God" or something normal like that.

316
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:44,443
I mean, it was pretty creepy.
And I told him I thought so...

317
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,802
...but he just couldn't stop.
He just couldn't stop.

318
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:56,719
He said he didn't even realize
it was happening.

319
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,637
He just couldn't stop.

320
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:01,160
So I just broke the whole thing off.

321
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:09,164
I'm sorry.

322
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:12,404
I guess I'm really putting you
through the mill tonight.

323
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,521
It's okay. I'm used to it.

324
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:18,725
You know, I still love him very much.

325
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:23,124
In fact, we write each other
every day.

326
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,598
Naturally, I don't like to talk about it.

327
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,233
- Could we have the check?
- It's on the house.

328
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,404
- Really?
- Sure, what the hell.

329
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:39,041
Different rules apply this late,
know what I mean? It's like after-hours.

330
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,797
- Thanks, Peter.
- Sure, Marcy. Have a good evening.

331
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,277
It's okay. It's...

332
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:31,997
Do you want me to go?

333
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:57,364
The pill makes me sick.

334
00:28:57,525 --> 00:29:00,244
Everything makes you sick, Marcy.

335
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:05,596
The guys gave it to me.

336
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,677
Oh, my...

337
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,233
God!

338
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,524
Well...

339
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:34,357
...here we are.

340
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:47,317
- So how about that joint?
- Yeah.

341
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:50,203
- Good idea.
- Great.

342
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,677
What type of pot is this?

343
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:24,164
It's Colombian.

344
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:28,044
- That's a lie.
- What?

345
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:32,043
This isn't Colombian.
I don't even think it's pot.

346
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:35,716
The guy who sold it to me
said it was.

347
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:39,878
Well, the guy who sold it to you is a liar.
So are you. That's shit.

348
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:44,198
Don't get upset.
I just won't buy it from him anymore.

349
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,084
That's horseshit.

350
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,359
Are you all right?

351
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:50,959
Where are those plaster-of-Paris
paperweights, anyway?

352
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,036
I mean, that's what
I came down here for.

353
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:55,241
That's not entirely true.
I came to see you...

354
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:58,442
...but where are the paperweights?
That's what I wanna see now.

355
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:02,723
- What's the matter?
- I said, I wanna see a plaster-of-Paris...

356
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:05,604
...bagel and cream cheese paperweight.
Now, cough it up.

357
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:07,995
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

358
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,364
They're in Kiki's bedroom.

359
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,914
Then get them.
Because as we sit here chatting...

360
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:15,394
...there are papers flying
around my apartment...

361
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:18,318
...because I don't have anything
to hold them down with.

362
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:20,964
Fine.

363
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,003
I don't know, Kiki.

364
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,762
Sorry about that.

365
00:31:56,485 --> 00:31:59,363
- It's really coming down, huh?
- You bet.

366
00:32:00,205 --> 00:32:02,594
- Here you go.
- The fare is a dollar and a half.

367
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:06,878
- What?
- Fare went up to $ 1.50 as of midnight.

368
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,997
You're kidding.

369
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:13,198
Look...

370
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,763
...I've got 97 cents.
- No.

371
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,199
- It's raining like mad out there.
- No.

372
00:32:21,685 --> 00:32:24,563
Would you just give me a break?
I really just wanna go home.

373
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:27,114
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I could lose my job.

374
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,560
Who would know, exactly?

375
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:36,037
I could go to a party, get drunk,
talk to someone. Who knows?

376
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,763
Would you give me
a goddamn token?!

377
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:40,962
No, goddamn it! I can't give you a token.
Those tokens are $ 1.50.

378
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,719
I can't sell them for 97 cents.
We'd lose money that way.

379
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:47,116
All right, there's the train. Come on,
give me a token! Come on!

380
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:57,443
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I wanted to take the Express.

381
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,243
I mean, it was the other way around.

382
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:02,681
- I'm talking to you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

383
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:05,439
I've never done that.
I don't know what came over me.

384
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:07,402
The fares went up and I have 97 cents.

385
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:11,080
I won't even take the train.
I won't even take it. I'm sorry.

386
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:12,798
That's my train.

387
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:15,081
That's the one I wanted. Thanks a lot.

388
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:19,276
Must be a full moon out there.

389
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:27,923
Can I get you something?

390
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,282
I have 97 cents.

391
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:33,878
That's not very much, is it?

392
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,764
No. No, it's not.

393
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:41,920
Do I have to order something?
I mean, can I just sit here for a minute?

394
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:46,640
- Yes. Sure.
- Thanks.

395
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,477
Any time.

396
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,798
What'll it be?

397
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:29,164
I don't want anything.
I just wanna sit here.

398
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:30,838
Is that okay?

399
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:32,597
- Sure.
- Thanks.

400
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:36,401
But if you're looking to make friends,
don't get your hopes up.

401
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:38,675
Looks like a pretty slow night.

402
00:36:40,685 --> 00:36:41,959
Yeah.

403
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,084
- Well, it is late.
- Not for this place.

404
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:48,196
Things are usually hopping
around now.

405
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:51,675
That's all right, really.
I just wanted to get in out of the rain.

406
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:55,123
I just hope it lets up soon.

407
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:59,836
- I really just wanna go home.
- Aren't the subways running?

408
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,916
But I happen to be broke
at the moment, see.

409
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:07,679
Christ. I'll give you the money.

410
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:11,633
Really? I can't tell you how much
that would mean to me.

411
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:16,475
- Oh, Christ. Not another one.
- What? Another what?

412
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:21,234
Guy lives in the same building as me.
He's been here three times tonight...

413
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,681
...to tell me about three burglaries
in this neighborhood, all tonight.

414
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:26,917
- Shit.
- What?

415
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:28,639
What?

416
00:37:28,805 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm just trying to remember if I turned
my burglar alarm on at home tonight.

417
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:34,123
Sometimes I forget.

418
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:36,595
Oh, well, anyway.

419
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:54,037
That's all right. It's all right.

420
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:58,245
That's all right. Forget it.
Doesn't matter.

421
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:00,965
I'd like to open the register.
What if I got a rush now?

422
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,763
Yeah, I see your point.

423
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:05,077
What about a key?
Do you have a key?

424
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:09,204
- Yeah, but I keep it up in my apartment.
- Damn. That's too bad.

425
00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:14,082
Listen, I can't go anywhere,
but how'd you like to do me a favor?

426
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:15,803
- For subway fare?
- If you don't mind.

427
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:18,798
- You got it.
- I'm at 158 Spring Street, top floor.

428
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,758
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?

429
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,244
Right.

430
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,155
You don't know me,
I don't know you.

431
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:30,317
I might rip you off, right?
Is that what you're thinking?

432
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,519
I'm not gonna rip you off. I'm not.

433
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:36,437
With what I've been through tonight...

434
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,517
...the last thing I wanna do
is steal from somebody.

435
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,801
I really just wanna get home.

436
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:43,599
Look, here.

437
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,154
Here are my keys.
This is my deposit, okay?

438
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:49,920
If I don't come back, these are yours.
Everything I own is yours.

439
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:53,395
I just wanna get home. Keep them.

440
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:58,277
Okay, all right. Good. Here.

441
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:02,642
The keys for the register
are over the light switch, on a hook.

442
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,000
The alarm is underneath
the light switch.

443
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:06,996
Make sure you see a beeping red light.

444
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:09,765
- Beeping red light. 158 Spring.
- Top floor.

445
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:11,563
I'll be right back.

446
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:08,196
Oh, no.

447
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:10,637
Oh, God.

448
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:13,441
Oh, Jesus! God.

449
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:16,794
- What's come from Phil?
- I don't wanna read it.

450
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:19,195
I'm jealous.
He even sounded tan on the phone.

451
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,720
I wonder if this is
our local friendly burglar.

452
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:24,957
Did you get what you wanted
or did we get back and spoil your fun?

453
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:28,515
- Who are you? You don't live here.
- I'm a friend of Tom's.

454
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:30,994
Tom who?
There are three Toms living here.

455
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:33,725
Look, guys, I'm not a burglar.
So get your hands off me.

456
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:36,445
- He asked you which Tom.
- I don't know Tom's last name.

457
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:38,721
He's on the top floor.
How many Toms are there?

458
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:40,159
How'd you get in here?

459
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:42,475
He gave me the keys. Look. See this?

460
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:44,954
He gave me the keys and I let myself in.

461
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:49,001
Sorry, but there have been
about eight break-ins here just last week.

462
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:53,761
Okay, I'm sorry, all right.
I didn't know that.

463
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:57,279
Hey, we gonna hit RadioShack
tonight, man?

464
00:40:57,485 --> 00:40:59,521
Wait till next week.
The new models come in.

465
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:01,641
Hey! Where'd you get that?

466
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,677
Kiki! God, what happened?

467
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:38,355
Just throw down the keys.
Throw it. Be careful.

468
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,922
That's right. Give it a good throw.
There you go.

469
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:53,444
Hold on, Kiki.

470
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,643
Bastards!

471
00:41:58,085 --> 00:41:59,837
What have they done?

472
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:03,236
What are these guys, sailors?
Look at this.

473
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:06,203
It's so elaborate.
Must've taken them hours.

474
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,839
- How'd they get in?
- How did who get in?

475
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:12,242
- The burglars.
- The burglars? What burglars?

476
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,999
The ones who took your sculpture
and your TV set.

477
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:17,163
God.

478
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,444
- Neil and Pepe?
- Who?

479
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,675
It was Neil and Pepe.
They're friends of mine.

480
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:25,120
I just sold them my television
for 300 bucks.

481
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:27,441
How did you get ahold of my sculpture?

482
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,559
- This the guy?
- Yeah.

483
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,404
I'm Horst.

484
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:49,353
I'm Paul. Hi.

485
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:01,080
That was rude of you before, Paul.

486
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,514
You really ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

487
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:06,398
I am.

488
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:10,439
I don't know what could have
come over me.

489
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:13,922
Lack of discipline.

490
00:43:14,565 --> 00:43:16,237
Possibly.

491
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:20,435
Well, it's not too late to finish
what you started.

492
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:23,637
Marcy, it's Paul.

493
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:33,324
Hi.

494
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:38,754
Listen, I owe you an apology.

495
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:43,758
There's just no excuse for
leaving the way I did. And I'm sorry.

496
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:46,076
You know, I just figured...

497
00:43:47,365 --> 00:43:49,754
...it's not working out between us...

498
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:53,998
...and, hell, I'll never see you again.
You know, there's just no excuse.

499
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:57,919
I think I just got a little spooked,
you know?

500
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:02,233
With that story about your husband
and your boyfriend.

501
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:04,236
I mean, that was really weird.

502
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:06,243
What was that all about?

503
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:11,558
And I gathered there's something...

504
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:16,242
...wrong, or you have
some burns or something...

505
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,794
...and I just couldn't handle that.

506
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:21,843
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened to me.

507
00:44:24,085 --> 00:44:27,236
I don't know. Maybe the timing's
just off or something...

508
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,195
...but I think I just better go.

509
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:36,478
Okay?

510
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:39,884
Marcy?

511
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:43,477
Marcy.

512
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:45,918
What...

513
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:54,200
Oh, Jesus! Marcy.

514
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,193
Oh, God! Breathe. Breathe.

515
00:44:57,485 --> 00:45:00,841
Kiki! Kiki! Come on.

516
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:04,078
Oh, Jesus!

517
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:10,238
God...!

518
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,483
Think.

519
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:19,921
Kiki! Horst!

520
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:24,803
<i>Paul and Marcy, Horst and I
<i>went to Club Berlin for drinks.</i>

521
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:27,763
<i>Join us if you feel up to it.</i>
<i>Corner West Broadway and Grand.</i>

522
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:28,914
<i>See you! Kiki.</i>

523
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:30,924
Shit.

524
00:45:33,445 --> 00:45:35,242
Operator, give me the police.

525
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,317
Yes, I wanna report a death.

526
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,717
Oh, God.

527
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:39,877
Oh, no.

528
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:18,196
Hey, it's me.
I did it. I quit my job.

529
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:19,684
What do you want me to do?

530
00:47:19,845 --> 00:47:22,405
Let's go have a drink. Celebrate.
Pier Three is open.

531
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:24,283
I don't know what your problem is...

532
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:28,358
...but I've gotta get over to that bar,
get my keys, so I can get home.

533
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:33,359
Oh, look at this.

534
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:38,442
Now what?

535
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,402
This is incredible.

536
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:43,123
Where the hell is he?

537
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,680
You know, I live across the street.
Would you like a TV dinner?

538
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:54,513
Oh, wait a minute! Neil, Pepe!
Wait a minute! I didn't know!

539
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:56,516
It's that dude again.
Get out of here.

540
00:47:56,685 --> 00:47:58,403
I didn't know.

541
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:01,037
I didn't know.

542
00:48:04,285 --> 00:48:05,843
Oh, God.

543
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,238
My place?

544
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:13,277
You like The Monkees?

545
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:18,837
What's your name?

546
00:48:19,045 --> 00:48:20,319
Julie.

547
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,444
I'm Paul.

548
00:48:29,645 --> 00:48:31,636
Rough night, huh, Paul?

549
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:33,995
You look depressed.

550
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:37,916
I came downtown tonight...

551
00:48:39,445 --> 00:48:41,242
Oh, God.

552
00:48:41,605 --> 00:48:44,722
I didn't even know...
I didn't even know this girl.

553
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:52,117
Oh, God.

554
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,403
I didn't even know her.

555
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:58,203
Hang on.

556
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:03,364
Is that better?

557
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:06,596
"Chelsea Morning."

558
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:11,120
Go on. What is it? Talk to me.

559
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:16,556
I'm fine, really. I'm gonna be
out of your way in just a sec.

560
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:19,957
I'm just waiting for them
to open up downstairs.

561
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,282
I'll just get my keys and go home.

562
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:25,803
Boy, oh, boy.

563
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:31,955
Just let it go, honey.
Tell me your problems.

564
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:35,764
I don't think so.

565
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:38,803
Paul, lighten up. What is this?

566
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:43,317
This doom and gloom and...
Be loosey-goosey. Come on.

567
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:48,155
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, tell me your problems.

568
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:50,044
Where the hell is he?

569
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:52,759
- What the hell time is it?
- It's very late.

570
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,644
Jesus.

571
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:04,879
So you really hate that job, huh?

572
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,923
Yeah. I hate both my jobs, you know?

573
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:10,394
Oh, yeah? What else do you do?

574
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:13,484
Well, I work in
the Xerox shop downstairs.

575
00:50:14,685 --> 00:50:16,004
Downstairs?

576
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:18,599
Yeah. We're right on top of it.

577
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,040
I've got the keys.
You wanna go down and see it?

578
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:24,959
No, thanks. I've had about
enough excitement for one night.

579
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:26,757
It's a lousy job...

580
00:50:27,205 --> 00:50:29,719
...but I can get free copies
whenever I want to.

581
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:31,682
Gee whiz.

582
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:34,359
What is that? "Gee whiz"?

583
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:36,322
I mean, you humoring me?

584
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:40,443
I don't have to take that shit.
What is it with people today?

585
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:43,039
You can't say anything
without getting a smart answer.

586
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:45,958
You have to be so goddamn careful
about everything you say.

587
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,355
You think I don't notice?
I know what's going on.

588
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:51,756
I overhear the customers
at the Xerox shop making fun of me.

589
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,358
I didn't mean anything by that.

590
00:50:53,525 --> 00:50:57,313
I mean, it was raining outside
and I invited you to come into my home.

591
00:50:57,485 --> 00:50:59,396
I didn't have to do that, now, did I?

592
00:50:59,565 --> 00:51:01,078
First of all, you're not stupid.

593
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:04,476
Look, I have trouble figuring out
the tax on checks. So what?

594
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:06,676
I mean, 8 percent is a bitch!

595
00:51:06,885 --> 00:51:10,719
So I make a few mistakes.
Sue me! Call your lawyers!

596
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:13,758
Okay, come on. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

597
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:22,404
- Wanna sit down? Come on.
- Okay.

598
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,759
I'm sorry I was rude before.
I really am.

599
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:31,675
Okay, no more crying. Please.

600
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:35,357
What a night.

601
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:38,323
Hey, Paul?

602
00:51:40,685 --> 00:51:42,676
Do you like my hairdo?

603
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:52,843
Yes. Yes, I do.

604
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:55,123
Then why don't you touch it?

605
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:02,202
- I don't wanna mess it up.
- You won't.

606
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:06,836
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

607
00:52:08,805 --> 00:52:10,284
Okay.

608
00:52:16,725 --> 00:52:20,479
I hear him. That's him.
I hear him. I hear him. No, it's okay.

609
00:52:20,685 --> 00:52:22,755
Thank God he's there. I can go home.

610
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:25,724
Excuse me. What's the matter?

611
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:29,116
Well, nothing, I just...

612
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:33,925
You know, I really got the feeling...

613
00:52:34,845 --> 00:52:37,120
...that you kind of liked me, no?

614
00:52:38,765 --> 00:52:42,997
You're not gonna leave now, not after
I brought you in out of the rain, are you?

615
00:52:44,685 --> 00:52:47,438
All right. All right. I'm going to...

616
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,641
Here's what I'll do. I'll...

617
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:55,324
I'm gonna go to the bar,
give your boss back his keys.

618
00:52:55,485 --> 00:52:58,875
Then I'm gonna get my keys,
then I'll be back, okay?

619
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,354
- Should take all of two minutes.
- Yeah, sure.

620
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:05,234
Julie, two minutes. Okay?

621
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:13,961
Well, well, what happened to you?

622
00:53:14,405 --> 00:53:16,236
Long, difficult story.

623
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:20,444
Honestly, when you didn't show up for
so long, I figured you did rob me blind.

624
00:53:20,605 --> 00:53:24,598
I had to close up here to check it out.
A neighbor told me he did see you leave.

625
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:27,199
But he wasn't too sure
about you either.

626
00:53:27,565 --> 00:53:29,601
But here you are.

627
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:31,997
I tell you, you had me worried.

628
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:37,162
How about a drink?
Sure look like you could use one.

629
00:53:39,245 --> 00:53:42,874
You don't happen to have any powerful
aphrodisiacs back there, do you?

630
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:45,237
She won't put out?

631
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:47,600
No, it's not for her. It's for me.

632
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,123
I seem to have gotten myself
involved with...

633
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:53,517
...one of your cocktail waitresses.

634
00:53:53,685 --> 00:53:56,836
- Miss Beehive, 1965.
- Yes.

635
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:00,756
Don't even ask me how.

636
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:03,525
So take off.
What's she gonna do, kill herself?

637
00:54:06,405 --> 00:54:07,884
Terminal.

638
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:11,203
What's up, Rich?

639
00:54:28,485 --> 00:54:32,239
You know, you're right. Just give me
my keys. I'm gonna go home.

640
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:46,717
What's the matter?

641
00:54:49,805 --> 00:54:51,477
My...

642
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:54,796
My girlfriend...

643
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:59,557
...just killed herself a little while ago.

644
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:02,634
- Took some sleeping pills.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

645
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,234
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

646
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:10,959
We had an argument, I told her
she had to get out of the apartment...

647
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:16,163
It's my fault.

648
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:18,284
God.

649
00:55:18,605 --> 00:55:21,324
Marcy. Marcy, Marcy...

650
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:26,878
Marcy!

651
00:55:42,925 --> 00:55:45,359
I don't know what to say. I just...

652
00:55:45,685 --> 00:55:47,801
- I don't know what to say.
- What can you say?

653
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:50,399
After all, it wasn't your fault.

654
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:58,079
I'm going to...
I'll be right back, okay? Try to stay calm.

655
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:11,601
- Are you all right?
- Why, yes.

656
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:17,273
- You said two minutes, though.
- I know. I know.

657
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:20,118
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Did you miss me?

658
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:24,480
Like I've never missed anyone in my
whole life, is how much I missed you.

659
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:28,194
- Really?
- I can't believe how much I missed you.

660
00:56:28,725 --> 00:56:31,159
- I really did miss you, I'm not...
- That's very sweet.

661
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:38,924
I'm gonna give you a present.

662
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:42,401
Don't do that.
That's really not necessary at all.

663
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,443
I mean, I've only known you,
what, an hour?

664
00:56:45,605 --> 00:56:49,564
No, no, no. You said that you were
gonna come back and you did.

665
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:53,083
In these days,
that is something to be commended...

666
00:56:53,245 --> 00:56:55,440
...and rewarded.

667
00:57:00,605 --> 00:57:03,199
- Do you know what this is?
- No.

668
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:10,561
This is a plaster-of-Paris
bagel and cream cheese paperweight.

669
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:12,957
I bought it from a local artist.

670
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,400
Kiki Bridges.
Did you ever hear of her?

671
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,918
Julie...

672
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:21,199
...I promised I would come back
and I did.

673
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:24,042
Now I really do have to go.

674
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:27,119
I gotta sleep.
You understand that, don't you?

675
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:29,435
And I promise I'm gonna
see you again.

676
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:32,358
I will. Okay?

677
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:35,879
You all right?

678
00:57:36,045 --> 00:57:40,243
Why do you keep asking me that? What's
with you, are you nuts or something?

679
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:43,603
Let's exchange phone numbers.
Wanna do that?

680
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,558
- Phone numbers?
- Yeah, come on.

681
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:50,719
It's a great idea. I'll write it on this.
Okay. What's your number?

682
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:54,798
My number is 5-4433.
Very easy to remember.

683
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:57,354
5-4433.

684
00:57:57,605 --> 00:57:59,960
That's not enough numbers, but okay.

685
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,922
5-4433.

686
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:05,358
- Okay.
- No, KL5-4433.

687
00:58:05,525 --> 00:58:08,437
I'm sorry. Okay.
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

688
00:58:13,005 --> 00:58:15,235
- Oh, God.
- Wait.

689
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:17,919
Get that away from me. Jesus!

690
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,917
Oh, really?

691
00:58:21,885 --> 00:58:24,274
You're gonna be sorry,
because I am going to get you!

692
00:58:27,165 --> 00:58:29,315
You're kidding me. Not again.

693
00:58:31,245 --> 00:58:33,201
What is this?

694
00:58:45,085 --> 00:58:48,122
Hey, let's knock off for tonight, okay?
My back's killing me.

695
00:58:48,285 --> 00:58:52,881
Come on. Let's look for my statue, man.
It's gotta be around here someplace.

696
00:58:54,045 --> 00:58:57,924
That makes me sick. That statue was
the first thing in my life I ever bought.

697
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,042
See what happens when
you pay for stuff?

698
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:04,515
Somebody rips it off. Shit.

699
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:10,882
It's gotta be around here someplace.
Let's cruise down Mercer Street.

700
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,883
Tom?

701
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,317
Tom, it's Paul.

702
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:37,555
And I was afraid to go in because
you don't wanna confront one of them.

703
00:59:37,725 --> 00:59:41,161
Some of them are drugged up and
you don't know if they have a knife...

704
00:59:42,365 --> 00:59:43,718
I wasn't out an hour.

705
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:47,844
I come in, the cameras are gone,
the lenses are gone, the whole thing...

706
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:51,600
- Did you call your insurance agent?
- I don't have insurance, besides...

707
00:59:52,445 --> 00:59:54,322
It's that guy again. Hey!

708
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:56,598
Don't let him get away.

709
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:02,397
- You know where he went?
- Let's go this way. Maybe that's him.

710
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:10,195
Come on, get your grubby face
out of here. Get out.

711
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:14,163
- Hey, fella, where you going?
- Restroom?

712
01:00:14,605 --> 01:00:18,314
You didn't just come use the bathroom?
The bathroom's for customers only.

713
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:22,000
I'm gonna order something, really.
I just wanna use your bathroom, okay?

714
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:23,678
Hey, didn't you hear me?

715
01:00:23,845 --> 01:00:27,838
Come on, you goddamn mutt,
get out of here and stay out of here.

716
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:46,478
Menu's on the table.
Make yourself comfortable.

717
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:48,317
I set it up for you.

718
01:00:50,085 --> 01:00:51,518
Thank you.

719
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:03,557
<i>Paul and Marcy, Horst and I
<i>went to Club Berlin for drinks.</i>

720
01:01:05,805 --> 01:01:09,115
I'm just gonna go put a quarter
in the meter at my car.

721
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:14,796
Let's see.
I'll have a burger, medium rare, coffee.

722
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:31,599
May I enter?

723
01:01:31,765 --> 01:01:34,074
I can't let you in at the moment.

724
01:01:36,245 --> 01:01:38,884
Will it be possible to be admitted...

725
01:01:39,045 --> 01:01:41,275
...at a more convenient time
for the club?

726
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:44,039
It is possible, but not at the moment.

727
01:01:46,525 --> 01:01:48,004
God.

728
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,761
If you're so drawn to it,
you can try and force your way in.

729
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,922
Got any money?

730
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:02,084
Yes, I have money.
Is that what you want? Money?

731
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:04,634
Why didn't you just ask that
in the first place, man?

732
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:07,273
Here. It's not much,
but it's all I've got.

733
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:11,040
I'll take it because I don't want you
to feel you left anything untried.

734
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:12,923
You keep the quarter.

735
01:02:13,285 --> 01:02:15,196
You'll still have to wait
a few minutes.

736
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,083
Hey, Mott.

737
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,524
Why doesn't he have to wait?

738
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:26,081
Tonight is Mohawk night.
If you had a Mohawk, you could go in.

739
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:32,283
Come on. We're both adults.

740
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:35,395
Why don't you just let me in!

741
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,643
Do you really wanna go inside?

742
01:02:37,805 --> 01:02:40,717
Yes. It's very important.
I've got people in there expecting me.

743
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:43,080
Why don't you just let me in.

744
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:45,643
You're sure?

745
01:02:46,645 --> 01:02:49,034
Yes, I'm sure.

746
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:55,433
Coming through, coming through.

747
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,435
- To your left and straight ahead.
- What?

748
01:02:58,605 --> 01:03:01,881
Right through there.
It's straight through there.

749
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:24,640
- Mohawk this guy.
- With pleasure.

750
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,555
Kiki! Kiki! Horst!

751
01:03:33,965 --> 01:03:36,160
Kiki! Horst!

752
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:39,681
Marcy's dead!
Neil and Pepe are crooks!

753
01:03:39,845 --> 01:03:42,279
I'm broke! Help!

754
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:45,399
No! Don't!

755
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:02,116
God, what have they done to me?

756
01:04:03,285 --> 01:04:06,163
God. I'll kill those barbarians.
Kill them.

757
01:04:08,005 --> 01:04:10,678
Bald. God! Get me a gun.

758
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:15,920
Hello? Hello?

759
01:05:11,805 --> 01:05:14,239
Taxi. Taxi.

760
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:16,314
Come here.

761
01:05:16,485 --> 01:05:18,601
- God, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

762
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:21,841
This is great.
Look, I got the money back.

763
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,041
Isn't that great?
Now you can take me uptown.

764
01:05:24,205 --> 01:05:26,355
Great. I'll be right back.

765
01:05:26,525 --> 01:05:29,562
- See how you like it!
- No, don't! No!

766
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,563
Oh, no.

767
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:36,239
No, no, no.

768
01:05:36,405 --> 01:05:39,715
I don't believe it. Did you see that?

769
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:44,802
- Look at your arm. It's bleeding.
- Oh, great.

770
01:05:44,965 --> 01:05:46,478
I feel terrible.

771
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:51,117
Look, why don't you come with me
and I'll get you a bandage.

772
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:54,436
- No, thank you. It's not that serious.
- No, I insist.

773
01:05:54,605 --> 01:05:56,004
No...

774
01:05:57,645 --> 01:05:59,203
- Do you have a telephone?
- Yeah.

775
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:05,917
I'm sorry. I just...

776
01:06:07,085 --> 01:06:09,474
You wouldn't believe
what I've been through tonight.

777
01:06:09,645 --> 01:06:11,601
You just wouldn't believe it.

778
01:06:12,765 --> 01:06:14,801
I'm an ice cream vendor.
Mister Softee.

779
01:06:14,965 --> 01:06:16,398
What?

780
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,721
You misunderstood.
I didn't ask what you did.

781
01:06:19,885 --> 01:06:22,922
I said, "You wouldn't believe
what I've been through tonight."

782
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:24,882
It's not boring.

783
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:29,924
And I have my own Mister Softee truck.
It's not. It's not boring.

784
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:34,078
Also, you need a Class Four
New York chauffeur's license.

785
01:06:34,245 --> 01:06:36,520
Guess who has one.
Got it on my own.

786
01:06:36,685 --> 01:06:39,802
Manhattan, please. Could I have
the number of Peter Patzak?

787
01:06:40,085 --> 01:06:43,361
That's P-A-T-Z-A-K.

788
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:45,117
- Need a pencil?
- No.

789
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:47,116
On Mulberry Street.

790
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:51,193
Thank you.

791
01:06:51,685 --> 01:06:54,961
Five, eight, one, nine...

792
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,164
...six...

793
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,484
...two.

794
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:11,124
That was funny.
That was funny.

795
01:07:14,445 --> 01:07:18,802
Patzak, please. P-A-T-Z-A-K
on Mulberry Street in Manhattan.

796
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,604
Thank you.

797
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:23,035
- Five, eight, six, two...
- Don't.

798
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,163
Nine, three, eight, zero.

799
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:35,994
Now I have forgotten the number.

800
01:07:37,405 --> 01:07:40,044
What is wrong with you?
Are you all right?

801
01:07:42,565 --> 01:07:45,637
I have had a terrible, terrible night.
Do you understand?

802
01:07:45,805 --> 01:07:47,318
I'm just trying to entertain you.

803
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:51,194
I don't want any entertainment!
And I'm sorry I did that. I'm sorry.

804
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:55,277
I'm under... Oh, God.

805
01:07:56,725 --> 01:08:00,001
I'm unable to get home tonight,
you know? I can't get home.

806
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:01,917
And I'm trying desperately...

807
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:06,235
...to find a place I can stay tonight.
Just sleep. All I wanna do is sleep.

808
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:08,714
I could stay on Spring Street,
but I don't want to.

809
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:10,159
- Why not?
- Why not what?

810
01:08:10,325 --> 01:08:12,520
Why aren't you there?
On Spring Street. Go.

811
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:16,200
Because the bartender who lives there,
his girlfriend killed herself tonight.

812
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:18,674
- And I think it's because of me.
- That's out, then.

813
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,563
That's right, that's out.
That is out.

814
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:22,841
That is not a possibility.

815
01:08:23,325 --> 01:08:26,556
So if you'd just let me
make this phone call...

816
01:08:26,965 --> 01:08:29,354
...you'd be doing me such a favor,
you really would.

817
01:08:29,525 --> 01:08:30,924
That can wait.

818
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:34,873
I hurt your arm and now
I want to dress your arm, please.

819
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:38,634
All right.

820
01:08:40,885 --> 01:08:43,080
- How'd they get there?
- What?

821
01:08:44,805 --> 01:08:48,161
- I was dipping papier-mch earlier.
- What is this?

822
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:52,002
"A man was torn limb from limb...

823
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:54,395
...by an irate mob last night...

824
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,159
...in the fashionable SoHo area
of Manhattan.

825
01:08:57,325 --> 01:09:00,954
Police are having difficulty identifying
the man because no form of ID...

826
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,434
...was found on his shredded clothing."
- Shredded?

827
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:07,484
"And his entire face was pummeled
completely beyond recognition..."

828
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:10,478
Forget that.
Can't handle things like that right now.

829
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:13,205
What does a guy have to do
to get his face pummeled?

830
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:16,642
- Jesus! Why does that hurt so much?
- Because it's infected.

831
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:18,955
- Stop touching it!
- I want to get it off...

832
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:21,595
- I know, I'll burn it off.
- You're not gonna burn it off.

833
01:09:21,805 --> 01:09:24,035
I just need matches.
I'll go ask a neighbor.

834
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:26,241
- No, lady, no!
- My name is Gail!

835
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:27,719
Lady, no!

836
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:34,757
No matches.
That's enough, now.

837
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:36,438
Where are you going?

838
01:09:37,365 --> 01:09:39,162
I'm going home.
I'm walking home now.

839
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:41,122
- How far is home?
- East 91 st Street.

840
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:43,276
East 91 st, are you kidding?

841
01:09:44,045 --> 01:09:46,115
Listen, I like you
and I don't know why...

842
01:09:46,285 --> 01:09:48,719
Why don't I give you a ride
in my Mister Softee truck?

843
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,364
How does that sound?

844
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:58,194
- Where's the truck?
- Right around the corner.

845
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:09,843
Well, come on.

846
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:15,244
Come on.

847
01:10:17,085 --> 01:10:18,484
- What's the matter?
- Shut up.

848
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,124
- What?
- Shut up.

849
01:10:20,285 --> 01:10:21,684
What's wrong?

850
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:24,003
- You're dead, pal.
- I'm what?

851
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:25,684
Gail.

852
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:28,604
Gail, what are you doing?
What's wrong?

853
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:32,281
What...? Gail? What is that?
Are you still giving me a lift home?

854
01:10:32,445 --> 01:10:34,800
What are you looking at me
like that for?

855
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:38,921
That's him! Over there, with the whistle.
That's him! Get him!

856
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:41,082
Oh, shit!

857
01:10:56,325 --> 01:10:58,885
Help! Help! Call the police!

858
01:10:59,045 --> 01:11:01,434
I went to school with your son!

859
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:06,121
I mean, Mom, it's me!
I can't... Oh, goddamn it!

860
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:29,763
You're so stupid!
Come on! Cut it out!

861
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:42,677
I'll probably get blamed for that.

862
01:11:53,965 --> 01:11:57,753
What do you want from me?
What have I done?

863
01:11:57,925 --> 01:12:00,723
I'm just a word processor,
for chrissake!

864
01:12:12,725 --> 01:12:14,636
Excuse me. Hi.

865
01:12:16,005 --> 01:12:18,155
I wonder, could you...

866
01:12:18,325 --> 01:12:19,997
It's okay.

867
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:23,404
Would you help me?
Would you please help me?

868
01:12:26,445 --> 01:12:28,117
What do you want me to do?

869
01:12:29,405 --> 01:12:32,715
Where do you live?
Can you take me home?

870
01:12:32,885 --> 01:12:36,924
Because there's certain things
that I, you know, will not do.

871
01:12:38,085 --> 01:12:39,996
I'm telling you in advance.

872
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:50,562
I really have to tell you something
before we start.

873
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:55,554
I have never done this
with a man before.

874
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:57,597
I'm a little bit nervous.

875
01:13:02,965 --> 01:13:05,001
Listen, can I...

876
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:07,924
Can I use your telephone?

877
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,956
- Sure, it's...
- I see it. That's great.

878
01:13:14,245 --> 01:13:16,713
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Get me the police, please. Right away.

879
01:13:16,885 --> 01:13:18,398
<i>Just a minute.</i>

880
01:13:20,285 --> 01:13:25,075
- <i>Twelfth Precinct, Fitzgerald.</i>
- Yes, officer. Thank God. Okay.

881
01:13:25,245 --> 01:13:29,761
My name is Paul Hackett. I'm in SoHo.
I don't know the exact location.

882
01:13:29,925 --> 01:13:32,439
I'm being persecuted
by a vigilante mob.

883
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:34,402
I'm sure you're aware of their actions.

884
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:39,434
Now, I have every reason in the world to
believe that my life is in serious danger.

885
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:42,799
Evidently, there's a series of robberies...

886
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,195
...that are being conducted
in this neighborhood.

887
01:13:45,365 --> 01:13:47,196
<i>Just get some sleep, buddy.</i>

888
01:13:47,365 --> 01:13:49,515
Hello? Hello?

889
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,604
Hello?

890
01:13:58,645 --> 01:14:00,875
I don't believe you...

891
01:14:01,245 --> 01:14:03,122
Oh, my...

892
01:14:09,765 --> 01:14:12,882
I'm sorry. I wonder...

893
01:14:13,605 --> 01:14:16,324
...could I just crash out on
your couch for a couple hours?

894
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,918
I am just beat.

895
01:14:18,085 --> 01:14:20,155
- Why don't you just go home.
- Pal...

896
01:14:20,765 --> 01:14:23,359
...I've been asking myself that one
all night long.

897
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,517
So? So, what happened?
Why can't you?

898
01:14:27,805 --> 01:14:29,124
All right.

899
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:32,480
I met this girl tonight, okay,
in a coffee shop.

900
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:36,320
She gave me her phone number.
So when I got home, I gave her a call.

901
01:14:36,485 --> 01:14:41,001
She said to come over. In the cab,
all my money flew out the window.

902
01:14:41,165 --> 01:14:44,237
Then I got to know this girl
and I didn't get along with her well.

903
01:14:44,405 --> 01:14:45,804
It didn't work out, so I left.

904
01:14:46,205 --> 01:14:49,515
I tried to take a subway tonight.
The fare went up. Did you know that?

905
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:50,959
- Yes.
- You knew that?

906
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,877
I didn't know anything about that.

907
01:14:53,045 --> 01:14:56,082
I haven't got enough money to get home
until I meet a bartender...

908
01:14:56,245 --> 01:14:58,156
...a nice guy who wanted
to lend me money.

909
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:01,078
I mean, he really wanted
to give me the money...

910
01:15:01,245 --> 01:15:04,317
I mean, they'd actually purchased
this piece of work here.

911
01:15:04,485 --> 01:15:06,441
I didn't know anything about that.

912
01:15:06,605 --> 01:15:09,517
She's also pissed off at me,
and for this I don't blame her...

913
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:11,915
...for the way I treated her friend.
Inexcusable.

914
01:15:12,085 --> 01:15:15,157
So I march in there to apologize,
but she'd already killed herself.

915
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,644
I was too late.

916
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:21,242
And he was about to give me the money
when all of a sudden his phone rang.

917
01:15:21,405 --> 01:15:23,157
His girlfriend killed herself tonight.

918
01:15:23,325 --> 01:15:26,397
Is that a coincidence?
No, because the same girl...

919
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,635
...who I came downtown to see
was dead too.

920
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:31,922
That's because they're the same person.
They're both dead.

921
01:15:32,085 --> 01:15:33,404
I couldn't believe that.

922
01:15:33,565 --> 01:15:36,637
He didn't know that I came down to,
you know... his girlfriend...

923
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:40,434
...because he would have taken my face
and he would have smashed it.

924
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:44,644
Luckily, there was this girl, who saw
everything, who let me use her phone.

925
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:47,524
Really nice about it too.
Let me use the phone. That was it.

926
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:50,074
Just use it. Pick it up and put it down.
Up and down.

927
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:53,442
Now she's the one in the ice cream truck
who's trying to kill me!

928
01:15:53,885 --> 01:15:57,275
They're all trying to kill me.
I just wanted to leave my apartment...

929
01:15:57,445 --> 01:16:01,836
...maybe meet a nice girl.
And now I've gotta die for it!

930
01:16:02,285 --> 01:16:05,914
That's the girl. That is Julie.
That's her. Look.

931
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,639
Julie! Julie, it's me!

932
01:16:08,805 --> 01:16:10,841
What are you doing? Come here.

933
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:14,918
Oh, God. That's the one.
That's the one. Unbelievable.

934
01:16:25,805 --> 01:16:27,079
No.

935
01:17:00,725 --> 01:17:02,443
What's the matter with you?

936
01:17:05,685 --> 01:17:07,801
You've gotta help me.
You've gotta help me.

937
01:17:07,965 --> 01:17:09,478
Get ahold of yourself, okay?

938
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:12,040
- Can he get a glass of water?
- You gotta tell them.

939
01:17:12,205 --> 01:17:15,561
Tell them it's not my fault.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

940
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:17,556
You've gotta make things
clearer to me.

941
01:17:17,725 --> 01:17:21,001
I just got back from the morgue.
I'm not thinking too straight either.

942
01:17:21,165 --> 01:17:23,201
There's an angry mob
that wants to kill me...

943
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:25,401
...because they think
I'm robbing apartments.

944
01:17:25,565 --> 01:17:27,681
I had keys to your apartment,
I didn't rob you.

945
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:30,564
I could've robbed you blind,
but I didn't. I'm not a thief.

946
01:17:30,725 --> 01:17:33,319
I'm not a thief. Right?

947
01:17:33,485 --> 01:17:34,998
I'm not a thief.

948
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:38,325
All right. All right.
Stay here.

949
01:17:38,485 --> 01:17:39,918
Wait! Where are you going?

950
01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:41,882
- To get your keys.
- Okay.

951
01:17:42,285 --> 01:17:45,960
Thank you. Thank you.
Go ahead. I'll be right here.

952
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:48,480
- Just relax.
- I will, I will.

953
01:17:53,365 --> 01:17:54,798
Thanks.

954
01:18:45,645 --> 01:18:47,442
He's in here!

955
01:19:18,005 --> 01:19:19,723
What can I do for you?

956
01:19:22,885 --> 01:19:26,161
- Why so empty?
- Invitation only.

957
01:19:29,925 --> 01:19:31,802
Then where is everybody?

958
01:19:31,965 --> 01:19:35,241
Beats me. Must have stayed home.

959
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:40,764
Who's she?

960
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:46,564
Oh, that's June. She's always here.
Usually nobody notices her.

961
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:53,317
If you're interested, you better hurry.
I'm closing up in a few minutes.

962
01:20:58,005 --> 01:20:59,597
Excuse me, miss.

963
01:21:00,845 --> 01:21:04,201
I couldn't help noticing you
and I wondered...

964
01:21:05,805 --> 01:21:07,204
...would you...

965
01:21:07,845 --> 01:21:09,324
...care to...

966
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,318
...join me for a drink?

967
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:17,797
Just talking?

968
01:21:18,565 --> 01:21:20,521
I'm having a really...

969
01:21:21,885 --> 01:21:23,841
...really bad night...

970
01:21:24,965 --> 01:21:28,082
...and I can't seem to find anyone...

971
01:21:30,565 --> 01:21:34,558
...who just will sit with me for just...

972
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:39,724
Without yelling at me
or something, you know?

973
01:21:42,045 --> 01:21:44,718
I obviously wouldn't approach you
in this state...

974
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:47,963
...were I not so...

975
01:21:48,485 --> 01:21:50,396
...unusually...

976
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:55,483
...intrigued.

977
01:21:58,165 --> 01:21:59,803
Well.

978
01:22:01,645 --> 01:22:02,998
There.

979
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:10,677
I bared my soul to you.

980
01:22:15,845 --> 01:22:17,244
May I?

981
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:59,314
- Why are you doing this?
- What?

982
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:03,397
You flirt with me...

983
01:23:04,085 --> 01:23:06,474
...you share your cigarette with me...

984
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:09,041
...you dance with me.

985
01:23:09,925 --> 01:23:11,916
You're nice to me.

986
01:23:13,445 --> 01:23:15,197
Why are you doing this?

987
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:22,078
I want...

988
01:23:25,205 --> 01:23:27,799
...to live.
- Okay, sorry, folks. Closing up.

989
01:23:28,485 --> 01:23:31,795
- I just want...
- Time to go home.

990
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:35,400
...to live.

991
01:23:36,485 --> 01:23:37,918
Live.

992
01:23:44,965 --> 01:23:47,479
Come downstairs with me, Paul.

993
01:23:49,565 --> 01:23:51,078
Come on.

994
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:42,923
- They got in!
- What is it?

995
01:24:43,085 --> 01:24:47,044
I have to tell you, I'm in big trouble.
Those people up there wanna kill me.

996
01:24:47,205 --> 01:24:49,765
- Is there another way out of here?
- No!

997
01:24:50,605 --> 01:24:52,960
- What is this?
- No, don't go in there!

998
01:24:53,245 --> 01:24:55,998
- Oh, what's this?
- No, don't touch that!

999
01:24:56,285 --> 01:24:58,845
No, don't touch that vat!

1000
01:25:02,525 --> 01:25:04,641
Oh, God.

1001
01:25:08,765 --> 01:25:10,164
- Come with me, Paul.
- What?

1002
01:25:10,325 --> 01:25:12,714
Come with me. Come on.

1003
01:25:12,885 --> 01:25:16,002
You're closed, you wanna go home.
It's only gonna take a minute.

1004
01:25:16,165 --> 01:25:19,999
- I'm telling you no one's in here.
- You cannot reason with this man.

1005
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:25,916
Don't move, I don't wanna
stick you with this stuff. Okay.

1006
01:25:26,245 --> 01:25:28,679
I just gotta put this piece here.

1007
01:25:28,845 --> 01:25:31,075
Hold up! No! Hold up!

1008
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:34,995
Do you at all sense the pressure here?

1009
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:38,921
This is very good for the pores.

1010
01:25:39,085 --> 01:25:41,041
Come on, it's a total search!

1011
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:42,514
All right.

1012
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:45,920
Good. No, no, no.

1013
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,843
Now, pick this up.

1014
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,399
Where's this lead to?

1015
01:25:54,845 --> 01:25:56,164
No. It's a private apartment.

1016
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:58,202
- Fine. Knock on the door.
- Wait, wait.

1017
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:01,043
I'll knock.

1018
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:05,762
- June. June?
- Yeah, what is it?

1019
01:26:05,925 --> 01:26:09,076
Sorry to bother you. Some people
wanna look around your place.

1020
01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:12,243
- Something about a robbery.
- I'm working! Can't you see that?

1021
01:26:12,445 --> 01:26:14,356
- I know, I'm sorry...
- Tough titty.

1022
01:26:15,285 --> 01:26:16,798
Excuse me.

1023
01:26:17,085 --> 01:26:18,757
Excuse me. Have you seen this guy?

1024
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:41,003
Doesn't look so hard.

1025
01:26:42,885 --> 01:26:46,241
- Is there another way out of here?
- No. That's it.

1026
01:26:48,765 --> 01:26:50,517
All right, we're moving out!

1027
01:26:51,245 --> 01:26:52,564
Come on.

1028
01:26:52,725 --> 01:26:56,001
Look, we're sorry we disturbed you,
lady, but we were sure that...

1029
01:26:56,165 --> 01:26:58,076
Okay, let's boot it!

1030
01:26:58,565 --> 01:27:00,635
Wasting time here.

1031
01:27:05,605 --> 01:27:07,118
It's okay. They're gone.

1032
01:27:07,285 --> 01:27:09,753
Great. Great.

1033
01:27:10,085 --> 01:27:12,315
Okay, will you let me
out of this thing now?

1034
01:27:12,485 --> 01:27:15,522
No, you're safe like this.
They could still come back.

1035
01:27:15,685 --> 01:27:19,439
Look, lady, you've been great. Terrific.
But can you let me out of here...?

1036
01:27:19,605 --> 01:27:21,914
Listen, you know,
I'm involved in this too now.

1037
01:27:22,085 --> 01:27:25,441
I gotta keep working on you.
They could still come back.

1038
01:27:25,605 --> 01:27:29,518
Lady, let me out of this thing. Now.

1039
01:27:29,685 --> 01:27:31,562
Do you hear me? Let me out...

1040
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:39,239
Okay, that's it.

1041
01:27:39,525 --> 01:27:42,244
I just wanna go upstairs
and check if they're still there.

1042
01:27:42,405 --> 01:27:43,884
Be right back.

1043
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,800
Didn't I tell you, man?
Check it out.

1044
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,680
- Check it out.
- Man, this is junk.

1045
01:28:25,165 --> 01:28:28,282
What are you talking about?
This is antiques, man. This is old.

1046
01:28:28,445 --> 01:28:32,404
It's plastic. Let's call it a night, man.
We got enough stuff already.

1047
01:28:35,245 --> 01:28:36,644
It's my sculpture!

1048
01:28:36,805 --> 01:28:38,875
Hey, man, be careful with it. All right.

1049
01:28:39,045 --> 01:28:40,956
Hey, man, is it worth taking this thing?

1050
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:43,923
What, are you crazy, man? This is art.

1051
01:28:44,645 --> 01:28:46,681
Art sure is ugly, man.

1052
01:28:47,085 --> 01:28:51,522
Yeah, that's how much you know.
The uglier the art, the more it's worth.

1053
01:28:51,685 --> 01:28:54,961
- This must be worth a fortune.
- That's right.

1054
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,320
- It's by that famous guy, Segal.
- Yeah?

1055
01:28:57,485 --> 01:29:00,397
You see him on the <i>Carson Show.</i>
Plays the banjo all the time.

1056
01:29:00,565 --> 01:29:02,203
I never watch Carson.

1057
01:29:02,365 --> 01:29:05,323
Yeah, well, that's how much
you know about art.

1058
01:29:06,805 --> 01:29:10,002
I don't know, man.
I'd take a stereo any day.

1059
01:29:10,525 --> 01:29:14,837
Yeah, what do you know, man?
A stereo's a stereo. Art is forever.
