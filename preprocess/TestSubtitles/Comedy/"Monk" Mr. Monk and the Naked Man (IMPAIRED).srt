Right here, back pocket.

Well, I use my gun,

Yeah. Uh, he doesn't like
the beach.

to look around a little bit,

Hey.

74
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:10,393
There should be a law against
murdering people on a beach.

75
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:12,648
Who was she?

76
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,348
Actually, we don't really have
that much.

77
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,748
Her name was Vickie Deline.

78
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,243
23. Lived in Mission Hill.

79
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:20,948
And she worked in a bar.

80
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,648
What was she doing here?
Well, don't know.

81
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:23,948
She parked her car up top,

82
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,504
left her keys
in the ignition.

83
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:26,548
Up the hill?

84
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:29,552
Why--why didn't she park
down here on the access road?

85
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:30,948
Any footprints?

86
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:33,147
No. Uh, it rained
this morning.

87

like those shoes.

89
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,047
Yeah.
These are my sand shoes.

90
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,394
Nice.

Never seen...

93

sand quite that color.

94
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,743
Mr. Monk, what would
you call that color?

 <i>I don't know. Sandy.</i>

97
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,109
No, just a shell.
Here she is.

98

99

Just missed her.??

?

102
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,250
I guess Dr. G missed that.

103
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,448
It's like a paper cut.

104
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,492
[stretching]
Oh yeah, those hurt
like the dickens.

105
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,547
What about
all the stab wounds?

106
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,348
Yeah, they probably hurt too.

There's still sand in it.
It's fresh.

find anything nearby?

Not yet.

Well, she was holding
something.

112
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,765
Maybe that's what the killer
was after.

113
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:37,948
She's missing
a fingernail.

00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,565
Yeah, he lives up there.

167
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:41,209
He's been hassling me
for years.

168
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:47,937
That guy owes me 200 bucks.

169
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,512
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

170
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,448
<i>You'll go blind.</i>
 <i>I know.</i>

171
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,072
But when?

172
00:08:58,548 --> 00:08:59,448
Mr. Magneri, 

173
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:01,248
i just ?

174
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,248
one photograph ?

175
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:05,148
I appreciate
your seeing us.

176
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:08,648
I understand
your time is valuable.

177
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,248
Actually, a reporter
worked it out.

178
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,648
I'm worth $300,025
a minute.

179
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,059
Well, then we'll
make it quick.

180
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:16,748
Do you recognize this girl?

181
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,548
Never seen her.
You didn't even
look at her.

182
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:19,748
Where's my coffee?

183
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:21,348
You've already had
four cups, sir.

184
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,048
And your wife said--

185
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,948
Do I need a doctor's note?
No, sir.

186
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,248
I got a clean bill of health
from St. Andrews

187
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,548
less than three weeks ago.

188
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:28,948
They checked me over,
head-to-toe.

189
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,248
MRIs, X-rays, blood tests.

190
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,248
Do you know what, I'm going
to bury the lot of you.

191
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,148
Coffee, coffee,
coffee now.

192
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:38,148
She was murdered
last night on your beach.

193
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:39,448
Oh, not my beach.

194
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,348
It should be my beach,
but it's not my beach.

195
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,883
Don't even
get me started on that.

196
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,248
I didn't actually pay
for this, did I?

197
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:46,448
No, sir,
that's a thank-you note

198
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:48,048
from the children
at Lincoln Elementary.

199
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,548
You donated some computers.

200
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,148
The zoning commission
meets on Wednesdays.

201
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:51,721
You want to come?

202
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,848
Sir, where were you
last night about midnight?

203
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:56,248
(Magneri)
I was here. I'm always here.
I was working late.

204
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,748
(Disher)
Did you see anyone
or hear anything?

205
00:09:58,748 --> 00:09:59,948
Well, as a matter of fact,

206
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,048
there was a woman trying
to get in last night.

207
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,248
She kept on ringing
the buzzer.

208
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,048
(Stottlemeyer)
Who was she?

209
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:03,823
How should I know?

210
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:05,348
Did she say anything?

211
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,878
Yes. Something about
a matter of life and death.

212
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,548
And you didn't let her in.

213
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,148
What, are you crazy?
Everybody wants a piece of me.

214
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:14,848
Everybody's problem's
a matter of life and death.

215
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,048
Yeah, I know.
Happens to us all the time.

216
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,350
Everybody wants something.

217
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,048
Listen, while we are here,

218
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,648
when I press play
on this thing,

219
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,148
why does it keep
sending me back to the menu?

220
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,448
I have no idea.
Call customer service.

221
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,748
No, no, no.
Ha ha.

222
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,348
They kept me on hold
for an hour and a half.

223
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:29,748
Look, my warranty
just expired.

224
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:30,848
If you could take
a quick look at it--

225
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:31,714
Lieutenant!

226
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,487
Holster your MP3.
That's an order.

227
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:39,148
Is there a security camera
by the gate?

228
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:40,148
Yeah, but it's broken.

229
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,548
That's a big surprise.

230
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:44,493
Look at him,
out there in public.

231
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:45,448
(Natalie)
Mr. Monk,

232
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,813
it's a nude beach!

233
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,748
<i>(Magneri)</i>
 <i>It's repugnant.</i>

234
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,048
<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>That's the word.</i>
 <i>Repugnant.</i>

235
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:53,148
Degenerate.
That's the other word.

236
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,247
Degenerate!

237
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:55,148
<i>(Natalie)</i>
 <i>Don't you think</i>

238
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,214
<i>that's a little bit harsh?</i>

239
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:58,448
[scoffs]
Being polite.

240
00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,648
Where was he last night?

241
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,548
<i>Exactly.</i>

242
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:02,248
We already spoke
to Mr. Singer.

243
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:03,804
<i>(Magneri)</i>
 <i>Yeah, well,</i>
 <i>speak to him again.</i>

244
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:06,848
Oh, he likes to pretend
he's all peaceful and new age-y,

245
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:08,947
but believe you me,
there's a dark side.

246
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:09,941
<i>I believe it.</i>

247
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,047
I can tell.
Even from here.

248
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,336
He threatened me once
at a zoning meeting.

249
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:16,925
Hit me with a microphone.

250
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,140
He's a nudist!
That's what they do.

251
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,480
They--they hit people
with microphones.

252
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,914
Captain.

253
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:30,680
He's the guy.

254
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:32,448
He says he was here
all night.

255
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:33,748
We're going to talk
to his staff.

256
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:36,248
Not him.
The <i>nudist.</i>

257
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:37,280
Singer?

258
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:41,048
I already called, Monk.
His alibi checks out.

259
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,248
He was in a lockup
all night.

260
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,300
I don't know how
he did it...

261
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,574
but he's the guy.

262
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,378
I still can't believe it.

263
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:56,197
She was more than my roommate.
She was my best friend.

264
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,530
I'm so sorry.
How long did you know her?

265
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,063
Three years.

266
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,478
We met at a bar
downtown.

267
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,848
She was waitressing,

268
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,350
and I was working across
the street at the hospital.

269
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,629
I used to be
a lab technician.

270
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,952
Used to be?
I quit...

271
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,442
about two weeks ago
to play the market.

272
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,647
Day trader?
Good for you.

273
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:18,994
<i>Well, we'll see.</i>

274
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,848
Ask me again
in a few months.

275
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:21,645
<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>Sand.</i>

276
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:23,807
<i>That must be Vickie.</i>

277
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,448
She'd been going
to the beach a lot.

278
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:26,779
Meeting a nudist?

279
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,506
A nudist?

280
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,921
Was she seeing anyone
in particular?

281
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,088
Uh, I think so.

282
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:34,848
She'd been hinting
about a guy--

283
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,073
Was he a nudist?

284
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:38,647
Let me put it another way.
Was he always naked?

285
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,742
Mr. Monk, you're not
letting her talk.

286
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,263
<i>I don't know.</i>

287
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,948
I think she might have been
meeting him last night.

288
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,448
That's him.
I knew it.

289
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,348
You don't know his name.
We all know his name.

290
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,847
Can I talk to you?
Excuse us.

291
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:51,548
Come here.

292
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:52,648
What are we doing here?

293
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,848
We should be getting
a search warrant.

294
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:55,248
We gotta get back
to the beach.

295
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,239
Get into his trailer.
Would you relax?

296
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,135
I have never seen you
like this.

297
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:02,048
We're wasting our time.
It's the nudist.

298
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:02,848
We both know it.

299
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,333
I don't know that, Monk.

300
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,248
Look, maybe you're right.
You usually are.

301
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,574
But I have to do
my job here.

302
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:13,005
I need to dot every I
and cross all the Ts.

303
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,053
You can appreciate that.
[cell phone ringing]

304
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:17,348
<i>You don't want</i>
 <i>any uncrossed Ts, do you?</i>

305
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,248
<i>Just sticking up.</i>
 <i>Some crossed.</i>

306
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,848
<i>Some of 'em</i>
 <i>not crossed.</i>
Hello.

307
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:21,748
With different angles.

308
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:24,339
That would be anarchy,
wouldn't it?
Yes.

309
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,284
And we don't want that,
do we?
No.

310
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,148
Sweetheart,
I can't leave just now.

311
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,037
Mr. Monk isn't feeling
very well.

312
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:31,721
He saw a naked man today.

313
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:34,423
I knew you'd understand.

314
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,169
So I'll be there
at 4:30.

315
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,580
I just need to get
the address.

316
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,548
'Scuse me.
May I use this?

317
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,549
Sure.
Go ahead, sweetie.

318
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,154
CDs, huh?

319
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:49,047
I've gone digital.
60 Gigs.

320
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:51,111
Over 5,000 songs in here.

321
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,348
Of course, I can't play
any of them.

322
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:54,848

00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:14,993
Positive ID.

480
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,442
You want to see
the fingerprints?

481
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,192
What was he in for?

482
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,293
<i>(Disher)</i>
 <i>Public nuisance.</i>

483
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,622
He was collecting petitions
at a strip mall.

484
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,092
Strip mall.

485
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,493
Doesn't mean anything,
Mr. Monk.

486
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,293
That's what they're called.

487
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,367
Well, he got out.

488
00:21:27,993 --> 00:21:29,693
Somehow, he got out.

489
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:30,891
And back in again.

490
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:32,999
Without the guards
noticing.

491
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,177
Excuse me.

492
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:37,654
Where did you get that?

493
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:38,996
From the guard.

494
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:40,541
How about this?

495
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,704
The guard gives Singer
an apple.

496
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,792
Singer chews the apple core
into the shape of a key.

497
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:48,592
He fashions a rudimentary kiln
using that light bulb

498
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:50,166
<i>and a sardine can.</i>

499
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:51,593
<i>He hardens the apple core</i>

500
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,193
in his kiln, and uses it
to pick the lock.

501
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,088
Thank you.

502
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:56,549
An apple core key.

503
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:58,389
No?

504
00:21:59,193 --> 00:21:59,865
Okay.

505
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:07,996
He slipped through the bars
and out the bathroom window.

506
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:09,816
How?

507
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:11,993
He wiggled through.
He's a nudist.

508
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:13,593
They're all double-jointed.

509
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,693
They are?
 <i>Randy.</i>

510
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:16,371
<i>Don't be so naive.</i>

511
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:19,117
They're not like us.

512
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:22,852
look,I-I have a theory.

513
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,111
I-I think--

514
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,998
I think they secrete a fluid.

515
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:28,794
<i>Like an oil.</i>

516
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:30,793
<i>It's odorless,</i>
 <i>but I can smell it.</i>

517
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,193
It makes them all slippery.

518
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:33,693
They can wiggle
through anything.

519
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:34,992
They're like slugs.

520
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,493
<i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>Monk, nobody wiggled</i>
 <i>through anything.</i>

521
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,193
There was a guard on duty
all night.

522
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,993
Then he's in on it too.
He's one of them.

523
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,893
Well, what about the 20 cops
that are outside?

524
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,196
They're all in on it!

525
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:44,657
Don't you see?

526
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:46,843
It's a cabal.

527
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,092
What?
 <i>A cabal.</i>

528
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,193
<i>It's a secret society.</i>

529
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,593
Sometimes they're naked.

530
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:54,093
Sometimes they go around dressed
to confuse us.

531
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:55,193
Well, they're certainly
doing that.

532
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:56,593
Have you read their literature?

533
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,593
I have.
They want to convert us all.

534
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,293
<i>And they won't stop</i>
 <i>until we're all</i>

535
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:03,593
like them, on beaches,
in parks,

536
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,793
hanging out...
everything hanging out.

537
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,362
Hanging and hanging.

538
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:10,730
Captain, there's only one way
to deal with them.

539
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,397
We gotta ship them back.

540
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,639
<i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>Ship them back where, Monk?</i>

541
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:22,649
Exactly.

542
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,480
Sit down.

543
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:33,691
Sit down.

544
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:44,975
Sit down

545
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,093
Look, I don't know
what happened

546
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,393
on that beach
Monday night.

547
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:52,993
I do not know
who killed that girl.

548
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,839
Actually,
I have another--
Let me finish.

549
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:56,392
Don't you talk.

550
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,902
This is not a conversation.

551
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:00,788
This is an intervention.

552
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:02,795
I'll tell you
what I do know.

553
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:05,693
Number one--
it was not Chance Singer.

554
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:06,793
Captain!
Chance Singer

555
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,892
was in my jail
all night long.

556
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,513
Number two--
you are off this case.

557
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:13,008
You--

558
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:15,955
You-you're defending them?

559
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,225
Monk, this is
San Francisco!

560
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,893
There's a million weirdoes
out there.

561
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,679
Some of them
are wearing clothes.

562
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:24,633
Some of them are not.

563
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:28,193
And yes,
I am defending them.

564
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:29,518
That's what this means.

565
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:31,676
We defend them.

566
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:36,793
I spend a lot of my time--
too much of my time--

567
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,593
trying to keep bigotry
and racism

568
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:39,593
out of this department.

569
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:40,693
I am not a bigot.

570
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,093
Well, I don't know what else
to call it, Monk.

571
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,793
You wanna put this guy away
for the rest of his life

572
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,682
because he makes you
uncomfortable.

573
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:49,995
Look,
you've always had issues.

574
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,829
But this isn't just
another quirk or phobia.

575
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,593
Like, uh,
your fear of clowns

576
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:58,893
or round things.

577
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:00,390
This is different.

578
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:01,668
This is new.

579
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:04,220
And weird.

580
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:06,420
And ugly.

581
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:08,993
First of all, I am not
afraid of round things--

582
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,662
Monk,
you're a great detective.

583
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,505
Look at it
like it's a mystery.

584
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,159
There's something
going on here.

585
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,211
Something's going on
inside of you.

586
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:21,861
Figure it out.

587
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:24,682
Detective.

588
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,981
I don't wanna see you
back here until you do.

589
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,693
This is...
this is not fair treatment.

590
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:47,493
How do people
wear these things?

591
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,093
I feel like
I'm suffocating.

592
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:49,792
I know.

593
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,492
I'm chafing.
Are you chafing?

594
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:55,193
Hey, does anyone have
any more of that powder?

595
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:56,035
I need it.

596
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:57,192
Hey, there he is.

597
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:59,497
<i>Here he comes,</i>
 <i>here he comes.</i>

598
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:01,237
<i>Peter...</i>

599
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,023
<i>It's Magneri.</i>

600
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,493
Peter! Mr. Magneri.

601
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:06,993
Channel 7 News.
How do you feel?

602
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:08,106
I feel great.

603
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,593
I feel
the Board of Supervisors

604
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:10,937
will do the right thing.

605
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:12,893
They understand
that I'm just a taxpayer.

606
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:14,293
All I want
is a front lawn of my own

607
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:16,393
where I can relax
and play with my kids.

608
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:17,393
(Singer)
The problem is, Mr. Magneri,

609
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:18,793
Barr Beach
is not for sale.

610
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,193
It belongs to the people
of San Francisco.

611
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:23,093
Mr. Singer,
is that really you?

612
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,893
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

613
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:25,893
You look almost human.

614
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:26,692
yeah

615
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:30,093
California has been blessed
with 1,200 miles 

616
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:31,292
of coastline.

617
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,793
Surely there's another beach
somewhere

618
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,593
where Mr. Singer
and his freaky friends

619
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,147
can throw their Frisbees.

620
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:38,693
Look, the real issue here
is that

621
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,183
I am a high-profile
individual.

622
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,993
I need my own beach
for my privacy

623
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:44,738
and my personal security.

624
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,185
A young woman,
as you may recall,

625
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,153
was murdered on that beach
only recently.

626
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,585
And the police have been
questioning Mr. Singer

627
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:51,861
about that very incident.

628
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,182
You can't say that.
You can't just accuse people.

629
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:55,429
I'm not accusing you,
sir.

630
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:57,582
Adrian Monk
is accusing you.

631
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,585
Mr. Monk happens to be
the finest detective

632
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,684
in San Francisco,
and he has confided in me

633
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:05,735
that Mr. Singer
is his primary suspect.

634
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:06,663
And you believed him?

635
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,162
Adrian Monk is certifiable.

636
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:10,263
He was in my house last night
without a warrant,

637
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,862
hiding in my closet.

638
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:13,763
I was gonna press charges,
but frankly,

639
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:14,963
I feel sorry for him.

640
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,966
I hope he gets the help
he needs, I really do.

641
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:23,961
There's something
I never told you.

642
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,518
Something happened
when I was a boy

643
00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:31,696
There was an incident.

644
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:35,097
With a...
with a man.

645
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,193
Who was that?

646
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:41,094
I'd never seen him before.

647
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:42,359
Stranger.

648
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,741
How old were you?

649
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:46,929
I don't remember.

650
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:48,165
Young.

651
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:50,991
I was...so small.

652
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:55,389
I remember...

653
00:27:57,163 --> 00:28:00,654
I remember[voice breaking]
I was naked.

654
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,247
Take your time.

655
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:05,849
I was so naked.

656
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:09,241
I just hated
being naked.

657
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:11,484
And I remember...

658
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:13,635
I was crying.

659
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:16,605
And then...

660
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,799
he hit me.

661
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,163
Adrian, I'm so sorry.

662
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:24,225
There was blood.

663
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:27,086
There was blood everywhere.

664
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:29,757
I was screaming.

665
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:31,184
I wanted him to stop.

666
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:33,778
And my mother...

667
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,046
my mother was smiling.

668
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:40,463
W-w-wait, your--
your mother was there?

669
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:42,191
Why didn't she stop him?

670
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:44,063
She was supposed
to protect me.

671
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:45,266
He kept hitting me.

672
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:48,571
Swinging me around
upside down, and...

673
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,149
<i>You</i> were upside down?

674
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:58,049
Was he wearing a mask?

675
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,963
I never wanted
to be naked again.

676
00:29:03,963 --> 00:29:06,163
Adrian,
that man was a doctor.

677
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,568
You're remembering
your own birth.

678
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,063
Doctor...doctor?

679
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:14,475
Anybody else,
I wouldn't have believed it.

680
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:15,636
But you...

681
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:17,163
Doctor?

682
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:17,685
Mm-hmm.

683
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:22,452
Well, that would explain
a lot, actually.

684
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,582
The lights,
and my father

685
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,016
in the doorway
holding a balloon.

686
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,462
You feel better?

687
00:29:33,463 --> 00:29:34,907
[chuckling]
Yes.

688
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:36,407
I do.

689
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:40,920
Wow.

690
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,387
That only took
11 years.

691

[doorbell rings]
Hello!

692
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:51,763
Sorry, the door was open.
Natalie, listen.

693
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:53,763
Monk, I'm so glad you're here.
I was just about to call.

694
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:55,963
Something happened.
I was talking to Dr. Kroger.

695
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,763
I remembered something.
Mr. Monk.

696
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,563
There's been something
I've been trying to tell you.

697
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:00,663
When I was 19--

698
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:02,163
Is this gonna be
a long story?

699
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:03,023
Please let me finish.

700
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,562
I was an exchange student
in Greece.

701
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:06,263
And there was this
beautiful beach that was about

702
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,506
three blocks away
that I went to all the time.

703
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:09,763
Great.
And this is the thing,
Mr. Monk.

704
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:10,435
Um...

705
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:13,117
It was a European beach.

706
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,963
Which means...topless.

707
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:17,363
I don't care.
I had a breakthrough.

708
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:19,763
I was a nudist, Mr. Monk.
I was one of them.

709
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:20,763
I went back
four years ago,

710
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,763
so technically I guess
I still am one.

711
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:24,363
I was in the cabal.

712
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:25,463
No, Natalie, forget that.

713
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:27,263
I mean, maybe it means
you can't work with me anymore,

714
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:28,429
but I don't care.

715
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:29,763
I'm not apologizing for it.

716
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,063
I met the best people.

717
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,663
It was the most amazing time
of my life.

718
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:34,752
Great.
Natalie, listen.

719
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:36,663
I am not that guy anymore.

720
00:30:36,663 --> 00:30:37,463
It's okay.

721
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,963
I had an amazing session
with Dr. Kroger.

722
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,402
I went back.

723
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,463
I went way back.

724
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:46,663
Way, way, way, way,
way back, back.

725
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:48,205
Back, back, back,
back, back.

726
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,263
And I got past it.
This whole naked thing.

727
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,964
I understand it now.

728
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:53,215
Wow.
 <i>Yeah.</i>

729
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:54,363
And guess what
I just did?

730
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,205
I walked through
Bishop Park.

731
00:30:56,363 --> 00:30:57,363
You know, the big statue?

732
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:59,735
The nude statue
of the nude woman?

733
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:00,863
[imitates blasting lasers]

734
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:01,980
I looked right at it.

735
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:04,463
Mr. Monk, the statue
in Bishop Park is a man.

736
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,663
Okay, I glanced at it.

737
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,563
But I wasn't completely
and totally repulsed.

738
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:09,763
I didn't black out.

739
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:11,463
And I didn't throw up!

740
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:13,562
Wow. You know,
there's a word for that.

741
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:14,163
Progress.

742
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,163
Progress, that's me.

743
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,762
Only 312 other issues
to go!

744
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,463
Well, I guess we'll just
take 'em one at a time.

745
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,498
Let's start
with dryer lint.

746
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,363
Hey, I guess this means

747
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:24,163
you owe Chance Singer
an apology.

748
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:26,251
Yeah, I guess I do.

749
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,363
Maybe I'll bring him something.

750
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:31,563
Like a bottle of wine
or some overalls.

751
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:32,304
What's this?

752
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:34,372
What?

753
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,263
Oh, a note.

754
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,842
No, I mean this stationery.
This is...

755
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,477
This is from
Vickie's roommate.

The yellow copy is for you

You worked at St. Andrews
Hospital, is that right?

770
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:26,263
You were an X-ray technician.

771
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:28,163
Did you ever meet
Peter Magneri?

Peter Magneri.

00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:31,763
He founded Magneri Computers.

775
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:32,822
They make these.

776
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,682
I thought yours broke.

Life's too short, right?

779
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:45,663
Mr. Magneri had
a checkup July 23rd.

780
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,593
That's four days
before you quit.

781
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:48,963
I got a clean bill of health

782

from St. Andrews
three weeks ago.

783
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,742
They checked me for everything,
head to toe.

784
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:54,263
We just spoke
to the SEC.

785
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,063
Apparently, since July,
you've been very interested

786
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:57,463
in the Magneri company,

787
00:32:57,463 --> 00:32:58,794
except you haven't been
investing.

788
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,563
You've been selling short.

789
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,419
You've been betting
against the company.

Here's what happened.

793
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:12,162
Three weeks ago,
Magneri went in for a checkup.

794
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:14,130
You were the lab tech. on duty

795
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:16,263
You must have noticed something
on his X-rays.

796
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,663
Something serious.
Something that could kill him.

797
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,863
(Natalie)
It was the ultimate piece
of inside information.

You knew if anything happened
to him,

801
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,900
the stock would plummet.

802
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,999
All you had to do
was switch X-rays

803
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
and put a different label
on it.

804
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,400
Magneri got

Nobody knew how sick
he really was,

not him,
not even his doctor.

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,400
You quit your job
and started selling short,

When Magneri died,
you'd make a small fortune.

At some point,
Vickie found out.

Maybe you were looking
for a partner.

812
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Maybe you were just bragging.

813
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
But Vickie wasn't
like you.

814
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
She couldn't just sit back
and do nothing

815
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,800
and wait for another human being
to die.

816
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,700
She tried to warn Magneri.

817

You knew you had to stop her
by any means necessary.

818
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
That night,
Vickie told Magneri

819
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,000
it was a matter
of life or death.

820

She was talking
about him.
