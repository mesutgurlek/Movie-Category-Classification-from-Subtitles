I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life.

Perhaps death is sacred,
and I've profaned it.

For what a wonderful
vision it was!

188

I dreamed of being the first to give to the world

the secret that God
is so jealous of.

Think of the power
to create a man.

And I did. I did it!
I created a man. And who knows?

In time I could have trained him to do my will.

the secret of eternal life.

Don't think them.

No. No! It's the Devil
that prompts you.

202

It's death, not life,
that is in it all and at the end of it all.

have gone too far to stop.

Nor can it be
stopped so easily.

will do me the honor of visiting my humble abode,

I think you will be interested
in what I have to show you.

I thought you might
change your mind.

Why not tonight?

need a coat.

had better wait here.

but science, like love,
has her little surprises, as you shall see.

650
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,631
Yes, I hope so.

651
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,259
Have a cigar.
They are my only weakness.

652
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,181
Good, good.

653
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,736
Drink, good.

654
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,112
Good.

(CHUCKLING)

656
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:10,674
You make man like me?

657
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:13,802
No. Woman.

658
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,929
Friend for you.

659
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,599
Woman. Friend.

660
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,518
Yes.

661
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:25,772
I want friend like me.

662
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,274
I think you
can be very useful,

663
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,195
and you will add a little force to the argument,
if necessary.

664
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:37,492
Do you know who Henry
Frankenstein is and who you are?

665
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,453
Yes, I know.

00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:44,124
Made me from dead.

667
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,794
I love dead.

Hate living.

You're wise
in your generation.

We must have a long talk,

671
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,638
and then,
I have an important call to make.

672
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,477

673
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,563

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

676
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,490
That Dr. Pretorius
is here again, sir.

677
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,659
There. I knew it.

678
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,245
Send him away.
I won't see him.

679
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,580
I certainly will.

680
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,668
Good evening, Henry.

681
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,256
Baroness, I've not
yet had the opportunity

682
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,801
of offering you my congratulations on your marriage.

683
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:38,386
Pray accept them now.

684
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,638
Dr. Pretorius,

685
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,766
I don't know what your business is with my husband,

686
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,601
but whatever it may be,
I tell you frankly

687
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,895
that I am not frightened of it or of you.

688
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,982
Henry's been very ill.
He's in no state to be alarmed or annoyed.

689
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,777
Your visit now
is most unwelcome.

690
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,906
Henry, I heard
the carriage drive up.

691
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,449
I'll see that
the baggage is put in.

692
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,243
Then we're leaving.

693
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:12,253
I think you know
why I am here, Henry.

694
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,590
All the necessary
preparations are made.

695
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,842
My part in the experiment
is complete.

696
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,513
I have created by my method
a perfect human brain,

697
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,057
already living but dormant.

698
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,100
Everything is now ready
for you and me

699
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,102
to begin our
supreme collaboration.

700
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,106
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
I don't want to hear!

701
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,442
I've changed my mind.

702
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,653
I won't do it.

703
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,488
I expected this.

704
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,076
I thought we might need
another assistant.

705
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,037
Perhaps he can
persuade you.

706
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,206
Nothing can persuade me.

707
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,041
We shall see.

708
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,127
No! Not that!

709
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,004
Oh, he's quite harmless,

I'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,253
Yes. Must.

720
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,921
Get him out.

721
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,007
I won't even discuss it
until he's gone.

722

Never.

00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:50,716

Is there any life yet?

No. Not life itself yet.

780
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:04,188
This is only
the simulacrum of life.

781
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:07,859
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

782
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,318
We must be patient.

783
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,237
The human heart
is more complex

784
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,156
than any other
part of the body.

785
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,409
Look. The beat
is increasing.

Yes.

Shall I increase
the current?

789
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,420
This heart is useless.

790
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,964
I must have another,

791
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,426
and it must be
sound and young.

You promise me
1,000 crowns?

It will be well worth it,
and the Baron will pay.

Yes, yes.
Go and get it.

I'll go into that room,
and I'll take my knife out and I'll get it.

00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,096
I'll hold her down,
and there'll she be.

00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,641
Where, I ask you.
Where will she be?

806
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,810
A thousand crowns.

807
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,825
It's beating perfectly,

808
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,410
just as in life!

809
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,621
Oh, if only I can
keep it going until...

810
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,164
It was a very fresh one.

811
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,960
Where did you get it?

812
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,838
I gave the gendarme
50 crowns.

813
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,757
