Don't let results like this fool you.

159
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:23,001
All right?

162
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,600
See you, Carlos. La vida loca!

163
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,484
What a phoney.

164
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,526
I'd give anything to go on
a two-week stakeout with that man.

165
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,442
What did you hear happened
on the stakeout between him and Rachel?

166
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:49,727
I didn't hear anything.
No, it's not what I heard, it's what I saw.

167
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,086
It's what I saw.
I saw the look on her face.

168
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,046
Every woman recognizes that look.

169
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,201
What's that look?
Look of total satisfaction.

Guy gets a couple missions
in Latin America,

171
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:09,246
all of a sudden he's a Julio Iglesias.

172
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,049
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

173
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:11,799
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

174
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,880
Is this my stuff?
Oh, easy.

175
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:17,485
This is Carlos' stuff. This is yours.

176
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,119
Where's my monofilament
phone descender?

177
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,359
I didn't get one of these exploding
pagers. I don't see one of those.

178
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,317
You got the micro GPS.

179
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,922
Micro?

180
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:34,644
This is your spy-cam.

181
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,522
This is Carlos' spy-cam,
and this is my spy-cam?

182
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,327
Look at the size of this thing!

183
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,923
Size matters.
But in the spy world, it's reversed.

184
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,764
You want people to say, " Look how
small and sexy and sleek this is."

185
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,683
Not, " How huge this is! Look what he
pulled out of his pants. It's huge!"

186
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:58,922
People will laugh at me if I pull this
out. Is that his escape module?

187
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,286
Yes, it is. I know, everybody wants
to be like Carlos.

188
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,838
I don't want to be like Carlos,
but I can't help noticing

189
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,763
that my stuff looks like you can get it
from RadioShack in 1972.

190
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,562
Uh-huh.

191
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:12,918
Yes, it is.

192
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,646
Right away.

193
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,926
All right, we'll finish this later.
It's a good start, though.

ANNOUNCER: Kelly Robinson, seen here
making his typical flamboyant entrance...

195
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,763
Shouldn't this be on the
Weather Channel or something?

- with a first-round knock out
of Blak e "The Blade" Lirette.

Kelly Robinson, baby!

Everybody "Hungary"

00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,729
with the European
heavyweight king, Cedric Mills.

201
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,039
I don't think you understand
how important it is to Kelly Robinson

202
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,928
that he be 58 and 0.
I'm 57 and 0 right now.

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,238
This man gonna be 58!

Alex!

208
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,838
Gen. Tucker, this is
Special Agent Alex Scott.

209
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,601
General.
Special agent.

210
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,841
I still love hearing that. I was just
a regular agent till a couple weeks ago,

211
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,206
and then around Christmas,
I got promoted to special.

212
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:14,888
Special.

213
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,922
We were going over the op.

214
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,762
We call it the "Switchblade."

215
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,808
They designed the thing as the first
electrochromatic invisible stealth aircraft.

216
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,766
But in the hands of the evildoers,

217
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,399
it's an untraceable delivery system
for weapons of mass destruction.

218
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,048
New owner: Arnold Gundars.

219
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,565
The boys over at CIA have access
to his overseas accounts.

220
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:36,607
The past five days, there's been
a significant depletion of funds

221
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,043
without any reimbursements.

222
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,280
In other words, the bastard's bought
the damn plane.

223
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,723
He just hasn't sold it yet.

224
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,398
I'll get it back, general.

225
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,006
Give me a minute.

226
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:50,838
Hot.

227
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,441
GENERAL:
Are you sure we can't use Carlos?

228
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,803
No, they all know him.

229
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,564
Without plastic surgery, he wouldn't
last five minutes on this case.

230
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,208
That's a shame.

231
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:03,961
That Carlos is amazing.

232
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,760
This guy...

233
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,720
You sure about this, Mac?

234
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,119
He'll get the job done.

235
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,437
Shouldn't Rachel be here?

236
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,361
She's already in Budapest,
setting up the op site.

237
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,599
You've worked with her
before, right?

238
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,680
I have, but not
in a stakeout situation.

239
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,085
This mission doesn't call
for a stakeout.

240
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,365
It wouldn't kill us to keep
our options open, I guess.

241
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,845
The European middleweight
championship

242
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,000
is being held in Budapest
in two days.

243
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,605
Gundars is a boxing fanatic. He's
throwing a party the night before.

244
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,237
Okay. Classic stakeout
scenario, right?

245
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,765
No, Alex. No stakeout. This is
more about hacking and tracking.

246
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:45,001
Now, take a look at this guest list.

247
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:50,323
You got to be kidding. This is like a
who's who of international bad guys.

248
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,799
Obviously, Gundars is using this
party as cover to auction the plane.

249
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,925
Your mission is to get
into Gundars' palace,

250
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,081
find out where the plane is
and stop him from selling it.

251
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,480
You put all these heavy hitters in one
place and security's gonna be insane.

252
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,847
Exactly. The way we see it, there's only
one shot we've got of getting you in there.

253
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:09,922
Stakeout?

254
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,523
No.

255
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,645
We've arranged cover.

256
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,083
You'll be working with a civilian
to secure entry.

257
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,238
A civilian?

258

You know how Kelly Robinson do.

259
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,482
Listen to me now. I don't
care what Gen. Patton says.

260
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,879
We don't need to do it this way.
I think if...

261
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,687
I kick ed ass all around the world,
you know me.

262
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,000
For crying out loud. Can we turn this off
or change the channel or something?

263
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,488
This guy gives me a headache...

You better watch what come out your
mouth next, little blond-haired surfer boy.

265
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,883
He never shuts up. Now he's
lighting into some poor reporter.

266
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,847
No, I'm talking to you. Better watch
what's coming out your mouth.

267
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,524
You digging your grave with your
tongue. You gonna get your ass whipped.

Yeah, I remember.
The pleasure's all mine.

281

Yeah...

282
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:49,917
Is that your plane?

Hey, step away from the man.
No autographs!

Whoa, Kelly, I thought
I was your assistant.

Yeah, yeah, the Mission Man.
Right. Right.

289
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:13,645
It's not a good idea to tell them who I am.
I think we should try to keep that down.

290
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,039
Hey, man, relax, I ain't no fool.
I ain't tell them who you was.

291
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,882
I told them the mission was, I had to take
care of the president's retarded nephew.

292

Wait a second, what?
Yeah, they think you're a retard, man.

Wha...?

294
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,121
All you gotta do is get you some drool, a
plastic helmet and zip your jacket up tight.

295
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,280
You get that mentally challenged look.
You'll pull it off.

Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, go ahead. What's up?

298
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,599
Excuse us. Uncomfortable.
Too many brothers standing around.

299
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,566
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

300
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,799
You're thinking you're going to be
the Harlem Globetrotters

301
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,039
and I'm gonna be the team
that stands there and looks like an idiot.

Yeah, that's it.
But that's not how it's gonna work.

me the ball. Remember Curly, he...

308
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,642
And the rubber band on the ball.
Right, doing the...

309
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,403
I like all that. Tell you what, Meadowlark,
you get me some of this chicken,

310
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,959
some of these sodas and get these bags
and get your ass on the plane.

311
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,245
Meadowlark. You heard
what he just said to me?

312
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,404
He told me that in this situation, he
would be Meadowlark and I'm Curly.

313
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,721
What kind of bullshit is that?
Curly, my ass. I'm Meadowlark...

314
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,799
I'm not Kelly Robinson.
No, you ain't no Kelly Robinson.

315
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:29,448
Kelly Robinson don't make
his own phone calls.

316
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,002
Kelly Robinson
don't even call his mama!

317
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,161
Come on, now. I'm just trying
to confirm the man's reservation.

318
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,047
All we need is a room.
That's all.

319
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:39,167
Don't make me get on that phone.
What the hell is:

320
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:41,200
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGU AGE]

321
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,409
It means, "Of course I speak English,
just not to you, sucker."

322
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,129
Guys, I speak Hungarian.
Need some help?

323
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:48,881
Okay.
Yeah, knock yourself out.

324
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,721
The brother gonna
speak Hungarian now.

325
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:53,158
Szia.
Hello?

326
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,318
Igen, igen.

327
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:58,004
You guys want the junior suite
or the high-roller suite?

328
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,038
We go with the high-roller.

329
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,598
The cheapest room you've got.

330
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,806
In the basement.

331
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,527
It's all taken care of.
Did you get an extra kusenum?

332
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,486
I'm gonna hustle up
and get these bags onboard.

333
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:15,278
Don't wanna get yelled at again.
Yeah, yeah. Hustle. Hustle on.

334
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:19,362
You better watch your job.
Rain Man got skills.

[###]

336
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,285
Kelly just took the stick.

337
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:27,888
I thought he was doing a phone interview.

338
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,607
What interview? The man was napping.

339
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:32,920
What? Now he's flying the plane?
Come on, Kelly!

340
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,884
Excuse me, sir, but there's a lot of stuff
for us to go over...

341
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,279
Didn't you see me turn on
the "fasten seat belt" light?

342
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,360
No, I didn't see that.

343
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,160
Sit your ass down!
When you get up, sit down.

344
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,962
Funny.

345
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,608
He's a funny guy.
I gotta remember that one.

346
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,444
When you did the stick up, I went
flying there! That's a good little trick.

347
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,839
I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

348
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,125
So back to business.
I'm gonna need you at the party at 8.

349
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,883
You know something, spy guy? We got to
change the schedule around a little bit.

350
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,325
Kelly Robinson don't be going to
no parties at 8:00. I ain't about to start.

351
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,957
Are you gonna be referring to yourself
in the third person the whole time?

352
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,642
'Cause that can get a little irritating.

353
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,800
Well, it's not gonna get
irritating until 11:00,

354
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:24,405
'cause that's when I'm
showing up for your little party.

355
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,323
Okay. Excuse me, gents.

356
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:31,802
I can't risk that. The party could
be clearing out by 11.

357
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,961
Look, ain't no party that Kelly Robinson
gonna be at gonna end at 11:00.

358
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,643
You know, that's the type of attitude
that can destroy a mission.

359
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,083
You know what can destroy a mission?

360
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:42,764
A lame-ass party that end at 11:00.
Let the shit go, man. I ain't going till 11.

361
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,726
Okay, drop the shit.
Okay.

362
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,882
I'll get T.J. or Jerry to get me in.
Yeah, go get T.J. He'll help you.

363
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,280
I just hope that the optical
diaphanous polyalloy transducers

364
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:54,440
can fit on one of their retinas.

365
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,600
What you say?
What you got over there?

366
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,806
This right here. It's one of the little things
we got for the mission. It's pretty cool.

367
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:02,529
It opens up here. I put this in my eye,
this little camera,

368
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,726
and then I give this to T.J.
Then he's able to see everything I see.

369
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,322
Wait a second here.

370
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:11,004
I don't know if I want T.J.'s eye juices
all over something that goes in my eye.

371
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,080
Maybe I should try that.
What you call it, poly what?

372
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:16,480
Polyalloy transducers.
The polyalloy should be for me.

373
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,480
Let me put it in my eye, then.

374
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,084
I put this in my eye?
Put it in your eye.

375
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,648
This is some spy shit?
Yeah.

376
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,925
Okay, I'll put this in.

377
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,647
And I got
the camera in my eye.

378
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,488
What's gonna happen now?

379
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,321
Can you see anything?
No.

380
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,079
What about now?

381
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,480
Hey, I see me!
Look, watch this.

382
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,721
That's bad. Shit, now I see the TV.
I'm seeing what you seeing.

383
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,722
Exactly.
I see me looking at you looking at me!

384
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,800
Hey, Kelly Robinson.

385
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,803
Look at this. Put this behind
your ear. It's a listening device.

386
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,199
Just stick it back here?
Can you hear me?

387
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,441
Yeah, it sound like you
in my head. Shit, I like this!

388
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,201
That's the type of thing
we're gonna be doing on the mission.

389
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,280
At 11:00, though.
No, not 11:00.

390
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,759
11:00. I already spoke. Kelly Robinson
has spoke. I said 11, it's 11.

391
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,840
It's a dead issue. Let it go.

392
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,284
Look at me. I said 11, goddamn it!
Get out my face!

393
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,644
That shit is bad.
Then give them back.

394
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,561
I ain't giving back shit. Take them.

395
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:12,448
That look funny, look like
I'm yelling at me. Take them back, punk!

396
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,158
I'm Kelly Robinson, baby, 57 and 0!
I'll kick your ass, baby!

397
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,685
That's what it look like when I'm whupping
somebody's ass? That's scary as hell.

398
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,409
That's scary. Kelly.
Oh, yeah, that's scary.

399
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,402
Look at that move.
Kelly Robinson.

400
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:29,404
Why you staring at me?
Do something with your time.

401
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,129
Okay, Kelly.
I heard that in my head.

402
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,645
You looking in the cockpit right now.
That's a trip.

403
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,279
What's our altitude?
About 37,000 feet.

404
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:42,168
What's that? Is that a little Cessna
out there on the horizon?

405
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:43,608
Where?

406
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,402
Hey! Surfer boy!

407
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,526
You seeing this, Kelly?
What are you doing?

408
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,283
Come fly the plane.
Wake him back up!

409
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:57,282
He fell asleep.
You put that dart in his back!

410
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:58,888
ALEX:
I thought you knew how to fly it.

411
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,562
Wake him up.
You better fly it.

412
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:04,768
I don't know how to fly no plane!
He put it on automatic, I hold the stick.

413
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,444
The deal is, we go at 8,
and I wake the pilot up.

414
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:11,203
Okay, then let the plane crash.
Let it crash.

415
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,361
You know that ride I just took?
Get ready for a great ride.

416
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,089
I'm ready to die, baby.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

417
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:20,480
Death? Ha, ha! That's how I feel
about death. Go on. Crash it.

418
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,960
This is getting crazy.
Wake the man up.

419
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,166
Do we have a deal?
Yes. Just wake the man up!

420
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,724
Hey, Ken. He ain't woke.
He'll wake up. He'll be fine.

421
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,120
So you a pilot this whole time?
I can fly a little.

422
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,041
Okay, I see how this is gonna work.

423
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:45,838
I ain't coming to no party at 8:00.
I told you 11:00. Here's your eye shit.

424
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,045
Hey, be careful with that.
Hey, my ass.

425
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:52,885

if something in my plane is broke...

Oh, God.

It wasn't my fault, man.
It was Mission Man.

I'm going downstairs! No, we in
the basement. I'm going upstairs.

Y'all got five minutes to get my ass into
the most expensive suite in this hotel,

or else, T.J.! Or else!
Or else what?

I don't think good underground.

But whatever it is, it's gonna be bad!
Let me tell you something. You falling off.

435

Your ass is gonna be back in St. Louis,
frying fish in your father's fish store.

436
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,602
Now, you mess up one
more time again. I'm waiting.

437
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,761
Please do it one more. Just please.
One more time.

438
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,046
One more time. Please let him do it
one more time.

439
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:51,962
Oh, my God.

440
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,929
Hey! How's the room?

441
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:01,402
My room is fine. Oh, did I say
11? I meant to say 12. Maybe.

442
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,719
What's with the attitude?
Excuse me!

443
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,845
Kelly Robinson? The famous boxer?

444
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,277
Yeah, one and the same, baby.

445
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:11,806
I can't believe it!
It's a big thrill for you, huh?

446
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:16,360
You don't know. I know you from
your advertisement for your perfume.

447
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,168
Kelly Robinson. TKO.
TKO. That's right.

448
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,240
It's not perfume. It's cologne.

449
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,400
Perfume is for ladies and sissies.
I put out cologne.

450
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:25,724
I so stupid.

451
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,245
So, Kelly, tell me...

452
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,687
Do you really wear it?

453
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,684
Well, you tell me.

454
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,163
I'd love to go to your room
and get your autograph.

455
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:48,244
Is that right? I'd really love to, but
unfortunately, my room ain't ready.

456
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,839
Let's go to mine. Is very,

457
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:53,765
very close.
Hey, hey.

458
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,363
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
Excuse me.

459
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,282
ALEX: No. Come here for a second.
Excuse me.

460
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,599
Don't you move. What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

461
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,885
Nothing. But if you let go
of my arm, in about five minutes

462
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,767
I'm gonna go across the street
and wax that ass.

463
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,762
Listen to me. For all intents and
purposes, you are a spy right now.

464
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,568
I can't have you running off
with some strange Hungarian woman.

465
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0. Going off
with a strange woman is what I do.

466
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,887
Mind your own business. Let me go do
this. Have a good evening, all right?

467
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,927
I guess I'm just jealous.
I can understand, but she chose Kelly.

468
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,364
Look, I'll hit it once for you, all right?
Good night.

469
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,757
See if she's got a sister.

470
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:27,966
If she got a sister, I ain't gonna call your
ass. It's gonna be the three of us.

471
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:31,087
Why don't you go see the city?
What you say your name was?

472
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,800
Are you going to scream it?
Yes, I will scream your name if I know it.

473
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,120
I had a couple of interesting
situations where...

474
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,520
What happened?
The girl tried to press charges... Hey, hey!

475
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,849
Hey, slow it down!
I got a lady over here.

476
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:53,601
Hey, that's some serious road rage.

477
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:56,445
What's up, man?
What's all this?

478
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:02,207
MAN: How long have you been working
for the U.S. government?

479
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,121
I work for the United States
of Kelly Robinson.

480
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,728
There was BNS agent on your jet.

481
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:07,288
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who was he?

482
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,485
Hey, man, y'all been reading
too many spy novels.

483
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,480
Maybe we should cut off his penis.

484
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:14,163
Cut off my penis? Why would you go
straight to "cut off his penis"?

485
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,643
What happened to "rough the man up"?

486
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,606
Cut it off!
Wait a second, now calm down!

487
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:21,728
You ain't cutting off nobody's penis!
I'll answer all your questions, but...

488
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,608
Who's the agent?
I'm not sure if he's an agent.

489
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:28,045
Who's the agent?
I don't know if he's an agent or not!

490
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,126
Okay, he's 5 foot 9, he's got blond hair...
His name?

491
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:36,077
I'm not sure, but he's very annoying.
He's definitely a BNS agent.

492
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,364
His name?

493
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,919
Y'all got these knives and guns
pointing at me, so I'm blocking!

494
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:43,557
He got one of them white names.
Alan or...

495
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:46,880
Take off his pants.
Why? Why you gonna take my pants off?

496
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:48,368
Please don't cut off
Kelly Robinson's penis.

497
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:51,847
Freeze!

498
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:06,087
Kelly! Kelly, shoot her!

499
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:08,680
Shoot her!
Kelly, shoot her!

500
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,077
Shoot her!

501
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,122
[GASPS]

502
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,762
Did I kill her?

503
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,208
Oh! Not yet.

504
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,960
Hey!
Kelly, Kelly!

ALEX: Stop shooting that.
What the hell's going...?

[LAUGHING]

507
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,525
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
Special Agent Rachel Wright.

508
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,283
Nice to officially meet you.
You're a spy!

509
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,485
Don't tell anyone.

510
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,321
You're all BNS?
It's all BNS.

511
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,322
AGENT: Big fan, Mr. Robinson!
Crazy way of showing it.

512
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:43,166
God, Alex, you been working out?
Yeah, a little. Why?

513
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,685
You just got buff.
Just doing curls.

514
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,245
Two, three drops of me
come out of this.

515
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,197
I hope you didn't mind. Alex wanted
to test you before we put you in the game.

516
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:55,599
So this whole thing was a big test?
RACHEL: Yep.

517
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,885
Unbelievable. That was great.

518
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,277
Really?
Really.

519
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:00,598
Oh, cool.

520
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:03,602
Guys, excuse us for a second.
AGENTS: Yeah.

521
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,363
RACHEL: Hey, good job.
ALEX: Nice work, nice work. Good.

522
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:10,643
I have seen hundreds of agents

523
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,119
put through that exercise, and
I've never seen it handled so well.

524
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,166
Never.
Never.

525
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:17,887
Yeah. Well, Kelly Robinson.

526
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,324
It was like your instincts, every step
of the way, were perfect.

527
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,684
Give them a little information,
but nothing important.

528
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:26,967
Like he's blond, 5'9".
How many guys fit that description?

529
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,087
That doesn't mean anything.
You were never gonna name names.

530
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:31,477
You know what you are, my friend?

531
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:34,647
You're a "why not" guy,
as opposed to a "why" guy.

532
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,800
What's the difference?
A "why" guy's like:

533
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:39,558
"Why are we gonna do this?"
"Why are we gonna do that?"

534
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:41,242
They're scared. They're afraid
to make a decision.

535
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,481
Afraid they might get in trouble.
As opposed to a "why not" guy.

536
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:46,446
He's like, "Roll the dice."
Man of action.

537
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:48,287
That's me.
Kelly Robinson's a "why not" guy.

538
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,009
The "why not" guys are
like eagles. They don't flock.

539
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,080
The few, the proud, the "why not."

540
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,479
The president wouldn't have called
me if I wasn't a "why not" guy.

541
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,724
Exactly.

542
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:58,481
Let me see everything
that's going on with this mission.

543
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,038
ALEX: Now, Kelly, we gotta
get you up to speed.

544
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,359
What you're about to hear
is a national secret.

545
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:07,488
See this man? This is Arnold
Gundars, premier arms dealer.

546
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,402
We believe he has this plane,
the Switchblade.

547
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:13,686
It's a sophisticated prototype
stolen from the U.S. government.

548
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,488
The Switchblade is the next generation
of stealth technology.

549
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,686
Undetectable to radar, infrared,
even the human eye.

550
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:21,726
Our mission is to get it back.

551
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,083
To make a long story short,

552
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:26,559
we can't find it,
because we can't see it.

553
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,441
Here it is with the electrochromatic
cloaking device engaged.

554
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,884
That's like one of those bugs
that look like a leaf.

555
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,767
One of the who?
On the Nature Channel

556
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,841
sometimes they have a bug that stays
safe because it looks like a leaf.

557
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,126
But it don't really look like a leaf.
It can make itself look like a leaf.

558
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,044
A leafy bug. It's a good name for it.
You should call that the "Leafy Bug."

559
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,444
That's a good idea.
I'll pass that on.

560
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:53,000
The Leafy Bug. We gotta go. We'll be
late for the mission. It's almost 8:00.

561
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:55,888
You owe me for one belt. Yamaguchi.
Hey, man, you got a cell phone?

562
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:58,119
Tuxedo.
KELLY: I'm gonna set that all up.

563
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:02,441
Hey, Alex, I'm sorry I kneed you and
roughed you up in there. You okay?

564
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,158
My gosh, don't be ridiculous. No, I'm fine.
I thought that was great.

565
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,285
When you kneed me, I loved that.

566
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:12,920
You did? You loved that?
Well, I... I just felt it helped sell it.

567
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,205
Made it convincing.

568
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:20,364
Don't forget, wait to turn this on. The
satellite's only good for the next 72 hours.

569
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,281
Let's hope that's more than we need.

570
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,599
All right, set us up.
You know the drill.

571
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:26,885
Hey, what's in that bag?
Spy stuff.

572
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:29,763
Rule number one:
Always have a sure way out.

573
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,124
Hey, Rachel.
What's up?

574
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:35,597
It's weird. It feels like
a stakeout, doesn't it?

575
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,683
No. Not really.

Hey, what's that for?

579
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:13,646
This, my friend, is how I break this case
wide open, with your help of course.

580
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,845
It's an exact replica of the pen
Gundars carries.

581
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,477
There's an IHB tracking device
built into the chamber.

582
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:19,923
Technology.

583
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,081
If Alex can plant it on him,
we can follow his movements.

Okay. Let's do this, then.

585
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:30,285
Nice shifting, Rachel. I know these
stick shifts can be a little tricky.

586
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,599
You make it look easy.

00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,326
Thank you.

didn't just say, "nice shifting."

I'm with you. I'm with the boxer.

Take him around back, shoot him in his

01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:40,441
How did big shot know
she was bad?

1351
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:43,601
I got 45 seconds to figure out
this logarithmic code,

because we'll blow up.

1353
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,679
Why don't you stick to your perfume
ads and leave the espionage to me?

1354
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:51,123
No, don't say that to him.

1355
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:53,883
Hey, Zorro, it's not perfume.
It's cologne.

1356
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,047
No, Kelly! No!

Come on, come on.
Here we go.

1358
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:11,646
Code invalid.
Come on.

1359
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:13,242
Eighteen, seventeen,

1360
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:14,958
sixteen...

1361
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:19,682
Thirteen,

eleven...

1364
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:30,006
Nine, eight, seven.
Sequence aborted.

1365
01:17:30,169 --> 01:17:31,284
I got it. I got it.

1366
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:33,565
No, I don't. No, I don't.
No, I don't.

1367
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:41,847
Don't do it! Put that shit down.
Put the gun down right now.

1368
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,837
I'm putting it down. Okay?

1369
01:17:45,889 --> 01:17:47,959
But I'm on your side.
I'm with BNS.

1370
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:50,689
What do BNS stand for with you?
Bitch that Need some Slapping?

1371
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:53,761
I was just trying to make sure Carlos
doesn't get to this computer.

1372
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:56,124
Think I believe that shit?
What's wrong with you?

1373
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:59,759
Hear her trying to flip the script?
Now she's saying she's good?

1374
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:02,363
I gotta hear this.
This should be rich.

1375
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:05,089
RACHEL: We've suspected Carlos
was dirty for months.

1376
01:18:05,249 --> 01:18:07,809
Mac and me teamed up with him
so we could nail him.

1377
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:10,529
Why didn't they tell me?
You know how this stuff works.

1378
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:13,403
It's all on a need-to-know basis.
You know that.

1379
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,367
Mac didn't want you protecting me
at the wrong time.

1380
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:19,327
That's all Carlos would have needed.
He's so insanely jealous of us.

1381
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,286
He is?
If he knew how we felt...

1382
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:23,679
KELLY: Go easy now.
Don't be creeping up and shit.

1383
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:26,409
She got long legs.
Bitch is sneaky. She'll kick you.

1384
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,560
He's always known
I wanted to work with you.

1385
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,720
You wanted to work with me?
Yeah.

1386
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:32,561
What, like on a stakeout?

1387
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,318
Don't you know
how I feel about you?

1388
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:39,686
That's bullshit.
My head's spinning. I don't know...

1389
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:43,205
I can't deny it. I feel the same...
You dizzy from massive blood loss

1390
01:18:43,369 --> 01:18:46,008
because the bitch stabbed you
15 minutes ago!

1391
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:49,047
I could have crippled him
for life if I wanted to.

1392
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:52,963
You've got full mobility in your leg, right?
It doesn't feel that bad.

1393
01:18:53,129 --> 01:18:54,357
Son of a gun.

1394
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:59,523
I had no idea.
Carlos was jealous of us?

1395
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:01,566
That's enough.
I can't listen to this shit.

1396
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:04,482
What's wrong with you?
You booty-blinded right now.

1397
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:07,959
It's like being snow-blinded, only it ain't
no snow, just a cute piece of ass.

1398
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:10,518
No. She's telling the truth.

1399
01:19:10,689 --> 01:19:13,249
You don't understand the spy world.
There are agents.

1400
01:19:13,409 --> 01:19:16,367
There are double agents, and
there are pseudo-double agents.

1401
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:18,326
It's actually pretty standard stuff.

1402
01:19:18,489 --> 01:19:20,286
Y'all stabbing each other is standard?

1403
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:23,601
Yeah. It's pretty standard.

1404
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:24,958
Look out!

1405
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:37,558
I'm watching your ass.

1406
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:41,365
Alex, you idiot!
I'm on your side!

1407
01:19:41,529 --> 01:19:42,848
I've had enough of this!

1408

There's Vitalis and shit all over...

1409
01:19:55,009 --> 01:19:59,321
He was coming like a buzz saw. If you
didn't grab him, he was gonna kill me.

1410
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:02,128
It was like looking
in the eyes of the devil.

1411
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:04,162
Where's Rachel?

1412
01:20:05,249 --> 01:20:07,638
Yeah, where is Rachel, huh?
She gone.

1413

Didn't I tell you
that bitch was bad?

1414
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:11,801
Why didn't you keep
an eye on her?

1415
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:14,847
You said she was good!
You can't listen to what I say.

1416
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:17,648
I'm bleeding from a knife wound.
I'm delusional!

1417

You said yourself I'm booty-blind.
I'm blinded by ass.

1418

You blinded now, but a minute ago...

1419

You two fools just let Rachel
escape with Gundars' computer?

1420
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:29,206
That has all the passwords
to his numbered accounts.

1421
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:32,805
It's worth billions of dollars!
Mac knew you would screw this up.

1422
01:20:32,969 --> 01:20:34,322
That's why he sent me...

1423
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:38,842
"Worth billions of dollars."
You hear this guy?

1424
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:41,484
He's still a bad guy, right?

1425
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:44,364
Yeah, he...
Well, I don't know.

1426
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:47,566
Everybody keeps flip-flopping
around. I can't keep it straight.

It's murky.

You said it was standard...
I know what I said!

1429

It's murky when there ain't
no girl involved, huh?

I see how it go.

1431
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:58,688
I'll tell you one thing. Good
or bad, I'm tying this guy up.

1432

We tie everybody up.
That's the new rule.

Why don't you stop stressing?
There's the Leafy Bug, baby.

1434

That's what we set out to do,
and we got it.

We got the plane.
We heroes.

Come on, why you acting...?

Why can't I play with it?

You broke it.
I broke the shit? How I break it?

Like a child, you knock it
out of my hand. I broke it?

Are you happy now?
How will I explain this?

1451
01:21:51,249 --> 01:21:54,047
I show up with the plane
and a broken remote.

1452
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,801
You think they're worried
about the remote?

1453
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:58,847
There's dead bodies all over the roof.
You think they'll care about that?

Come on, man!
You're right. Let's go.

I'm gonna get my parade, huh?

01:22:03,489 --> 01:22:06,481
Maybe so.
I'll definitely get a parade behind this.

Hell, no! I ain't okay.

You just crashed my parade
down into the river.

We had nozzle failure. Then the
thrust manifold went all haywire.

01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:45,927
You thought
you was gonna get away?

1499
01:24:46,089 --> 01:24:48,239
Thought you was gonna
make a fool out of Kelly Robinson?

1500
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:51,560
When I have my parade, I'll tie
your ass to the front of a float.

1501
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:53,760
Alex?

1502
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,799
How about a stakeout
in Greece for two weeks?

1503
01:24:57,969 --> 01:24:59,527
Stakeout?
Yeah.

1504
01:25:00,289 --> 01:25:01,688
Two weeks?

1505
01:25:03,889 --> 01:25:05,561
Hey! The answer is still no.

1506
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:08,926
I know. I was just imagining
for a second. There's no harm in...

1507
01:25:09,089 --> 01:25:12,320
You taking a long time. Tell her no.
You getting lost in this. No!

1508
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:13,888
No.
In fact, say, "Hell, no!"

1509
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:16,768
Hell, no.
Hell, no, bitch!

1510
01:25:17,089 --> 01:25:19,557
Sorry.
The spell wore off.

1511
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:24,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, boys, I'm glad
you guys got all the news coverage.

1512
01:25:24,769 --> 01:25:27,363
What's that mean?
She's always got to have the last word.

1513
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:29,565
She always gotta say some shit, huh?

1514
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:33,000
What she talking about, news
coverage? Ain't been no news...

1515
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:34,363
Is that Carlos?

1516
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,239
"Superspy hero thwarts..."
So Carlos was good.

1517
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:41,082
We the ones that saved the day!
Is this a parade?

1518
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,763
Yes! Look at the spectacle
and the glitter and shit!

1519
01:25:43,929 --> 01:25:45,567
That's my parade!
He stole my parade!

1520
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:47,640
I don't know what to say.
I know what to say. Bullshit!

1521
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,367
Bullshit!

1522
01:25:51,769 --> 01:25:52,918
Bullshit!

1523
01:25:53,089 --> 01:25:55,239
We gotta go to Washington
and get debriefed.

1524
01:25:55,409 --> 01:25:57,240
I ain't going!
I don't blame you.

1525
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:01,084
It's just, I was looking forward
to testing out the hover gel with you.

1526
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:05,087
The whatsit gel?
Hover.

1527
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,763
It's a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide.

1528
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,841
It's 12 times lighter than air.
You smear it all over your body,

1529
01:26:11,009 --> 01:26:12,761
and as long as you're in an
oxygen-rich environment,

1530
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:15,602
it allows you to float
down to earth like a bird.

1531
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:19,407
Like a jelly bird?

1532
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:23,278
Yeah. That's the street name for it.
"Jelly Bird." Exactly.

1533
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:25,565
They have a couple for us
on the transport plane.

1534
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:29,358
Plan was, they drop us off over D.C.,
and we float down like birds.

1535
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:33,283
There's press and photographers.
It's gonna be a whole spectacle, but...

1536
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,167
What we waiting on?
Let's do this.

1537
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,240
You'll do it?
Hell, yeah, I'll do it!

1538
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:39,718
Float like a jelly bird?
Let's go right now.

1539
01:26:39,889 --> 01:26:42,039
I used to always dream
I'd be able to fly.

1540
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:44,279
Are you serious?
My grandma said I was a damn fool.

1541
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,007
That's what made her
punch me the first time!

1542
01:26:46,169 --> 01:26:48,080
See, I told her and...
Hold on.

1543
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:50,843
Get a couple jars of jelly on the plane
and two parachutes.
