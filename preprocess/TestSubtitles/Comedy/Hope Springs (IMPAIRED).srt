You wanted to come?

323
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,679
Yes.

324
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,055
All right.
And Arnold, you?

325
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,182
I thought she was nuts.

326
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,936
We're not in the same tax
bracket as your other patients.

327
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,434
I think you'd be surprised.

328
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,485
Well, even if we were,
all due respect.

329
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,404
I really don't
see the point here.

330
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,738
So, you think there's nothing
wrong with your marriage.

331
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,036
Well, we've been married
31 years, isn't it?

332
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,620
It's not perfect.

333
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,626
But in your opinion,
it works well enough.

334
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,456
But you wanted to come.

335
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,884
You persuaded Arnold?

336
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,178
No. I mean, I paid for it.

337
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,349
With my own money,
from savings.

338
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,509
All right. So this is
really important to you.

339
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,932
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,725
Tell me why.

341
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:27,610
I want to have
a marriage again.

342
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,732
ARNOLD: Again?

343
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,109
If we don't have a marriage,
I don't know who does.

344
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,658
Arnold. Let's let Kay talk
and you can respond after.

345
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,278
Okay. Fine. "Again."

346
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,618
Arnold used to touch me.

347
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,824
Oh, God.

348
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,957
Not just... You know,

349
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,708
but he would touch my arm
or my shoulder, just to...

350
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,966
Just to, I don't know,
because he wanted to.

351
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,589
And now he doesn't?

352
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,303
And that bothers you.

353
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,354
Do you touch him?

354
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,725
Not really.
He doesn't like it.

355
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,354
Is she right, Arnold? Do you
like it when she touches you?

356
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,147
I don't know.

357
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,115
DR. FELD: You don't know?
I don't think about it.

358
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,781

(SIGHS)

360
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,371
What else, Kay?

361
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,207
Well, it feels like we live in
the house together like two...

362
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,551
Like two workers
who bunk in the same room.

363
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,553
Except we don't...
We're not in the same room,

364
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,226
but it just feels
like there's nothing

365
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,020
holding us together
except the house.

366
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,348
Nothing holding us together
like 31 years of...

367
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
Of what, Arnold?

368
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,734
Marriage.

369
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,529
What does that
word mean to you?

370
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,073
Means we have a marriage license
and I pay all the bills.

371
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,492
Not to mention
our two grown...

You really have
lost your mind.

We don't talk

Talk! What is there
I don't know about you?

379
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,756
About Eileen and
the skirts she bought

380
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,219
or if she took back the little
necklace with the tiki gods.

I just mean, I don't...

(SIGHS)

384
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,862
I don't tell Arnold how
I feel about anything.

385
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,691
And I don't know how he feels
about anything either.

386
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,697
I'll tell you how I feel
about this, I hate it.

387
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,653
All right. This is good.

388
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,783
ARNOLD: Good. Yeah.
Good for you.

389
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,198
The more we tear
each other apart,

390
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,033
the more money we have to pay
you to put it back together.

391

(CHUCKLES) Jesus God. You
people are worse than lawyers.

392
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,419
I understand how you feel.

393
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,841
Yeah?

394
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,045
You two have come here to try to
restore intimacy to your marriage.

395
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,926
So that is
going to be the goal

396
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,928
of our very focused
sessions together.

397
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,102
To find ways to communicate
your needs to one another.

398
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,099
To cultivate intimacy.

399
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:12,274
And to develop the tools to sustain
that intimacy going forward.

400
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,444
The first step in
rebuilding a marriage

401
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,322
is tearing away
some of the scar tissue

402
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,903
that has built up
over the years.

403
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,035
It can be very painful,
but it's worth it.

404
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,491
I like to think of it...

405
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:34,001
The metaphor of when you have a
deviated septum and you can't breathe?

406
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,046
You have to break the nose
in order to fix it.

407

(CHUCKLES)
ARNOLD: <i>Charlatan!</i>

408
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,264
No, he's worse than a charlatan.
He's like one of those...

(SIGHS)

410
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,638
Says he's "honed his method."
The only thing he's honed

411
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,769
is making sure that
if you don't walk in

412
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,441
with
a marriage-destroying problem,

413
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,439
you won't leave without one.

414
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,489
He's like those moisturizing eye
drops that make your eyes dry.

415
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,317
$4,000. That could
have been a new roof!

416
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,780
Did you look at his credentials or
even read that brochure that you...

417
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,909
I mean, my God!

418
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,204
Unbelievable! I'd like to have a
look at this guy's tax returns.

419
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,535
Whoo-hoo.

420
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,085
Oh, don't.
Come on, just don't.

421
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,963
You have to
stop yelling at me.

422
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,545
I'm not yelling!
Who's yelling?

423
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,050
Hey. Welcome back.

424
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,302
I'll have an Arnold
Palmer and a tuna melt.

425
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,805
You sure you're
ready to commit?

426
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,099
I'll have the soup
and salad, please.

427
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,726
Okey-dokey.

428
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,904
$9 for a tuna melt, it's canned
tuna, a slab of cheese and toast.

429
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,107

00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,458
Oh.

437
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,583
In case you're wondering,
we are never coming back.

438
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,298
I mean, if I had ever said so
much as even one unkind word...

or do you want this kind here?

to one of these things, whew.

I never help and I never...

we're going to go to Florida and see my

What was your first impression
of Kay, Arnold?

She was pretty.
Very pretty.

picked the wrong horse."

But two days later,
I found it.

the ring, in a cinnamon bun.

it's not like buying a car.

Arnold threw his back out.

his back got better.

00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,767
It still bothers me
a little bit. But also I...

479
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:24,977
He snores.

480
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,983
I have that
sleep apnea deal.

481
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,360
So he just stayed in the
guest room after that.

482
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,691
Yeah.

483
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,739
Did you ask him to come back?

484
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,489
No. I didn't think he'd...

485
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,742
No.

486
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,376
Hmm.

487
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,246
So it's been a long time since
you've slept in the same room.

488
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,883
When was the last
time you had sex?

489
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,428
Yeah.

490
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,136
Uh, I have no idea.

491
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,764
Well, let's try
to think about it.

492
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,276
It was four years ago, almost
five years ago. In September.

493
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,787
When Brad moved out
after college.

494
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,285
September 22nd.
I remember thinking,

495
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,868
"He's moving out on
the first day of fall."

496
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,703
We get the picture, okay?

497
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,914
This makes you uncomfortable
talking about this, doesn't it?

498
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,749
Well, sue me because
I don't want to talk

499
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,210
about having sex with my wife
with a total stranger.

500
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,966
You want to talk
about it at all?

501
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,138
What else do you remember
about that day, Kay?

502
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,473
How'd you make love?

503
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,850
How?

504
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,444
DR. FELD: Was it the missionary position?
Arnold on top?

505
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,736
KAY: Oh, yeah.
(SIGHS)

506
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,813

missionary position?

507
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:52,898
Oh, please.

509
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,321

that you enjoyed doing?

510
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,497
Mostly it was the same.

511
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,920
Was your sex life
satisfying for you?

512
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,588
Well, it was fine.

513
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,711
Yeah. All right.

514
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,085
Okay.

515
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,472
I would like to assign
you your first exercise.

516
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,966
What... What kind of...

517
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,767
Tonight, I would like you
to spend a period of time

518
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,344
with your arms
around one another.

519
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,519
(STAMMERING)
Well, what's the... Why?

520
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:31,145
Because I want you to remember what
it's like to touch each other.

521
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,568
Do you think
you can do that?

522
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,732
Arnold?

523
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,818
Well, maybe that's what...

524
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,029
I mean, forced intimacy...
Is that really...

525
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,113
It's not forced intimacy.

526
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,823
That's what it sounds like.
Oh...

527
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,292
What? We're supposed to be truthful here.
DR. FELD: You are.

528
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,959
Although... So what I'm saying is
that I don't think this exercise,

529
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,290
or whatever you wanna call it,
sounds like something...

530
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,875
It's not forced.
If I do that

531
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,926
just because somebody tells
me to, what is the point?

532
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,802
I don't think I like the idea
of anybody telling me...

533
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,306
I mean, the whole idea of this exercise
thing is totally ridiculous to me.

00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,513
I'm thrilled with the
progress that you've made.

641
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,762
And I think it's going to
make it that much easier

642
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,718
to proceed to
the next step.

643
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,470
Next step. That's great.
Let's get with it.

644
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,397
I mean, we're doing so well, we might
be able to get out of here early.

645
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,100
Okay, next step.
What is it?

646
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,902
Write a poem? Hold hands in public?
Sing a serenade?

647
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,654
Sex.

648
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,990
We're going to talk extensively
about your sexual history.

649
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,163
When it started. What it included.
What it didn't include.

650
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,121
If you had orgasms,
vaginally or otherwise.

651
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,498
If you had issues around
sexuality or performance.

652
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,463
Whether you talked
about sex or during it.

653
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,794
What your fantasies are.

654
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,671
If you ever
acted on fantasies.

655
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,927
Brought toys or sex games
into the bedroom.

656
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,804
Brought sex out
of the bedroom.

657
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,385
And once we've explored
all of those things,

658
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,141
I will give you
your first sexual,

659
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,473
not sex,
but sexual, exercise.

660
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,401
All right?

661
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,354
Let's get started.

662
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,065
Arnold,
would you like to begin?

663
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,652
Do you...

664
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,198
I think we ought to stop
this right now before...

665
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,874
We should just get
our things and go.

666
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,583
I'll go first. I will.

667
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,126
Fine.

668
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,878
Terrific.

669
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,258

670
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:03,638
Kay, let's talk about
what you liked sexually.

672

674
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,076
Did you have orgasms?

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

676

Do you masturbate?
KAY: No.

678
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,376
Not any more.

679
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,253
Why not?

680
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,296
Because at a certain point,
I just...

00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,502
(SIGHS)

682
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:40,429
I think I didn't want to think
about sex or about Arnold, even.

683
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,968
It just made me sad thinking
about what I missed and...

684
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,432
What about your fantasy life?

685
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,560
Do you have fantasies?

686
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,895
Mmm-hmm.

687
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,189
What?

688
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,366
My fantasy is that, you
know, we'll renew our vows.

689
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,543
Just a little small ceremony,
on a beach, maybe.

690
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,870
Right.

691
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,587
Maybe with the kids there.

692
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,010
Right. And do you
have sexual fantasies?

693
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,681
Imagine scenarios?

694
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,271
Having sex on a mountain top
or dressed all in leather?

695
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,098
(LAUGHS)

696
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,686
That's funny.

697
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,396
So, no.

698
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,199
I mainly think about Arnold
and things that we've done.

699
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,243
You never have fantasies
about things that

700
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,576
you haven't done ever?

701
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,661
No.

702
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,507
No.

Okay. Okay.

704
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,309
All right. Arnold,
let's talk about you.

705
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,021
What do you enjoy sexually?

706
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,101
Sex.

707
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,982
I'm going to ask you
to get more specific.

708
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,438
Okay, fine.

709
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,990
So you enjoy the actual sexual act?
Intercourse?

710
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,191
Yeah.

711
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,493
Missionary style.

(SIGHS)

Would you prefer that
to, say, oral sex?

714
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,586
I guess so.

715
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,089
Was oral sex an option? Is that
something that you would do regularly?

716
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,088
(STAMMERING)
No, I, I, I, I don't... No.

I was not very... I'm...

718

comfortable with that.

00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,023
Um, I don't know.
Both, I guess.

722
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,686
Okay. So, now you, Arnold,
would have been open to that.

723
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,364
What does it matter? She just
said it was not an option.

724
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,783
DR. FELD: What about
problems in the bedroom?

725
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,370
Have you ever experienced
erectile dysfunction?

726
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,368
(LAUGHS) No.

727
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,120

like Viagra?

728
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,199
No.

729

Yeah.

734
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,133

wanted to do, but didn't?

So, last night you had
the touching exercise.

805
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,205
How did that go?

806
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,423
How was that for you?

807
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,714
All right,
let's talk about it. Arnold.

808
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,224
How was it
having Kay touch you?

809
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,300
It was fine, I guess.

810
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,019
Did it feel good?

811
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,312
Did you get aroused?

812
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:54,982
How did that
make you feel?

813
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,400
Aroused.

814
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,652
What about you, Kay?
How did that make you feel?

815
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,646
Oh, I got aroused, too.

816
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,776
Did you know that, Arnold?

817
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,451
How am I supposed to know what
she's thinking or feeling?

818
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,701
How was it for you, Kay,
when Arnold touched you?

819
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,874
Oh, we didn't
get to that part.

820
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,075
Why not? Why?

821
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,878
Because we just stopped.

822
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,835
We did the exercise.
It was done. We did it.

823
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,544
The exercise was to spend a period of
time touching each other sensually.

824
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,470
It sounds like Kay touched
you and then you stopped.

825
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,389
Did you talk about it?

826
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,683
Whose idea was it to stop?

827
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,853
It was mine, okay. I just wanted to stop.
I wanted...

828
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,972
All right. Okay. I didn't
want to do it any more.

829
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,649
All right.
Well, let's go deeper, then.

830
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:38,817
Let's not go deeper.

831
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,987
It's not enough to just be here.
You have to try.

832
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,941
I'm not trying? I flew 1,500 miles
up here for this and I'm not trying?

833
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,026
All right. Well, then, let's
just try to figure this out.

834
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,281
Why did you
want Kay to stop?

835
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,828
I wanted her
to stop because...

836
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,323
Were you afraid?

837
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,408
No! What do I
have to be afraid of?

838
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,002
Fear... Hey, re-engaging can be...
I'm not afraid of my own wife.

839
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,001
Fine. Well, that's okay. It's okay.
It's normal to feel fear.

840
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,172
I did not feel fear!

841
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,091
Then why did you stop Kay
from touching you?

842
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,168
Let me tell you something.

843
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,628
I am done with this for today.

844
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,758
I am done.

845
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,589
I'll see you back at the room.

848
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,989
Kay?

849
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,787
What are you doing?

850
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,664
Dr. Feld said
he'd give us a refund.

851
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,666
What percent?

852
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,422
What?

853
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,923
Did he say he'd give us back
the whole payment, or...

854
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,676
Half.
Half.

855
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,718
I don't know what you thought
was going to happen here.

856
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,474
What did you...

857
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,894
I mean, there's no
magic pill or wand or...

Mmm-hmm.

860
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,395
It's ridiculous. You come
up here, you spend one week

861
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,981
and you're supposed to, what,
have a new marriage?

862
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,239
It's a setup.
You're set up for failure.

863
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,034
Then you feel bad about failing.
You see that, right?

864
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,953
You can't win.

Why the hell did
you bring us here?

866
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,591
You know how you think you're
always headed towards something?

867
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,095
You think, "When we get married,"
or, "When we have kids,"

868
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:18,553
or, "When the kids go
and it's just us again..."

869
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:25,359
You know, there's always
something to look forward to.

870
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,781
And one day, I realized that we are
not going towards anything any more.

871
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,946
And I guess I was
just not willing

872
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,619
to let go of things
getting better any more.

don't get a choice,

you know?

00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,378
Maybe you just
don't get a choice.

877

Don't forget your
razor in the bathroom.

You're back.

Let's talk about that.
ARNOLD: Let's not.

880

Let's just... I'm back, all right?
That ought to be enough.

881
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,511
It isn't, actually.

What do you want
from me, blood?

883
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,019
You have a lot
of anger, Arnold.

884
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,521
What do you think
you're so angry about?

885
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,023
I'm angry about everything.
I'm angry about being here.

886
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,322
Why? What are you
afraid will happen?

887
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,900
You want to know what? Fine.

888
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,784
What I'm afraid
will happen here

889
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,328
is what probably happens in every
goddamn therapist's office

890
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,368
every time any poor
couple goes in there.

891
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,916
You say whatever thing,
because somebody like you

892
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,494
is dragging it out of them and
then you can't take it back.

893
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,831
There are things in this life
that you don't say for a reason.

894

Like what?
What would you say?

895
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,459
Uh...

896
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,762
Tell me.

897
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,804
I want to know.
I want to know.

898
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,228
It's worse not knowing when there
are things that you're holding back

899
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,397
you won't say because you think
I'm too fragile or whatever.

900
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,315
No, it's not that. It's...

901
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,064
Something I can't hear.

902
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,066
All right, fine!
All right.

She has a way...
Say it to Kay.

904
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,532
You have a way of saying
that something's up to me

905
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,739
and then when
I make a decision

906
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,869
and it's something
you don't like,

907
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,245
you don't actually
say anything,

908
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,076
but you sure do get
your point across.

909
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,289
Well, can I just say, I don't like...
Is it my turn?

910
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,417
I don't like the way
that we always do

911
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,344
something for Christmas,
or an anniversary,

912
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,300
that's a joint gift for the
house, like a water heater.

913
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,429
You needed
that water heater.

914
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,136
Yes, but you did, too.
You shower.

915
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,556
Why is that
a special gift for me?

916
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,098
Hmm?

917
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,937
And I hate watching golf.
I do. I think it's boring.

918
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:35,155
And the shows where they
talk about golf, even worse.

919
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,733
It's like being
married to ESPN.

920
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,779
And when you eat ranch chips,
your breath smells.

921
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,614
I like ranch chips.

922
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,707
And I hate it when
you rub up against me,

923
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,286
like you just
expect me to do it.

afraid to make any kind of move.

926
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,129

tried to kiss you...

927
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,336
Well, you never kiss me.

928
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,756

You just want "it."

932

bet your life I want "it."

to have sex with my wife!

934
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,074
And, you know,
it's not pleasant

935
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,366
to do that with somebody
who doesn't want to do it.

936
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,411
But you never saw me...

937
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,422
What?

938
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,420
Go on, Arnold.

939
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,718
I didn't complain
because Kay didn't want sex.

940
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,009
Love. That's what I wanted.
Not just sex.

941
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,883
I wanted you.

942
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,846
Well, what about all those
years I wanted you?

943

All those goddamn years.

944
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,069
And I didn't cheat.

945
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,321
I didn't go to hookers.

946
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,691
I watched a little porn,
but who doesn't?

I was good.
I did the right thing.

bringing me here for...

who stopped, not me.

Yeah, for a while I stopped,
yes, but you stopped, too.

951
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,129
You did. You stopped.

952
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,557
Well, you don't just turn
it on and off, you know?

953
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,136
Maybe when it's off,
it's just off.

that was the best. Either of you.

959
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,499
Even if it wasn't very good.
Even if it was terrible.

960
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,550
Best time
that you remember.

961

Oh.

964
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,020
I remember one time.

965
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,019
Kay was pregnant.

966
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,776
Where were you?
In the kitchen.

967
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,105
She was making soup.

968
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:25,568
And I came in there and she kept
saying she had to stir her soup.

969
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:30,198
And pretty soon,
she forgot about that soup.

970
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,499
What do you remember, Kay?

971
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,340
Well,
we were on the floor, and...

972
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,838
And it was slow.

973
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:57,562
He... He put some dish towels
behind my head

974
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,143
so my head wouldn't bang on...

975
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,480
Wouldn't bump up against
the bottom of the cabinet.

976
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,907
That was... (LAUGHS)

977
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,373
Arnold, what else
do you remember about that?

978
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,247
Just wanting her.

979
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,922
Just wanting her.

in the kitchen.

983

getting to be too little because her

984
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,528
belly was getting so big.

985
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,610
You were very
attracted to her then.

986
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,529
Yeah, I was, and...

987

I don't look
like I did then.

No, it's not that.

No. I never could
lose all the weight.

993

of it in that way any more.

I had one.

1007
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,712
I had a fantasy.

1008
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,010
Was it...

Like you said, it was just us,

1012

and it was really different.

Something we've
never done before.

1014

Something new.

I'm going to ask you to take a
leap of faith and try something.

1016
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:36,554
It is most likely way out
of your comfort zone.

1017

Try to think of
it in terms of...

1018
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,475
Remember the metaphor
of a nose breaking?

1019

It's the nose.

the renewals of your

to be here and to be a part

KAY: Arnold,
after 32 years of marriage,

1489
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:44,785
I can honestly say that I love
you more than I ever did.

1490
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:47,663
The day I met you
changed my life.

1491
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,002
It made my life.

1492
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:55,254
And now I can't imagine
living my life without you.

1493
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,752
It wouldn't be any
kind of life at all.

1494
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:03,183
When I think about spending
the rest of my life with you,

1495
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:07,391
I only regret it
won't be long enough.

1496
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:10,148
So I want to now

1497
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,273
make this next chapter
of our lives together

1498
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:17,356
something that
we'll both cherish.

1499
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:23,286
I vow to watch more golf with
you without complaining.

1500
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,704
(LAUGHTER)

1501
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,283
I vow to watch less golf,

1502
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,794
and to buy you good presents
that aren't for the house.

1503
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,793
Maybe like jewelry.

1504
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:35,919
Like jewelry.

1505
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:38,548
Jewelry. Yes.

1506
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,762
I vow not to cut my hair
any shorter than it is,

1507
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,761
'cause I know
you like it long.

1508
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,966
Longer.

1509
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,723
I vow not to
complain so much.

1510
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,144
If I can help it,

1511
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,972
because sometimes
there's something

1512
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:53,103
that really needs to
be complained about.

1513
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:55,560
And I vow to go to one
of those sleep studies

1514
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,155
like you've been
asking me to go to.

1515
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,699
And I vow to take you
somewhere once a year

1516
01:37:01,774 --> 01:37:03,697
that's more than 200
miles away from home

1517
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:06,074
and isn't to see
a family member.

1518
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,575
Now, on this wonderful day,

1519
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:13,290
I give you
the rest of my life

1520
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:17,882
and I thank God every
day that you're in it.

1521
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:21,219
And I vow to
tell you how I feel,

1522
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,093
not just when you ask me.

1523
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:28,309
And I'll tell you
how I feel about this.

1524
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,559
I love it. I love you.
