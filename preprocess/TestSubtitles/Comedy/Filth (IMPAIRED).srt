-l said, l'm worried about you, Bruce.

Oh, right, l see. You're worried about me.

1070
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:20,707
What? Oh, don't flatter yourself.

1071
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:24,374
-l think you're a silly, silly, little, little man.
-You fancy me.

1072
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,999

apart from us having to work together.

1073

-Oh, God, you're pathetic.

You stink.
Do you know what, Bruce?

1076
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,999
You're the kind of sad case

What about Karen the other night
at the Christmas party?

1079
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,707
She was wasted, Bruce.

1080
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,207
Well, she shouldnae have
fucking drunk then, should she?

1081
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,915
She wanted a drink, so she had one.

1082
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,915
She wanted a ride,
so she had one of them as well.

So, don't treat me like a fucking rapist!

-Are you a lesbian?
-l'm not a bloody lesbian, Bruce.

and he's far younger than you

Go on, fucking hit me, Bruce!
Are you gonna hit me, Bruce? Yeah?

l didn't mean it.

As your colleague...

1098
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:08,582
...and as a human being, l'm telling you,
Bruce, you've got some stuff to sort out.

1099
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:14,082
OK? Then you might become
the sort of person

1100
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,540
that you seem to imagine yourself to be,

1101
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,665
although Christ only knows what that is.

1102
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:22,207
l used to be good at this job, Amanda.

1103
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:27,499
l used to be a good person.

1105

-Have you got a wife, Bruce?
-Yeah.

1106

You see, there's something wrong with me.

1114
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:20,082
There's something seriously wrong with me.

1115
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:26,082
Have you spoken to anyone?
Have you been to see a doctor?

1116
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,999
-Yeah.

-What's wrong, Bruce?

Didn't you?

You have to believe it wasn't me.
