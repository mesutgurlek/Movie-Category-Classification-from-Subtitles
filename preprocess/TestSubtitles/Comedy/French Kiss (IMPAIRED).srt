What?

1590
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,969
Nothing. You just
seem so different.

1591
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,930
Well, Charlie...

1592
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:18,600
l'm going through some sort
of transitional thing.

1593
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:22,228
After you called,
l decided to get to Paris

1594
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:23,396
and get you back.

1595
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,858
l hate to fly. Never fly,
right, Charlie?

1596
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,443
But l told myself

1597
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,903
no way would everything
l've been building toward

1598
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,780
be destroyed because
some pouty little...

1599
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,532
And this is before
l knew you personally.

1600
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:37,493
...bitch wanted to steal
herself a husband.

1601
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,787
So l bought the ticket,
boarded the plane,

1602
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,290
somehow made it
over the ocean,

1603
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,043
and then the most
extraordinary thing happened.

1604
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,336
What?

1605
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,047
Everything went wrong.

1606
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:53,176
So l was wandering
the streets of Paris,

1607
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,970
penniless, without
a hope in the world.

1608
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,305
And, let me tell you,

1609
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:58,556
you can do a lot
of soul-searching

1610
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,016
in a time like that.

1611
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,102
l realized that l've spent
most of my adult life

1612
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:06,522
trying to protect myself
from exactly this situation.

1613
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,191
You can't do it.

1614

There's no home
safe enough,

1615

no relationship
secure enough.

1616
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,615
You're just setting yourself up
for an even bigger fall

1617
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,493
and having an incredibly
boring time in the process.

1618
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:19,786
Sorry, Charlie.

1619
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,870
Oh.

1620
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:22,121

took up with Luc.

Maintenant
je comprends tout.

1639

1640
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,205
l don't know.

1641
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,832
He doesn't speak
much English,

1642
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,875
but we seem to manage
just fine.

1643

Yeah?
Yeah.

1644

transitional thing,
