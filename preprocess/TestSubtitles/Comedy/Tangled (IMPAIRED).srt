<i>(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.</i>

5
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:03,038
<i>Don't worry, this is actually
a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

6
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,587
<i>This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.</i>

7
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:10,038
<i>And it starts, with the sun.</i>

8
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:16,509
<i>Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,212
<i>And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.</i>

10
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:26,545
<i>It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.</i>

11
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,657
<i>Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?</i>

12
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:31,563
<i>You might want to remember her.</i>

13
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,356
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

14
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:39,028
<i>Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.</i>

15
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,389
<i>The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.</i>

16
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:46,525
<i>And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,</i>

17
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,007
<i>but she got sick,</i>

18
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,805
<i>really, sick.</i>

19
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,246
<i>She was running out of time.</i>

20
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,745
<i>And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.</i>

21
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:58,298
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

22
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,867
<i>Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.</i>

23
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,179
<i>You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,</i>

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,257
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

25
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:10,165
<i>and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.</i>

26
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:14,246
<i>And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.</i>

27
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:22,214
Mother Gothel: *Old voice: Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*

28
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:30,519
*Make the clock reverse,
(Younger voice) bring back what once was mine*

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,221
*What once was mine*

30
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,236
<i>Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings
to it, she turns young, creepy, right?</i>

31
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,499
Guard: We've found it!

32
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,609
<i>Flynn: The magic of the golden flower,
healed the queen.</i>

33
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,507
<i>A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.
(Baby giggles)</i>

34
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,608
<i>With beautiful golden hair.</i>

35
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,110
(Baby laughs)

36
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,246
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

37
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,024
<i>That's Rapunzel.</i>

38
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:26,583
<i>To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

39
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

40
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:39,136
<i>(Door creaks)
And then that moment ended.</i>

41
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:49,666
<i>Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine*</i>

42
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,948
<i>*Make the clock re...*
HUH!</i>

43
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,708
<i>(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,</i>

44
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,559
<i>stole the child, and just like that...gone.</i>

45
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:09,163
<i>The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.</i>

46
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,030
<i>For deep within the forest</i>

47
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,567
<i>In a hidden tower.</i>

48
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,484
<i>Gothel raised the child
as her own.</i>

49
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:24,410
<i>Rapunzel: *...take what has been lost, bring back what
once was mine, what once was mine.*</i>

50
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,447
<i>Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.</i>

51
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,790
<i>But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.</i>

52
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,606
Rapunzel: Why can't I go outside?

53
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,677
The outside world is a dangerous place.

54
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,032
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

55
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:44,043
-Gothel: You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Rapunzel: Yes, Mommy.

56
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,377
<i>Flynn: But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.</i>

57
00:04:55,534 --> 00:05:00,144
<i>Each year on her birthday, the King
and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.</i>

58
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:05,925
<i>In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.</i>

59
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,795
HAH!

60
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,879
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.

61
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:33,306
(Snickers)

62
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,003
GOTCHA!
(Screams)

63
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,693
That's twenty two for me.

64
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,318
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?

65
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,749
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

66
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,565
Yeah, I don't think so.

67
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,425
I like it in here and so do you.

68
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,446
(Blows raspberry)

69
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:58,837
Oh, come on Pascal, it's
not so bad in there.

70
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,680
*Sings "When will my life begin"*

71
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,924
<i>*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*</i>

72
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,142
<i>*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*</i>

73
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:23,999
<i>*Polish and wax, do laundry and
mop and shine up.*</i>

74
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,888
<i>*Sweep again, and by then
it's like 7:15.*</i>

75
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,207
<i>*So I'll read a book,
or maybe two or three.*</i>

76
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,915
<i>*Ill add a few new paintings
to my gallery.*</i>

77
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:42,331
<i>*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook
and basically.*</i>

78
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,377
<i>*Just wonder when will my
life, begin.*</i>

79
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,816
<i>*Then after lunch, it's puzzles,
and darts and baking.*</i>

80
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,336
<i>*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet,
and chess.*</i>

81
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,550
<i>*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*</i>

82
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:15,874
<i>*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*</i>

83
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:21,531
<i>*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall
some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*</i>

84
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:26,622
<i>*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,
and brush my hair.*</i>

85
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:30,920
<i>*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*</i>

86
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:34,941
<i>*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering,
and wondering...*</i>

87
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:40,199
<i>*Wondering, when will my life begin?*</i>

88
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:49,062
<i>*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*</i>

89
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:58,108
<i>*Just like they do on my birthday,
each year.*</i>

90
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:08,454
<i>*What is it like, out there
where they glow?*</i>

91
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:17,362
<i>*Now that I'm older. Mother
might just let me go.*</i>

92
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,369
(Rattling on shingles)

93
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:36,889
(Armor clanging)

94
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,402
Wow!

95
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,974
I could get used to a view like this.

96
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,441
-Stabbington brother 1: Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.

97
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:52,024
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.

98
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:55,606
We do this job, you could
buy your own castle.

99
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Aaaahchoo!

100
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,757
Flynn: Oh, hay fever?

101
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,827
Yeah.

102
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,589
Huh?

103
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,937
Guard: Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!

104
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:19,210
Can't you picture me in a castle of
my own?

105
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:20,295
'Cause I certainly can.

106
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,828
Flynn's voice fades: Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.

107
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,484
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

108
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:30,860
This is it. This is
a very big day, Pascal.

109
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,779
I'm finally going to do it.

110
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,569
-I'm going to ask her.
-Gothel: RAPUNZEL!

111
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,034
Gothel: Let down your hair.

112
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,832
It's time.

113
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:45,210
I know, I know. Come on, don't
let her see you.

114
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:52,292
Gothel: Rapunzel, I'm not getting any
younger down here.

115
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,165
Coming, mother.

116
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:21,355
Hi, welcome home, mother.

117
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:26,108
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do
that every single day,

118
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:30,147
without fail, it looks absolutely
exhausting, darling.

119
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:32,376
Oh, it's nothing.

120
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,422
Then I don't know why it
takes so long.

121
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,431
(Laughs) Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

122
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:44,696
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

123
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:47,571
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?

124
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:52,010
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

125
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,821
Oh look, you're here too.

126
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:58,153
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.

127
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,072
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...

128
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,724
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.

129
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,063
Would you sing for me, dear?

130
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,737
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.

131
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,717
<i>(Sings VERY fast)
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*</i>

132
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:25,089
<i>*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

133
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,615
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,

134
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:30,768
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

135
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,003
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!

136
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,383
TADA!

137
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,531
No, no, no can't be.

138
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,980
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.

139
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,341
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

140
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:47,082
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

141
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,880
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.

142
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,930
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...

143
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,613
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

144
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,650
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

145
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,748
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.

146
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:04,217
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

147
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,083
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

148
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:15,737
-What?

take me to see the floating lights.

always constant.

But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

They're meant for me.

157
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:44,592
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

(Chair drags on floor)

308
00:25:20,007 --> 00:25:21,007
((Slap))

309
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,444
((Slap...slap))

310

((Squish))

312
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:30,881
AHHH!

313
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:35,096
(Grunts and struggles)

314
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Flynn: Is this...hair?

315
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:44,481
Rapunzel: Struggling...struggling is pointless.

316
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:45,564
Huh?

317
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,634
Rapunzel: I know why you're here.

318
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,358
And I'm not afraid of you.

319
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,871
What?

320
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,445
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

321
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,262
Ah hah.

322
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,963
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

323
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:16,104
(Clears throat)

324
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,763
Says in noble voice: I know not who you are.

325
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,928
Nor how I came to find you.

326
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,869
But may I just say.

327
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:26,107
Says in lecherous voice: Hi!

328
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,753
How you doing?

329
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,259
The name's Flynn Ryder.

330
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,138
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?

331
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:40,029
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?

332
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,577
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.

333
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:43,725
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

334
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,519
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

335
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,671
I came across your tower and...

336
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:52,034
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

337
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,576
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll
never find it.

338
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:00,160
It's in that pot, isn't it.

339
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:01,855
(((Clang!!)))

340
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:05,783
Huh?

341
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,087
Ahh, will you stop that.

342
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:11,818
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

343
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,143
So, what do you want,
with my hair?

344
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,381
-To cut it?
-What?

345
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,041
-Sell it?
-No!

346
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,960
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,

347
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,740
is to get out of it.
Literally.

348
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,216
Wait, you don't want my hair?

349
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:30,193
Why on earth would
I want your hair?

350
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:33,679
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

351
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,695
You're, telling the truth?

352
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,149
Yes.

353
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,263
Hmmm.

354
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,730
I know, I need someone
to take me.

355
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,118
(Pascal chatters)
I think he's telling the truth, too.

356
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,700
Doesn't have fangs,
but what choice do I have?

357
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
(Chair bangs on floor)

358
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:04,187
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

359
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,856
-Deal?
-Look this way.

360
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:07,437
Oh...oomph!

361
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:10,009
Do you know what these are?

362
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,311
Nasal voice: You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

363
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,189
Lanterns?

364
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,330
I knew they weren't stars.

365
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:22,812
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,

366
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:26,851
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

367
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:30,462
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

368
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:34,741
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.

369
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:35,939
That is my deal.

370
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,645
Yeah, no can do.

371
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:43,491
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
aren't exactly, simpatico,

372
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:45,783
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.

373
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:55,991
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.

374
00:28:55,992 --> 00:29:00,188
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.

375
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,792
So I have made the decision to
trust you.

376
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,121
A horrible decision, really.

377
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:06,497
But trust me, when I tell you this.

378
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:12,602
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.

379
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:17,015
But without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

380
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,988
Let me just get this straight.

381
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,876
I take you to see the lanterns.

382
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,176
Bring you back home,

383
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,347
and you'll give me back my satchel?

384
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,605
I promise.

385
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:33,381
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.

386
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:37,222
EVER!

387
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:43,049
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,

388
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,641
but you leave me no choice.

389
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:47,056
Here comes the 'smolder'.

390
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:51,706
*sexy music*

391
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,610
This is kind of an off day for me.

392
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,398
This doesn't normally happen.

393
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,986
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

394
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,487
Really!

395
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,899
-Ooops.
-Flynn: You broke my 'smolder'.

396
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,703
You coming, Blondie?

397

I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

415
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,950
Mother would be so furious.

416
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:17,944
But that's okay, whatever she doesn’t
know won't kill her, right?

(Echoing) Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

I'm going back.

You know, I can't help but notice,

427
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:53,963
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.

428
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,415
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up
bits and pieces,

429
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,827
of course, over protective mother,
forbidden road trip.

430
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,412
I mean, this is serious stuff.

431
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,327
But let me ease your conscious.

432
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,059
This is part of growing up.

433
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,178
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

434
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:09,116
That's good, healthy even.

435
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,112
(Laughs) You think?

436
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:15,091
I know. You're way over thinking
this, trust me.

437
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:17,257
Does your mother deserve it?
No.

438
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,758
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?

439
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,760
Of course.
But you just got to do it.

440
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,166
Break her heart?

441
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,364
-In half.
-Crush her soul?

442
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,263
((Squish))
Like a grape.

443
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:33,055
She would be heart broken,
you're right.

444
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,966
I am, aren't I, oh bother.

445
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,565
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

446
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:42,212
I'm letting you out of the deal.

447
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,040
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.

448
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,634
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's
just turn around,

449
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,386
and get you home, here's
your pan, here's your frog.

450
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:50,142
I get back my satchel.

451
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:52,246
You get back a mother
daughter relationship

452
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,392
based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.

453
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,897
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!

454
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:02,775
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?

455
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:04,684
I will use this.

456
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:06,026

458
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,258
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?

459
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,188
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

460
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,885
Oh, sorry.

461
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,944
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

462
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,880
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

463
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:32,334
(Laughs)
Yeah, that probably be best.

464
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,317
Are you hungry?

What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell.

and the other part is
really bad man smell.

I don't know why, but overall,
it just smells like the color brown.

Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.

Probably be better off. This is a five

Gretel, go find some guards.

That reward's going to
buy me a new hook.

514

I can use the money.

What about me?
I'm broke.

Okay, I don't know where I am,
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

because I've been dreaming about
them my entire life.

00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:24,170
Oh stop it, you big lug.

620
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,649
Where does that tunnel led out?

621
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,726
Knife!

622
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:28,959

623
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:31,624
Flynn: Well, that got us safe.

624
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,964
Didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty, impressive.

625
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:37,307
Excitedly: I KNOW!

626
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:40,083
Subdued: I know...

627
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:45,327
Sooo, Flynn.

628
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,528
Where are you from?

629
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:48,714
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.

630
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:51,611
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.

631
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:54,087
Now I...I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.

632
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:55,901
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.

633
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,745
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.

634
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:00,102
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.

635
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:04,056
Here's my question though, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,

636
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:06,414
why haven't you gone before?

637
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,277
Uhh, heh, well...

638

Uh, Flynn...

640
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:18,675
Flynn!

641
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:19,675
(Horse neighs)

642
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,632

644

Who's that?

645
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,375
They don't like me.

646
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,804
-Rapunzel: Who's that?
-Flynn: They don't like me either.

647
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:49,107
-Rapunzel: Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment,

648
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,624
that everyone here doesn't like me.

649
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,124
Here.

650
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,190
(Captain laughs)

651
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:03,062
I've waited a long time for this.

654
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:16,072
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.

655
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:17,513
HAH!

656
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:18,576
(Neighs challenge)

657
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:29,207
You should know that this is
the strangest thing I've ever done.

658
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:35,643
How 'bout two out of three?

659
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,026
Flynn!

660
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:44,427
Flynn, look out.

661
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,765
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.

662
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:51,705
You should see your faces.
Because you look...

663
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,000
(Grunts) Ridiculous

664
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:56,200
((Pounding))

665
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:02,572
Flynn: Come on, Blondie.

666
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:03,866
Jump.

Hey, there's no point.

681
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:45,011

should have done this.

My real name is,

Someone might as well know.

693
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:32,532
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.

694
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:33,593
What?

695
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:39,896
I have magic hair,

We made it.

702
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:37,277
Her hair glows.

703
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:40,002
We're alive.
I'm alive!

704
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,834

-Rapunzel: Eugene.
-You're hair actually glows.

-Rapunzel: Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?

-Rapunzel: EUGENE!
-What?

707
00:50:47,183 --> 00:50:49,874
It doesn't just glow.

708
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,934
Why is he smiling at me?

(Coughing, trying to catch breath)

711
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:19,629
I'll kill him.

712
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,358
I'll kill that, Ryder.

713
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:24,851
Stabbington brother 1: We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

714
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:27,079

715

Gothel: Boys.

716
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:35,750
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

717
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,857
and think for a moment.

718
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:39,900
((Blades ring))

719
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,258
Oh, please there's no
need for that.

720
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:51,540
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

721
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,472
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

722
00:51:54,473 --> 00:51:56,485
would have made you
rich beyond belief.

723
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:58,483
And that wasn't even the best part.

724
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,070
Oh well, C'est la vie.

725
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,324
Enjoy  your crown.

726

What's the best part?

727
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:10,918
It comes with revenge
on Flynn Ryder.

(fire crackles)

729
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:22,285
So you're being strangely cryptic as you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.

00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:24,689
-Aaah!
-Sorry.

Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?

No, I'm just very interested in your hair.
and the magical qualities that it possesses.

Forever, I guess.

747
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:49,109
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.

748

They wanted to take it for themselves.

749

But, once it's cut.

750
00:53:53,812 --> 00:53:56,500
It turns brown, and looses its power.

No...yes?

758
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:28,433

It's a little bit of a downer.

Heh.

765
00:54:57,146 --> 00:54:58,741
There was this book.

766
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:01,342
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing
to ever brag about, of course.

Ahh, well no.

772

Actually, he had enough
money to do anything that he wanted to do.

He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.

And...and, for a kid,
with nothing.

I don't know, I...

776

It just seemed like a better option.

777
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:32,561
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?

778
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,127
It could ruin my whole reputation.

779
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:38,034
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

780

783

I, I should get some
more firewood.

Rapunzel: Hey.

785
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:02,605
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.

786
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:07,394
Well, then you'd be the first.

787

791

792

How did you find me?

793

Oh, it was easy really.

794
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:35,381
I just listened for the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.

795
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,963
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.

796
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:42,390
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.

797
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:44,226
I've been on this incredible journey.

798
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:46,437
And I've seen and learned so much.

799
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,231
I even met someone.

800
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:51,573
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.

801
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,691
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.

802
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,231
I think

803
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:58,715
I think he likes me.

804
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:01,334
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.

805
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,375
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.

806

Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,

807
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:13,355
just proves you're to naive to be here.

808
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:16,633

Come on now, really.

that he's impressed?

What will I do then?

If she's here*</i>

941
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:31,148
<i>*It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go*</i>

942
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:35,596
<i>Both: *And at last, I see the light*</i>

943
01:09:35,597 --> 01:09:39,590
<i>*And it's like the fog has lifted*</i>

944
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:44,162
<i>*And at last, I see the light*</i>

945
01:09:44,163 --> 01:09:48,406
<i>*And it's like the sky is new*</i>

946
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:59,386
<i>Both: *And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*</i>

947
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:06,859
<i>*All at once
Everything is different*</i>

948
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,449
<i>*Now that I, see you.*</i>

949
01:10:16,014 --> 01:10:25,905
<i>*Now that I...see you.*</i>

950
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:44,878
Rapunzel: Is everything okay?

951
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,788
Huh? Oh yes.

952
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:49,994
Uh, yes of course.

953
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,013
Flynn: I just...

954
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:59,294
Flynn: I'm sorry, everything is fine.

955
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:01,904
There's just something I
have to take care of.

956
01:11:04,977 --> 01:11:06,591
Okay.

957
01:11:07,857 --> 01:11:09,883
I'll be right back.

958
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:17,776
It's all right, Pascal.

959
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:27,135
Flynn: Ahh, there you are.

960
01:11:27,136 --> 01:11:30,306
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.

961
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:32,806
Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?

962
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:34,374
You gotta be excited about that.

963
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:39,708
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

964
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:42,569
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.

965
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:46,781
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.

966
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:51,439
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?

967
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:54,697
-What?
-We heard you found something.

968
01:11:54,698 --> 01:11:57,843
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

969
01:11:58,323 --> 01:12:01,642
We want her, instead.

970
01:12:08,986 --> 01:12:09,986
(Footsteps approaching)

971
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:15,304
I was starting to think you
ran off with the crown and left me.

972
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:23,427
He did.

973
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:26,413
What?
No.

974
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:27,437
He wouldn't.

975
01:12:28,204 --> 01:12:30,079
See for yourself.

976
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:35,915
Eugene?

977
01:12:38,502 --> 01:12:39,881
Eugene!

978

Stabbington brother 1: Fair trade.

979
01:12:44,129 --> 01:12:47,760
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.

980
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:52,724
How much do you think someone
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

981
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:54,569
No, please.

982
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,893
NO!

983
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:57,261
NO!

984
01:13:00,674 --> 01:13:01,692
AHH!

985

Gothel: Rapunzel!

987
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,444
Mother?

988
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:17,096
Oh, my precious girl.

989
01:13:17,097 --> 01:13:18,787
Mother.

990
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:20,943
Are you all right?

991
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:22,274
Are you hurt?

992
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:25,742
-Mother, how did you?
-I was so worried about
you dear.

993
01:13:25,743 --> 01:13:27,154
So I followed you.

994
01:13:27,155 --> 01:13:29,019
And I saw them attack you.

995
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,843
All right, let's go, let's go
before they come to.

996
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:00,543
(sobs)

997
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:03,630
Rapunzel: You were right, mother.

998
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:06,277
You were right about everything.

999
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:08,949
Gothel: I know darling.

1000
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:11,535
I know.

1001
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:21,905
(Slams into dock)

1002
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:25,589
Look!

1003
01:14:26,349 --> 01:14:27,572
Guard: The crown.

1004
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:29,517
Rapunzel.

1005
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:31,575
RAPUNZEL!

1006
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:36,114
Flynn: No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.

1007
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:40,947
Flynn: Rapunzel!

1008
01:14:57,022 --> 01:14:58,022
(Keys jingling)

1009
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:02,521
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

1010
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,874
Where are we going?

1011
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,978
Oh...

1012
01:15:13,812 --> 01:15:16,396
Gothel: There,
it never happened.

1013
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,997
Now, wash up for dinner.

1014
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:23,700
I'm making hazel nut soup.

1015
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,207
I really did try, Rapunzel.

1016
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,437
I tried to warn you,
what was out there.

1017
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:37,359
The world is dark, and selfish,

1018
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,598
and cruel.

1019
01:15:38,598 --> 01:15:41,818
If it finds even the slightest
ray of sunshine.

1020
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:44,750
It destroys it.

1021
01:15:58,142 --> 01:15:59,142

((Clatter))

1026
01:17:26,465 --> 01:17:28,482
How did you know about her?

1027
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:29,633
Tell me, now!

1028
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:30,884
It wasn't us.

1029
01:17:30,884 --> 01:17:32,355
It was the old lady.

1030
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,985
Old lady?

1031
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,478
Wait, no, wait!

1032
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:39,312
You don't understand,
she's in trouble.

1033
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:40,272
Flynn: Wait!

1034
01:17:40,528 --> 01:17:41,546
Rapunzel?

1035
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:45,367
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

1036
01:17:47,224 --> 01:17:48,224
(Panting)

1037
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,133
Are you all right?

1038
01:17:52,513 --> 01:17:54,074
I'm the lost princess.

1039
01:17:54,556 --> 01:17:58,179
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

1040
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,065
I am the lost Princess.

1041
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:02,106
Aren't I?

1042
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,787
Did I mumble, Mother?

1043
01:18:08,253 --> 01:18:10,730
Or should I even call you that?

1044
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:15,248
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

1045
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:17,846
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

1046
01:18:17,847 --> 01:18:21,054
It was you!
It was all, you.

1047
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:26,933
Everything I did, was to protect you.

1048
01:18:28,529 --> 01:18:31,696
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,

1049
01:18:31,697 --> 01:18:34,670
...hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

1050
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:37,151
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.

1051
01:18:37,152 --> 01:18:38,195
From you.

1052
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:39,407
Where will you go?

1053
01:18:39,407 --> 01:18:41,394
Gothel: He won't be there for you.

1054
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:43,221
Rapunzel: What did you do to him?

1055
01:18:43,222 --> 01:18:47,207
Gothel: That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.

1056
01:18:47,324 --> 01:18:50,916
-(Gasps) No.
-Now, now. It's all right.

1057
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:51,978
Listen to me.

1058
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,471
All of this is as
it should be.

1059
01:18:55,472 --> 01:18:56,578
Rapunzel: NO!

1060
01:18:57,295 --> 01:18:59,903
You were wrong about the world.

1061
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,149
And you were wrong about me.

1062
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,655
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!

Fine.

1066
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:22,103

-What?
-Nope.
