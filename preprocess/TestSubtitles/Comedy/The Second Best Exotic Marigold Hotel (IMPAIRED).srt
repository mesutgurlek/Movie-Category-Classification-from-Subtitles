about half past ten

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,249
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,563
So movin' on over

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,488
Rockin' on over

Move over, little doll

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,040
Breathe the air, Mrs. Donnelly!

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm eating dust.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,560
The wind in your hair!

- Put the bloody top back on, Sonny!

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,160
I will not hear your negativity.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
Madam, this is Route 66

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,682
and we are most assuredly
getting our kicks!

- Whoo!

14

MAN: She changed the lock
on my back door

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,240
Now my key won't fit no more

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,767
Movin' on over

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,602
Rockin' all over

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,650
Move over, nice doll
The mean old dog's going in

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
Hi. I'm Chet and I'll be
happy to valet your car.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,124
Not as happy as we are
that you are happy to do so, my friend.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Just tell me... Just tell me

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,120
there's a cup of tea
and a biscuit waiting inside.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,124
That's a great accent.
Are you from Australia?

The sound of destiny, madam...

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
calling us with her siren song.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,720
And go to her we must!

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,040
For this is our moment.

Somebody else?

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,080
My hand is powdered,
so the shake is firm and dry.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,360
My clothes precisely walk the tightrope

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,600
between casual and relaxed formality.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,730
Sonny, Sonny. Let me do the talking.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,242
- Alright?
- Okay.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,684
(CLEARS THROAT)

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,764
Mr. Burley.

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
While I am aware that...

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
convention dictates that I should wait

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,680
for your assessment of our proposal...

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,085
please take my interruption
less as rudeness than proof...

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,520
of our profound excitement
at the opportunity to meet yourself...

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
and your fine company.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,280
And let me say right here and now...

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,442
Alright, that's enough, that's enough.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,240
We agreed that my colleague would do

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,607
the speaking and rightly so for...

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,166
while her language may be... salty,
it has great economy and pith.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,882
MURIEL: I don't care about any of that.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,160
No, listen and learn, son.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,720
Tea is an herb that's been dried out.

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,282
So to bring it back to life,
you have to infuse it...

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,562
in boiling water.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
That is boiling water.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,040
Everywhere I've been in this country...

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
they slap down
a cup of tepid nonsense...

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,760
you know with the teabag
lying beside it...

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,640
which means I've got to go through

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,520
the ridiculous business of dunking it...

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,808
in the lukewarm piss...

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,160
waiting for the slightest change
of color to occur.

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,120
And at my age... I haven't got the time.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
This is what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,521
Get her some boiling water.

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,167
Now, Mrs. Donnelly.
Tell me more about your establishment.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,165
MURIEL: We've been going properly
for about eight months now.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,524
But phase two of the development
is more or less complete.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Like life and a tortoise.

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not exactly fast-moving...

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,320
- Mrs. Evelyn Greenslade.
- Here.

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,320
MURIEL: ...but you only make progress
when you stick your neck out.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,687
- Mr. Douglas Ainslie.
- Here.

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
We have guests that come and go.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,760
- Mrs. Muriel Donnelly.
- Here.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,760
But there's been a hard core
of regulars from the beginning.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,040
- Mrs. Madge Hardcastle.
- Here.

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Mr. Norman Cousins and Miss Carol Parr.

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
BOTH: Both here.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,240
We have monthly check-ups
at the local clinic...

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,240
and Sonny takes
a roll-call every morning.

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,440
A most valuable precaution to ensure

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,568
that nobody has died in the night.

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,840
MURIEL: Most of our guests don't just
live in India, they now work there.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
EVELYN: These are lovely.

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
HARI: That is why they
cost 10,000 rupees each.

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,960
(CHUCKLES) Every day?
We have to do this every day?

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,200
Process, madam.
We must respect the process.

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
Very well. You and I both know

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,960
that since a fine, genuine pashmina...

91
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,760
requires the annual growth
of at least three Changra goats...

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
you and everyone in this market

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,080
blend the yarn to give it more body.

94
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
The reason I come to this stall is that

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,760
whereas Bharat over there uses wool...

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,480
and Mohan goes with the rabbit fur...

97
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,280
you at least use a reasonable
quality of silk.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I'll give you 5,000 for four.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,680
Done.

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,921
Thank you.

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
I'll see you tomorrow, Hari.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Tomorrow, Miss Evelyn.
And thank you for your respect.

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,400
MURIEL: Two of the guests
have made themselves useful

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,840
at the local expats club.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Which is, shall we say,
a little down on its uppers.

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,603
- Norman...
- Mmm?

107
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,920
I know the membership's dropping,
times are tight, but...

108
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,400
do you really have
to water down the wine?

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,291
What?! I uncorked it myself.

110
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,248
They're on to us.

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's try the red.

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,200
MURIEL: And others are doing jobs
they never thought they could do.

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,480
One Queen was so
close to her elephant...

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,800
that when she passed away, the elephant

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,962
stood beside her tomb for three days...

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,480
before dying of grief.

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,360
We should all know such love,

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,330
just not necessarily from an elephant.

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,320
MURIEL: And sometimes
they're right, they can't.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
- Uh, when were these built?
- I'm sorry?

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,291
- What period are we talking about?
- What, um...

122
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,010
period? Ah, uh... yeah. Um...

123
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
17th... 17th century.

124
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,890
17th century.

125
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
- Sure?
- Absolutely positive.

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,128
- Wait, wait, wait. Maybe 18th.
- Oh, oh, oh...

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,480
Please admire the beautifully carved...

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Now please admire

And, um, you, you, you can see...

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
MURIEL: Look, I could talk and talk...

137
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,760
but all that counts in the end
is this one had an idea.

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,606
I know, I know, but it works.

139
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,600
The proof of our success
is we are victims of it.

140
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,440
The Marigold Hotel is full up.

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,288
With nobody checking out.
Until the ultimate check-out.

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,848
So we have to expand.

143
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
There's a local place
we've got our eye on.

144
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
The Supreme Quality Hotel.

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
You put up the notes, we buy it.

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,920
And we become the furthest outpost
of the Evergreen franchise.

147
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,920
Leading to a chain of hotels
stretching across India and beyond...

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,923
for those such as...

149
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,807
this great lady...

150
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
whose face is a map of the world...

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,560
and whose mind,
though failing, still contains

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,280
many of the secrets of the universe.

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,360
Who had the chance to say, when she left

154
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,400
her home for the Best

155
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,562

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,040
we know it was a test run,
to see if there was any demand.

320
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,680
And after three months
we were either going

321
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,525
professional or giving
the whole thing up.

322
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
We're going professional.

323
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,800
Oh, I'm delighted.

324
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,080
And please tell whoever it is that

325
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
I'm around to impart
what little wisdom I...

326
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,968
Evelyn, we want to employ you.
We want to go professional with you.

327
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,520
You have contacts. You have taste.

328
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,600
You can haggle
the hind legs off a donkey.

329
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
We would like you to
be in charge of sourcing

330
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
for our whole operation in this country.

331
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm 79 years old.

332
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,320
We don't mind if you don't.

333
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,520
We'll give you a team
to work under you, of course.

334
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,960
It's going to mean some travel.

335
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,320
- DOUGLAS: Good morning.
- Oh!

336
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,720
I was just riding past on my bike
and I saw you in here.

337
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,720
Well, I say riding, damn thing
broke down again, I was pushing it.

338
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,530
- Do you mind if I join you?
- JODI: No, please do.

339
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,200
I trust everyone's
ordered the Chilla pancakes.

340
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,640
You haven't lived until you do.

341
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,640
- I'm Douglas, by the way.
- Jodi.

342
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,240
Jodi's the representative of
the company I've been working for.

343
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,520
You've talked about her.
All good things.

344
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,080
They're mutual.
Actually, I've just asked

345
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,561
if she'd like to join us officially.

346
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,405
Have you?

347
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,201
Well, congratulations.

348
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,360
It would mean a lot of traveling.

349
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Yes, I expect so. You'll love that.

350
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,562
She hasn't said "yes" yet.

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,651
Well, she will. Of course she will.

352
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,570
What's stopping her?

353
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,400
You see I think the problem
this time is the piston...

354
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,760
which must have had
what we call a seizure.

355
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
But, luckily, Cyril at the bike shop

356
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,611
has this tool called
a gudgeon pin remover...

357
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
which should minimize damage

358
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
to the bearing at either
end of the con rod...

359
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
or, God forbid, the con rod itself.

360
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,051
I think you're just
making these words up.

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,560
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

362
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,087
Would you have asked my opinion?

363
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,882
Sorry?

364
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,880
If I hadn't have come in,

365
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,691
would you have talked it over
with me before saying "yes"?

366
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Of course I'd have told you tonight

367
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
and asked you what you thought.

368
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
Thank you.

369
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
What do you think?

370
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
That you'll do it wonderfully.

371
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
NORMAN: Good morning, Ainslie.

372
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,760
Morning, you two.

373
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,800
Not riding the bike, Douglas?

374
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,040
No, the piston's seized up.

375
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,284
But luckily everything can be saved
by a device called a gudgeon pin remover.

376
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,640
NORMAN: We just popped out
for some of those pancakes.

377
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,041
I don't suppose you'd care to join...

378
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
EVELYN: Good Lord. Are you alright?

379
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,522
CAROL: I'm fine.

380
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,120
- Thank you.
- Nothing I haven't done before.

381
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,640
Something must have
gone wrong with his steering.

382
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,168
It almost looked as if
he was aiming straight at you.

383
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,651
You could be killed
by one of those things.

384
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,485
Oh, God.

385
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,720
How I wish I could
prevail upon you to stay.

386
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,531
- Always leave them wanting more, Nimish.
- (CHUCKLES)

387
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,360
Are we going to the Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel, madam?

388
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,800
There's another stop first,
if you don't mind.

389
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,086
Goodbye, Nimish.

390
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,320
ABHILASH: Ah!

391
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,244
- Your Highness.
- Welcome.

392
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
In this hand, I'm nothing but putty.

393
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,771
If you like it,
you should put a ring on it.

394
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,601
Uh...

395
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,962
Would you mind waiting?
I don't quite know how long I'll be.

396
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,044
Your command is my wish.

397
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,680
He will wait.

398
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,160
MADGE: Yes, but can you?

399
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,685
ABHILASH: Tough.

400
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,040
Break out the champagne!
Let the klaxons sound!

401
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,411
For home are the happy hunters and fat
is the lamb that we have slaughtered!

402
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
Namaste, Anokhi.

403
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,728
(BOTH SPEAKING HINDI)

404
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,200
- Namaste, madam.
- Namaste, Anokhi.

405
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,280
(SPEAKING HINDI)

406
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,283
How was America?

407
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,286
- It made death more tempting.
- (SUNAINA TRANSLATING)

408
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,360
Not bad biscuits, though.
I can't call them cookies.

409
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,045
Oh, look.

410
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,005
These are for your mother, apke ma.

411
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,491
These are for your father, apke pita.

412
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,520
- Hello, beta.
- Mummyji.

413
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,011
Come here.

414
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,160
I was just checking in a guest.

415
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,440
You scare the guests.

416
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,080
I'll do it.

417
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,760
She must be the reason
why things are going so smoothly.

418
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,288
It takes teamwork to make
a dream work, Mummyji.

419
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,205
Cousin Sapna.

420
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,809
And little Ranjan.

421
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,320
Thank you.

422
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
And there's more.

423
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
And breakfast is served on the terrace
between 7:00 and 10:00, Miss Beech.

424
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,080
With roll-call at 9:00 precisely.

425
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Roll-call?

426
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,960
To ensure that if anyone
has left us in the night,

427
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,122
at least they will not lie undiscovered.

428
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,200
Although you, dear lady, are nearer

429
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,806
the menopause than the mortuary.

430
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,650
Do fill in, please.

431
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,561
Hello?

432
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,161
Yes?

433
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,960
Oh, good morning.

434
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,201
Good morning.

435
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,080
Is this the Marigold Hotel?

436
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,800
Do you have a reservation?

437
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,040
- No, it seems great to me.
- I meant...

438
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,160
No, I know what you meant.

439
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,526
And, no, I don't have a booking.

440
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,320
Then you should plan your life
a little better. The last room's just going.

441
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,720
With great pride and joy I offer you
room 6, the jewel in our crown.

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,360
Overlooking the restaurant.

443
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,680
I was hoping for
somewhere quite private.

444
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
SONNY: Another new guest.

445
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,040
Like lemmings they come to the cliff edge
that is the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

446
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm so sorry, we're full up.

447
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,680
- That's disappointing.
- Mmm.

448
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,560
Fail to prepare, sir... prepare to fail.
I'm sorry, buddy.

449
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,160
Come, Miss Beech, your palace awaits.

450
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,680
I saw you at the airport, didn't I?

451
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,560
The man with only one bag.

452
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,246
GUY: Guy. Guy Chambers.

453
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,844
LAVINIA: Lavinia Beech.

454
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,331
The name again, please?

455
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,724
- Guy Chambers.
- (DROPS LUGGAGE)

456
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,280
Mr. Chambers. Forgive me for the cursory
nature of my greeting.

457
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,520
I am Sunil Indrajit Kapoor,
owner and proprietor

458
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,960
of this great and
sincerely profitable hotel.

459
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm pleased to meet you...

460
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,280
Of course we have our most
luxurious room available.

461
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,160
- We do?
- One to which I will personally escort you.

462
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
Don't you want to see my passport?

463
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,680
Ah, I know who you are, Mr. Chambers.

464
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,680
I know who he is.
Take Miss Beech to room 19.

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,720
Room 19 is not finished yet.

466
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,600
What can carpeting achieve
that a good pair of slippers cannot?

467
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,400
I'd really rather the room that I...

468
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,120
Please, Miss Beech, say it walking...

469
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,920
I don't mind what room I have, really.

470
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,600
But I mind, good sir. I mind deeply.

471
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,960
Sonny. A word.

472
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,520
In one hot minute, my darling.

473
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm just attending
to this most significant gentleman.

474
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,400
Now.

475
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,685
One moment.

476
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,600
What is your problem?
I have never seen such rudeness.

477
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,081
Bigger fish are frying, Sunaina.

478
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,080
Mr. Burley promised he would send
someone to evaluate the hotel.

479
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,400
You told me he'd send someone...

480
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,440
He said he'd send his guy.

481
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,840
His guy! You see?
He was sending me a message.

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
That's not much to go on.

483
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
Instinct, Sunaina.

484
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,160
Instinct is the nose of the mind.
And I have a large nose.

485
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,846
It goes well with my poppy-out ears.

486
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,722
MURIEL: Yeah, these aren't bad.

487
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,720
Not bad at all.

488
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,040
You're happy?

489
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,800
When have you seen me happy?

490
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,320
Good evening, Mrs. Donnelly.

491
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,000
Evening, Mrs. Greenslade.

492
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,920
We understand there
are grounds for optimism.

493
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,800
The boy did well.

494
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,360
And you? How did you find America?

495
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,840
I went with low expectations
and came back disappointed.

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
(CHUCKLES) Given your age,
I'm impressed you came back at all.

497
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,160
You're still standing, I see.

498
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,000
The old knee's hanging in there.

499
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,480
When's your next check-up?

500
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,000
Last week. And yours?

501
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Tomorrow. We'll see what's come loose.

502
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
Evening, all.

503
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,004
- Evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.
- Namaste.

504
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,160
Evening. Had a good day?

505
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,000
Wonderful. Spent every
second of it together.

506
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,880
Suffocating. Spent every
second of it together.

507
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,566
- He even followed me to the lavatory.
- (CHUCKLES)

508
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Everyone, this is Lavinia Beech.

509
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,600
- MADGE: Good evening.
- Hi.

510
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
You're a bit young, aren't you?

511
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,920
Well, I'm here for my mother.

512
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,320
Not that one needs an excuse
to escape the six weeks of warm rain

513
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,040
that constitute an English summer.
(LAUGHS)

514
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,841
She's thinking of coming for a longer stay.
I'm the advance party.

515
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,800
You must be hungry.
Please, come, sit down.

516
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,920
Not there, my darling. That is
the special table, already reserved.

517
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,525
For who?

518
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,280
Lordy lord, have mercy on my ovaries.

519
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen...

520
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,400
this is the great Guy Chambers.

521
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,643
As welcome as he is fragrant.

522
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
Hello.

523
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,560
MADGE: Hello.

524
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
Good to meet you all.

525
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,760
Perhaps tomorrow you will allow me to

526
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,049
take you on a tour of
our magnificent Pink City.

527
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,240
But now I shall
bring you food guaranteed

528
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,721
to tickle even your
most talented taste buds.

529
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Well, that was thorough.
Find any polyps up there?

530
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,360
He's the one.

531
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,480
What one?

532
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
Our evaluator.

533
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,920
Sent to decide if we are
to be franchise or footnote.

534
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,923
What's your evidence?

535
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,440
The nose knows, Mrs. Donnelly.

536
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,240
Oh, right. So that's bollocks, then.

537
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,450
I'm here writing a book,
as a matter of fact. A novel.

538
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,280
- That's a coincidence because I read novels.
- GUY: Oh.

539
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
Have you written others?

540
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,003
No. (CHUCKLES) No, this is my first.

541
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,280
It's just been kind
of a dream until now.

542
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,488
Any other dreams I can help you with?

543
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,921
NORMAN: So, what's it about?

544
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,927
It's about getting older, really.
And all that entails.

545
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,762
A sense of emptiness, of loss.
A gradual narrowing of one's...

546
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,809
Yes, well, you've come
to the right place for that.

547
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,800
Yes, yes. Now listen.
It's covered in scorpions.

548
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,400
How many tuk-tuks are there
with bloody scorpions on them?

549
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,211
And the driver is completely lethal.

550
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,800
Of course I don't know his name
but he's got one eye.

551
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
- There you are.
- Oh, my God.

552
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,169
Now listen, you. I don't want
any more excuses. Just do it!

553
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,486
(SCOFFS) That was the club.
There's been a power cut...

554
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,320
and apparently some of the food

555
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,920
for the party tonight
is slightly on the turn.

556
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
I'm sure you'll sort it, darling.

557
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
There's a problem with the party?

558
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
No, no problem with
the party, my darling.

559
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,489
Carol. Carol, where are you going?

560
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,240
To the travel agency where I work.

561
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
Why don't I walk with you?

562
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,840
No need. See you later.

563
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,321
Mrs. Hardcastle. Is there
a problem with the party?

564
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,400
Better not be.
It's the club's biggest night

565
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,528
for years. Can't afford slip-ups.

566
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,680
There was a power cut.

567
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,171
Norman.

568
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,200
- Douglas.
- Hello.

569
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
You missed roll-call.
I thought we'd lost you.

570
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,880
I was here early. Cyril's helping me.

571
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,360
I need to get all this sorted
for the wedding. I've got this whole...

572
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,560
bike thing planned.

573
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,400
Turns out, it wasn't
a piston problem at all.

574
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Something to do with
the carburetor. So...

575
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,400
- (LAUGHING)
- You don't care, do you?

576
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,600
Only insomuch as it matters to you.

577
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,569
But still you came.

578
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,920
Listen. I'm going to Mumbai
in a couple of days.

579
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,240
I know, for Laura's conference.

580
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,528
I was thinking, why don't you come?

581
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,611
She's my daughter,
I'd like you to meet her.

582
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,360
Of course. But I'm not sure
I can make a trip like that.

583
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,760
Silly idea.

584
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,200
With the new job and everything.
I shouldn't even be going myself.

585
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,960
Plenty of tours to fail to guide...

586
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
and the bike still isn't finished.

587
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,800
I would love to meet her.

588
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,246
It'll happen.

589
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,040
Oh... will I see you tonight?

590
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,800
- What?
- The engagement party.

591
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,600
DOUGLAS: Absolutely. I wouldn't miss it.

592
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
EVELYN: Wonderful.

593
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,649
- Bye.
- Bye.

594
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,683
You should marry that girl.

595
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
I want to.

596
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,960
(MRS. KAPOOR AND ANOKHI SPEAKING HINDI)

597
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,929
Where's our new guest?

598
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Which one?

599
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,646
The American...

600
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,288
I didn't see him at breakfast...

601
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,281
(BOTH SPEAKING HINDI)

602
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,520
Good morning.

603
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,681
Ah.

604
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,960
The man with no plan
who still gets the best room.

605
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
I felt really bad about that.

606
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
Not bad enough to swap with her.

607
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,408
No, I did swap. After dinner last night.

608
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,400
So how's the new room?

609
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,961
Monastic. Which I prefer.

610
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,200
No need to tell
the proprietor about this.

611
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,840
He's not the fastest fox in the forest.

612
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,850
He's my son.

613
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,560
GUY: And a fine fellow he is.
You must be very proud.

614
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,520
Don't speak to the guests, Mummyji.

615
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,960
Mr. Chambers was just telling me

616
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,361
how comfortable he is at the hotel.

617
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,169
I'm both delighted and unsurprised.
But really, no speaking.

618
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,883
Hope to see you again.

619
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,889
Go on, Mummyji. (CLEARS THROAT)

620
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,720
And now, good sir, for our tour.

621
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Let us find Vikram and
his beautiful minibus,

622
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,960
and taste the pleasures
of our fine city.

623
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,920
Could I come along? I was just
about to brave the city on my own.

624
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,600
Madam, this perfect specimen and I

625
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,680
were planning to spend
the day alone together.

626
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,200
- I didn't mean to intrude.
- Of course she can come.

627
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,930
Of course you can come.

628
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,044
MADGE: It's difficult.

629
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Every morning I take a taxi
to the roundabout and I have a decision.

630
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,720
I can either go left to Nimish...

631
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,967
or right to Abhilash.
Both of whom love me.

632
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,210
I'm pretty sure they're going
to propose soon enough.

633
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,360
Just because I'm looking
at you when you talk,

do your dance?

make a move before the price went up.

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,808
Sonny, your mother needs to spend
some time with my parents.

795
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,360
For the guest of honor.

796
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,640
We are the guests of honor.

797
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,200
GUY: Congratulations.
This is just a wonderful night.

798
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,409
I was thinking of celebrating by asking
your mother for a dance.

799
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,366
- Whose mother?
- Your mother.

800
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,087
Really?

801
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,880
You're looking very
fine tonight, Norman.

802
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,408
I don't suppose you've seen
Carol anywhere, have you?

803
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,405
(CHUCKLES) Here...

804
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,720
Thank you. I find it awfully hard not
to wipe my fingers on my trousers.

805
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,400
I've noticed.

806
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,080
Jean used to accuse me of doing it
deliberately to annoy her.

807
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,480
Whereas, the best way
was to stand in front of her

808
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,320
and fold up a road map the wrong way.

809
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,680
You're happy.

810
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,600
I've just got a text from
Laura. Well, five texts,

811
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,000
although I could
only read the first one.

812
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,920
I hate this machine.

813
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,520
Turns out she's coming here.

814
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,080
I thought she was going to Mumbai.

815
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,760
She's taking a diversion to see
her old man. In his natural habitat.

816
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,080
That's wonderful.

817
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,925
So the two of you
will finally get to meet.

818
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,480
And she can see for herself that

819
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,610
all the things I've told
her about you are true.

820
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,610
Mmm. Mmm. Oh.

821
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,330
- (LAUGHING)
- Mmm. Oh.

822
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,008
I hear you're going to dance tonight.

823
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,280
We met before. I'm Lavinia.

824
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,204
- Lavinia. Absolutely.
- (CHUCKLES)

825
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,120
You're probably thinking
I'm a little young

826
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,566
to be staying at the Marigold.

827
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,566
- Either that or your plastic surgeon's
a genius. - (LAUGHING)

828
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,964
I'm... quite interested
in your new place.

829
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Come by again sometime.

830
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,324
Maybe I will. Or maybe I won't.

831
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,444
That means I will.

832
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,840
SONNY: Mummyji.
Guy Chambers has chosen you.

833
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,520
A great mystery for another time.

834
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,600
But the moment he beckons,
you must join him

835
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,683
on the dance floor to throw some shapes.

836
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,040
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

837
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,920
The man is so handsome he has me

838
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,760
urgently questioning my own sexuality.

839
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,840
What's left of our hopes
for the hotel are

840
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,321
in his hands. So, please,
take one for the team.

841
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,360
Are you pimping out your own mother?

842
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,840
No, no, not at all. No.

843
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,440
Although, yes.

844
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,601
(EXCLAIMS IN DISMAY)

845
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,721
Ah!

846
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,240
Madge. I can't find Carol anywhere.

847
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,360
Norman, quick, kiss me.

848
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,480
What?

849
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,768
- You know you want to.
- I don't want to.

850
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,764
Well, I wouldn't mind but...

851
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,640
I'm sorry, Norman. I can't do this.
I'm in love with someone else.

852
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,840
Fair enough.

853
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm breaking your heart. I'm sorry.

854
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,000
I'll get over it.

855
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,286
Forgive me.

856
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,564
Now, have either of you seen Carol?

857
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,126
I honestly thought it might help.

858
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
I thought if I could
see them at the same time,

859
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,240
I'd know which one I preferred...

860
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,244
which port in the storm I'd choose.

861
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,441
But it didn't work out that way.

862
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,204
Some you win, my lady,
and some you learn.

863
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,920
And I don't know why, but I rather
snubbed his kind invitation...

864
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,360
to go with him to Mumbai.

865
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,603
Where, as it turns out,
I'm going anyway.

866
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,285
So we'd actually be there together.

867
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,081
(SIGHS)

868
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,923
I don't know
if I'm excited or terrified.

869
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,926
Sometimes it seems to me
that the difference between...

870
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,371
what we want and what we fear...

871
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,807
is the width of an eyelash.

872
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,486
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

873
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,680
Oh, the hearing's gone then, obviously.

874
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,286
Yeah, along with your backbone.

875
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,520
I don't know why I tell you anything.

876
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,880
Because I'm older and wiser.

877
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,640
19 days older.

878
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,043
That's the entire lifespan of a wasp.

879
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,485
(SOFTLY) Go on, talk to him.

880
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,526
Look, we don't have to dance.
We could just talk.

881
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,005
Well, we start by you telling me
what your name is.

882
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,204
It's Mrs. Kapoor.

883
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,881
That's all I get?

884
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,000
Mmm-hmm. That's all you get.

885
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,200
Huh. Alright, um...

886
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,361
Um...

887
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,520
Okay, I'm 64. I am single...

888
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,766
and my wife left me a couple
of years ago. I don't know why.

889
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,485
Uh, I'm generally kinder
to people than to animals.

890
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,120
Not that I'm mean to animals, I'm not.

891
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,400
I like animals. Especially dogs.

892
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,400
What do you want from me?

893
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,245
I don't know, just a little
back and forth. A little...

894
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,963
I went, now you go.

895
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,480
What do you really want?

896
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,801
(CHUCKLES) I don't know.

897
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,445
I don't know.

898
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,720
I prefer cats.

899
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,564
I figured.

900
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,524
Have dinner with me.

901
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,204
Whenever you want.

902
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,880
We can go tomorrow night.
Night after that. That's...

903
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,566
Or I could book a table right here,
if you want?

904
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,040
What makes you think I'll say yes?

905
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,800
I'm hoping you already did.
Just not out loud.

I don't find you in the dark.

- Norman?!

Carol, darling, where are you?

920
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,360
Neither do I. It's outrageous.

Don't pretend you're not relieved.

922
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,960
You think I'd organize a power cut?

923
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,531
The only thing you did organize.

924
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,040
I had more important things to see to.

925
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,920
What is more important
than your engagement?

926

If I could see where
your leg is, I'd kick it.

927
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,920
Then I wouldn't have to dance and you
could stay on the floor with your Kushti.

better than me.

that's wonderful. I can't wait to meet her.

But, absurdly, um, as it happens,
I now have to go to Mumbai.

Oh.

I mean I was thinking that
when you come for the conference...

948

we could...

I'm going to be there

perhaps we could...

Hello, Evelyn.

956
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,480
It was all so delightfully last minute.

957
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
Yes, a bit of warning
would have been nice.

958
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
You didn't get my texts?

959
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,961
I hate that machine.

960
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,720
Laura's giving a speech at an international
conference. Aren't you, darling?

961
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,480
About the exponential growth
of internet start-ups...

962
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,160
and the consequent effect on...
I'll shut up now.

963
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,040
And when she mentioned
she'd been offered

964
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,160
two return flights,
first class, of course...

965
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,440
I couldn't resist the chance to come out

966
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,967
and visit the old crumbling ruins.

967
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,005
And see how the hotel
was doing as well. (LAUGHS)

968
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,840
Daniel has been saying I was looking
tired and could do with a holiday.

969
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,005
It's typically him to be
so considerate and caring.

970
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,320
Daniel?

971
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,963
Daniel Green. He's a country solicitor.
And my boyfriend.

972
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,921
It was actually his idea that I come
and speak about this in person.

973
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,520
Apparently, we have three options:

974
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,040
desertion, unreasonable behavior...

975
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,886
or adultery. A rather
unholy trinity. (CHUCKLES)

976
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,004
You can take your pick.

977
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,000
I don't understand.

978
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,527
Daniel's proposed to me, Douglas.

979
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,009
He's asked me to marry him.

980
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,842
I'm here to get a divorce.

You've been to Mumbai before, surely?

Oh, yes, many times. Very many times.

1003

- So you've never been?
- Never.

But I've got many relatives there.

Yes.

do me a favor from now on?

going to be working together.

Could you always just tell me the truth?

Very well.
But I must warn you, Miss Evelyn...

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,560
You deserve one. Although
the power cut was not of my doing...

1018
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,520
I nevertheless plunged
the night into darkness.

For that there is no excuse
and I am completely and sincerely sorry.

Kushal is machinating against me.

Because he bought a building?

1024
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,720
He didn't even know
you were interested in it.

Let us delay this conversation
until the moment I'm proved right...

1029
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,645
when perhaps it will be your turn
to apologize to me.

I'll get you a fresh pot.

Just hot water and a teabag
on the side would be marvelous.

Lavinia was curious about
that new place you showed us.

I don't recall.

1041

Kushal thought the lift might be

1042

rather a bonus for my darling mum.

1043

Six stairs without a rest
is about all she can manage now.

1044
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,400
Maybe we should take another look.

1045

is quite handsome. (LAUGHS)

How's your niece doing?

1057
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,282
She's bored and frustrated.

1058
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
Her first question to the doctor

1059
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,480
was whether she would
still be able to dance.

1060
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,640
Is she good?

1061

She makes movement into magic.

You have no children yourself?

1063
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,969
I did not marry, madam.

1064
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,482
I just never fell in love.

invite you to play with them?

Which option are you plumping for?

1101

The thing is...

as I recall, you deserted me

1103
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,360
and I'm not sure I was
entirely unreasonable.

1104
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,080
It'll have to be adultery, then.

Not guilty.

1112
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,484
I think she actually went
to start her new job.

1113
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,051
What a busy little pensioner bee she is.

1115

FACTORY OWNER:
This is a process that takes many weeks

1116
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,840
and involves 12 separate dyes...

1117
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,560
to produce the finished product.

1118
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,200
The intricate patterns require
40 passes over the cloth...

1119
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,360
and each pass involves
the entire length of the table.

1120
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,480
There are 8 tables in
this room and 24 in all.

1121
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,120
We will process around
2,000 meters of cloth in a day.

1122
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,000
And as you know, ma'am,
the workforce is highly skilled.

1123
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,721
The best that can be found in all India.
Please, follow me.

1124
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,880
Be honest.

1125
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,560
This man took one look at me
and thinks he can charge us double.

1126
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,120
- No.
- No?

1127
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,520
Four times. Read this and learn it fast.

1128
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,368
And when I run my fingers through my hair,
say it with great authority.

1129
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,120
FACTORY OWNER: I'm sorry.
I cannot go below 50,000 per crate.

1130
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,560
My costs will not permit it.

1131
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,000
EVELYN: 30 really is
the most we can offer.

1132
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,240
I'm not sure you understand
the work involved.

1133
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,560
I understand perfectly,
but 30 is our limit.

1134
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,840
Then we can do no business.

1135
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,080
I thank you and your assistant
for coming here.

1136
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,320
He's my partner, not my assistant...

1137
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,600
and he has full authority to conduct
this negotiation himself.

1138
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,120
Of course.

1139
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,760
My friend...

1140
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
we can get four for this price
anywhere else.

1141
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,640
You're just asking more
because it's her...

1142
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,080
You think because
you're with this white woman...

1143
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,080
that you've climbed a treetop?

1144
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,520
You think her white hair
is going to fluster me?

1145
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,760
Don't talk rubbish!

1146
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,720

1148
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,600
you think I'm going to give in ...?!

EVELYN: What did I say?

1153
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,640
That you understood
every word he was saying...

1154
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,840
and he should have more respect
for his elders.

1155
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,843
- Well, he does now.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1156
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,849
I thought you'd have left
for the Sangeet already.

1157
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,204
- Where have you been?
- I was working late.

1158
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,520
You'd gone before I woke up.

1159
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,526
I was working early.
And I did tell you, darling.

1160
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,681
Right.

1161
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,801
You've missed me, you sweet man.

1162

Let me get changed, hmm?
We'll go together.

MURIEL: Are you not worried about him?

1166
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,002
There's no point in worrying
if there's nothing you can do.

1167
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,360
Sonny, in a few days
we will all be one family.

1168
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,680
And in this family, we do not
tell each other what to do.

1169
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,240
We talk to each other, beta. We listen.

1170
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,200
Guys, I know you're worried,
but it will be okay.

1171
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,840
I will find another hotel
into which we can expand.

1172
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,320
Why don't you just talk to Kush. Okay?

1173
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,080
Please, Sonny, talk to him.

1174
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,766
Just listen to what he has to say.

1175

1176
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,925
Sonny, thanks for hearing me out.

1177
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,281
I want us to form a partnership.

1178
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:12,090
Outsourcing old age.
It's a brilliant idea.

1179
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,560
It's brilliant and it's working.

1180
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,720
But to keep growing, you've got
to have somewhere to grow into.

1181
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,120
You were going to buy the hotel.

1182
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,200
I'm proposing we own it together.

1183
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:24,365
As part of the company
we form together, equal partners.

1184
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,200
I know you began this
journey on your own,

1185
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,443
but you've gone as far
as you can without help.

1186
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,885
Without me.

1187
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,810
What do you say?

Your lips are moving.

of treachery and betrayal.

- This was your plan all along.
- I had no plan!

01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,240
Mrs. Donnelly, can you please
talk to this guy?

1193
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,080
JAMUNA:
What's your advice, Mrs. Donnelly?

1194
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,480
Never to give any.

1195
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,560
Listen, think about it, take some time.

1196
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,000
Long as you want. Five minutes?

1197

(LAUGHS)

1198
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,008
Five is more than enough.

1199
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,681
Is there really nothing you can do?

1200
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,360
MRS. KAPOOR:
Are you really writing a book?

1201
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,443
(GUY CHUCKLING) Well, I'm trying, yeah.

1202
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,604
My son thinks you're not
who you say you are.

1203
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,049
Is that why you came?

1204
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,120
So tell me about your book.

1205
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,805
Ah, okay.

1206
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,400
Well... The story's changed quite a bit.

1207
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,884
It was meant to be a story
about the end of things but now...

1208
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,404
maybe it's about the beginning of them.

1209
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,249
It's about a man who...

1210
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,720
whose life has fallen apart...

1211
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,360
and he's done what people do
when they've been bruised.

1212
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,091
He circles the wagons, he shuts down.

1213
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,045
But now he's, he's come
somewhere very far away and...

1214
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,369
suddenly he's awake.

1215
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,562
His blood is moving. He's...

1216
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,403
It's the place,
it's the extraordinary place.

1217
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,004
But mostly...

1218
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,524
it's this person that he's met there.

1219
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,884
And how does...

1220
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,569
How does she feel?

1221
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,040
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

1222
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,720
Well, she doesn't know.
Not immediately, of course not.

1223
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,884
That would be kind of
a short story if she did.

1224
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,521
I think that she's scared.

1225
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,440
And I'm sure that she was an incredibly...
beautiful young woman...

1226
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,286
and she knows she's not that young anymore.
Although to him...

1227
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,202
to him she looks wonderful.

1228
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,725
But she wouldn't trust him
if he said that, so...

1229
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,202
Actually, I don't think
she trusts anybody, really.

1230
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,765
Least of all herself, which is probably
a sign that she's become...

1231
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,127
become someone who she
doesn't really wanna be.

1232
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,722
And every day that goes by
makes it harder to remember...

1233
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,480
that she once was passionate, willful.

1234
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,486
She disapproves of those things.
Now she fears them.

1235
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,481
Which is why he's not pushing.

1236
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,604
For now...

1237
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,842
For now he just wants
an evening with her.

1238
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,930
And another.

1239
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,922
To see what happens.

1240
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,044
That's my story.

1241
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,651
Or at least what I know of it so far.

Shall we write the next chapter?

1244
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,805
SONNY: I don't know what
to do, Mrs. Donnelly.

1245
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,405
I used always to dream of the future...

1246
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,365
but now all I see is him in front of me.

1247
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,805
Looking back and laughing.
Having taken from me my livelihood...

1248
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,564
and my Sunaina.

1249
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,488
You know, there's a long list
of things I don't care for.

1250
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,244
Doctors, sunburn. Mosquitoes.

1251
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,480
People who outstay their welcome.

1252
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,406
I could go on forever.
But there is one thing...

1253
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,447
I cannot bear and that's self-pity.

1254
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:41,082
It destroys everything around it.
Now don't be that idiot.

1255
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,240
Don't let that happen.

1256
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,080
Then tell me what to do, madam.

1257
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,360
You have to work that out on your own.

1258
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,600
Why, when you are here?

1259
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,286
So you can do it when I'm not.

1260
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
- Evening all.
- Oh, good evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.

1261
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,240
In before midnight.

1262
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,720
Only two customers.

1263
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,800
I finished my shift early.
I felt like being alone.

1264
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,440

(SIGHS)

1423
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,921
That was me when I was her age.

1424
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,010
Twirling away.

1425
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,683
I wasn't bad, I don't think,
but I gave it up.

1426
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,047
Just like most things in my life.

1427
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,489
- Which is your house?
- Uh...

1428
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,201
White house. I was born there.

1429
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,331
So was she and her sisters.
My sister. My whole family.

1430
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,726
What a lovely place to have lived.

1431
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,163
I'm very happy you came.

1432
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,480
So... what happened last night?
You left in a hurry.

1433
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,000
I went to talk to the inspector.

1434
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,400
And?

1435
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,000
His mind was on other matters.

1436
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,481
Because he's not the inspector.

1437
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,160
No, Lavinia Beech is. Except her name's

1438
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,360
not Lavinia and she's American.

1439
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,120
And you've done nothing but show her

1440
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,320
the back of your hand
since she got here.

1441
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,320
That is absolutely not true.

1442
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,080
My God, that is true.

1443
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,440
Excuse me.

1444
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,080
Ah, Miss... Miss... Miss...

1445
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,681
Miss...

1446
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,760
- Beech.
- Miss Beech. How delightful to see you.

1447
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,080
Might I ask most humbly
if you have plans

1448
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,440
for today and, if so,
can I feature in them?

1449
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,000
I was actually just
on my way to see Kushal.

1450
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,760
And is that, if so bold I might be,

1451
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,520
for the purposes of
business or pleasure?

1452
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,960
Both, really.

1453
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,520
No offense, but I think in the end

1454
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,400
the Supreme Quality will
just suit my mother perfectly.

1455
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,800
Please, madam, I'll give you
a better room. One that's finished.

1456
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,040
Sonny. I heard you were looking for me?

1457
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,960
Room 6 will shortly be available.

1458
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,440
- I'm in room 6.
- You are? She is?

1459
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,680
A lot's been going on.

1460
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,285
I'm sorry, no.

1461
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
So, Mr. Chambers.

1462
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,200
Could you hold on a sec, Miss Beech?

1463
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,567
The great Mr. Chambers.

1464
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,560
The great writer Mr. Chambers.

1465
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,645
- Sure, if you like.
- I do not like, sir. I do not like one bit!

1466
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,720
What did you wanna tell me?

1467
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,804
To leave this hotel and never darken
its towels again.

1468
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,240
- You lied, sir.
- He did not lie.

1469
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,480
You pretended not to be
something you weren't.

1470
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,645
There was an inspector.
It just wasn't him. It was that one.

1471
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,160
Lavinia. Except that's
not your name, is it?

1472
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,085
(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
No. My name's Theresa.

1473
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,120
I knew that I knew you.
You work for the competition.

1474
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,240
- "Golden Years," right?
- Correct.

1475
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,080
How did you know that?

1476
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,004
It's his business to know.

1477
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,006
And ours to know what he's up to.

1478
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,169
Please explain.

1479
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,528
She is a hotel inspector. Just not
the one that they were worried about.

1480
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,284
That would be me.

1481
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,530
I told you.

1482
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,884
The nose knew.

1483
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,320
While there are patterns we can study...

1484
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,800
to mitigate the amplitude
of the extreme highs and lows...

1485
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,560
that characterize any entrepreneurial
journey, they'll come anyway.

(ALL LAUGHING)

01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,849
But don't let that stop you
because the highs...

1488
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,720
like being here today with you all,
make everything worthwhile.

1489
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,320
Just get in the game.
I'll see you in the bar. Thank you.

Riveted, they were. No, really.

Thank you.

Laura's success continues, evidently.

Yes, I'm very proud of her.

1496

It's a shame Douglas
couldn't be here to enjoy it.

What exactly is your job here?

1498

Sourcing fabrics and liaising between

1499
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,560
the merchants and
the company I work for.

1500

Ooh, doesn't that
just trip off the tongue.

1501
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,360
Oh, it's easier to say than to do.

1502
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,921
Well, you look as if you're handling it.

1503

I must say, I admire
what you've made of yourself here.

Thank you.

There's only one thing puzzling me.

1506
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,684
Douglas pleaded not guilty to adultery.
Why would that be?

1507
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,880
Do you not fancy him?

1508
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,880
Even when I could hardly stand the man,

1509
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,800
I still found him rather attractive.

1510
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,120
In some ways rather more so than Daniel.

1511
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,640
Well, Douglas has one great advantage

1512
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,565
over Daniel which is
that he actually exists.

1513
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,964
Daniel exists.

1514
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,566
- He does.
- Oh, if you say so.

1515
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,520
I work in his office.

1516
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,240
I've started doing clerical stuff,
Tuesdays and Thursdays...

1517
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,801
just to keep the ends meeting.

1518
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,121
Money doesn't stretch as far
in Reigate as in Rajasthan.

1519
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,760
Daniel knows my name,
of course, we're a small team.

1520
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,571
But he hasn't proposed,
I grant you that.

1521
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,120
That's why I want the divorce.

1522
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,649
I can hardly expect a man to want
to go out with me while I'm still married.

1523
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,363
What do you suppose
we should do for our first date?

1524
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,520
I'm too embarrassed to ask Laura.

1525
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:22,401
A film? A shared experience.
Something to talk about afterwards.

1526
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,640
Which will prevent
any possible awkwardness.

1527
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,360
Oh, there won't be any awkwardness.

1528
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,887
No, I don't suppose there will be.

1529
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:36,128
There are some people into whose laps
the good things in life fall.

1530
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,923
I'm not one of them.

1531
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,965
Coming out here finally taught me that.

1532
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,040
So, if the good things
won't come on their own,

1533
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,850
I must make them.

1534
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,966
And that's what I intend to do.

1535
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,606
DOUGLAS: ...given them roots
and now they can...

1536
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,480
Sonny and Sunaina's wonderful families

1537
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,881
have given them roots and now...

(SIGHS)

1539
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,120
- Sunaina?
- You can't come in.

1540
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,440
I don't want you to see
the dress until Friday.

1541
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,960
I need my clipboard.

1542
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,440
You know the names of the guests.
Why do you need a clipboard?

1543
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,921
It's just an excuse to come in.

1544
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,680
I must apologize to you.

1545
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,000
You apologized already.

1546
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,003
I mean it more now.

1547
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,842
And I promise you three things.

1548
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,925
I promise I will properly rehearse
the wedding dance.

1549
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:58,000
I promise I'll wear the turban
your mother chose for the ceremony.

1550
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:01,160
And I promise I'll be a better
husband than fiancé.

1551
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,688
Good... because
you're a terrible fiancé.

1552
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,490
Listen to me.

1553
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,800
If there is ever a time
in our life together when...

1554
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,760
I find myself attracted to another man

1555
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,680
or even confused a little,
I will always tell you.

1556
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,287
And that way, you know that
I will never, ever act on it.

1557
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,881
I don't find Kush attractive.

1558
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,840
His ears are too close to his head.

1559
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,564
I hoped you would find
his offer of a partnership...

1560
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,084
more attractive.

1561
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,723
But that is up to you.

1562
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,360
- Have you seen my other shoe, darling?
- Hmm?

1563
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,160
If you don't tell me what's been
the problem for the last few days,

1564
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,720
I'll need it to kick you with.

1565
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,928
Your shoe's under the bed.

1566
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,520
And you're having an affair.

1567
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,160
Oh, so it is. Wonderful.

1568
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,600
I said I know you're sleeping
with someone else.

1569
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,920
Of course I am, darling. Aren't you?

1570
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,440
What about that twitchy
little witch at the club? Susan.

1571
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,840
Obviously you've both been at it
like rabbits for weeks now.

1572
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,760
No. I mean no!

1573
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,600
Well, why not? What's been stopping you?

1574
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,285
Well, you have.

1575
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,201
What?

1576
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,600
That's not fair.

1577
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,520
Do you mean I didn't need to be
carrying on with any of these men?

1578
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,760
There's more than one?

1579
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,240
I am only out there
because I thought you were.

1580
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,610
Look, I'm not "out" at all.
I couldn't be more "in."

1581
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,201
You know, when we met...

1582
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,760
you said you were lonely.

1583
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,242
I was. It doesn't mean I was celibate.

1584
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,806
I don't want to be
that lonely again, Norman.

my good wishes or not...

Thank you.

I don't care what you are.
I still would.

How will you rate us?

Not that it matters now, but...

1606
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,403
what will the report say?

1607
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,050
Shall I be frank?

1608
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,205
A welcome change.

1609
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,080
To say that...

1610
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,560
there is huge room for improvement
in the running of this hotel...

1611
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,760
would be to understate the surreally

1612
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,764
haphazard nature of your operation.

1613
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,362
Thank you... for your feedback.

1614
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,600
But the fact that
you get away with it...

to the reservoirs of affection

in which you're held
by the residents here.

1619
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,720
No-one can put a price on that.

1620
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,406
So, I would have said...

1621
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,080
that with a new and better-equipped
facility like the Supreme Quality...

1622
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,600
you would have had my endorsement.

1623
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,091
Would have?

1624
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,489
Well, I'm resigning.
My position is totally compromised here.

1625

I see.

1626
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,880
But you've got another inspector
right here.

1627
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,760
I don't like the people she works for
but if that's the only game in town...

1628
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,480
We've spoken already.

1629
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,280
Her recommendation is also based upon

1630
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,091
the acquisition of
the Supreme Quality Hotel.

1631

Why don't you just do a deal with him?

If only for the sake
of your beautiful bride.

1633

Right, well I'll be, I'll be staying

at the Viceroy until my plane leaves.

1635

Could you... Would you please
tell your mother...

1636
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,484
Would you please tell her
that I'm quitting my job?

1637
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,883
What are you going to do?

1638
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,924
Write my book.

1639
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,408
She knows the story.

Allow me to offer you
a lift to the Viceroy Club.

Please.

Good.

1645

Careful. You'll never get back up again.

1646
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,200
Well, you're still in one
slightly sagging piece, I see.

1647
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,880
Barely. The plane was diverted
just before landing.

1648
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,568
A cow on the runway. Not exactly
the way I always wanted to go.

1649
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,200
Death by cow.

1650
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:11,320
I suppose it would make people
sit up and take notice.

1651
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,320
Yeah, I wouldn't want that.

1652
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:18,088
I'd like everyone to turn around
one day and realize I've already gone.

1653
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,282
Tell me about Mumbai.
Did you find your spine?

1654

Well, I'm taking the job.

1655
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,080
I thought I wouldn't. I thought...

1656
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,720
"How many new lives can we have?"

1657
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,488
And then I thought, "As many as we like."
While we can.

Be a lot of traveling.

1659
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,651
How else could I come home afterwards?

1660
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,483

the wedding is nearly upon us.

You got your glad rags ready?

would want to get married.

I could spend a week with...

I do opinions.

1682
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,122
he gets plenty wrong...

01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:58,440
to send them on their way
in such remarkable style.

our children, it seems to me...

it seems to me, are roots and wings.

1748

And Sonny and Sunaina's wonderful
families have given them roots...

For this is what the young
make us remember...

1762
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,603
that in the end...

that in the end, it's all very simple...

that all it takes is
to look into someone's eyes...

and say... "Yes...

Well that, that was true already.

You were my first since my husband died.

You weren't the first.
