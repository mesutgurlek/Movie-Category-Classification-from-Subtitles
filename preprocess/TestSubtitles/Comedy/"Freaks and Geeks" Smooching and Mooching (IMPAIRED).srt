HEY.

480
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:43,414
I WAS, UH, WORKING.

481
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,339
HEY, UM...

482
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,340
THOSE ARE, UH,
NICE PAJAMAS.

483
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:57,582
THIS IS
A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

484
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,083
I SEE DOUBLE-DATING

485
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:01,085
AND TRIPLE-DATING

486
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:02,587
AND CHEERLEADERS
AT YOUR HOUSE

487
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:05,089
AND ME AT YOUR HOUSE.

488
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,574
CONGRATULATIONS,
SAM.

489
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,075
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR GOOD FORTUNE.

490
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:08,943
THANKS.

491
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:10,945
SHE'S THE ONE THAT
SHOULD BE THANKFUL.

492
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,563
YOU'RE A CATCH.

493
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,533
SO, CAN YOU GET BILL
AND I INTO THIS PARTY?

494
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:18,035
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

495
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:20,037
WELL,
THINK ABOUT IT.

496
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,539
I DON'T--I DON'T
WANT TO GO.

497
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,640
WHY NOT?

498
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,142
EVERYONE WANTSO GO
TO A MAKE-OUT PARTY.

499
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,611
IT'S A MAKE-OUT PARTY?

500
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:28,079
UH-HUH.

501
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,081
NOBODY TOLD ME IT WAS
A MAKE-OUT PARTY.

502
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,550
WELL, YOU BETTER
GET READY TO MAKE OUT.

503
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,051
OTHERWISE SHE'S GONNA
THINK YOU DON'T
LIKE HER.

504
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,037
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FRENCH KISS CINDY,

505
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,038
ARE YOU, SAM?

506
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,039
FRENCH KISSINGI WOUL
IS GROSS.

507
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,024
DN'T FRENCH KISS
IN A MILLION YEARS.

508
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:42,009
AND WHY THE HELL NOT?

509
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,479
HELLO.

510
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,982
GERMS. SPIT. MUCUS.
OLD BITS OF FOOD.

511
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:49,450
THAT'S JUST
TO NAME A COUPLE.

512
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:51,452
THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS IN THERE.

513
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:52,954
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO USE YOUR
TONGUE, ANYWAY?

514
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:55,957
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO KISS WITH YOUR LIPS?

515
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:56,941
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
A REAL KISS

516
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,943
UNLESS YOU USE
YOUR TONGUE.

517
00:24:58,944 --> 00:24:59,443
WHY?

518
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:00,945
WHAT'S THE POINT?

519
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,430
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO DO?

520
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:02,930
LICK THE INSIDE
OF HER MOUTH?

521
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:03,431
ARE

522
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:04,932
YOU SUPPOSED
TO LICK HER TEETH?

523
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,435
DO YOU MAKE YOUR
TONGUE HARD OR SOFT?

524
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:09,437
GOD, BILL. ENOUGH.

525
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:10,421
WHAT? I WANT
TO KNOW NOW,

526
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,923
SINCE EVERYONE
SEEMS TO THINK

527
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:13,407
THAT FRENCH KISSING
IS SO GREAT.

528
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:14,408
OK, BILL.

529
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,910
YOU PUT YOUR TONGUE

530
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:20,414
AGAINST HER TONGUE.

531
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:21,916
WHAT IF SHE PUTS
HER TONGUE

532
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:25,386
TOO FAR INTO
MY MOUTH? WH--

533
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:27,388
WHAT IF I
THROW UP?

534
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,841
WHAT IF I THROW UP
ALL OVER HER?

535
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:30,808
WHAT IF I THROW UP
IN HER MOUTH?

536
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,310
UGH, SHUT UP, BILL!

537
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,278
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

538
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,279
SORRY.

539
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,781
WELL, I'M JUST
TELLING YOU GUYS

540
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:38,282
I'M NOT DOING IT.

541
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:39,267
WELL, I AM,

542
00:25:39,268 --> 00:25:40,768
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

543
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:41,769
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
CAN WE GO?

544
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,771
WELL, IF I TAKE YOU,

545
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,773
THEN I HAVE TO TAKE
GORDON AND HARRIS.

546
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:48,276
GUYS, I CAN'T MAKE IT.

547
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,261
I'M SAVING MY VIRGINITY

548
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:51,762
FOR THE FUTURE
MRS. CRISP.

549
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:52,713
NAH, I HAVE A DATE
WITH JUDITH.

550
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:55,716
EVERY NIGHT'S
A MAKE-OUT PARTY WITH US.

551
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,702
YES.

552
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,186
WHOOPIE.

553
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:02,690
ALL THESE MAKE-OUT PARTIES
START THE SAME WAY--

554
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,191
SPIN THE BOTTLE.

555
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:09,192
THAT'S WHY THIS BOTTLE
IS THE KEY TO OUR
MAKE-OUT FUTURE.

556
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:11,766
HE SPIN

557
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:15,236
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER
WE HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
OR A GREAT NIGHT.

558
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:17,255
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
A BOTTLE, NEAL.

559
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:18,756
OH, CAN'T I?
JUST WATCH.

560
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:22,260
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
ALL WEEK.

561
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,761
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

562
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:26,230
IT'S ALL FINGER CONTROL.

563
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,216
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TRAIN YOURSELF

564
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:30,701
TO MAKE THE BOTTLE SPIN
2 REVOLUTIONS,

565
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:32,703
THEN YOU ADD OR SUBTRACT
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TORQUE

566
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:34,705
BASED ON THE POSITION
OF YOUR TARGET.

567
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:36,173
THAT'S AMAZING!

568
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:39,627
ALL I CAN SAY IS...
HELLO, LADIES!

569
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:44,098
WHAT?

570
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:46,601
WHAT IF...THEY DON'T
WANNA KISS US?

571
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:49,570
THAT'S THE GENIUS
PART OF THE GAME.
THEY HAVE TO!

572
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:52,089
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...I JUST

573
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,091
DON'T WANNA SEE
THE EXPRESSION
ON THEIR FACE

574
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:56,043
WHEN THEY SEE
THAT THE BOTTLE
LANDS ON ME.

575
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:59,046
BILL, WHO CARES
IF THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED?

576
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:03,050
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS IF THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED
AFTER THE KISS.

577
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,552
BUT I KNOW THEY WON'T
WITH ME,

578
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:07,088
BECAUSE I PLAN ON
DELIVERING THE GOODS.

579
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:11,125
DO PEOPLE FREN THE BOTTLE?

580
00:27:11,126 --> 00:27:13,127
SOME DO.

581
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,595
MOST DON'T.

582
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:17,531
I DO.

583
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:20,534
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

584
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:21,018
I T

585
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,555
HINK I'M GOIN'
TO KATMANDU

586
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,558
THAT'S REALLY,
REALLY WHERE I'M GOIN' TO

587
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:30,561
IF I EVER GET OUTTA HERE

588
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:34,565
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO

589
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:38,035
K-K-K-KATMANDU

590
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:41,005
I THINK IT'S REALLY
WHERE I'M GOIN' TO

591
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:44,508
IF I EVER GET OUTTA HERE

592
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:48,012
I'M GOIN' TO KATMANDU

593
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:52,016
I GOT NO KICK
AGAINST THE WEST COAST

594
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:54,986
WARNER BROTHERS
ARE SUCH GOOD HOSTS

595
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:58,489
I RAISE MY WHISKEY GLASS
AND GIVE 'EM A TOAST

596
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,993
I'M SURE THEY KNOW
IT'S TRUE

597
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,478
HERE WE GO.

598
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:04,979

I CAN'T. I'M NOT

UNDERNEATH.

604
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:24,465
BESIDES, I HAPPEN

SO DO I!

WE CAN'T BOTH
WEAR THEM.

607
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:30,955

ARE YOU OK?

YOU REMEMBER THAT SCENE
AT THE BEGINNING
OFANIMAL HOUSE

632
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,518
WHERE FLOUNDER WANTS TO
GET INTO THE FRATERNITY,

BLIND GUYS ARE COOL.

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,980
THEY HAVE SUPERSONIC
HEARING.

639
00:30:08,436 --> 00:30:09,937
YOU'RE RIGHT.

674
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,965
WHAT, YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO?

675
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:30,451
NO, I'M JUST
WONDERING WHY,

676
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:32,453
WHEN NICK
HAS A PROBLEM,

677

THAT'S BECAUSE
I EXPECT MORE FROM YOU.

680
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,962
NICK'S FATHER
IS A HARD MAN.

681
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:43,964
MY OLD MAN
WAS THE SAME WAY.

682
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:46,467
YEAH, I KNOW
THE FEELING.

689
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:12,693
HEY, HOW COME THE BOTTLE

COULD I TALK TO YOU
IN THE KITCHEN
FOR A MINUTE?

I GUESS THEY MAY BE
PRETTY DISTRACTING.

717
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,668
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,171
EH, THINGS KIDS

719
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:05,672
WHEN I WAS A KID,

720
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:07,674
I WAS ALWAYS
BRINGING DOGS HOME.

721
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,693
UH-HUH.

722

I HOPE HE WASN'T
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

780
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:50,354
OH, NO. HE WASN'T
ANY TROUBLE AT ALL.
