Ow!

1433
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,158
I must leave now.

1434
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:56,453
The nature of your universe is burning me,

1435
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:58,747
even worse than my gonorrhea.

1436
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,749
You should get checked, by the way.

1437
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:05,295
If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate.

1438
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:08,382
Let me go with you.
It'll be just the two of us.

1439
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:10,300
We'll make a fire and play Uno.

1440
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:11,969
Fry, stop.

1441
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:15,305
- That's who we were, not who we are.
- But...

1442
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:19,351
My only consolation is that
I did find one among the quadrillions

1443
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,436
who truly understands me.

1444
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:24,231
Colleen?

1445
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:27,442
- Wait a second, are you and Yivo...
- That's right, Fry.

1446
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:29,361
Thank you for introducing us.

1447
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:33,156
Yivo has taught me
what a narrow-minded prude I was before.

1448
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,118
Oh, great.
So what am I supposed to do now?

1449
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,244
Go home.

1450
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:40,205
Find a girl from your own universe
and live on top of her.

1451

(EX CLAIMS)

1452
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:42,791

1455
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:05,814
Maybe Yivo was right.

1456
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:09,109
Maybe I should look
for love closer to home.

1457
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:13,030
- I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...
- Oh, please.

1458
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:15,657
You forgot me quick enough
when you met Colleen.

1459
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:17,159
That's true.

1460
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,661
- How about you, Amy?
- (SCOFFS) Fry...

1461
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:22,539
- I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
- Are you?

1462
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:25,792
Well, then perhaps you misunderstood
the meaning of the term.

1463
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:29,296
It means, "One who doesn't sleep
with my superior officer."

1464
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:31,215
That's the literal translation.

1465
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:34,801
Give the poor girl a break, Kif.
It's not like she had a dictionary.

1466
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:37,387
She was butt naked, for God's sakes.

(GROANS)

1468
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:41,350
So, Wernstrom,

1469
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:45,479
did you happen to notice
those mighty cables Bender used on Yivo?

1470
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,022
Pure diamondium.

1471
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:50,776
More like pure crap-crapium.
No wonder Yivo got away.

01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:03,997
At ease, buckos.

1478
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:07,042
Bender, why did you do it?
We were all so happy.

1479
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,460
And we were in love.

1480
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:11,964
- (SCOFFS) That wasn't love.
- What? How can you say that?

1481
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:14,508
Because Bender knows love.

1482
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:17,886
And love doesn't share itself
with the world.

1483
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:20,973
Love is suspicious, love is needy,

1484
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:24,059
love is fearful, love is greedy.

1485
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:29,940
My friends, there is no great love
without great jealousy.

1486
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,361
I love you, meatbags.

1487
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:18,071
Twenty-four. . .
I'm gonna get twenty-four. . .

1488
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:20,616
I'm gonna get
twenty-fourth century on his ass
