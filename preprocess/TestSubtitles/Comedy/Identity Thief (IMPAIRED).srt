00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,817
Yeah, it's not a company-wide bonus, though.

164
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,277
It's only on the partner level.
It's for retention.

165
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,320
Not for us.

166
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,697
The checks are being cut to the people

167
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,031
on that list, who are all partners,

168
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,784
but the retention program is to
keep the entire company healthy.

169

But there's no money going to...

170

We survived a terrible,
terrible moment in our history,

171
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,625
and we retained 60% of the workforce.

172
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,668
Lost 40, though.

173
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,044
Those are pretty impressive numbers,

174
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,588
so I think everybody
should be happy about this.

175

No, I was just so excited

178

because we haven't had
the bonuses for three years.

179

The company's doing well,
I thought maybe this was the day.

180
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,516
Okay. Just because
Harry Cornish gets a bonus

181
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,184

00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,333
You go somewhere else?

323
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,086
Look, that's my <i>papi.</i>
He owns this store.

324
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,587
- He says cut the card.<i>
- Senior.</i>

325
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,756
- If you don't pay your bills...
- My bills are paid.

326
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,508
Oh, your bills are paid.
I gotta cut the card.

327
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,801
Do not cut that card.

328
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,011
I'm gonna cut the card. I just cut the card.

329
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,848
- Go pay your bills, Randy.
- It's Sandy.

330
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,016
Sandy?

331
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,187
(MOCKING IN SPANISH)

332
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,481
SANDY: How's my credit exceeded?

333
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:26,653
WOMAN: <i>Well, Mr. Patterson,
your balance is $12,243.67.</i>

334
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,616
That's absurd.
I use the card for gas and for coffee.

335
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,954
<i>I'm showing $4,345
from Great Beyond Water Sports.</i>

336
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,331
Well, I'll stop you there,
because I've never heard of that place.

337
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,876
"Great Beyond Water Sports"?
Nope, I've never been there.

338
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,212
And that was this morning?
I just left the house.

339
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,589
Except for the gas station that I went to,

340
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,842
where my card got chopped in half

341
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,678
by an angry man in a glass box, okay?

342
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,973
So, first things first,
I need a fresh card in the mail.

343
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,143
And Loretta,
I need you on the stick to unscrew me.

344
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,229
This is clearly on your end. This is not me.

345
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,314
Or I'll fix it. Where's the surf shop?

346
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,483
<i>Well, sir, it's in Winter Park, Florida.</i>

347
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,529
Florida? I'm in Colorado, you know, so...

Step out of the vehicle, Mr. Patterson.

356
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,058
Okay, coming out of the vehicle
for hands-free?

357
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,060
That seems just a little bit excessive.

358
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,186
Mr. Patterson, you're under arrest.

359
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,228
Under arrest?

360
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,480
You have the right to remain silent.

361
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,564
Hey, wait a second.

362
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,068
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

363
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,529
REILLY: The arresting officer
ran your license through the NCIC.

364
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,407
You were booked for felony assault
two weeks ago in Florida.

365
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,077
What? No, I wasn't.
What are you talking about?

366
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,204
- I've never even been to Florida.
- You've never been to Florida?

367
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,581
No, sir. This whole morning...

368
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,251
Well, hang on a second.
Was it Winter Park, Florida?

369
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,336
See, that's good.

370
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,046
We're dropping the whole
"there's been a mistake" thing.

371
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,589
I got it now. Listen...

372
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,216
The problem is, Mr. Patterson,

373
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,010
is that you missed your court date
three days ago in Florida.

374
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,178
Officer, let me just explain.

375
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,306
And the judge has
issued a warrant for your arrest.

376
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,100
- Yeah...
- So what we're gonna do

377
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,935
is we're gonna go ahead
and ship you back down to Florida.

378
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,061
You can work on your tan.

379
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,145
Sir. Yeah, listen. You're not listening.

380
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,271
- Sit down.
- Sorry.

381
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,940
There's a person that has my same name

382
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,483
that is doing things in Florida.

383
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,612
This guy is making salon appointments,
he's buying beach equipment.

384
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,322
He's maxing out my credit card.

385
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:38,410
Are you Sandy Bigelow Patterson,
born May 18th, 1974?

386
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,494
That is you, correct?

387
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,121
Yeah, but it's not me doing this stuff.

388
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,623
I've never even been to the state.
I'm here with you guys.

389
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,001
I'm in Colorado. How can I be in Florida?

390
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,463
Call Winter Park PD. Pull the mug shot.

391
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,301
Okay, uncuff him.

392
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,138
Uncuff me. That's great.

393
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,973
Can I see?

394
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,475
Whoa.

395
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,102
Is that a woman?

396
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,938
If I had to guess,
it's the woman that stole your identity,

397
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:10,025
obviously taking advantage
of the fact that you have a female name.

398
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh, it's not female, it's unisex.

399
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,654
When you say "stole my identity,"
do you mean credit card fraud?

400
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,031
Oh, no, no, it's a lot worse than that.

401
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,657
What happens is,
they get a hold of your name,

402
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,867
your birthday, Social Security.

403
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,577
And then they run up debt,

404
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,245
get arrested, commit crimes as you.

405
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,872
What do you do now?
You go down, you go get her?

406
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,167
Oh, no, we don't go get anyone.
Let me walk you out.

407
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,628
See, we're Denver PD.
All we do is open and close the case.

408
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,630
Now, if she buys something on Amazon,

409
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,507
then Seattle PD would investigate.

410
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,510
Your mobile company's in Ohio,
then Cleveland PD handles that.

411
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,346
Then so on and so forth
for every single theft.

412
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,556
Well, hang on. How long does all this take?

413
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,516
About six months to a year.

414
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,642
A year?

415
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,852
Yeah. So why don't you go ahead

416
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,937
and just leave your contact information
with this gentleman here?

417
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,148
You might want to hold on to this mug shot
in case you may need it.

418
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,232
SANDY: Great. Okay.

419
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,859
Listen, I'm gonna need this solved

420
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,361
a whole lot quicker than a year, Detective.

421
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,030
Okay, listen, I understand
that this is really frustrating for you,

422
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,449
but our percentage rate
in solving these cases is pretty high.

423
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,575
Yeah? How many?

424
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,868
About 5% to 10%.

425
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,037
That's garbage.

426
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,247
We'll be in touch with you, Sandy.

427
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,972
- Hi, I'm Sandy...
- Mr. Patterson.

428
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,017
- I know who you are. I'm Jessica.
- Hi.

429
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,102
Welcome.

430
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,479
Anything you need, just ask.

431
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,897
Your office is right over there.

432
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,149
Office. Nice to meet you.

433
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,368
- Patterson?
- Sorry.

434
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,246
I had a hell of a morning.

435
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,497
- Listen to this.
- Can you explain this to me?

436
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,581
What do you got?

437
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,668
These are e-mails I received
from a couple of prospective clients.

438
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:52,877
No, no, no.

439
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,713
You defaulted on six credit cards?

440
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,756
- No, I didn't, actually.
- You did.

441
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,966
- No.
- You have nine other delinquencies.

442
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,259
This is what my morning's been all about.

443
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,720
- Your credit score's a 240. A 240!
- (SIGHING)

444
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,597
There are homeless people
with better numbers than that, Sandy.

445
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,766
Dude, you have a warrant
out for your arrest.

446
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,393
This is a financial institution.

447
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,604
How am I supposed to give you access
to $5 billion in funds?

448
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,106
My identity's been stolen.

449
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,941
I was at the police station all morning.

450
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,359
Don't worry about it, though.

451
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,819
I'm gonna get on the phone,
I'm going to clean it up.

452
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,113
They can run my credit tomorrow
and it's gonna be fine, okay?

453
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,448
What the fuck is this?

454
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,284
- Those are cops!
- That's my guy.

455
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,244
This is the detective
that's handling my case.

456
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,497
Hi. I was just
filling my boss in on our situation.

457
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,750
Did you find her?
Do you have some good news?

458
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,960
No, I'm sorry,
we don't have any good news.

459
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,504
Soon after you left,
we got a call from Orlando Metro.

460
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,758
They just busted a narcotics dealer
named Paolo Gordon.

461
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,594
Your name and your credit cards
turned up in connection

462
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,970
with the investigation.

463
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,305
Ah! This... (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

464
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,684
One of my colleagues spoke
to your former employer, Mr. Harold Cornish.

465
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,769
Yeah.

466
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,271
And he said that, in fact,
you are a drug dealer.

467
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,647
(CHUCKLING)

468
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,567
That's... He's a fucking liar.

469
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,320
I've got a warrant to search the premises.

470
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,072
- For drugs.
- Oh.

471
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,656
And guns.

472
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,367
And guns.

473
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,826
- This is a waste of time.
- I understand.

474
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,496
It's not me, it's the woman in the picture.

475
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,289
- Just doing my job.
- I need to put that out.

476
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,874
Okay.

477
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,001
(SIGHING) Okay, guys, let's...

478
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,174
Okay, we're done.

479
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,884
You can let your employees back in now.

480
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,010
Thank you.

481
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,012
- So, no Oxy?
- No, no Oxy.

482
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,180
Did you find my weapons?

483
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,599
I'm not an idiot, Mr. Patterson, okay?

484
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,393
I know almost certainly
it's the woman in Florida.

485
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,644
Yeah.

486
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,729
But until we know for sure
that you didn't do this,

487
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:35,980
it's an open investigation.

488
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,524
For narcotics.

489
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,362
Let me walk you out.

490
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,866
We're gonna have to
talk about our options.

491
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,494
I think we got to let you go.

492
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,300
I know where she is. Hey!

493
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,429
I know exactly where she's gonna be
tomorrow afternoon.

494
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,597
If I tell you, you can tell
the Winter Park Police Department,

495
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,850
they can grab her, and we're done.

496
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,019
- No, no, it doesn't work like that.
- Why not?

497
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,354
Well, they'd have to
bring her up on local charges first.

498
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,732
And it would pretty much
be about a year before we get a shot at her.

499
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,901
I mean, she'd have to be
standing right here to do you any good.

500
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,029
That's the new standard of police work?

501
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,322
The criminal's got
to be standing right in front of you?

502
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,116
- Have a good day.
- Hang on, hang on.

503
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,410
If they won't bring her here,
what if I bring her here?

504
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,661
What if, somehow, I get her here,

505
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,746
and I put her right in front of you,

506
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,081
she gives you a full statement
and owns up to everything?

507
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,916
Then we'd be done, wouldn't we?

508
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,585
Oh, I wouldn't recommend
that, Mr. Patterson.

509
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,295
You see, criminals generally just don't

510
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,880
volunteer confessions to policemen.

511
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,299
All right, what about this?

512
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,760
What about if I ask her to talk to you?

513
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,929
Because she cost me my job
and I want to get my job back,

514
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,640
and in return, I don't press any charges.

515
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,268
She doesn't have to worry about me.
There's no cops.

516
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,478
But there are cops.

517
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,730
You're down the hall,
you're listening to a thing. I'm wearing...

518
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,273
(CHUCKLING) What? That's ridiculous.

519
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,608
No, no, no, this sort of thing

520
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:02,901
- tends to work pretty well.
- Right?

521
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,486
And we do have enough
for an eavesdrop warrant.

522
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,946
No, no. Sandy, I need somebody
here doing the work right now.

523
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm the best at what I do.
Those are your words.

524
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,617
I'm just looking for a little bit of time.

525
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,244
We don't have time.
I'm supposed to put everything on hold?

526
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,287
We have clients!

527
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,748
Listen, I gave up everything because
I believe in you. Just believe in me.

528
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,459
Come on, you know me. Come on, Daniel.

529
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,090
- I'll give you one week.
- Really?

530
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,132
But that's it.

531
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,635
That's all I need. Thank you.

532
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,845
One week, Patterson!

533
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,431
I'm calling to confirm
my wife's appointment for tomorrow at 3:00.

534
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,684
Thank you. She ended up
making the appointment.

535
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,603
I didn't realize that
she's gonna be in the area.

536
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,357
Anyway, I need your address
because she lost it.

537
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,610
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

538
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,779
She'll see you tomorrow at 3:00. Bye-bye.

539
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,658
Okay. I've got cash for the plane ticket,
I've got my sock money.

540
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,660
- Did you call the cab?
- Don't do this.

541
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,663
Don't start this again.
Trish, I need you to just hang in there.

542
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,331
This is not who we are.

543
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,916
- You're not Batman.
- Do not unpack this.

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,668
Please, I can't refold all this stuff.

545
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,503
- Do you even know how to use those?
- It's just in case.

546
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,672
It is my only option.

547
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,883
It is our only option.

548
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,511
Let me see the picture of her again.

549
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,851
Make you feel better to see that?

550
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,935
Uh-huh.

551
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,312
Yeah. She's not dangerous.

552
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,565
That number right there is her height.

553
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,901
It's hobbit height.

554
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,195
I'm going after Bilbo.

555
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,323
Yeah, I can do this, I really can.

556
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,159
But I can't do it without your support.

557
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,203
Okay? Please trust me.

558
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,414
Thank you.

559
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,542
If all goes well,
I'll be right back here tomorrow night.

560
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,919
Also, I borrowed your anxiety pills

561
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,546
because I might have to
coax her onto the airplane.

562
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,214
Oh, good. Okay, that's fine

563
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,716
'cause why would I need those right now?

564
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,886
I'll call you when I land, okay?

565
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,137
Goodbye, you guys.

566
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,181
Daddy, the TV's broken.

567
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,559
Oh. Well, you know. Come here.

568
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,229
Some things are broken,
but only for a few days.

569
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,731
That's why I have to go on this trip

570
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,232
to pretty much the worst place in America.

571
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,068
But Daddy's gonna fix these problems.

572
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,362
When I get back, it's all gonna be perfect.

573
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,697
I promise, okay? Come here.

574
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,699
It's too late for TV anyway,
you guys are going to bed.

575
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:18,578
Do some drawing, and then PJs. Goodbye.

576

- Sorry about that.

you were gonna come to a full stop

Oh, a mama badger
and a baby crossing the road.

No, this is totally my fault.
You got your license on you?

595
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,734
Why don't we swap information?

596
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,694
We can get
the insurance companies involved.

597
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,114
I guess that's what it comes to.

but that's a custom paint job. Thank you.

You know, if it's okay with you,

00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,542
I'm okay and I'm cool with just doing cash.

Yeah, cash would be a lot easier,
wouldn't it, Sandy Bigelow Patterson?

Yeah.

603
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,050
Bigelow is such a rare name.

From a debt collector, huh?

633
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,190
<i>I guess she bought herself a car.</i>

634
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,359
Well, honey, that is just...

635
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,403
You sound really weird.
Are you sure you're okay?

636
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,406
Yeah, I'm good.

637
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,248
Okay.

638
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:39,714
Let's see what kind of crap
you have in your bag, Sandy Patterson.

639
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,852
Here you go. Thanks.

640
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,875
Ooh! Nice.

641
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,796
- Ding-dong!
- Shit.

642
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,214
Put it down.

643
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,800
- Now, we're gonna have a little chat.
- Okay.

644
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,512
Okay? We can do it the hard way,
or we can do it the easy way.

645
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,931
I'd like to pick the easy way.

646
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,599
Get over here and give me your wrists.

647
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,519
(SIGHING) Okay.

648
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,354
Now, I have a plan...

649
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,398
(CHOKING)

650
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,317
Shit! I'm a lady, you fucking animal.

651
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,111
Give me your wrist. Stop fighting me.

652
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,739
Yeah, I'll fight it. You
like that? You like that?

653
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,866
How about that? You like hitting girls?

654
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,576
Sandy? This isn't cute, Sandy!

655
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,660
Stay down!

656
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,204
Oh, shit!

657
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,040
Shit.

658
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,001
Shit, shit. Ow!

659
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,086
Ha!

660
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:01,755
Stay down.

661
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,590
You threw like a fucking girl.

662
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,675
Now, once you hear my plan,
you're gonna wanna come with me.

663
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,594
I'm not going anywhere with you!

664
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,304
- Fuck you, Sandy.
- Damn it. Stop right there and listen to me.

665
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:13,183
No, go home to your shitty wife
and your fucking dumbass kids.

666
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,267
Stop right there!

667
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,061
(GRUNTING)

668
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,063
Why did you do that?

669
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,314
You did that.

670
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,232
(PANTING)

671
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,692
Well, that was not the easy way.

672
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,403
I loved that guitar. I'm gonna sue you.

673
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,780
You're gonna sue me?

674
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,824
Really, you're gonna sue me?
Enjoy the empty accounts.

675
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,493
I'll be taking my car keys.

676
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,495
And what are these?

677
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:34,621
These are future victims?

678
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:35,955
Put my shit down.

679
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,123
They can thank me later.

680
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,959
Is that how you buy all this crap?
What do you need this for?

681
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,002
You're sick.

682
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:46,257
This stuff is things I use
for my charity that I help children with.

683
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,342
For the what?

684
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,135
For my children's charity, you dick.

685
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,512
Oh, that makes sense. I apologize.

686
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,305
Now, you're coming with me.
Give me your wrist.

687
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,932
What's your name, by the way?

688
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,892
- Julia.
- Julia?

689
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,185
MARISOL: Diana!

690
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,229
Open the fucking door!

691
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,272
Shit!

692
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:02,440
Who's that?

693
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,026
Just changing my clothes. I'll be right out!

694
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:08,863
MARISOL: Don't lie to me.
Those credit cards you sold Paolo were shit.

695
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,740
No, no, no, it's a misunderstanding.

696
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,743
It will be so funny
when I explain it to you guys.

697
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,495
MARISOL: You're coming with us, now!

698
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:16,788
Just give me the car keys.

699
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,331
No, you're not taking the car again.

700
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:19,624
(GUNSHOT)

701
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,126
DIANA: Shit!

702
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,055
Go, go, go!

703
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,104
What? What the...

704
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,313
You little bitch.

705
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,070
SANDY: You just make friends
wherever you go, huh?

706
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,156
- Who were those people?
- Don't worry about it.

707
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,908
And what the hell is that?
Is that a bobby pin?

708
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,243
Yep, sure as shit is.

709
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,661
You're wasting your time.
That's not coming off.

710
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:57,996
Yeah, we'll see about that.

711
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,789
How about you just apologize
for getting me shot at?

712
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,041
I'm not gonna apologize for that

713
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:05,170
because you should not
have broken into my home.

714
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,839
So, it's a little lesson for you, Sandy.

715
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,382
- Pull over.
- I'm not pulling over.

716
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,092
We're going to an airport

717
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,428
and we're taking
the first flight to Denver, Diana.

718
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,889
Why don't you pull over
before I kick your ass again?

719
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,432
As soon as I explain it,
you're gonna come with me. All right?

720
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,435
I'll tell you what, why don't we find a bar,
we calm down a little bit...

721
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,937
I buy you a drink, I talk, you listen?
Does that sound fair?

722
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,898
That sounds fair, Sandy.

723
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,441
You'll behave yourself if we find a bar?

724
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,859
- Oh, totally.
- Great.

725
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,027
Yeah, I'll behave myself

726
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,945
because you will have probably dosed me

727
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,822
with a shitload of Trish Patterson's Xanax.

728
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,115
Hey, when did you get those?

729
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,451
I had two hands down your pants,
and you didn't notice,

730
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,453
so you should deal with that.

731
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,913
Fucking dead below the waist.

732
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,039
You're disgusting.

733
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,624
Just pull the car over.

734
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,750
- Is that what you want?
- Yes.

735
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,293
Jesus Christ, yes.

736
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,797
Here you go. You're sure?
Right in the middle of the highway.

737
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,923
Yeah, right in the middle of the highway.

738
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:51,049
Really?

739
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:55,220
All right. I'll tell you what, then.
I'll just call the police

740
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,930
and I'll tell them that there's a criminal

741
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,598
out here with a known warrant

742
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,183
just hanging around the highway.

743
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,102
I got a lot of evidence they'd like to see.

744
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,521
You got nothing.

745
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,233
Hey! I'm calling the police right now.

746
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,485
Good luck, pal. I'll be long gone.

747
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,362
- It's ringing.
- (PANTING)

748
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,951
What are you, a fucking Kenyan?

749
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:21,204
Listen, I just need you to talk to my boss.

750
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,747
That's it. And I won't press charges, okay?

751
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,290
I'm losing my job because of you.

752
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,500
- Your job?
- That's right.

753
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,710
I didn't fire you.

754
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,753
- Effectively, you did.
- I don't think I did.

755
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,172
And I don't wanna go to Colorado
and meet your anxious wife.

756
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,799
You're right, she is anxious.
She's very anxious.

757
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,009
You wanna know why?

758
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,469
Because we have two daughters
and a third on the way.

759
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,887
We live in a very, very small apartment,

760
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,306
about half the size
of that house I bet you stole.

761
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,683
Hey, I worked hard for that house.

762
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:46,312
I'm proud of it.
I have a seven-year amorticized sub-rate...

763
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,439
It's amortized.

764
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,608
Well, I can't get into that.
You're not gonna get it.

765
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,735
Enough, all right?

766
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:55,196
This is a free trip, okay?
It's on me, all right?

767
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,489
No cops.

768
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,199
All you need to do is
talk to my boss, that's it.

769
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,744
And then we're done.
That's all. It's very simple.

770
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,203
Come on, it's in Denver.
You're gonna love it.

771
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,580
There's nobody shooting at you there.

772
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:04,956
You stay here, they're gonna find you.

773
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,293
Hey, hey, hey!

774
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:12,756
Come on.

775
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,716
This is ridiculous.

776
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,343
(GROANING)

777
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:17,844
Shit.

778
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:18,887
You blow a tire?

779
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,473
Yeah, I blew a fucking tire.

780
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,932
Why don't you rest that in the car?

781
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,976
Put the air on.

782
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,103
I won't talk to the cops.

783
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,147
Right, no cops. I said that.

784
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:30,273
And don't lie to me.

785
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,108
I'm not. I'm not lying, I swear.

786
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,735
Yeah? You swear on your kids?

787
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,362
(SCOFFING)

788
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,197
Yeah, swear on your kids.

789
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,908
Yes, I swear on my kids.

790
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,913
Shotgun.

791
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,207

I think you're painting it with
the most negative brush possible.

898
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:59,454
I bet that they would paint it
the same exact way.

899
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,873
- I mean, what you do is...
- I use the system.

900
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,085
- I use the system that's provided...
- You cheat the system.

901
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,128
Now, the fact that I...
No, I do not cheat the system.

902
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,339
I use the system. If there's a loophole,

903
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:10,757
and I go through the loophole,

904
00:43:10,882 --> 00:43:12,384
I'm not doing anything wrong.

905
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,427
You create a lot of destruction.

906
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:17,389
You know, it's not my fault
if people don't check their own finances.

907
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,308
All you do is make one call
to the credit card company,

908
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,644
they take the charge off.
It's a victimless crime...

909
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:23,728
You don't take any accountability for this?

910
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,689
It's not a victimless... I'm a victim!

911

We're kind of in the midst
of a pivotal moment here, you know?

912
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:30,443
This is...

913
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:33,780
I think we might want to take stock of this.

914
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,033
We're kind of bonding.

915
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,578
It's kind of like family,
or brother and sister,

916
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,832

917

We are just driving to Denver.
There will be nothing else.

919
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:52,173
I just thought,

920
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:54,426
in the spirit of honesty, I'd put out there

921
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:55,969
that I visually enjoy you.

922
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:57,595
Hmm.

923
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:02,517
And I've always, you know,
really liked tall men.

924
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:06,813
What are you talking... I'm average height.

925
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:08,148
Not to me, stretch.

926
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,316
- Great.

00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,821
I love that.

929

930
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,157
We're not.

931
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:21,161
You know, they say driving
tired is more dangerous than driving drunk

932
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,830
and that's a statistical fact.

933
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:25,999
I doubt it.

934
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,960
You know, I drive drunk all the time.

935
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,839
Never had a problem. I slept-drove
once and I smashed into an Arby's.

936

00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,090
Just right at the base.

952
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,389
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

953
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:24,015
Come on.

954
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:28,770
Oh! This is nice.

955
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,565
It's nice and soft, Walt. You like that.

956
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:35,151
Just leave me out of the school plays, okay?

957
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,361
I'm not comfortable with it.

958
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:39,364
Now, I have allotted us each $8 per meal,

959
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:42,075
- (SIGHING)
- so it looks like you can get one of the...

960
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,411
One of the salads or a soup or...

961
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:45,620
Sorry, I'm quick.

962
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:48,164
The tomato soup for me,
please. That'll do it.

963
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,042
I'm going to take a full
slab of the baby backs,

964
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:54,004
and I'm going to take
that with mashed taters,

965
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,091
hushpuppies and I'm
going to have a sweet tea.

966
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,384
The fuck you are.

967
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,178
(CHUCKLING) I don't know what that means.

968
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,097
I asked you to eat less food.

969
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,767
What is wrong with you?

970
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,644
This is a beautiful woman.

971
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,021
You let her eat.

972
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,024
No, he's right.

973
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,610
You know, I've put on a little bit of weight
because of all the stress.

974
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:19,738
- Walter is a fireman.
- (GROANING)

975
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,574
Yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

976
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:25,452
He was in a pretty intense...

977
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,578
She doesn't care.

978
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,540
...accident last year,
and he injured his male parts.

979
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,209
- Oh.
- They're just shredded down there.

980
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,794
And now he can't work.

981
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,755
He wants to fight fires,

982
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,424
and he wants to pee standing up.

983
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:43,595
Don't you want to pee standing up?
I know you do, but he can't.

984
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:44,804
Just bring two soups.

985
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:48,725
And he can't lay with me
like a husband should,

986
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:50,185
on account of the injury.

987
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:51,394
And I don't even need him to,

988
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,814
but he gets mad at me,
and takes his anger out on me.

989
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,524
And then I feel bad about myself

990
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,151
and I feel ugly, and then I eat.

991
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,695
Lord knows, I know I eat. I know I do.

992
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:04,366
No, no. You just wait right here,
sweetheart, okay?

993
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:05,700
(SNIFFLING) Okay.

994
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,035
I'm going to wait right here.

995
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:08,203
SANDY: God.

996
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,496
You're breaking the rules.

997
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:10,914
You understand that?
You're breaking the rules.

998
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,832
Society can't function without rules.

999
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,000
Ah.

1000
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,168
You follow the rules, right?

1001
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:16,294
I sure do.

1002
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,129
Oh, yeah, how's that working out for you?

1003
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,257
Yeah. Hold on just a minute.

1004
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:23,134
(WEEPING)

1005
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:28,431
This is from the buffet,
and it is on the house.

1006
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:29,766
That's so sweet.

1007
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,186
Enjoy your soup.

1008
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,523
And if you have to pee,
the ladies' room is right back there.

1009
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:40,652
- God bless you. God bless you.
- All right. Okay, okay.

1010
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:42,028
(SNIFFLING)

1011
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,282
You know what a sociopath is?

1012
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,618
Do they like ribs?

1013
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,832
Hey, how you doing?
I need one room, two beds, please.

1014
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:54,916
Oh, sorry.

1015
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,168
We only have single beds left tonight.

1016
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:58,545
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

1017
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,797
We don't really mind.
I mean, it's an inconvenience,

1018
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,049
but my husband can't really
digest stuff anyway

1019
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,175
(SIGHING)

1020
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,970
because of his intestinal surgery,
so just comp us the mini-bar.

1021
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:08,346
He can digest Pringles.

1022
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,682
Right, that's right. I'm Walt.
This is the wife, Myra.

1023
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,351
She's a functional idiot.
Wears diapers like a chimp.

1024
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:15,020
I'm running her down to Disneyland.

1025
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,563
She loves the noise and the sugar.

1026
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:17,689
He's just tired from the drive.

1027
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,315
We're going to have to figure out
the mattress thing

1028
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,734
because even though I
can't have sex with her

1029
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,652
due to my cock and balls getting shot off

1030
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,778
in an apparent warehouse fire...

1031
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:24,946
Oh, shit.

1032
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,531
I wouldn't share a bed with her anyway.

1033
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:29,075
I'd much rather sleep on the floor.
Do you want to know why?

1034
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:30,243
Because you got no dick?

1035
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,246
Close. It's because she repulses me.

1036
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,207
She's the worst person I've ever met.

1037
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,918
Screw you. You got a bar?

1038
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,754
Yeah, the Foxhole. It's across the lot.

1039
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,048
- Thank you.
- You're not going to the Foxhole.

1040
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:45,925
Hey. I don't need to go to Denver.
You need me to go to Denver.

1041
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:48,053
No splitting up.

1042
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,304
Do you still want the room?

1043
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:51,181
Yeah, I do, real quick.

1044
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:52,432
Fucking chimp on the loose.

1045
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,768
It's not my business,
I'm really sorry about your dick,

1046
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,897
but you got to treat your lady better,
or somebody else is gonna.

1047
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:01,566
Appreciate it. Are we
on the set of your talk show right now?

1048
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,402
Do you know what? Being nice is a choice.

1049
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:05,570
Can I just get the fucking key?

1050
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:07,989
Uh... Oh! Are you in a hurry?

1051
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:09,991
Oh, no.

1052
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:11,951
I have to go get this magnetized,

1053
00:49:11,993 --> 00:49:13,745
because it wasn't magnetized properly.

1054
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,121
- This might take a while.
- (SIGHING)

1055
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:18,249
Can I have a double melon ball?

1056
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:23,838
Thanks.

1057
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,716
Is that a melon ball?

1058
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,385
Yep.

1059
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:32,472
Do you like milkshakes?

1060
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,141
I'm just trying to have a drink.

1061
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:38,937
Sorry, that probably sounded
like a dumb pickup line, I apologize.

1062
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,361
I don't like milkshakes, I love them.

1063

(CHUCKLING)

1064
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:50,115
You're going to flip out over these.

1065
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:52,325
Stu, mix us up two grasshoppers.

1066
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:54,369
Oh!

1067

I'm Big Chuck.

00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,290
Yes, you are.

1069
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,167
I'm Margie.

- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- You, too.

1071
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,297
I love a man that wears jewelry.

1072
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:08,133
Thank you very much.

1073
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,803
I like my turquoise like I like my women,

- American and top-grade.
- Oh!

1075
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,557
100%.

1076
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,225
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
- 100%.

1077
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:19,019
To you.

1078
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:25,984
You know what they say about grasshoppers?

1079
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,027
Mmm-mmm.

1080
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,779
Hard on the outside
and soft and creamy on the inside.

1081
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:32,282
Oh, I always like soft and creamy.

1082
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:34,242
- I'm soft and creamy.
- I know you are.

1083
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,289
Why don't we go make sure
that table's okay?

1084
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:41,499
Looks like it's in danger.

Let me get your bag.

I'd like you to get that,
like you to get that.

1088
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,429
I'll just get your drink for you.

Hey.

You're here five minutes,
you already made a friend, huh?

- Howdy, Walt. I'm Big Chuck.
- Hi, there.

I got to tell you,
this little Margie is quite a lady.

01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:38,163
Okay.

1582
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:40,373
It's almost over.

1583
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:45,003
(GRUNTS) Trouble. He's got the neck.

1584
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:46,421

(GROANING)

1586
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,177
God! Don't let it come near me.

1587
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:53,261
That hurts!

1588
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:54,929
(SANDY YELLING)

1589
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:57,349
That hurt. That hurts!

1590
01:15:57,515 --> 01:15:58,683
Oh, God.

1591
01:16:17,577 --> 01:16:18,578
- (GROANING)
- Okay.

1592
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,663
Okay. Go slow, fella.

1593
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,541
Just go slow. Easy.

1594
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:27,420
Where are we? What is this?

1595
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:30,090
Bus station, middle of nowhere.

1596
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:32,133
Whose pants are these?

1597
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,927
I got them out of the lost and found.

1598
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:35,929
It's a good fit, huh?

1599
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:38,431
Yeah. Okay. Better get on a bus.

1600
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:43,061
We're not getting on any bus for three days,
not to Denver.

1601
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:44,187
What?

1602
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,606
There's not a bus
from here to Denver for three days.

1603
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:50,068
Hey. When's the next bus to Denver?

1604
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:52,278
Wednesday.

1605
01:16:54,572 --> 01:16:57,075
Fuck! That's too late.

1606
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:05,959
Phone's gone, wallet's gone
because the pants are gone.

1607
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:07,627
(SIGHING)

1608
01:17:15,927 --> 01:17:17,470
We're done. I'm done.

1609
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:22,475
I lose, you win. You're a great thief.

1610
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:25,311
I got nothing left.

1611
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,693
I got no money, I got no time,
I got no job, I got no chance.

1612
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:42,162
I've got these weird pants on,
out in the middle of nowhere.

1613
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,708
How did we get here anyway?

1614
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,544
I carried you.

1615
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:50,670
You what?

1616
01:17:51,629 --> 01:17:53,882
I carried you. It's not a big deal.

1617
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,551
You were unconscious.

1618
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,178
We were like, a half
mile from the main road.

1619
01:17:58,345 --> 01:17:59,346
Jesus Christ.

1620
01:17:59,429 --> 01:18:02,390
So, I just...
I scooped you up and flagged down a truck,

1621
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:05,185
and he gave us a ride here, dropped us off.

1622
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:09,356
You carried me a half mile. That's, uh...

1623
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:12,317
Probably not even that far.
(CLEARING THROAT AWKWARDLY)

1624
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,861
You get these shoes
the same place you got the pants?

1625
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:17,489
No. Yeah.

1626
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:20,200
The clerk said
an EMT took them off a dead hobo, so...

1627
01:18:20,867 --> 01:18:21,868
Come on.

1628
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,203
He's not going to need them back, so...

1629
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:25,330
A guy died in these?

1630
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:26,539
Because you needed shoes.

1631
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:28,041
What is the matter with you?

1632
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,753
My socks, though...

1633
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,380
They're your socks,
they're not dead guy socks.

1634
01:18:33,546 --> 01:18:35,757
I've got money in here.
I've got money. I got sock money.

1635
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,841
We don't have...

1636
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:39,552
- What the hell?
- Hey.

1637
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:42,389
Why are we living like animals
if you've got money in your socks?

1638
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:44,891
I've got $300
and I need to be in Denver by Tuesday.

1639
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:47,352
You can get a pretty cheap car
over there at Andrew's.

1640
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:49,396
Tell him Carl sent you.
He's a good man, Andrew.

1641
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:50,897
He was with my sister for a bit.

1642
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:51,981
Oh, yeah?

1643
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:56,569
You got a beautiful yard here, Andrew.
Here's 200 of the finest.

1644
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:58,113
Keys? Thank you.

1645
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:00,657
Ooh! And it's got satellite.

buying that one. Jesus.

Morning.

1651
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:34,149
I'm supposed to be
meeting some friends here.

1652
01:19:34,315 --> 01:19:37,152
Was there a man and a lady
come through here?

1653
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:39,112
Both answer to the name Sandy.

1654
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:41,114
Well,

1655
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:42,949
we get tons of people through here.

1656
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,707
- Ahhh!
- I've had a shitty day

1657
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:53,793
and you got a face
that looks like a dog's asshole.

1658
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,045
Were they here or not?

1659
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:57,464
They came through earlier.
I sent them to get a car.

01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:58,631
Where?

(MARISOL CHUCKLING)

1673
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,514
That's what I always thought,
but then I thought,

1674
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:48,890
"You know what? I'm going to do it.

1675
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:50,767
"I'm going to wallpaper the garage."
And I found...

1676
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,019
First I thought,
"Well, is that going to be crazy?"

1677
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:54,521
But it's not really that crazy,

1678
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:56,398
because I found something
kind of thematically on point.

1679
01:20:56,564 --> 01:20:58,650
You wouldn't rather just listen to this?
That's a good song.

1680
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:02,070
Oh, it is a good song.
I like that. It's got tires on it.

1681
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:05,240
It's wallpaper with tires,
which I thought was...

1682
01:21:05,323 --> 01:21:06,366
Ow!

1683
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:08,034
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1684
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:11,246
I think it would be so cute.
It's red and...

God damn it!

- It was one of those badgers.
- Oh.

01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:38,982
How great is the ride on this Caprice, huh?

1688
01:21:39,232 --> 01:21:40,900
You know this is the last tank, right?

1689
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:42,610
This is not going to get us to Denver.

1690
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:44,612
You know, I could help us out.

1691
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,323
How? Did you find some sock money?

1692
01:21:47,532 --> 01:21:51,036
No, I didn't find sock money.
But I've got my credit card burner.

1693
01:21:51,202 --> 01:21:53,371
I can get a card,
fill this tank up in 15 minutes.

1694
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:56,166
I told you, this trip
will not turn me into you.

1695
01:21:56,332 --> 01:21:58,335
I am not saying that we have to go out

1696
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,337
and steal from orphans and baby puppies.

1697

No one deserves to get stolen from.

1698

I don't know why you don't get that.
Just drop it.

1699
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:06,259
I get it, I just find it bizarre

1700
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:08,345
that you don't have any kind of shit list.

1701
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:09,596
I find it pretty hard to believe

1702
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:10,930
that you can't come up with one person

1703
01:22:10,972 --> 01:22:13,892
that deserves the wrath of Sandy Patterson.

we're gonna get his financial information</i>

<i>for your little credit card toy.</i>

1709

<i>Social Security numbers,
bank account numbers, routing numbers,</i>

1710
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:35,205
<i>it's all stored on hard copies in there,
in the Record Room.</i>

1711
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:36,706
<i>We just need a little code to get in there.</i>

1712
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:38,958

get in there with you looking like that.</i>

1713
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,670
SANDY: <i>That's a great point.
There is a way around that.</i>

Oh! (GROANING)

1715
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:45,799
Are you okay?

1716
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:47,634
What is it? What is it?

1717
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:50,303
My fibromyalgia.
Oh, God, my leg is cramping up.

1718
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:51,721
- What can I do? What can I do?
- Oh, God. Rub it.

1719
01:22:51,888 --> 01:22:52,972
- Rub it?
- Rub it! Rub it!

1720
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,140
Rub it! It's cramping.

01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:01,022
Higher, higher, higher.

01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:02,273
- Higher.
- A little higher.

How is this helping you?

Oh, God! (GRUNTING)

1729
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,375
God, get in there! All right, get off me.

1730
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,459
Get off me.

1731
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,513
I thought it was gonna
be a couple of offices.

1732
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,181
No. Come on.

1733
01:23:37,183 --> 01:23:38,268
Who is this guy?

1734
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:42,188
That's Accounts Processing.
That's the "me" of this branch. Come on.

1735
01:23:42,355 --> 01:23:43,690
Oh. That shouldn't be any problem.

1736
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,442
No offense, but just keep your mouth shut.

1737
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:47,527
This will be over in a minute.

1738
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:50,321
Hi. Good morning.

1739
01:23:50,488 --> 01:23:54,868
Tina... Van Westengarden. How are you?

1740
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:58,163
I'm fine. Can I help you?

1741
01:23:58,371 --> 01:24:01,875
I'm here with my boss, Harold Cornish.
We're in from Denver.

1742
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,585
Oh. I'm familiar with the name.

1743
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,003
DIANA: I'm sure you are.

1744
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,880
We're gonna need
to get into your Accounts Room.

1745
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,923
Do you have an authorization letter?

1746
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,891
(SOFTLY) I'm gonna be real honest with you.

1747
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:19,351
I fucked up.

1748
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:24,064
I just kind of completely
blanked on that authorization letter.

1749
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,233
He basically runs me 24-7. He's...

1750
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,028
Cornish is... He's a handful. I mean...

1751
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:32,072
Honestly, he's an asshole.

1752
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:35,158
And I'm just hoping that we can

1753
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,954
figure something out,
and you can do me a solid and...

1754
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:43,124
You know, I don't think
you want to see me shit-canned.

1755
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:45,794
On my birthday.

1756
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:49,756
'Cause I'm getting married.

1757
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:52,092
This weekend...

1758
01:24:53,593 --> 01:24:54,969
'Cause I got pregnant.

1759
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:56,930
Just a sec.

1760
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:59,766
Twins. And my cat died.

1761
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:00,934
How are we doing over there?

1762
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,727
We doing good? You calling security?

1763
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:05,146
You better not be calling security.
Hang up the phone right now.

1764
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:06,398
I wasn't calling security.

1765
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:07,899
Yes, you were. Hang it up.

1766
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:09,567
Right now.

1767
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:12,821
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed back there
without authorization.

1768
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:15,198
I'm not... You're not allowed back there
without authorization.

1769
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:16,574
I can do whatever the hell I want.

1770
01:25:17,158 --> 01:25:19,327
I don't have to tell you that we suspect

1771
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:20,912
that there are some people at this branch

1772
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,539
that are doing some very, very bad things.

1773
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,290
And I don't have to tell you
that I've been sent here

1774
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,544
to look very quietly at some records.

1775
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:31,715
Mr. Cornish, I don't mean any offense,
but we have rules.

1776
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,508
I know you have rules.

1777
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:35,301
Like never backdate a 5590

1778
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:39,472
or don't stamp a 33-B transfer
without telling a client first.

1779
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,975
I bet you do that one twice a month,
don't you?

1780
01:25:43,226 --> 01:25:45,061
Tanya, can you give us a minute, please?

1781
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:47,397
It's Tina, but...

1782
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:49,065
- See what I mean?
- What did I say?

1783
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:50,525
Nothing. You said that.

1784
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:53,570
I have you at a disadvantage.

1785
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,031
You don't know me, but I know you, Ken.

1786
01:25:56,197 --> 01:26:00,035
I know that you make $49,395 a year.

1787
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:04,080
I know that you work very hard
for that wife and child right there.

1788
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:05,999
I know that you're real good at your job,

1789
01:26:06,082 --> 01:26:07,584
that you take care of this company

1790
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:10,337
and you do things
that they'll never know about,

1791
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,588
that they'll never appreciate.

1792
01:26:11,671 --> 01:26:13,465
So, you're very proud, right?

1793
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:15,383
But you're scared.

1794
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:17,969
You're scared because you're dispensable.

1795
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:21,473
You're scared because you know that,
more than likely, one day,

1796
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:25,018
you're gonna be replaced
by somebody younger, somebody cheaper,

1797
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:26,227
maybe even by an app.

1798
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:28,063
But not me.

1799
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,024
I'll be fine, 'cause
I'm on a different level.

1800
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:37,197
So if I don't get into that room today,
I'll be okay. But not you.

1801
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:39,783
You're still going to be scared.

1802
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,119
And that's not fair, is it?

1803
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:45,789
Here's what we can do, though.

1804
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:49,417
You can help me today
and someday I might be able to help you.

1805
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:52,170
But you're gonna have to break the rules.

1806
01:26:53,713 --> 01:26:54,839
9488.

1807
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:16,236
Got it.

1808
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:24,369
Let me see it.

1809
01:27:24,577 --> 01:27:26,246
This is it. Right there.

1810
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:28,957
We got it.

1811
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,458
All right. That's what I need.

1812
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,559
Shit.

1813
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,436
(BEEPING)

1814
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:55,442
Got it.

1815
01:27:56,776 --> 01:27:58,361
- Got it.
- Wow.

1816
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:16,629
Okay, great. Good job.

1817
01:28:16,796 --> 01:28:19,257
Let's put this baby to use,
get some gasoline and hit the road again.

1818
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,801
Wait, wait, wait. Hit the road? No, no.

1819
01:28:21,968 --> 01:28:25,263
I am exhausted. I need to sleep
for at least a couple of hours.

1820
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,807
I need something to eat
that doesn't come out of a bag

1821
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:30,810
and I need to put
at least some of my parts into a shower.

1822
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:31,895
I bet you're a real mess.

1823
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:33,813
Do we get you a Motel 6, or something?

1824
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:37,150
Motel 6? No, no, no.

1825
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:39,903
Mr. Cornish, we go wherever we want.

1826
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:43,740
Come on. Let's go.

1827
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:53,124
I need a room, please.

1828
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:54,250
How about a suite?

1829
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:56,336
Thank you, Mr. Cornish.

Yeah, spoke to Daniel.

You are, but I gotta admit,
you taught me something.

1882
01:32:57,035 --> 01:32:58,495
Well, you taught me a few things.
You taught me

1883
01:32:59,245 --> 01:33:03,416
about getting what you want,
and you taught me about confidence.

1884

Maybe a little bit too
much about confidence.

like the chump anymore.

01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:16,838
You know what?
Actually, we'll take this to go.

2214
01:53:17,005 --> 01:53:19,799
We gotta go. It's very late. Let's go.

2215
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:21,885
I can't believe how beautiful she is.

2216
01:53:22,635 --> 01:53:25,388
I mean, to me, she still...
She really does look like a Diana.

2217
01:53:25,472 --> 01:53:26,514
Let it go.

2218
01:53:27,015 --> 01:53:28,433
I'm letting it go, but...

2219
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,226
Sorry.

2220
01:53:30,393 --> 01:53:31,519
Are you kidding me?

2221
01:53:31,603 --> 01:53:33,355
- You are pulling these out of your pocket.
- No.

2222
01:53:33,521 --> 01:53:36,107
I will shiv you in the yard.
I will shiv you in the yard, I will.

2223
01:53:36,566 --> 01:53:39,194
PRISON GUARD:<i>All right,
visitation's over in five minutes.</i>

2224
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:40,612
All right, break it down for us real quick.

2225
01:53:40,904 --> 01:53:42,572
Okay. Here we go.

2226
01:53:42,989 --> 01:53:44,032
Math, A.

2227
01:53:44,115 --> 01:53:45,116
Typical.

2228
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:46,493
Accounting, B.

2229
01:53:46,576 --> 01:53:47,702
Nice.

2230
01:53:47,786 --> 01:53:49,037
And Econ?

2231
01:53:49,204 --> 01:53:51,164
- Well, you know.
- What happened?

2232
01:53:51,331 --> 01:53:53,124
You guys have been
studying for weeks, haven't you?

2233
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:54,876
I know, but I just got this.

2234
01:53:55,335 --> 01:53:56,419
(MOCK GASPS) Oh!

2235
01:53:57,295 --> 01:53:58,630
Nice going.

2236
01:53:58,797 --> 01:53:59,839
I know. I know.

2237
01:54:00,006 --> 01:54:01,091
I'm putting this in the file.

2238
01:54:01,257 --> 01:54:04,719
Oh, come on, it's not like
somebody's gonna hire an ex-con.

2239
01:54:05,011 --> 01:54:07,722
I'm actually starting a first step program,

2240
01:54:07,889 --> 01:54:09,307
and I have a few years to figure it out.

2241
01:54:09,349 --> 01:54:10,850
Three, with good behavior.

2242
01:54:11,017 --> 01:54:13,061
And how is that going, by the way?

2243
01:54:13,144 --> 01:54:14,187
Great. Great.

2244
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:15,355
- Decent, you know.
- Good.

2245
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,858
Some of these dykes are still
really getting up into my sweet junk,

2246
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,443
but I don't let them.

2247
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:22,779
Girls, "sweet junk" is just...

2248
01:54:22,946 --> 01:54:25,907
Dessert. She's having
a problem in the mess hall.

2249
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:26,991
We should probably get going.

2250
01:54:27,033 --> 01:54:29,536
The lesson there, if you listen,

2251
01:54:29,744 --> 01:54:31,788
is that if you're in the woods,

2252
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:36,126
maybe a boyish female bear with corn rows

2253
01:54:36,543 --> 01:54:41,381
comes at you this way,
meaning this way, and you just deflect.

2254
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:46,094
It is always nice to see you,
and we'll wait out...

2255
01:54:46,261 --> 01:54:47,345
Girls, let's get going.

2256
01:54:47,429 --> 01:54:49,973
What are you gonna do?
Not let them in, right? Come here.

2257
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,599
Bye, Diana.

2258
01:54:51,766 --> 01:54:53,476
Stay beautiful, okay?

2259
01:54:55,854 --> 01:54:56,938
Okay, I'll see you in a couple months?

2260
01:54:57,147 --> 01:54:58,773
Okay. Love you.

2261
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:00,400
Love you, too.

2262
01:55:01,526 --> 01:55:02,819
I got you something.

2263
01:55:03,403 --> 01:55:05,071
- Ooh!
- I pulled some strings with Reilly,

2264
01:55:05,238 --> 01:55:08,616
and we ran your fingerprints
through the Wisconsin state database,

2265
01:55:08,783 --> 01:55:10,326
and we got that.

2266
01:55:14,289 --> 01:55:15,457
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

2267
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:17,584
My name.

2268
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:21,254
Dawn Budgie.

2269
01:55:23,214 --> 01:55:25,508
(VOICE BREAKING)
That's a terrible fucking name.

2270
01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:27,635
(SNIFFLING) It's a really bad name.

2271
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:32,432
It's not as great as I
was hoping, but it's you.

2272
01:55:33,099 --> 01:55:34,601
Thanks, Sandy.

2273
01:55:38,063 --> 01:55:40,148
But I already know who I am.

2274
01:55:48,114 --> 01:55:49,908
Yep. Thanks.

2275
01:56:02,754 --> 01:56:03,880
(SNIFFLING)

2276
01:56:12,764 --> 01:56:14,599
Back in your cage, bitch.

2277
01:56:16,559 --> 01:56:18,228
- (TASER CLICKING)
- Shit!

2278
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,355
- Budgie?
- (GASPING)

2279
01:56:23,942 --> 01:56:25,110
Sorry.

2280
02:00:19,928 --> 02:00:21,680
SKIPTRACER: <i>No, Sandy's a girl's name.</i>
