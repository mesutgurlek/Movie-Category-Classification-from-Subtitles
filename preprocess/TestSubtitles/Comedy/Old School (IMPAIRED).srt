00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,114
Yeah?

160
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,242
- Put in a good word for me.
- Yeah, okay.

You're the lady.

Excuse me.

I'd like to say I'm really glad
and proud to be here tonight.

171
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:40,421
I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.
I haven't seen him in eight years.

172
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,330
That's great.
Congratulations.

173
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,426
I love you, Dad!

174
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,165
True love is hard to find.

175
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,332
Sometimes you think you have true love,

176
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,775
and then you catch the early flight
home from San Diego,

177
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,076
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

178
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,244
like a goddamn magic show,
ready to double-team your girlfriend...

179
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,085
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

180
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,523
because I think what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

181
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,794
Let's raise our glasses,
whatever we got in front of us.

182
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,855
Salute. Health and happiness.

183
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,797
Cheers, everybody.

184
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,336
I love you so much, Frankie.
I love you.

185
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,270
I'm not a talker.

186
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,638
I love you.
Congratulations.

187
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,057
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

188
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,329
- This is great.
- How did you land this place?

189
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,303
I don't know, it was pretty easy, actually.

190
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,001
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

191
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,440
That's awesome!

192
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,904
That's awesome.

193
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,244
A little housewarming.

194
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,250
To new beginnings.

195
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,778
Thanks.

196
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,259
Actually, I gave this to you
for your wedding.

197
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,591
This model?

198
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,995
No, this exact one.

199
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,798
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,802
I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,098
It's okay.

202
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,900
I hope you like it.

203
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,974
I love it.
Thank you.

204
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,034
This place is unbelievable.

205
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,170
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

206
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,648
This is the probably the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

207
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,309
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

208
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,252
Do not get selfish on me here, okay?
Now stay with me.

209
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,256
You put a bar in over there, right?

210
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,522
Couple La-Z-Boys to fill it out, a smarter
couch. You could put a hot tub anywhere.

211
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,323
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

212
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,395
We're gonna get so much ass here,
it's gonna be sick.

213
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,526
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

214
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,900
That sounds like a lot of fun, but

215
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,963
I need a little time to get
my life back together.

216
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,908
We need to throw a big
kick-ass party to start things off.

217
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,242
Absolutely.
Break it in a little, meet the neighbors.

218
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,248
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

219
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,578
Break it in.

220
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,109
The real estate guy was really
adamant about not having...

221
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,089
I don't think you realize what
a huge opportunity this is for you.

222
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,853
Girls love a guy who's in your
particular situation.

223
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,087
What situation?

224
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,220
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

225
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,663
You're like an injured fawn
nursed back to health,

226
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,566
who's finally gonna be rereleased
into the wilderness.

227
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,193
[Glass breaking]
Sorry.

228
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,862
[Baby crying]
Please be careful.

229
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,601
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Don't say sorry to me, say it to the baby.

230
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,267
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

231
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,243
It's okay. It happens.

232
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,610
We should go tropical with this thing.

233
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,946
Like sand from wall to wall. I know a great
sand guy, we'll get it at price.

234
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,075
Sand in here?

235
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,746
Or foam, whatever.
Something in here.

236
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,449
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

237
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,118
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

Yeah, that's it.

285

I got a student alt rock band

I own six Speaker Cities.

I'm worth $3.5 million,

than a damn KISS concert.

for a fuckin' marching band?

- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

I wouldn't drink tonight.

Well, actually,
pretty nice little Saturday.

We're going to Home Depot.

303
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,176
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

304
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,209
Stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath
and Beyond, I don't know.

it's so good.

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,365
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

472
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,602
Campus patrol?

473
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,912
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

474
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,777
- [Beanie and Gordon laugh]
- I'm the dean.

475
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,874
Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

476
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,079
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

477
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,214
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

478
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,816
What are you talking about?

479
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,454
You can't just do that. I've already paid
the first and last month's rent!

480
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,792
Take a look at that.

481
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,632
You have a week to vacate the premises,
and I thank you for your cooperation.

482
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,000
Great.

483
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,272
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

484
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,832
It's been good seeing you guys.
It looks like you're doing great.

485
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,818
Frank, this is a safe place.

486
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,826
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

487
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:47,331
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

488
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,923
We can say anything here.

489
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:50,926
Anything?

490
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,499
It's okay, honey.
That's why we came.

491
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:04,472
Well, I guess I...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

492
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,608
I mean, suddenly you get married

493
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,247
and you're supposed
to be this entirely different guy.

494
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,153
I don't feel different.

495
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,016
Take yesterday, for example.

496
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:20,155
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

497
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,926
And...

498
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,960
I happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order,

499
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,237
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

500
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,634
Her panties.

501
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:42,046
Odds are they're probably
basic white, cotton underpants.

502
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,750
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties."

503
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,554
"Maybe it's a thong."

504
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:54,030
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about."

505
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,591
You know? And I started feeling...

506
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:58,991
What?

507
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,730
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest. Are we not?

508
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,503
- We are. It's okay.
- Okay?

509
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,741
It's okay. Please continue.

510
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,775
I don't know
where I was going with that.

511
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,385
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

512
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:22,256
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

513
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:26,491
that I'm gonna have sex
with only one person

514
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,227
for the rest of my life.

515
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,699
Walsh tells me
your San Diego trip was a blast!

516
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,068
Yeah.

517
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,574
How was Hooters?

518
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,701
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

519
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,370
Yeah, right.

520
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,913
Skittles?

521
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,346
No, thanks.

522
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,906
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

523
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:51,081
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

524
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,680
What's wrong with it?

525
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,215
Well, for one thing, it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth

526
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,923
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1966.

527
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,728
Most notably, clause four.

528
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,063
Shall I continue?

529
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,660
- Actually, I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

530
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,729
- Hi, Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

531
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,505
I don't think you've met my daughter.
Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

532
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,614
Nice to meet you, Mitch.

533
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,707
Hi. Nice to meet you.

534
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,116
- How was the slumber party?
- Great. You know,

535
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,348
movies and popcorn.

536
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,354
She's an angel.

537
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,659
It makes me sound an old man, but I can't
believe how fast she's growing up.

538
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,526
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry honey, but it's true.

539
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:38,092
To think that in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school!

540
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,864
[Coughs violently]

541
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,770
You okay?

542
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,775
I thought you said high school.

543
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,834
Yeah.
Shocking, isn't it?

544
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,707
Yes, it is.

545
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,287
Give me a break.

546
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,950
Hey, Mitch.

547
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,060
Hey, man. Did you have a good day?

548
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,964
Not too bad.

549
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,603
What's going on?

550
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:17,869
I thought maybe I could crash here
tonight, if that's all right.

551
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,843
Marissa is going through
some personal stuff.

552
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,783
Personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked?

553
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,412
That and some other stuff.

554
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,890
No problem.
Make yourself at home.

555
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,186
Thanks.

556
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,395
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

557
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,626
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

558
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:45,227
In other words, forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society,

559
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,067
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

560
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,304
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

561
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,346
where community status
and more importantly, age,

562
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,644
have no bearing whatsoever.

563
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,912
Yeah? From the guy who probably
won't get in.

564
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,682
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

565
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,714
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

566
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,920
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

567
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:13,328
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

568
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,765
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

569
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:20,794
As well as provide no public service
of any kind. This much I promise.

570
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,102
What the hell is going on here?

571
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,666
Guys, this is a very special occasion.

572
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:29,703
The Godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence.

573
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,112
- The Godfather!
- [Applause]

574
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:34,516
This is his damn house.
He lives here, he sleeps 20 feet away.

575
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,790
We need to talk.

576
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,046
Kitchen.

577
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,459
Sit good for me. I'm gonna talk
to Uncle Mitch for a second.

578
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,321
There you go, buddy.

579
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,595
- How long have these people been here?
- All day.

580
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,262
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

581
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,100
What are you talking about?

582
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,608
This is called "rush."
We're officially starting a fraternity.

583
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,667
I like it. It's genius!

584
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,371
You've got to be kidding me.

585
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,539
You heard Pritchard, all right?
We're obligated to do this.

586
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,711
This house, he says, is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

587
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,617
Fraternity solves both of those.

588
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,384
But this is my house.
I live here, Beanie.

589
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,790
I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

590
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:19,524
I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

591
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,567
Did you or did you not
have a good time at the party?

592
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,431
I had an awesome time.

593
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,895
I know you had an awesome time.

594
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,440
The entire town knows
you had an awesome time.

595
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,068
I'm trying to ask Mitch whether
he had an awesome time.

596
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,838
- I had a good time.
- Okay, that's good.

597
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,937
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

598
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,346
- More good...
- God. I mean...

599
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:42,182
I don't understand. I don't know why it's
so hard for you to admit you want this.

600
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,621
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

601
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,954
Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

602
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,928
I know you guys are trying to help,
but the truth of the matter is,

603
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:55,831
I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

604
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:59,962
And the fact is,
I've got 40 strangers out in my living room

605
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,768
and all I want to do is
get some fuckin' sleep.

606
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:07,107
So, I'm sorry, but we're not
starting a fraternity.

607
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,375
I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "F'ing."

608
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,541
All you got to do is
say "earmuffs" to him.

609
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,642
Then you can say,
"fuck, shit, bitch," whatever you want.

610
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,050
Cock. Balls.

611
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,919
I'm just proving a point.
You don't have to celebrate it, Frank.

612
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,390
- Sorry.
- Don't say sorry to me.

613
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,087
You let down Frank, you let down me,
you let down Max, most importantly.

614
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,357
And right about now,
I'm having a real hard time

615
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,992
trying to figure out why I take my time out of
my schedule to try to help you get over...

616
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,093
Earmuffs. That whore that you dated.

617
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:37,005
Wanna go out and see the other guys?
Uncle Mitch is sorry.

618
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,144
Say "yes."

619
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,303
Yes.

Here's the deal.

01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,648
I got to say,
I'm kind of impressed by him.

1245
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,086
Well, we're expelled.

1246
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,623
My life is over and I'm gonna wind up
working at Red Lobster.

1247
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,457
- You already work in Red Lobster.
- Yeah, but it's part time, dick.

1248
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,122
- Guys.
- Hey, listen.

1249
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,658
This is a serious situation.
I mean, I'm kicked out of school.

1250
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,571
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My mom's gonna kill me.

1251
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,869
Come on, she's not gonna kill you.

1252
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:16,275
Yes, she is. I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

1253
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:21,544
When I left, she said,
"Weensie, if you screw this up, I'll kill you."

1254
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,942
She showed me the knife.

1255
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:27,485
- [Weensie sobbing]
- [Beanie:] Shhh.

1256
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:32,157
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.
He's gonna take care of this thing, okay?

1257
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,889
It's gonna be all right.

1258
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,193
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

1259
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,896
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

1260
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,966
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

1261
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:49,272
Good. I need your help with something.

1262
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,973
Off the record.
You do this, you're in.

1263
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,480
Sir, yes, sir.

1264
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:57,417
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7-A,

1265
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,545
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

1266
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,954
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

1267
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:04,891
Booker, make two copies of this petition,
have it notarized,

1268
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,520
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then I need...

1269
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,997
Listen, Donald tells me you got these guys
working prep for the arbitration.

1270
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,263
I told you five times, I want them working
the Sunshine Square deal.

1271
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,930
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

1272
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,270
so now I have them helping
with the arbitration,

1273
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,969
and I'd appreciate it if you let me
handle my own team,

1274
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,138
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

1275
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,105
All right.

1276
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:30,175
Wanna make sure
you're on top of it.

1277
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,685
Well, I am.

1278
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,949
Well, good. Carry on.

1279
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,083
See? That's why they call him
the Godfather.

1280
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:37,989
Hey.

1281
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,322
Just take care of it.

1282
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:48,265
Gentlemen, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

1283
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,202
Did a little research.

1284
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,639
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

1285
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,700
We have the right to a formal evaluation

1286
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,440
before they can deny
our official application.

1287
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:02,450
However, we're now subject to
a charter certification review

1288
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:03,985
given by the board of trustees.

1289
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,418
Damn it.

1290
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:09,120
Wait. Wait, what does
that mean exactly?

1291
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:13,093
According to university bylaws,
it's a thorough inspection of the fraternity,

1292
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,153
and our contribution to the community.

1293
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:17,495
Focus is on five categories:

1294
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,899
Academics, athletics, community service,

1295
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,598
debate, and school spirit.

1296
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:26,840
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

1297
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,809
And I'll see you around campus.

1298
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:31,813
Actually, all of us are
being tested. Yeah.

1299
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,873
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

1300
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:38,545
It's in the bylaws. Every member
of the fraternity is subject to review

1301
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:41,089
in every category,
including academics.

1302
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,057
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

1303
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,754
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

1304
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:48,992
This is unbelievable.

1305
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,864
What happened to, "needing brotherhood
now more than ever?" They need us.

1306
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,994
Come on, college is
overrated anyway.

1307
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,301
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

1308
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:02,401
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

1309
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,469
and now people's lives are ruined.

1310
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,981
Ruined? Like, whose life is ruined?

1311
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,108
Well, let's see.

1312
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:10,909
Blue's dead.

1313
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:12,954
Frank's divorced.

1314
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:16,856
I've lost my house.
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

1315
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:21,226
And now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school,

1316
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,492
and you're not even gonna
help 'em out.

1317
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:41,444
Is this thing gonna go down smooth or
what? I'm missing 18 holes of golf here.

1318
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,350
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

1319
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,944
It should make for
a very entertaining day.

1320
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,615
I'm going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus.

1321
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:49,555
Ditto.

1322
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,986
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

1323
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,565
Unfortunately,

1324
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:02,866
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

1325
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,635
So, we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

1326
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,909
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's <i>Crossfire,</i>

1327
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:15,473
famed political consultant,
the Raging Cajun,

1328
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,280
Mr. James Carville.

1329
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,445
[Applause]

1330
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,820
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Don't clap.

1331
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:27,089
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here, sir.

1332
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,289
Topic number one.

1333
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,094
What is your position
on the role of government

1334
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:38,037
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

1335
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,275
Well, Dean, I'm glad you
asked that question...

1336
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:44,471
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

1337
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,973
Have at it, hoss.

1338
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,984
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

1339
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,855
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

1340
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,556
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited.

1341
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:05,794
And as a corollary, the market
for technologies is shrinking.

1342
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,359
As a world leader,
it is important for America to provide

1343
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,598
systematic research grants
for our scientists.

1344
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:14,609
I believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well-articulated innovation policy

1345
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,976
with emphasis on
human resource development. Thank you.

1346
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,009
[Applause]

1347
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,713
Where'd that come from?

1348
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,447
What happened? I blacked out.

1349
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,045
It was awesome.

1350
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,920
That was interesting.
Thank you very much.

1351
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:33,291
And your rebuttal,
Mr. Carville?

1352
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,389
We have no response.

1353
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,666
That was perfect.

1354
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:46,204
That's the way you do it!
That's the way you debate.

1355
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,143
Number 12.

1356
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:03,321
Which of the following is
a generally accepted graphical technique

1357
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,850
for determining first order
system parameters?

1358
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:11,930
Is it, A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics?

1359
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,335
B, Pythagorean triplets?

1360
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:19,568
<i>Or C, the migration method of graphing</i>
<i>quadratic functions?</i>

1361
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,546
Harriot's method of solving cubics.

1362
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,605
<i>The answer is A, Harriot's method</i>
<i>of solving cubics.</i>

1363
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,549
Good test.

1364
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,032
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

1365
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,570
Go Harrison!

[Laughing]

1378
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,269
Dean Pritchard,
can I talk to you for a second?

1379
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,931
Megan, I'm a little busy.

1380
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,635
I didn't get into
Columbia Law School.

1381
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,268
How awful.

1382
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,439
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

1383
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,607
You're right, I did say that.

1384
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,776
No one at Columbia
has even heard of you.

1385
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,114
Oh, Megan.

1386
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:14,715
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

1387
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,122
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work.

1388
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,683
I bribe people all the time,
but I changed my mind. It's a free country.

1389
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,820
Lesson learned.

1390
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,466
<i>[Banging on locker]</i>

1391

Damn it!

1392
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:31,972
Sorry, guys, I lost my composure out there.
I'm an idiot.

1393
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,339
Frankie, don't worry about it.
We'll make those points up, I promise you.

We gotta stay in the goal.
You can't be walking around.

1549
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:38,040
You're killing me.
Can we stay between the posts?

1550
01:28:38,111 --> 01:28:41,638
I want focus, I want intensity,
and I want "1,2,3"!

1551
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:42,841
Woofers!

1552
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:46,818
Go, go, go, eat 'em up!
Hungry! Eat 'em up!

1553
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:50,983
Caleb, you know what to do in the box.
We talked about it, in the box!

1554
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:53,026
Chill out, we're up by six.

1555
01:28:53,093 --> 01:28:57,826
That ref's a real prick out there.
That's right, you heard me, my man!

1556
01:28:57,898 --> 01:29:01,698
Number four's been throwing elbows,
and someone's kid's gonna get hurt.

1557
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:03,167
What?

1558
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,068
Let's make it official then, jackass!

1559
01:29:05,138 --> 01:29:06,901
Let's make it official!

1560
01:29:07,774 --> 01:29:10,800
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

1561
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,937
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

1562
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,649
Is that Frank the Tank?

1563
01:29:16,717 --> 01:29:18,810
Hey. Heidi.

1564
01:29:19,686 --> 01:29:22,621
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

1565
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:25,522
I got into body painting.

1566
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:27,423
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1567
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:28,586
That's great.

1568
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:31,324
Well, you're looking
very healthy.

1569
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:34,697
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, so are you.

1570
01:29:34,768 --> 01:29:36,702
Oh, thank you.

1571
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:40,137
So, I heard you and Marissa
split up. Is that true?

1572
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,072
Yeah, we did.

1573
01:29:42,809 --> 01:29:44,743
You poor baby.

1574
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,104
You know, I'm having
this get-together

1575
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,772
at my place
tomorrow night.

1576
01:29:48,949 --> 01:29:52,680
Like a few Internet friends.
You should swing by.

1577
01:29:52,753 --> 01:29:54,744
- Really?
- Totally.

1578
01:29:55,589 --> 01:29:57,022
- Okay.
- All right.

1579
01:29:57,090 --> 01:30:00,253
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

1580
01:30:03,096 --> 01:30:04,427
Awesome.

1581
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:05,931
Yes!

1582
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,700
I am back!

1583
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:12,466
