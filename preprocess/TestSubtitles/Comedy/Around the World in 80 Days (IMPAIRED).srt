1
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,704
[alarm bell ringing]

2
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,641
[man]
To the Bank of England! Quickly!

3
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,143
Surround the building!

4
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,874
You go that way! You go this way!

5
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,057
- [whistle blowing]
- There he is!

6
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,093
- Come on!
- After him, men!

7
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,764
[shouting]

8
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,382
[shouting]

9
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,511
That way!

10
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,706
- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!

11
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,148
Come on, mates! Keep up!

12
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,857
Sorry, sir.

13
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,971
[metal clanging]

14
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,512
Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.

15
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,542
Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.

16
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,055
And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.

17
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,559
- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.

18
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,290
We will make history.
Or we will die trying.

19
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,697
- Die?
- This is very exciting.

20
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:24,101
That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,

21
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:28,403
electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

22
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,103
I quit!

23
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,973
He is a very sick man!

24
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:42,512
The electrocution was not my fault!

25
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,820
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

26
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,917
We're looking for a bank robber.

27
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,130
Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,430
Oh... Aah!

29
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,098
[groans]

30
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,705
I'm your new valet.

31
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,640
Uh... I must commend
the valet service

32
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,010
on their impeccable foresight.

33
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,312
But they know I only
accept French valets.

34
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,410
Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!

35
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,149
I come from a long line
of French valets.

36
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,885
On my father's side.
Very, very French.

37
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,462
- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.

38
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:29,594
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.

39
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,103
[steam hissing]

40
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,934
- [whistle blowing]
- Very well.

41
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:37,103
Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?

42
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:41,671
- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.

43
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,809
- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,886
[rumbling, hissing]

45
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,290
And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.

46
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,824
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!

47
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,045
Uh-uh-uh...

48
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,553
Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.

49
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:30,757
We need more speed, man.

50
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,265
Waah! Wee-yoo!

51
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,668
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.

52
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,102
[screaming]

53
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,437
- Forty-seven.
- [groaning]

54
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,069
- Forty-eight.
- [whining]

55
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,943
Forty-nine.

56
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,983
Eureka! We've done it!

57
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,249
[screaming]

58
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,614
[screaming]

59
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,924
Uh...

60
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:01,985
Waaah!

61
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,553
I say, I say. Uh, good morning.

62
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:08,397
- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!

63
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,266
There he is. There's my valet.

64
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,431
- [screaming]
- [people screaming]

65
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,839
Sorry! New valet.

66
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,009
[screaming]

67
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,452
Whoa!

68
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,389
- [screaming]
- Whoa!

69
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,693
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

70
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,664
- [both screaming]
- You'll be able to let go any second.

71
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,291
The pack will run out of steam

72
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:45,805
in exactly three, two, one.

73
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,636
- Now.
- [screaming]

74
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,972
Look out!

75
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,073
- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.

76
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,142
[panting] Good-bye, sir.

77
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,188
It's been very nice valeting for you.

78
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,993
Let's... do it again soon.

79
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,425
Please, wait!

80
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:11,555
With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.

81
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,725
No!

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,734
[bobby] Spread out!

83
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,133
- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.

84
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,037
- I take the job.
- Splendid!

85
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,439
I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.

86
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,266
[applause]

87
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,809
[man] Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.

88
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:32,580
And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,

89
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,985
Dr. Ramsey invented this.

90
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,823
[gasps]

91
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,555
Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Science

92
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,531
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,

93
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,797
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.

94
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,839
Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.

95
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,571
Don't just stand there. Read it.

96
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,670
Oh. Um...

97
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,376
"It is with great distress

98
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,147
that Scotland Yard announces

99
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,984
that the Bank of England...
has been robbed."

100
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,183
[crowd gasps]

101
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,253
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!

102
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,958
You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!

103
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,626
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."

104
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,500
It's the same thing, you idiot!

105
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,731
- Please, please, not the quills!
- [shrieking]

106
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,743
Lord Salisbury!

107
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,804
Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.

108
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,749
To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.

109
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,380
A woman in the Royal Academy?

110
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:46,186
The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.

111
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:50,491
- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.

112
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,022
Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,

113
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,466
please inform General Fang

114
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,129
what other items were stolen
from the bank.

115
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,663
[whimpering] Nothing else.

116
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:05,178
Exactly. It seems
your little land dispute

117
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,373
has spilled over
onto our noble shore.

118
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,939
Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,

119
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:16,353
you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.

120
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,753
Kitchner.

121
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:25,491
My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.

122
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,966
This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.

123
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,552
A female general.

124
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,887
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

125
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,695
Cor!

126
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,564
- Come away from here.
- [boy] Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?

127
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,042
My wind-powered pulley system

128
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,637
circulates the house with fresh air.

129
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:17,707
Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,

130
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,252
and the blue is for laundry.

131
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,686
But most importantly,
this supplies the house

132
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:26,021
with a running current of electricity.

133
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,124
Electricity.

134
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:34,031
This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.

135
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,969
It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.

136
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,563
I must live my life
with total efficiency...

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,108
to maximize my inventing capacity,

138
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:47,010
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.

139
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,540
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.

140
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,988
Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.

141
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:01,194
Passport. Too.

142
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,787
Passepartout.

143
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,424
[whistles]

144
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,867
[Passepartout] Bottled light.

145
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,499
A miracle.

146
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,043
Hardly.

147
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:22,571
Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.

148
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,516
It turns on with a whistle.

149
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,553
- [whistles]
- [machinery winds down]

150
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,818
- [Fogg] Please don't do that.
- [Fogg whistles]

151
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,916
Ah, I see your eye is drawn

152
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,621
to what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.

153
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,527
A giant moth?

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,294
- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?

155
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,497
Yes.

156
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,370
No. But it will... one day.

157
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,502
One day it will transport people
through the air.

158
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,513
Perhaps over entire oceans.

159
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,878
[whistles]

160
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,214
Uh-oh.

161
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,344
I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.

162
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,730
Dear Father:

163
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:20,569
I will find the fastest way
back to China...

164
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,074
to make our village safe once again.

165
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,146
[ringing]

166
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,191
Passepartout?

167
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,129
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.

168
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,563
Prepare my urban transport device.

169
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,567
Prepare my urban transport device.

170
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,364
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

171
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,234
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

172
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,170
Clear the way. Clear the way.

173
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,644
Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!

174
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,839
Excuse me. Out of way.

175
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,180
- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.

176
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,652
- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!

177
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,555
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.

178
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,616
That will be all.

179
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,963
Gentlemen.

180
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,467
Today I have proved that man

181
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,505
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier

182
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,040
without disrupting
his internal organs.

183
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,097
[murmuring]

184
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,702
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

185
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,179
What am I thinking? What a fool.

186
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,376
That would mean that you
were a real scientist!

187
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,112
[laughing]

188
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,950
By your definition,
a real scientist's objective

189
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,287
would be to prevent man from progress.

190
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,320
We live in a golden age, Fogg.

191
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,455
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.

192
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,658
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist

193
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,066
on a past filled with dinosaurs...

194
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,661
and evolution.

195
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,933
- [laughing]
- And on a future filled

196
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,941
with motorized vehicles,

197
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,341
radio waves,

198
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,346
and flying machines!

199
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,645
Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!

200
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,521
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.

201
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,024
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.

202
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,793
Nothing.

203
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:31,726
Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.

204
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,231
[whispering]

205
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,409
No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.

206
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,506
[murmuring]

207
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:49,584
In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.

208
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,914
I heard it from a very reliable source

209
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,961
that it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegians

210
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,428
with very tiny feet.

211
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,158
[murmuring]

212
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,327
It's about time
someone robbed that bank.

213
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,632
- [gasping]
- Like this very institution,

214
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,729
the Bank of England is outdated.

215
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,866
As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.

216
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,137
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,

217
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,048
but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

218
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,648
So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.

219
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,122
Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.

220
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,627
Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.

221
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,360
From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,

222
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,835
where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.

223
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,429
In little over a month,
that man could be in China.

224
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,938
If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globe

225
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,946
and returned to England in a fortnight.

226
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:52,348
[laughing]

227
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:57,754
Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.

228
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,063
Outstanding idea.

229
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,102
Well, then, Fogg,

230
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,037
let's see you circumnavigate the world

231
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,540
in 80 days.

232
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,607
I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.

233
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,875
I'm on the verge of numerous...

234
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,417
countless... scientific breakthroughs.

235
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,749
You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.

236
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,390
It can! I could do it.

237
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,792
A wager.

238
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,093
- £10,000.
- [clamoring]

239
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,066
Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.

240
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,269
I believe every man has his price.

241
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,436
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.

242
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:56,141
There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.

243
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,915
There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.

244
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,082
[clamoring]

245
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,354
I could lead Britain
and the rest of the world

246
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,057
into a new age of progress
and discovery.

247
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,499
[laughing]

248
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,297
- Fair enough.
- What?

249
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:23,005
I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow

250
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:27,672
to surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...

251
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,840
- No!
- No! No!

252
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,852
if he can circumnavigate
the globe...

253
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,480
in no more than 80 days.

254
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,317
But if he cannot,

255
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,420
he must never set foot
in this academy again,

256
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:50,335
he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,

257
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,963
and he must swear...

258
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,099
never to invent again.

259
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,145
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.

260
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,673
You promise so much, yet you deliver...

261
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,343
oh, nothing.

262
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,717
[laughing]

263
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,653
- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?

264
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,495
I'll take your wager!

265
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,895
He did it.

266
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,332
Then it's done.

267
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:28,704
A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.

268
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,333
[laughing]

269
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,901
This is going to be rather amusing.

270
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:39,550
History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forget

271
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:44,282
the moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.

272
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,417
- [bell tolls]
- By the strike of noon,

273
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:51,293
after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the world

274
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,225
in 80 days!

275
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,238
[cheering, applause]

276
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,306
[Fogg] Oh, dear.

277
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:08,814
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?

278
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:12,079
[crowd chanting]
Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!

279
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,215
- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?

280
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,119
Huh?

281
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,125
Uh, Passepartout.

282
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,196
Would you... sit with me a moment?

283
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,894
Yes, sir.

284
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:39,677
I risked everything,
my entire life's work.

285
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,006
For something you believe in.

286
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,109
Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.

287
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,425
You are honorable, Passepartout.

288
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,290
But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.

289
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,264
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?

290
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,839
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.

291
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,508
This house and my inventions
are all I have.

292
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:23,148
And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.

293
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,761
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.

294
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,195
Yes. Yes. Yes!

295
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,259
You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.

296
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,639
[man] We're with you, sir!

297
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,839
Good luck!

298
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,515
Halt!

299
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,850
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.

300
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:05,761
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.

301
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:10,235
This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.

302
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,495
Vehicle code?

303
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,335
Code 431.

304
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:18,503
All vehicles
must be powered by horses.

305
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:22,412
Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,

306
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,347
excluding giraffes and...

307
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,009
You're driveling. Stand aside.

308
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,679
I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.

309
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,279
Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!

310
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,325
- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.

311
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,025
It's... Ow!

312
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:42,193
[shrieking, blubbering]

313
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,395
- [loud crash]
- [crowd moans]

314
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,271
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.

315
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:53,779
Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.

316
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,041
- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.

317
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:59,107
We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,

318
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,949
if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.

319
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,293
Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!

320
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,126

Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.

322
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,797
What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officer

323
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,342
if he can't abuse the law properly?

324
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,843
- Kitchner.
- Sir!

325
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,846
Tell Fix to pack his bags.

326
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,939
- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.

Hmm. Smart man.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,868
Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we must

331
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:28,339
leave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.

332
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,308
Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.

333
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,639
- Passepartout?
- Yes?

334
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,771
In French.

335
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,383

338
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,794
- What did he say?
- Uh...

339
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,825
He say...

340
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,840
- What?
- He says not to worry.

341
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:11,009
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.

342
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,678
Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!

343
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,846
I will not miss this train.

344

[bell jingles]

00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,491
Ah!

346
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,289
- Very amazing.
- What?

347
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,953
What does it say?

348
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,430
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.

349
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,729
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

350
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,793
What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.

351
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:35,534
I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.

352
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,734
Good idea.

353
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,282
See? Exposition. Science.

00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,253
[speaking Chinese]

355
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,831
I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.

356
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,425
Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.

357
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,838
Wait a moment. This isn't science.

358
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,370
This is art.

359
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:11,876
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

360
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,139
That painting is highly inaccurate.

361
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,977
[woman] It's not
supposed to be accurate.

362
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,053
The artist views reality
through imagination

363
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,352
rather than simply recording it.

364
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,120
It is called "lmpressionism."

365
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,692
Well, um, I'm not impressed.

366
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:36,326
Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,

367
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,267
and a man cannot...

368
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,448
fly.

369
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,507
You feel something.

370
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,849
You dream of flying.

371
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,650
Or of naked men.

372
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,191
- Sometimes.
- Ah.

373
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,422
The flying. N-N-Not the men.

374
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,431
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.

375
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,731
Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.

376
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,862
What did he say?

377
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,238
- Oh, no.

Non.

381
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,273
Goodness. What was that all about?

382
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:54,279
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

383
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,811
Champagne for everyone!

[shouting in Chinese]

00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:14,123
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.

386
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:19,532
Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?

387
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,935
No. It would be far too limiting.

388
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,306
At least your work
shows genuine promise.

389
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:30,682
Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.

390
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,684
I was lacking inspiration.

391
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:36,380
I found some men
to help me find Mr. "Edimon."

392
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:40,458
- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

[shouting in Chinese]

394
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:43,625
He's very eager.

395
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,197
[shouting] Get him!

396
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:58,967
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?

397
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,568
No, no, it's...

398
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:01,908
- clever.
- Oh.

399
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,175
Hmm. Yes.

400
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,172
- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,309
And yet...

402
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,615
he's incredibly angry.

403
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:13,158
The irony is, uh, terrifying.

404
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,227
- Is that good?
- Is it?

405
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,089
Ah, this is interesting.

406
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,689
Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.

Yes, they can.

Where have you seen

Right there.

You may just have saved our trip.

- There you are.
- I would, uh...

- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.

- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.

419
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:34,892
They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!

420
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:38,459
- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.

421
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,098
- Ah.
- Look.

The leading art critic in Paris.

00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,366
Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.

424
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:49,381
- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.

425
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,143
Why do you carry it?

426
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:56,176
When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,

427
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:59,224
I need a world journey to inspire me.

428
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,494
I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.

Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,

Outstanding!

00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,540
Passepartout, onward! Ah.

433
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,712
There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.

No, that is my bag.

00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,735
No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!

We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?

00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,906
What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...

- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.

00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,664
The statue's grabbing his trousers.

483
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,902
I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

484
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:02,523
- Oh, dear.
- [screaming]

485
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,503
[Passepartout] Help!

486
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,074
Well done, Passepartout.

487
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,118
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.

488
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,085
Yes, yes. Thank you.

489
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,256
Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.

490
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:41,930
- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?

491
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:49,699
- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.

492
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,744
Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.

493
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,244
Thank you so much.

494
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,772
- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.

495
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,409
I did not say you were free to come.

496
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,316
- I said you were free to go.
- Where?

497
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:05,722
- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.

498
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:10,890
- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.

499
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,155
Miss... Monique!

500
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,121
There! Now we are getting along.

501
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,362
[Monique] Comme c'est beau.

502
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,565
C'est magnifique.

503
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,232
[gasps]

504
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,969
Toutes ces couleurs.

505
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:28,809
Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.

506
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,474
- "Magical."
- Miss La Roche!

507
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,542
I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.

508
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:38,646
I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.

509
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,691
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.

510
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,387
This is what happens
when you leave your home.

511
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,362
You meet... people!

512
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,660
[chuckles]

513
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,937
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

514
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:06,717
Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.

515
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:20,226
A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.

516
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,289
I have taken it back.

517
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,708
Incroyable.

518
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,514
For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.

519
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,814
It has never left our village until now.

520
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,716
And those art thieves. Who are they?

521
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:52,354
The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.

522
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:56,026
She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.

523
00:38:56,101 --> 00:39:00,162
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

524
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,036
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.

525
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,006
Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.

526
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:12,478
I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Fogg

527
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,076
to allow me to travel
the world with you.

528
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:26,654
Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

529
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:32,430
Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,

530
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,871
- they could maximize our speed.
- [chuckling]

531
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:42,506
When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.

532
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:48,249
- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?

533
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:53,154
Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.

534
00:39:56,161 --> 00:40:01,497
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.

535
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:07,102
Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?

536
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,868
[chuckles] Yes.

537
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,975
I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.

538
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,213
[whistle blowing]

539
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,550
- [engine chugging faster]
- [chuckles]

540
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:30,060
[Monique, engineers laughing]

541
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:35,126
If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.

542
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,563
Ah! Voilà.

543
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:41,834
Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.

544
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,033
Merci.

545
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,401
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

546
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,242
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

547
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,244
[sighs]

548
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,414
[Phileas] A tea?

549
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,971
Okay.

550
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,348
How to make English tea.

551
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:31,784
Precisely 96 degrees.

552
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,621
Ooh.

553
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,325
Excuse me, sir.

554
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,368
Fogg's valet!

555
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:47,461
- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.

556
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,737
- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.

557
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,801
Oh. Really?

558
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,674
Owww!

559
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,941
Me bloody nose!

560
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,851
Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!

561
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,031
Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.

562
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,335
Ow! Oh! Ow!

563
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,538
Ahhh!

564
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,604
You're under arrest!

565
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,979
[screaming]

566
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,882
- [thudding]
- Ah! Ooh! Ow!

567
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,253
- Sorry!
- [screaming]

568
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,196
Why the devil are we stopping?

569
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:06,314
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Fogg

570
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,682
and his traveling companions
at his banquet.

571
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:10,448
[Fogg] How very flattering.

572
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:14,616
But please inform Prince "Happy"
that we are on a very tight schedule.

573
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,427
Prince Hapi demands it.

574
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,396
Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomed

575
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,697
to not getting everything he wants.

576
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,207
[speaking Turkish]

577
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,303
It is magnificent.

578
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:37,212
Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.

579
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:41,082
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.

580
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,642
Yes, it is.

581
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:46,948
Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.

582
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:50,017
And where is His Highness?

583
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,370
Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.

584
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,170
If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,

585
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,370
I'd learn to pluck a few notes.

586
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,919
Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,

587
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,995
wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...

588
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,563
[Hapi] Mademoiselle.

589
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:33,930
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?

590
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,597
Is that what you call it

591
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,335
when one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?

592
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,503
Phileas Fogg.

593
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,102
Please forgive me,

594
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,776
but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.

595
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,610
What is a ravishing
woman like you...

596
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:56,549
- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

597
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:58,357
- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!

598
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,431
Don't touch it!

599
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:05,936
- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...

600
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:07,869
Don't even point.

601
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:09,566
Rodin.

602
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:12,769
Yes. A Rodin.

603
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,243
Oh.

604
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:17,804
I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.

605
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,875
Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

606
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:25,218
Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!

607
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,484
Yes.

608
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,652
[Monique] "Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin."

609
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:33,094
- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.

610
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,935
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.

611
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,993
No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.

612
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,006
We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.

613
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:47,100
[Hapi, Monique laughing]

614
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:52,246
After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,

615
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,979
I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.

616
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,323
I'm such a fool.

617
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,454
Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.

618
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,590
But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?

619
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,669
[chuckles] Uh, yes.

620
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,466
Uh, it's Phileas, actually.

621
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:18,202
So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.

622
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,643
Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new ways

623
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,307
to help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

624
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,316
Well, I'm not an inventor,

625
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:30,013
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land

626
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,057
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

627
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,284
Oh.

628
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,353
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.

629
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,733
Not now, Passepartout.

630
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,734
Oh.

631
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,272
[Monique] Mmm.

632
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,864
- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?

633
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:55,140
It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.

634
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,407
Oh...

635
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,279
Her discoloration could be
an allergic reaction

636
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,012
or a mild form of hives.

637
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,145
[scoffs, snorts]

638
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,521
Although I've noticed a certain

639
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:11,289
luminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.

640
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:15,924
And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,

641
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:18,594
her ears will actually flutter.

642
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:25,935
- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.

643
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,070
U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

644
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,578
Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.

645
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,710
Thank you for your hospitality.

646
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:39,484
It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.

647
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,581
Yes.

648
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,660
Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.

649
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:46,186
But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.

650
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,855
- To be my wife.
- Hmm?

651
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,561
Yes. Wife number seven.

652
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:55,568
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

653
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,612
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!

654
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,146
Prince Hapi has spoken!

655
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,445
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.

656
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,647
I can tell when we're not wanted.

657
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:16,816
Monsieur Fogg!

658
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,326
- [whimpers]
- Do Tuesdays work for you?

659
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:24,130
- Good-bye.
- [Passepartout] Thank you!

660
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:30,540
No!

661
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:32,634
[Phileas] Halt!

662
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:34,803
Or Hapi gets smashed!

663
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:39,009
Please! Anything but my statue of me!

664
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,610
Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.

665
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:48,482
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!

666
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,523
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

667
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,031
- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.

668
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:06,841
Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...

669
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,847
I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.

670
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:29,332
- Get them!
- [guards shouting]

671
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,736
His arm!

672
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,303
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.

673
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,037
Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.

674
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:43,376
This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.

675
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:44,676
[Hapi] Kill them!

676
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:49,046
[yelling] I want my arm!

677
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,248
[crying] No!

678
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:56,054
Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.

679
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,355
- A-ha!
- According to him,

680
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:01,694
the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.

681
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:04,826
Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!

682
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:09,271
Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.

683
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,308
Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

684
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,309
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.

685
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,402
Eh, evading arrest,

686
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,846
stealing a police vehicle,

687
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:20,645
sounds rather incriminating to me.

688
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,618
One can almost deduce

689
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,451
this entire bet was merely a ruse

690
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,616
to facilitate his escape.

691
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,260
- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.

692
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,957
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.

693
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:37,865
I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!

694
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,028
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard

695
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:45,508
that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!

696
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,137
- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,

697
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,738
from Bombay to Calcutta.

698
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:53,079
Thank God we own India!

699
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,517
I want their faces
in every police station,

700
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:58,077
army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!

701
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,986
We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha back

702
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,824
by any means necessary!

703
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,632
[speaking Indian dialect]

704
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,298
Agra is where we will capture them!

705
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:26,881
Intercept them at Agra!

706
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,680
Carry on, Cutter!

707
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:31,187
Move it! Move it! Fall in!

708
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:40,988
[train whistle blowing]

709
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,156
[children laughing]

710
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,099
And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.

711
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:47,728
Ten Tigers of Canton.

712
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,103
Brothers in arms.

713
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,937
They fought to keep order
and justice in China.

714
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:55,467
The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.

715
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:59,209
- [children oohing]
- [goats bleating]

716
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,786
[Passepartout] Armed with
only bamboo sticks...

717
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:04,913
It's salivating on... please.

718
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,479
Is this your goat?

719
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:08,718
Did they really fight like tigers?

720
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:12,057
Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.

721
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,461
- Like tiger.
- [laughing]

722
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:17,592
Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!

723
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,365
Where are my calculations?

724
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:21,837
Monkey!

725
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:26,536
The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!

726
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,704
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.

727
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:33,682
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.

728
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,810
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.

729
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,788
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?

730
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:41,086
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.

731
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:46,195
How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...

732
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,697
- animals?
- It is famous legend.

733
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:52,725
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.

734
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,600
Yes.

735
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,130
But all truths are born from facts.

736
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,905
Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculated

737
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,707
and written down on paper.

738
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,614
- And then eaten by a goat.
- [children laughing]

739
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,744
Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the story

740
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:13,085
of the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,

741
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:15,489
would that not be a legend?

742
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,058
Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.

743
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:30,467
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!

744
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,408
Look sharp, now. Get 'em!

745
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,035
Find these men!

746
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:40,140
Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.

747
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,345
Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvin

748
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,614
to impede my journey.

749
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:47,146
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.

750
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,385
- [gunshots]
- [people screaming]

751
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:51,484
Except bullets.

752
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,828
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?

753
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,593
Come on!

754
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,916
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

755
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:15,612
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.

756
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,210
They won't get past us, sir!

757
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,885
Ladies, have you seen these two men?

758
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:26,661
Look closely. They're very dangerous.

759
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,757
[Phileas] They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!

760
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:33,462
- [Passepartout] Just act like ladies.
- [Monique] Not a problem.

761
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:36,370
[in high voice] Hello. Hello! Ah.

762
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,973
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!

763
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:43,206
- No, but I am.
- [bag hits ground]

764
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,986
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?

765
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:57,289
[gibberish]

766
00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:02,389
What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...

767
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,561
- Hang about!
- [screams]

768
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,297
[groans]

769
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,931
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

770
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:13,704
Stop, stop.

771
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:19,882
Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.

772
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,248
[Monique] Passepartout, we did it.

773
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,549
Hey, wrong way.

774
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,888
Ah!

775
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,225
- [shouts]
- [screaming]

776
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,763
[snarling]

777
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,694
Phileas? No! No!

778
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:41,998
[metal creaking]

779
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:44,268
Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!

780
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,036
Ah! Ah!

781
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:47,704
Ahhh!

782
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,609
Fogg's valet! Heh!

783
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:52,411
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!

784
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,578
Hand over the Jade Buddha!

785
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:56,942
[Fix] Oh!

786
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,852
[snarling]

787
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:02,757
You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!

788
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,164
Now you get him very mad! Let's go.

789
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:13,430
Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!

790
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,166
- [roaring]
- [shrieking]

791
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,437
[Passepartout] Run!

792
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,978
- Which way?
- Down!

793
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,043
- [Fix screams]
- Again!

794
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:32,684
[Passepartout] Down!

795
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:36,452
Jump!

796
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,995
[yowling]

797
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,965
- Go, go, go!
- [Fix] What's upsetting him?

798

- Then give it to him!

- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.

800
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,514
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!

803
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:18,728
Phileas, help!

804
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,702
Leave her alone! I'll protect you!

805
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,705
[groans] Ah!

806
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:25,265
I'm here, my dear.

807
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:28,368
Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.

808
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,679
This cane is not as it appears.

809
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:37,551
If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.

810
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,649
This... is...

811
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,423
a strange knife.

812
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,997
Isn't it a sextant?

813
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,867
Yes.

814
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,042
Huh.

815
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:07,641
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!

816
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,652
[officer] You men, come with me!

817
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,951
You'd better put this on.

818
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:15,787
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.

- Mm-hmm.

822
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,662
Yes, we should run.

- Okay.

- Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!
- Okay, okay.

828
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,659
What's "Bu-ddha"?

829
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,831
Get ready to jump! Now!

830
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:16,949
It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!

831
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,717
He's escaping in that palkee-garry!

832
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,156
[soldier] Hey, there he is!

833
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:26,119
They'll check all trains heading east.

834
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:30,599
If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.

835
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:34,001
- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?

836
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,529
Not China. Not yet.

837
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:33,094
Passepartout?

838
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:39,494
- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.

839
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,231
You did what you had to.

840
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,830
The fate of your village
is of far greater importance

841
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:46,774
than any bet Phileas has made.

842
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,075
If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.

843
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,605
No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.

844
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,543
- What do you mean?
- [rooster crowing]

845

846
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:11,128
- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,

847
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,135

848
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,670
Oh, it's beautiful!

849
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:19,065
[Phileas] We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.

01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:04,418

Welcome home, Lau Xing.

Your brothers will be proud.

881
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,009
The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,

882
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,707
unless you can
harness the power of helium.

Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.

886
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:24,452
As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?

887
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,724
He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.

Phileas, I made this for you.

Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.

Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.

- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.

It is Lau Xing.

920
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:37,853
- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?

01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:41,652
Not for gold or money,

It was stolen from our village.

Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.

01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,436
- You knew about this?
- Well...

925

I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.

01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:18,438
Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong.

963
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,881
- [man shouts in Chinese]
- Look!

964
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:28,422
[Phileas] Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.

965
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:38,597
- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.

966
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:44,137
You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?

967
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:48,309
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.

968
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,778
All right. It's not silly.

969
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:56,842
I spit on you! France spits on you!

970
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,353
Vive I'Anjou!

971
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:02,223
- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!

972
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:05,261
Leave them alone. Fight me.

973
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:07,387
Yes, fight him.

974
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:10,732
Let's see how ferocious you really are.

975
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:16,566
[speaking Chinese]

976
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,874
Hey, that's cheating!

977
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,083
- Look out!
- Huh?

978
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:06,281
Left!

979
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,525
Behind you!

980
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:16,493
[Monique] No!

981
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:19,831
- Hit them!
- Silence!

982
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:26,836
You savages!

983
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:29,969
Phileas, help him!

984
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:32,947
- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?

985
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,506
No, my right.

986
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:37,085
Stop helping me!

987
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:39,018
- [mouthing word]
- What's happening?

988
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:40,420
Where is Passepartout?

989
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,980
[Monique]
How is he getting on?

990
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:46,324
I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.

991
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,798
[soldiers laughing]

992
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,632
Go home to mama.

993
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,318
Huh?

994
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:17,851
- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.

995
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:28,961
Wong Fei Hung!

996
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:33,841
Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?

997
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:40,507
Ten Tigers?

998
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,721
Kill them!

999
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:04,502
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

1000
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:07,934
[shouting]

1001
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,853
What's happening?

1002
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,249
Phileas!

1003
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,264
[grunts] Ohhh!

1004
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,067
Passepartout... Knife!

1005
01:14:44,414 --> 01:14:46,575
- Merci.
- You're welcome. [shrieks]

1006
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:13,628
You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.

1007
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:27,911
[Chinese]

1008
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:38,021
These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.

1009
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:41,290
- But there are only nine.
- Including me.

1010
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:42,830
They're real.

1011
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,560
The legend was true.

1012
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:21,734
[speaking Chinese]

1013
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:35,847
- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,

1014
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:38,352
or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.

1015
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:42,289
Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.

1016
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,451
If anyone understands that, you do.

1017
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,121
Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.

1018
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:51,098
This should be adequate.

1019
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:56,972
Oh.

1020
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,872
I, uh, believe this is your veil.

1021
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,143
I will never dress like a woman again.

1022
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:10,518
Ever.

1023
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:13,987
Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.

1024
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:19,360
I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.

1025
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:22,863
[speaking Chinese]

1026
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:25,901
[shouting in Chinese]

1027
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:31,433
[yelling]

1028
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:33,566
Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,

1029
01:18:33,643 --> 01:18:35,304
travel alone.

1030
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:38,974
[Phileas shouts in Chinese]

1031
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:31,422
[man] Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!

1032
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:35,163
She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.

1033
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:37,968
See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...

1034
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,568
Ah, the most modern city in the world.

1035
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:45,580
Finally, civilization.

1036
01:19:45,648 --> 01:19:47,206
- [gunshot]
- [woman screams]

1037
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,615
- [glass breaking]
- [gunshot]

1038
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,449
- [woman] Yoo-hoo!
- [woman screaming]

1039
01:19:52,522 --> 01:19:55,150
[Phileas] Excuse me. Pardon me.

1040
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:59,217
Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?

1041
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,099
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1042
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,363
I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.

1043
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:09,870
No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.

1044
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:13,238
- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!

1045
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:16,210
Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.

1046
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:18,304
Uh! Ooh.

1047
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:20,576
I should find you a physician.

1048
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:23,380
There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.

1049
01:20:23,452 --> 01:20:27,149
Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.

1050
01:20:27,223 --> 01:20:28,349
Thank you.

1051
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:31,860
There should be more people
like you in this world.

1052
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:36,896
[laughs] Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!

1053
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,632
[laughing] Whoo!

1054
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:54,543
Mon Dieu.

1055
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:58,109
Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?

1056
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,745
I'm sure he's fine.

1057
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,952
Alms.

1058
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,891
Alms.

1059
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,026
Alms for the poor?

1060
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:14,796
[groans] Arms?

1061
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:19,466
You already got arms.
It's money you need.

1062
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,607
I can't even scrounge proficiently.

1063
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,112
Hey.

1064
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:29,446
Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.

1065
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:33,682
Now, what makes you
different from them?

1066
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:36,122
I'm hungry and miserable.

1067
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:38,854
No. You stink.

1068
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:43,897
Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.

1069
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,695
Watch this.

1070
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,067
- Hey.
- [gasps]

1071
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,733
- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.

1072
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:57,279
- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.

1073
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:00,110
Simple, yet effective.

1074
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:01,672
- Yeah, I see.
- You try.

1075
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,811
Give it a shot. I got faith in you.

1076
01:22:05,621 --> 01:22:09,717
Excuse me. Now, uh, you...

1077
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,225
[chuckling]

1078
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:14,151
Ah.

1079
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:18,131
I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.

1080
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:22,794
It's a volume business.

1081
01:22:24,974 --> 01:22:28,137
- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...

1082
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,802
Maybe later.

1083
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:34,282
What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?

1084
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:37,711
Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.

1085
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:42,148
- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

1086
01:22:42,224 --> 01:22:44,556
Or, rather, I was.

1087
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:56,738
One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.

1088
01:22:57,406 --> 01:22:59,738
Flying men? Where?

1089
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:04,673
- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?

1090
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,908
- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.

1091
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,280
The bird men are coming! I knew it!

1092
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:12,411
The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!

1093
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,854
The birds! The bird men!

1094
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:16,892
Bird men! Birds!

1095
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:29,299
"I traveled the world for inspiration

1096
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:34,240
and found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams."

1097
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:18,177
- Phileas?
- No.

1098
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:21,613
Passepartout! Monique!

1099
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,218
Mr. Fogg.

1100
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,666
You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?

1101
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:35,830
- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.

1102
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:40,364
- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,

1103
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,309
and perhaps... more.

1104
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:48,543
More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.

1105
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:52,246
- Ooh.
- Oof!

1106
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:56,519
[General Fang] Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more precious

1107
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,753
than a single Jade Buddha.

1108
01:24:58,828 --> 01:25:02,662
Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.

1109
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:07,566
If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.

1110
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:08,796
I see.

1111
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:12,034
However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,

1112
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:17,101
I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.

1113
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:22,412
Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.

1114
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:26,682
Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...

1115
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:31,993
Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.

1116
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:36,395
What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.

1117
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:37,829
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1118
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,868
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1119
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,631
It's not that great.

1120
01:25:52,982 --> 01:25:56,315
Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.

1121
01:25:56,385 --> 01:25:58,717
What if he's lost, or...

1122
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,584
Don't fret, my dear.

1123
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:04,922
Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.

1124
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:09,158
No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.

1125
01:26:09,265 --> 01:26:10,732
Agua.

1126
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:14,565
Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.

1127
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:15,899
Help!

1128
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:17,871
- Help us!
- Help!

1129
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,033
Ah! A rattlesnake!

1130
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:21,133
Help!

1131
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,474
I don't want to die!

1132
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,775
Ah. Good morning.

1133
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:29,479
- Howdy.
- Hey.

1134
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,951
Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.

1135
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:35,957
How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.

1136
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:38,016
Wilbur, it's him.

1137
01:26:39,962 --> 01:26:41,190
I'll be damned.

1138
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:46,665
Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.

1139
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:50,171
- We're big fans of yours.
- [Wilbur] Fan's a strong word.

1140
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:55,039
Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.

1141
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:57,442
We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.

1142
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:00,915
Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.

1143
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:05,716
Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.

1144
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:10,282
He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing around

1145
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:13,453
on the planet
like a little hummingbird.

1146
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:16,293
Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.

1147
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:19,390
It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.

1148
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:23,938
He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.

1149
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,997
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

1150
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:29,067
That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.

1151
01:27:29,144 --> 01:27:32,079
All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.

1152
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:36,049
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

1153
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:38,882
- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.

1154
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:42,048
- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1155
01:27:42,124 --> 01:27:44,615
Have you come across our friend
on your way here?

1156
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:47,719
Who are we looking for?

1157
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:48,922
Passepartout.

1158
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:52,027
You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guy

1159
01:27:52,134 --> 01:27:54,193
we saw running around,
where he was like...

1160
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:57,033
- Singing "Frère Jacques"?
- With a cow skull on his head?

1161
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:59,063
- Possibly.
- Yes.

1162
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:02,542
- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.

1163
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,136
- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

1164
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,252
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.

1165
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:15,120
- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.

1166
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:19,183
Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

1167
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:21,786
I did.

1168
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:23,865
"I did"? What's with the "I did"?

1169
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:27,197
We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.

1170
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:30,304
- Hyah!
- [horses whinnying]

1171
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,399
[train whistle blowing]

1172
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:41,442
- They're not going to make it!
- [clucking, squawking]

1173
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:54,462
[cheering]

1174
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:57,532
Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!

1175
01:28:57,633 --> 01:29:00,101
So much to see! So little time!

1176
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:02,535
Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!

1177
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,572
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1178
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:10,469
[ship's horn blowing]

1179
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:17,342
- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?

1180
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:23,491
Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.

1181
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:27,620
Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...

1182
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:30,095
Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.

1183
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:36,834
The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!

1184
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,544
Make a lane!

1185
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,184
Where are we?

1186
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:57,451
- Ah!
- Whoa!

1187
01:29:57,526 --> 01:30:01,860
- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.

1188
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:05,533
She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.

1189
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,809
[jingling]

1190
01:30:14,877 --> 01:30:16,674
[policeman laughs]

1191
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,646
Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,

1192
01:30:19,715 --> 01:30:21,649
but I'm afraid it ends here.

1193
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:24,447
Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.

1194
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:28,121
On the contrary, Lau Xing,

1195
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:32,593
Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

1196
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:34,652
Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,

1197
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:37,891
they entail his... permanent detour.

1198
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,627
I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,

1199
01:30:39,735 --> 01:30:42,670
but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!

1200
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:46,536
You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!

1201
01:30:48,677 --> 01:30:54,115
As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.

1202
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,344
One, two...

1203
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:01,315
- Go!
- Three!

1204
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:05,558
[screaming, howling]

1205
01:31:06,862 --> 01:31:09,092
- Go up there.
- Stop them.

1206
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:18,039
Passepartout, my cane!

1207
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:22,503
Uh, there.

1208
01:31:46,435 --> 01:31:49,632
[Monique] Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!

1209
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:52,464
[screeching]

1210
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:07,980
Help!

1211
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:10,149
[screaming]

1212
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:14,061
[Monique] Passepartout! Help!

1213
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,066
[yelling]

1214
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:33,645
There you are!

1215
01:32:36,852 --> 01:32:39,320
- [screams]
- You have a knife in your buttock.

1216
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:08,579
It's the evil Chinese warlord!

1217
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:10,015
- Ooh!
- Huh?

1218
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,349
She's coming!

1219
01:33:12,421 --> 01:33:14,218
[screaming]

1220
01:33:15,324 --> 01:33:17,121
- [ship's horn blowing]
- The boat!

1221
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:20,093
Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!

1222
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:23,893
Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.

1223
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:40,705
[horn blowing]

1224
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:44,883
Wait, wait! What am I thinking?

1225
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:46,715
Passepartout can't defeat them.

1226
01:33:46,755 --> 01:33:48,950
He's nine Tigers short.

1227
01:33:49,024 --> 01:33:50,082
[horn blowing]

1228
01:33:51,259 --> 01:33:56,094
Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.

1229
01:33:56,198 --> 01:33:58,723
When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legs

1230
01:33:58,834 --> 01:34:01,769
of the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...

1231
01:34:01,837 --> 01:34:03,805
of the man of your dreams.

1232
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:30,856
[horn blowing]

1233
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:35,164
- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.

1234
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:56,290
Let go of me!

1235
01:34:56,358 --> 01:35:00,294
The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...

1236
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,523
- Phileas?
- I will save him...

1237
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:05,259
[yelling] Wah!

1238
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:11,228
[metal creaking]

1239
01:35:13,608 --> 01:35:15,303
Mr. Fogg!

1240
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,055
- [screaming]
- No!

1241
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:44,430
Oh. Passepartout?

1242
01:35:49,878 --> 01:35:52,312
[grunting]

1243
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,816
- [groaning]
- Passepartout!

1244
01:35:56,885 --> 01:35:58,113
- Huh?
- You're alive!

1245
01:35:59,187 --> 01:36:01,747
- Are you injured?
- [grunting]

1246
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:09,857
Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.

1247
01:36:09,965 --> 01:36:12,798
Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.

1248
01:36:12,868 --> 01:36:16,861
Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.

1249
01:36:16,972 --> 01:36:20,635
Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.

1250
01:36:23,678 --> 01:36:26,272
[shrieking]

1251
01:36:30,852 --> 01:36:33,980
[sighs] You must be the eleventh Tiger.

1252
01:36:34,389 --> 01:36:36,050
Meow!

1253
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:44,521
- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.

1254
01:36:47,903 --> 01:36:50,371
No. No! No!

1255
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:54,465
We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!

1256
01:36:54,543 --> 01:36:57,944
We take the next ship
and win that bet!

1257
01:37:00,649 --> 01:37:03,049
Very well.

1258
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:04,779
- Let's go.
- Yes!

1259
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:07,448
Thank you.

1260
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:45,849
[Phileas] Yes. Yes! Yes!

1261
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,588
Oh, it's hopeless.

1262
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:52,633
By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.

1263
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:57,638
- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?

1264
01:37:58,506 --> 01:38:01,270
What an honor, sir!

1265
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:05,109
I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.

1266
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:10,015
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.

1267
01:38:10,685 --> 01:38:13,017
Got 'em both in one bite.

1268
01:38:26,468 --> 01:38:27,799
[clears throat]

1269
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,300
Ah, it's Inspector Fix!

1270
01:38:31,373 --> 01:38:35,036
My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!

1271
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:39,146
I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!

1272
01:38:40,815 --> 01:38:44,012
I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.

1273
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,254
A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?

1274
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:53,058
[screaming]

1275
01:38:56,464 --> 01:38:58,523
[screaming]

1276
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:01,363
[screeching]

1277
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:06,633
[sailor] That's the last
of the coal, Captain.

1278
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:19,352
Mr. Fogg.

1279
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:22,447
I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.

1280
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:25,186
- [sighs]
- But I've had a word with the crew,

1281
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,694
and all of them...

1282
01:39:28,363 --> 01:39:30,524
have agreed to burn their shoes.

1283
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,064
The effort is appreciated, Captain.

1284
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:37,070
Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.

1285
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:42,574
- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.

1286
01:39:44,245 --> 01:39:46,577
[gulls screeching]

1287
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:54,653
That's it.
I've got it.

1288
01:39:55,924 --> 01:39:56,913
Birds.

1289
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,482
Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!

1290
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:01,791
No, we'll fly to London.

1291
01:40:01,896 --> 01:40:05,627
We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia ago

1292
01:40:05,734 --> 01:40:09,670
and combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.

1293
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:12,806
Most people would laugh at you.

1294
01:40:12,874 --> 01:40:16,332
But not us. We care about you.

1295
01:40:23,485 --> 01:40:26,977
Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permission

1296
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:29,500
to dismantle your ship
to build this machine.

1297
01:40:29,657 --> 01:40:31,818
Dismantle Carmen?

1298
01:40:31,893 --> 01:40:34,828
But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.

1299
01:40:34,929 --> 01:40:36,157
Never, never, ever!

1300
01:40:36,264 --> 01:40:39,700
What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physician

1301
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:42,929
who could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,

1302
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:46,404
and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?

1303
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:50,504
You had me at the nipples.

1304
01:40:50,845 --> 01:40:54,975
- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!

1305
01:40:56,518 --> 01:40:57,985
One, two! One, two!

1306
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,150
[sailor] Timber!

1307
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:40,453
I'll go sharpen the propeller.

1308
01:41:50,138 --> 01:41:51,935
Wrong way. Not looking.

1309
01:42:28,176 --> 01:42:30,201
[sailor] Just one more.

1310
01:42:30,278 --> 01:42:33,076
That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!

1311
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,675
The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.

1312
01:42:37,919 --> 01:42:40,114
Well...

1313
01:42:40,188 --> 01:42:43,157
- Shall we fly?
- Let's.

1314
01:42:43,892 --> 01:42:48,090
Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!

1315
01:42:48,196 --> 01:42:50,221
[sailor] Hurrah!

1316
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:53,801
Inspiring words.

1317
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:58,430
- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!

1318
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:15,251
- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

1319
01:43:16,991 --> 01:43:19,186
- Whoa!
- [yelling]

1320
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:24,790
[cheering]

1321
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:28,725
How the hell are we getting back?

1322
01:43:28,836 --> 01:43:31,703
- [Monique screams]
- [Passepartout] Whoa!

1323
01:43:34,475 --> 01:43:36,841
- Now!
- Ohhh!

1324
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:41,144
[all yelling]

1325
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,547
[Monique squeals, laughs]

1326
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:46,984
You did it, Phileas! We are flying!

1327
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:49,785
My God! It's...

1328
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:52,054
magical!

1329
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:55,992
- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.

1330
01:43:56,097 --> 01:43:57,928
Hey! Don't forget to steer!

1331
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:16,207
[humming]

1332
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,388
It's a...

1333
01:44:21,456 --> 01:44:23,651
a telegram from...

1334
01:44:23,725 --> 01:44:25,818
General Fang, sir.

1335
01:44:25,893 --> 01:44:29,021
[humming continues]

1336
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:31,690
[Kelvin yells]

1337
01:44:34,135 --> 01:44:36,103
We're going to make it!

1338
01:44:40,174 --> 01:44:42,369
- This all right?
- Oh, dear.

1339
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:46,038
- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?

1340
01:44:46,147 --> 01:44:50,982
- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

1341
01:44:53,788 --> 01:44:56,154
- Look up there!
- Great Scott!

1342
01:44:56,224 --> 01:44:58,351
[man] Look! A flying machine!

1343
01:44:58,993 --> 01:45:02,520
- Don't step on the wing!
- [man] It's Phileas Fogg!

1344
01:45:03,664 --> 01:45:06,997
Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,

1345
01:45:07,068 --> 01:45:09,263
our bank thief at the pedals.

1346
01:45:09,337 --> 01:45:11,999
Some people will believe anything.

1347
01:45:12,073 --> 01:45:14,598
[all] A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!

1348
01:45:14,675 --> 01:45:18,736
- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?

1349
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,747
Help!

1350
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:23,215
Well done, Passepartout!

1351
01:45:23,684 --> 01:45:25,242
The wing ropes!

1352
01:45:26,521 --> 01:45:30,685
[Phileas] Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.

1353
01:45:31,692 --> 01:45:35,526
- All right, this is a major setback.
- [Monique screams]

1354
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:38,590
A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,

1355
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:41,634
and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.

1356
01:45:41,702 --> 01:45:43,135
[Kelvin yells]

1357
01:45:43,237 --> 01:45:46,673
Faster, Passepartout! Faster!

1358
01:45:46,741 --> 01:45:49,403
- We're losing altitude!
- [Monique] Landing gear?

1359
01:45:49,477 --> 01:45:52,037
[Phileas] That would have been
an excellent idea!

1360
01:45:55,283 --> 01:45:57,376
The bird men are here!

1361
01:46:00,388 --> 01:46:03,414
No. I will not lose this wager!

1362
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:07,860
He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!

1363
01:46:07,929 --> 01:46:11,194
I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!

1364
01:46:11,299 --> 01:46:12,561
- [whistling]
- Oh!

1365
01:46:12,667 --> 01:46:14,601
- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!

1366
01:46:14,669 --> 01:46:17,661
Passepartout, get back in your seat.

1367
01:46:17,772 --> 01:46:20,673
We're going to return to the ground!

1368
01:46:21,776 --> 01:46:24,438
- [all screaming]
- [screaming]

1369
01:46:26,347 --> 01:46:28,577
Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!

1370
01:46:29,283 --> 01:46:31,808
- Why are they fleeing?
- [screaming]

1371
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:34,047
Cowards!

1372
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:40,193
Hold on!

1373
01:46:54,342 --> 01:46:57,209
[cheering]

1374
01:47:11,025 --> 01:47:12,993
[Passepartout] Make it to the top step!

1375
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,927
- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.

1376
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:19,158
Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!

1377
01:47:19,901 --> 01:47:23,234
No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?

1378
01:47:23,304 --> 01:47:26,034
This is the Royal Academy of Science!

1379
01:47:26,107 --> 01:47:29,133
We don't need to prove anything!

1380
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:32,475
Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,

1381
01:47:32,547 --> 01:47:35,038
you'll have lost the wager.

1382
01:47:35,116 --> 01:47:36,879
[bell tolls]

1383
01:47:39,987 --> 01:47:41,545
Noon.

1384
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:42,987
We did our best.

1385
01:47:44,492 --> 01:47:48,622
Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!

1386
01:47:49,163 --> 01:47:51,461
Should have thrown him
through a higher window.

1387
01:47:51,566 --> 01:47:54,330
- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!

1388
01:47:54,402 --> 01:47:58,998
That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?

1389
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:00,062
[murmuring]

1390
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:04,373
He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!

1391
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:06,140
That's right. He did!

1392
01:48:07,582 --> 01:48:09,846
Lies! All of it!

1393
01:48:09,917 --> 01:48:13,011
- [raspberries]
- [crowd protesting]

1394
01:48:13,521 --> 01:48:14,647
- Kitchner!
- Yes?

1395
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,219
- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...

1396
01:48:18,292 --> 01:48:21,728
- [stammering] Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!

1397
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:24,195
Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.

1398
01:48:24,298 --> 01:48:27,267
I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!

1399
01:48:27,335 --> 01:48:30,395
- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,

1400
01:48:31,038 --> 01:48:33,006
I don't want to make a fuss.

1401
01:48:33,074 --> 01:48:36,908
- You spineless cretins!
- [crowd gasps]

1402
01:48:36,978 --> 01:48:41,779
That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!

1403
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:45,546
Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!

1404
01:48:45,653 --> 01:48:50,955
It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.

1405
01:48:50,992 --> 01:48:54,120
- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!

1406
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:57,426
So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?

1407
01:48:57,798 --> 01:49:01,131
What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?

1408
01:49:01,202 --> 01:49:05,070
I hold all the power!
I run everything!

1409
01:49:05,139 --> 01:49:10,475
So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?

1410
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:13,707
- The queen!
- The queen?

1411
01:49:13,781 --> 01:49:16,648
Oh, the queen!

1412
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:20,847
That inbred, antiquated old cow!

1413
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:25,949
The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!

1414
01:49:26,961 --> 01:49:30,556
With her big, fat royal bottom!

1415
01:49:30,665 --> 01:49:33,190
[laughing]

1416
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:36,760
She's behind me, isn't she?

1417
01:49:37,438 --> 01:49:39,702
Oh, Your Majesty.

1418
01:49:39,774 --> 01:49:44,143
I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.

1419
01:49:44,211 --> 01:49:46,645
- No, Majesty!
- [Fix] Rubbish!

1420
01:49:48,249 --> 01:49:50,240
Quiet!

1421
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:54,053
I love being able to do that.

1422
01:49:54,121 --> 01:49:56,783
So, Lord Kelvin,

1423
01:49:56,857 --> 01:50:00,452
unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,

1424
01:50:00,528 --> 01:50:03,725
trading my arsenal for Buddhas.

1425
01:50:03,831 --> 01:50:06,322
How do you know about that?
I never said...

1426
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:10,803
Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?

[murmuring]

1428
01:50:13,174 --> 01:50:18,339
Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.

1429
01:50:18,412 --> 01:50:20,778
What it was, was, was...

1430
01:50:20,848 --> 01:50:23,976
I was... I... I was simply...

1431
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:25,712
simply...

1432
01:50:27,555 --> 01:50:29,352
Why do they always run?

1433
01:50:29,423 --> 01:50:30,947
Arrest him.

1434
01:50:31,025 --> 01:50:35,860
Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

1435
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:40,426
I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!

1436
01:50:40,534 --> 01:50:45,233
So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?

1437
01:50:45,906 --> 01:50:48,670
Your Majesty, we all invented it.

1438
01:50:48,743 --> 01:50:52,440
I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.

1439
01:50:52,513 --> 01:50:53,844
Thank you.

1440
01:50:53,914 --> 01:50:57,543
But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.

1441
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:03,179
- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.

1442
01:51:03,257 --> 01:51:07,489
I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.

1443
01:51:07,561 --> 01:51:09,893
I flew across an ocean.

1444
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,658
I wore women's clothing.

1445
01:51:12,566 --> 01:51:14,830
Oh?

1446
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:18,270
Made a friend.

1447
01:51:19,707 --> 01:51:22,369
Fell in love.

1448
01:51:22,443 --> 01:51:25,742
- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- [Queen] I do.

1449
01:51:25,813 --> 01:51:31,683
- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.

1450
01:51:31,752 --> 01:51:35,313
Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.

1451
01:51:36,056 --> 01:51:38,923
- Could we have miscounted?
- No.

1452
01:51:38,993 --> 01:51:42,895
I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.

1453
01:51:44,298 --> 01:51:46,789
The international date line.

1454
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:49,870
We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...

1455
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:52,962
here it's still day 79.

1456
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,702
- So, we've...
- We've won!

1457
01:52:02,817 --> 01:52:04,341
We won, we won...

1458
01:52:04,418 --> 01:52:07,046
- Thank God. Ah!
- [gasping]

1459
01:52:11,459 --> 01:52:14,519
Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.

1460
01:52:14,595 --> 01:52:18,691
- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.

1461
01:52:18,799 --> 01:52:21,859
I shall need a new minister of science.

1462
01:52:24,338 --> 01:52:28,206
Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

1463
01:52:30,544 --> 01:52:32,910
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1464
01:52:33,948 --> 01:52:37,509
- Go!
- [cheering]

1465
01:52:42,656 --> 01:52:44,624
- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!

1466
01:52:44,725 --> 01:52:46,386
We won!

1467
01:52:48,829 --> 01:52:50,854
Oh, well done!

1468
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,033
Go ahead.
