1
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,596
Hey, watch it!

2
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,447
Aw, come on.

3
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,756
Hey, Mike.

4
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,885
- Hey, Larry. How you doin'?
- Have you seen Nicky?

5
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,964
I'm pretty sure
he went home with Erica.

6
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,397
It was a half day today—
uh, Parent Career Day.

7
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,940
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on in.

8
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,611
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

9
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,080
Um, why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

10
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,515
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

11
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,486
Oh, okay. I guess he forgot.

12
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,988
<i>- There he is.</i>
- Hey.

13
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,719
- How are you, Larry?
- Good. How you doin', Don?

14
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,525
Good.

15
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,622
Can you believe this weather?

16
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,633
Chilly, right?

17
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,330
Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the Penguin.

18
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,703
Oop, my phone. Leave me alone.

19
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,242
Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here?

20
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,369
Great. Great. That's great.
Yeah. Thanks.

21
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,041
Wow, your fiancé really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

22
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,552
- Stop it.
- What? What?

23
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,716
No, it's like he's the, uh,
Batman of stockbrokers.

24
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,726
- Bond trader.
- Bond trader. Sorry.

25
00:04:55,828 --> 00:05:00,162
<i>Hey, how's it going with that virtual reality</i>
<i>driving range that you wanted to open?</i>

26
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,394
Uh, gettin' there. Still waitin' for
the technology to catch up with the idea.

27
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,700
- I mean, it's not easy.
There are a lot of moving parts.
- Uh-huh.

28
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,401
- Hey, do you think, um—you
think Nick would like Queens?

29
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,071
Oh, no. Larry, you didn't
get evicted again, did you?

30
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,310
I didn't... get evicted.
I didn't get evicted, no.

31
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,909
I mean I didn't—
No, I didn't get evicted yet.

32
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,920
- It's like, uh—
- All right, listen to me.

33
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,217
I don't know how much more
of this Nicky can take.

34
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,555
Every couple months,
it's a new career, a new apartment.

35
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,993
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything. I would stay out of it.

36
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,895
It's just— It's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

37
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

38
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,741
You know...

39
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,505
l— I don't— I don't think
that Nicky should stay with you.

40
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,241
- What?
- Well, just—just until you get really settled.

41
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,841
<i> Hey, Dad.</i>

42
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,046
- Hey. Ready to carve it up?
- Cool.

43
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,825
- You're such a chicken!
- All right! Good!

44
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,522
- Get in front of it!
- Take it, Nicky! Break away!

45
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,101
<i>- What are you doin'?</i>
- Hey! Hey, Nicky!

46
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,763
<i>- Get off the ice!</i>
- Are you all right?

47
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,807
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

48
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,308
Listen up. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

49
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,403
You go to the left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

50
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,744
- Cool. Thanks.
- All right, man.

51
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,579
<i>- Come on!</i>
- We're good here.

52
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,883
He's good. All right. As you were, skaters.

53
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,082
Game on.

54
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,887
<i>- That's a good shot, kid!</i>
<i>- I'm good.</i>

55
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,622
I'm tellin' you, man.
You tore it up out there today.

56
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,994
I'm thinkin' the NHL
is a serious possibility.

57
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,034
Yeah, I don't really wanna
be a hockey player anymore.

58
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,130
- All right. What do you wanna be?
- A bond trader.

59
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,436
- A bond trader?
- Yeah, it's what Don does.

60
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,673
- He took me to his office last week.
- Uh-huh.

61
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,014
That's cool. So what? You wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

62
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,917
Like an automaton robot?

63
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,856
Trust me. You can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kinda awkward.

64
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,359
Well, he's got
a pretty big office.

65
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,590
That's not the point.
Come on. You love hockey.

66
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,099
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

67
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,693
Your fallback? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

68
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,932
You're too young to have
a fallback, okay, Nicky?

69
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,702
And—And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

70
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,938
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

71
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:31,540
- She called them schemes?
- She said it was time you found a fallback.

72
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,222
Are you really moving again?

73
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,760
Uh, I don't know. We'll see.

74
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,194
I mean, there are some pretty
cool places out in Queens.

75
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,233
- Yeah.
- Hey.

76
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,326
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

77
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,905
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you somethin'.

78
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,839
I know that things have been
kinda up and down for me lately...

79
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,843
and that's been hard for you.

80
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,175
But I really feel like
my moment's coming...

81
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,010
and when it does, everything's
just gonna come together.

82
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,550
- You know?
<i>- What if you're wrong...</i>

83
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,315
and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

84
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,496
<i>All right. Well</i>—

85
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,202
You know what?
We'll figure it out, okay?

86
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,361
<i>All right?</i>

87
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,905
Come on. Let's get you
back to Mom's. Come on.

88
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,945
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

89
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,519
I've never seen
a résumé quite like yours.

90
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,351
Ah, all right!

91
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,585
That wasn't a compliment.

92
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,460
It says here you were the C.E.O.
Of Snaptime Industries.

93
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,465
Care to elaborate on that?

94
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:59,869
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

95
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,271
You know, you snap, lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

96
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,674
Uh, didn't they already make that?

97
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,306
No, no. That's the Clapper...

98
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,407
which, obviously,
stole a bit of our thunder.

99
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,419
Personally, I don't really
see what the big difference is.

100
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,955
I mean—You know, whatever.

101
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,957
But, um, apparently...

102
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,459
there is a significant portion
of the population...

103
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,588
that has trouble actually snapping.

104
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,598
Clapping's easier.

105
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,294
Debatable.

106
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,735
I can't help you.

107
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,602
Uh, Debbie?
Can I call you Debbie?

108
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,109
'Cause, uh, I felt a connection
when I entered this office.

109
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,112
And I don't know.
I feel like you did too.

110
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,739
I didn't feel a connection.

111
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,654
Look.

112
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,589
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

113
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,593
If I don't have one—

114
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,595
I just need it, okay?

115
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,496
Well, I don't know. L—

116
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,660
I might have one thing.

117
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,536
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but, uh—

118
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,610
- Great.
- Who knows?

119
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,180
You might get lucky.

120
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,513
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

121
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:56,384
Uh, I'm Larry Daley. I've got
a job interview with Cecil Fredericks.

122
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,925
- Right. Uh, he should still be in his office.
- Great.

123
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,587
- I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
- Hi.

124
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,393
- Well, let me point you in the right direction.
- Please.

125
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,663
<i>Ah, Teddy Roosevelt, right?</i>

126
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,670
Yes, a great visionary.

127
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,333
<i>Yes, definitely.</i>
<i>He was our fourth president, right?</i>

128
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,342
- Twenty-sixth.
- Twenty-sixth.

129
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,776
<i>Please don't touch the exhibits!</i>

130
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,678
- Get down.
- I mean— Riffraff.

131
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,378
Miss Hutman, I cannot
tolerate this type of chaos.

132
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,386
I mean, this is a museum,
not a—

133
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,855
Do you know
what "museum" means?

134
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,862
It— It doesn't mean, "Ooh, Daddy,
it's a big tyrannosaurus thing!

135
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,023
Can I touch its leg?" No! It—

136
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,101
Work it out, please.

137
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,568
- Will do, sir.
- Thank you.

138
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,806
Dr. McPhee,
the museum director.

139
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,933
- Hmm. Seems like a fun guy.

140
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,604
Control your young, please!
Can we?

141
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,725
Hello?

142
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,695
- I'm just kidding.
- Hi. I'm, uh— I'm Larry Daley.

143
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,890
Are—Are you Mr. Fredericks?

144
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,365
Mr. Fredericks was my father.
I am Cecil.

145
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,994
Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice, firm handshake.

146
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,404
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

147
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,999
Okay.

148
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,281
- Let's talk turkey here.
- Okay.

149
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,417
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

150
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,617
I guess kids today don't care
about wax figures or stuffed animals.

151
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,957
So they're downsizing,
which is code for "firing"...

152
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,963
myself and the other two night guards.

153
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,694
<i>- They want to replace us with one new guard.</i>
- Oh. Sorry.

154
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,270
Well, what are you gonna do?

155
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,808
I'd like you to meet my, uh,
two colleagues here. Reginald?

156
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,809
<i>- Gus?</i>

157
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,870
Where is he?
I'll beat him with my fist!

158
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,713
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid
who wants to be the new night guard.

159
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,344
Uh, night guard?

160
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,720
No, no. The lady at the agency
said this was a museum position.

161
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,988
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

162
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,960
He looks like a weirdy.

163
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,123
<i> Wonderful guard,</i>
<i>terrible people skills.</i>

164
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,634
Now listen, lunch box,
don't try anything funny.

165
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,002
I once went nine rounds with John L. Sullivan.

166
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,974
You never fought
John L. Sullivan in your life.

167
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,738
<i> Gentlemen, we have</i>
<i>a job candidate here.</i>

168
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,976
He's got an excellent résumé, a winning
attitude, and I say let's give him a shot.

169
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,074
- What do you say?
- Uh, hang on a sec.

170
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,212
I think l— I might wanna have
a little time just to think it over.

171
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,257
Do you want the job or not,
snack shack?

172
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,394
No, no. I want the job. L—

173
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,930
Welcome to
the night guards, Larry.

174
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,500
<i> Larry, meet me</i>
<i>up on the second floor.</i>

175
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,867
I'll slip into my orthopedics
and give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

176
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,464
Not fun gettin' old,
my friend. Go on.

177
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,677
You really think he's the one?

178
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,720
Oh, yes.

179
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,789
He's the one.

180
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,836
<i>Gotta keep it moving, Larry.</i>
<i>I'm pretty spry for an old man.</i>

181
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,376
This is the, uh, Diorama Room.

182
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,377
Oh, yeah.

183
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,448
I remember these little guys.

184
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,074
Cute.

185
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,955
Cecil!

186
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,851
Hey, Cecil!

187
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,573
Did I get you good!

188
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,269
Yeah. You got me.

189
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,215
Seriously, though,
no foolin' around in here.

190
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,981
This stuff is really old.
All right then.

191
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,922
<i>As you can see, it's pretty</i>
<i>quiet in here these days.</i>

192
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,462
On your left there
is your Attila the Hun.

193
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,028
And here we have
our Easter Island head.

194
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,503
<i> Hey, Cecil.</i>

195
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:44,766
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

196
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,777
Ah, yes.

197
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,273
Ooh, monkeys. I love monkeys.

198
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,785
- Yeah.
- That guy's cute.

199
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,720
<i>Yeah, we</i>— <i>we call him Dexter.</i>

200
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,987
<i>He's quite a little ball of fun,</i>
<i>aren't you, Dexter?</i>

201
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,657
Moving on.

202
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,732
And, finally, this is the temple
of the pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

203
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,840
<i> And in that, uh,</i>
<i>tomb right down there</i>—

204
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,843
<i>The pharaoh himself.</i>

205
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,845
Neat.

206
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:27,112
And hanging on the wall behind him
was his most prized possession...

207
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,813
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

208
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,551
<i>- Twenty-four-karat gold. It's worth a fortune.</i>
<i>- Ah.</i>

209
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,220
- Very cool.
<i>- It is indeed, Larry.</i>

210
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,820
Very cool.

211
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,603
All right.

212
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,639
Report here at 5:00 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

213
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,709
Okay. 5:00. I'll be here.

214
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,777
Moving on.

215
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,578
Hey, it's me.
So, uh, I got a job.

216
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,015
Oh, Larry, that's great.
What is it?

217
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:04,317
Um, it's a—
it's a job at the, um—

218
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,482
- at the Museum of Natural History.
- Oh, uh-huh.

219
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,254
Yeah. So, uh, you can tell
Nicky that we won't be moving.

220
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,262
- Larry, this is good news.
- Yeah, no, definitely.

221
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,264
- So, uh, I'll see you tomorrow?
- Okay.

222
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,266
Okay. Bye.

223
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,742
<i> Larry.</i>

224
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,973
Your keys. Your torch.

225
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,313
- Right.
- You're gonna want to strap those to your belt.

226
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,717
Now, it can get a little
spooky around here at night...

227
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,051
so you might
want to put a few lights on.

228
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,091
All right. Flashlight, keys.

229
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,524
What am I for— Oh.

230
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,557
The instruction manual.

231
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:51,261
Instructions.
You start with one, two, three—

232
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,305
- Four?
- Are you crackin' wise?

233
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,001
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

234
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,079
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

235
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,581
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.
- You better get it!

236
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:09,950
<i>Gus. Larry, do 'em in order,</i>
<i>do 'em all and do 'em quick.</i>

237
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:15,083
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

238
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,163
- Out?
- Good luck, son.

239
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,858
- Night, Gus.
- Young buck, crackin' wise.

240
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,935
Moving on.

241
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,470
Hello? Ooh. Hello!

00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,065
Hello? Ooh. Hello!

Check! Check!

Check! Larry! L-L-L-L-Larry.

Monster truck rally!

Cecil?

249
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,914
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

250
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,945
What is this,
like a David Copperfield thing?

251
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,199
This is weird.

252
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,210
Cecil?

253
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,422
Come on! Revolve! Revolve!

Cecil, um—
Fredericks!

256
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,347
One moment. Connecting.

257
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,215
- Hello?
- Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

258
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,254
Larry. Yes? How can I help you?

259
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,189
The dinosaur—
The dinosaur's alive!

00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,955
I'm havin' a little trouble hearin' you, friend.

261
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,520
The dinosaur's alive! What do I do?
Just tell me what to do!

262
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,897
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

263
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,369
Okay, I got 'em!

264
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,633

- Wait! Wait!

265

<i>"Number one: Throw the bone."</i>
<i>What bone?</i>

Fetch?

267
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,185
Play fetch?

268
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,376
No way.

269
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,319

Gee. Okay. Um, you know what?
I have no gum-gum.

Sorry. And my name isn't dum-dum.
My name's Larry.

No, your name dum-dum.

Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

277

You better run-run

See you later, dum-dum.

279
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,287
What is happening?

280
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,566
How you doing?

281
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,269

Oh, Sakagawea.

00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,407
No, no, no.
Come back. Come back.

307
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,534
Dewey? Is that your name?
Dewey?

308
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,672
<i>No, no, no. What's</i>— <i>Dewey?</i>
<i>Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?</i>

309
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,046
Hey, Dexter, you want
to give me those keys?

310
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,642
I just want to lock up.

311
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,745
Yes. Oh, good. Come to papa.

312
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,381
Oh, thank you.
Can I have those keys?

313
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,585
Oh, good. What a good boy.

314
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,685
<i>That's okay. Oh. Oh, thank you.</i>

315
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,696
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's okay.

316
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,698
Thank you very, very much.

317
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,884
Ew! Oh! Yuck!

318
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,254
Bad monkey! Stop that!
Ew! That's not right!

319
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,919
Are you done?

320
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,997
<i>Do you have an issue with me, huh?</i>
<i>Do you have an issue with me?</i>

321
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,965
'Cause if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

322
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,401
All right? And also—
Let me tell you something. These keys?

323
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,701
Hey! Dexter, that's not funny! Give 'em back!

324
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,708
<i>Dexter! Dexter! Give</i>—

325
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,903
Don't. I know what you're
thinking. Don't do it.

326
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,914
Not a good idea. Mm-mmm.

327
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,780
<i>Not</i>— <i>Dexter, I need those!</i>

328
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,411
<i>Hey, don't encourage him! You think</i>
<i>you're funny for your friends, huh?</i>

329
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,786
You three, you think you got—What, he's the
ringleader, and you're like a little audience?

330
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,417
Yeah, no! Don't do it!
Okay? Lookit! Look—

331
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,290
You!

332
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,905
Oh! This is not happening.

333
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,220
Oh, man.

334
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,007
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

335
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,277
I can't feel my lip.

336
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,280
Oh, "thit."

337
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,590
Man!

338
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,422
Hey, stop that!

339
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,192
Yee-haw! Hogtie him, boys!

340
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,060
Get him!

341
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,326
Get that big old Bocephus
of a man!

342
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,267
- Hey, what are you doing?
<i>- Cinch him up real good!</i>

343
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,101
<i>- You ain't so big now, are you, boy?</i>
- Hey! Hey, stop that!

344
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,176
Whoo-wee!

345
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,745
Every night, year after year...

346
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,112
one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes!

347
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,516
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

348
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,420
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

349
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,689
Hey, blondie.

350
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,361
- Name's Jedidiah!
- All right, Jedidiah. Stop the train, please!

351
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,734
That's a big no-can-do,
crackerjack.

352
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,569
- What's going on here, huh?
- Somebody's gotta pay.

353
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,644
- Pay for what?
- I don't know! Just pay!

354
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,146
Now stop whining
and just take it like a man!

355
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,749
Seriously, stop the train.

356
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,789
- All right. Stop the train!
- Thank you.

357
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,984
Now full speed ahead
and ram him!

358
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,958
Split his head
like a watermelon!

359
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,823
For crying out loud!

360
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,891
- All right. That's enough.
- We got a breach!

361
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,743
I got him!
I got him, guys! I got him!

362
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,745
- Oh, my.
- Prepare the catapults.

363
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:57,487
<i>Whoa, Octavius, hold on. This ain't</i>
<i>your fight. This here giant's on our land.</i>

364
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,155
Hey, hey, little guy.
Jed. Yeah.

365
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,323
Sorry. Look, I just—
I'm not a giant, okay?

366
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,129
<i>- I'm just like an average size</i>—
- Don't talk down to me!

367
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,433
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

368
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,976
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

369
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,977
metaphorically speaking.

370
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,479
Don't take that the wrong way.
I'm just saying you're miniatures.

371
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:21,109
- Silence! The Roman Empire knows no boundaries.
<i>- Steady, men!</i>

372
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,312
- Don't you do it, son.
- Do what?

373
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,888
- Octavius!
- Don't do what?

374
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,516
- Unleash hell!
- D'oh!

375
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,390
<i>- Fire!</i>
- Ow! Oh!

376
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,432
- Ow!
<i>- Fire!</i>

377
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,470
Ow! Yeow! Ow!

378
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,336
Climb aboard, boy.
Take the hand, son.

379
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:49,042
On board.

380
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,412
<i> That's right!</i>
<i>You better run, boy! You hearJedidiah?</i>

381
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:57,045
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you! You hear me?

382
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,180
Um, thank you.

383
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,826
Not at all. Theodore Roosevelt...

384
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,158
26th president of these
United States of America, at your service.

385
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,164
Okay.

386
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,235
Uh, I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

387
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,829
Pleasure to meet you,
Lawrence Daley!

388
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,933
You'll have to excuse me though.
The hunt is afoot.

389
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,774
Hunt's afoot.

390
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,112
- Um, excuse me. Mr. President,
can I ask you something?

391
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,709
- Yes, but just one question.
- All right. Okay.

392
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,220
Why? Is it like just some,
like, three-wishes kind of deal?

393
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,720
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

394
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,855
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

395
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,434
All right. Well, l— I don't
really know how to put this...

396
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,435
and please don't take it
the wrong way...

397
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,335
but isn't everything in this
museum supposed to be, you know—

398
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,340
Dead?

399
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,810
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

400
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,981
Yell all you want, pharaoh!

401
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,952
You've been in there 54 years!
You're not getting out tonight!

402
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,717
There's the source
of all this commotion.

403
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,157
<i>The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.</i>

404
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:14,891
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

405
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,899
<i>On that night...</i>

406
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:21,495
everything in this museum
came to life.

407
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,404
And every night since.

408
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,014
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

409
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,107
Exactly.

410
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,051
And I'm supposed to do what?

411
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,145
You're the night watchman,
Lawrence—

412
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,384
a venerable position
in this institution.

413
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,860
- Come on, lad.
- All right. Okay.

414
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,988
- This is impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

415
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,158
If it can be dreamed,
it can be done.

416
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,260
Hence, the 20-foot jackal staring at you
right now. Don't make eye contact!

417
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,068
Your job is to make sure that
everyone stays inside the museum...

418
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:01,838
because if the sun rises and anyone's
on the outside, we turn to dust.

419
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,710
- You turn to dust?
- Dust.

420
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,715
- Really?
- Really.

421
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,309
Now it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

422
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:14,050
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

423
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,592
Yeah. I mean—

424
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,662
I mean, I guess. I don't— Um—

425
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,789
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

426
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,924
- Yes.
- Good!

427
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,003
Let's ride.

428
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:39,346
<i> All right.</i>
<i>So, the Hall of Reptiles is secure.</i>

429
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,652
What are you looking at?

430
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,491
I'm, uh, tracking, dear boy.

431
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,397
<i>A man's got to track.</i>
<i>Welcome to the family, Lawrence.</i>

432
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:03,667
- See you tomorrow night.
- Well— Oh, actually, I gotta be honest.

433
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,039
- I don't think I'm coming back.
- What? You've only just begun.

434
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,170
- Yeah. Well, this is not exactly what l—
- Lawrence.

435
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,545
- Yeah?
- What did you do before you took this post?

436
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,743
Uh, well, I've done
a lot of different things.

437
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,047
I, um— I invented this thing
called the Snapper.

438
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,122
Did you give up on that as well?

439
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,521
No. I didn't.
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.

440
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,115
- You might've heard of the Clapper.
- Lawrence.

441
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,355
- Yes, sir.
- Some men are born great.

442
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,592
Others have greatness
thrust upon them.

443
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,693
For you, this is that very moment.

444
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,060
Bully! Gotcha, boy.

445
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,727
Yeah. You got me.

446
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,840
Say hello to your little friend!

447
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,136
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

448
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,680
Put me down!
I don't like to be manhandled!

449
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,978
- Just calm down, Jed.
- It doesn't feel good!

450
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,815
- It makes me feel small and powerless.
- You done?

451
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,821
I'm gonna shoot you
in your dang eye.

452
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,949
In your dadgum eye.

453
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,493
Yeah, keep shootin'.
Nothing's gonna happen.

454
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,257
Now you know my shame.

455
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,300
Jedidiah's impotent rage.

456
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,801
His guns don't fire.
Take me away.

457
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,566
This ain't over!
You ain't seen the last of me!

458
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,766
Yeah, I don't wanna hear it, okay?

459
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,002
Duck!

460
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,377
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

461
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,383
This is not worth $11.50 an hour.

462
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,511
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant runnin' around.

463
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,493
Hello!

464
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,563
Larry?

465
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,666
Larry?

466
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,934
Oh! Oh, don't do that!
We're too old for surprises.

467
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,874
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like, uh, how you surprised me...

468
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,776
with the fact that everything
in the museum comes to life at night!

469
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,781
That little sweetheart.

470
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,511
Larry, we wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

471
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,780
- Do you have any idea
what I've been through tonight?
- What?

472
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,254
I said, "Do you have any idea
what I've been through tonight?"

473
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,257
Keep a lid on it, butterscotch!

474
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,022
I don't even know if what happened
was real or not, but I did not sign up for this.

475
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,429
I just need a regular job that— that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

476
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:21,062
So thank you very much, and, uh, I left my
uniform in the office, and I will be seeing you.

477
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:24,800
Larry! Bah.

478
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,080
<i>- Dad.</i>
- Hey.

479
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,479
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doin' here?

480
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,484
Erica had to be in court
early this morning...

481
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,486
so I'm taking
Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

482
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:41,115
- But he wanted to swing by
to see you in the new job.
- Oh.

483
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,420
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

484
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,758
Hey, Niko, want to take
a little look-a-doo inside?

485
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,832
Maybe your dad will
give you a V.I.P. Tour.

486
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,663
You know what? Um, we're
pretty slammed this morning.

487
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:56,138
Yeah, but, Nicky, I promise, I'll, uh—
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

488
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,969
- Deal.
- All right.

489
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,134
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

490
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,178
- Love you.
- Love you too, buddy.

491
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,247
Bye now. All right.

492
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,477
Hey, Larry.

493
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,412
So, I was thinkin' maybe
I'll give it one more night.

494
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,006
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

495
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,552
You! New night guard,
here, now.

496
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,196
- What's up?
- "What's up?"

497
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:58,758
Oh. Well, take a walk with me, and
I'll show you, Mr. "What's up." Come on.

498
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,869
So, would you kindly do me
the favor of explaining this?

499
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,912
<i>Ooh. Okay.</i>

500
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:15,316
Uh, I'm guessing— and I'm
just spitballing here— but, uh...

501
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,513
<i>Iooks like that Roman dude got cocky</i>
<i>and climbed over into the Wild West.</i>

502
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,489
And that cowboy knows the Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

503
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,493
so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

504
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,927
Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard.

505
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,900
No is the answer.

506
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:37,338
Sarcasm back at you, with your
humor box. I wasn't laughing.

507
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,844
I was pretending to laugh, if that's what
you want, some sort of battle of humor.

508
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,778
Do you?

509
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,043
No.

510
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,177
I don't want a—
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

511
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,279
No, you don't, because it would
be a bloodbath.

512
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,449
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

513
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:02,531
No. I find it about
as funny as a "fancist."

514
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,601
It's not funny. Okay?

515
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,570
And I will not stand
for this type of blatant s—

516
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,571
If I'm not clear, tell me.

517
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,537
Am I clear?

518
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,547
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

519
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,120
Hey, Cecil.

520
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,055
You got an extra copy of that,
uh, instruction manual?

521
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:32,322
Oh, no, I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

522
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,330
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

523
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,491
Helped me a lot
when I first started out.

524
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,462
<i> This museum</i>
<i>was originally dedicated...</i>

525
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,973
<i>to that man on the horse up there</i>—
<i>President Theodore Roosevelt.</i>

526
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,909
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

527
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,640
<i>the better prepared</i>
<i>you are for the future.</i>

528
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,044
<i>Okay, kids. Who can tell me</i>
<i>what this room is called?</i>

529
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,953
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

530
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,651
Right here we have the king
of the jungle, the lion.

531
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,356
<i>And up ahead is one of my favorite creatures</i>
<i>in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.</i>

532
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,591
<i>A highly intelligent primate...</i>

533
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,693
known for its loving and generous nature.

534
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,339
Excuse me?

535
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:21,172
L— l— I just thought that was—

536
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,803
l— I just was
laughing in agreement.

537
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,174
Happy monkey.

538
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,319
All right, kids. This way.

539
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,819
Let me tell you something.

540
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:40,988
I'm not buyin' it. You might have them fooled.
You might have the kids fooled.

541
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,498
Not me. Can't get past me.

542
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,661
There's a storm comin', buddy.
There's a storm comin'.

543
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,673
<i>One of the most famous trackers in history...</i>

544
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,210
Sakagawea was the woman
who led Lewis and Clark...

545
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,280
on their expedition
to find the Pacific Ocean.

546
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:00,077
Now, you guys have probably heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

547
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:04,086
<i>And yet they wrote</i>—
<i>Yes, Mr. Daley?</i>

548
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,213
Yes. Was she deaf?

549
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,692
Was she deaf?
Um, no. She was not. But she—

550
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:16,357
<i>Yeah, 'cause, just, she does seem</i>
<i>a little bit, sort of, unresponsive.</i>

551
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,162
That's because she's a statue.

552
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,669
<i>Um, kids, could you</i>
<i>give me one sec?</i>

553
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,797
Go check her out.
She's really cool.

554
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,343
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm gonna be here every night...

555
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:31,573
and I just wanted to learn a little bit
more about what I'm guarding.

556
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,118
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.
Maybe, I don't know, when you have a break...

557
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,586
- could I buy you a cup of coffee or something?
- A cup of coffee?

558
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,021
Yeah, I mean,
just purely a, you know...

559
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:45,390
colleague-to-colleague
information download sort of coffee.

560
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,362
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

561
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,365
- Thank you... so much.
- You're welcome.

562
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,129
<i>- And have a good rest of your</i>—
- All right. All right. Okay, kids!

563
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,001
It was incredible what she did.

564
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,468
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains.

565
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,137
All with her newborn baby on her back.
She was like the ultimate working mother.

566
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,579
Wow. You are quite
the "Sakagawayan" expert.

567
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,582
- "Sakagawee-an."
- "Sakagawee-an"?

568
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:12,314
Yeah. I should be. I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

569
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,449
Four years? You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

570
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,394
Actually, it's more like
a 900-page book.

571
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:24,957
So, what's your story?
You always wanted to be a security guard?

572
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,036
- Uh—
- Oh, I didn't mean to—

573
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:32,268
No, no, no, no. Um, no, I'm divorced,
and I have a 10-year-old son...

574
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:37,109
so I needed to find a—
a more steady situation.

575
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,183
Got it. So what can I
tell you about the museum?

576
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,651
Okay. Attila the Hun—
What is that guy's problem?

577
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,621
Attila was considered the only genuine
threat to the Roman Empire.

578
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,749
"Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

579
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,760
"Attila and his Huns would often...

580
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,831
<i>"tear off the limbs</i>
<i>of their helpless victims.</i>

581
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,194
"Attila was famous for his
superstitious beliefs.

582
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:03,706
<i>"He surrounded himself with a phalanx</i>
<i>of sorcerers and magicians...</i>

583
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,833
<i>who advised and mystified him</i>
<i>with their dark arts. "</i>

584
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,292
Larry? Just wanted to say
good luck, son.

585
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,766
And good-bye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

586
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,201
- If you're ever in Boca, look us up.
- Whoa. Wait.

587
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,899
You guys are goin' out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

588
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,909
A smart fellow like you?
You'll be fine.

589
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:18,539
Yeah, we'll just be a phone call away.
Come on. Walk us out.

590
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,811
Uh, uh, you fellows go ahead.
I, uh—

591
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,216
I— I— I need a moment.

592
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:28,883
He's very emotional.
A lot of, uh, memories in this room.

593
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,405
<i>Aha. Go crazy, big guy.</i>

594
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,251
Hey, guys.

595
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,484
Quest for fire?

596
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,085
Over. Knock yourselves out.

597
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,259
Morning, dum-dum.

598
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,132
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

599
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,501
Yes, I did, fathead.

600
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,769
- Lots and lots of gum-gum.
- Mmm!

601
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,055
<i>What's that?</i>

602
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,291
I can't hear you
through the... glass.

603
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,228
Sorry.

604
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,635
Heave!

605
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,470
- Heave! Heave!
- Hey.

606
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,237
<i>- Heave!</i>
- What's goin' on over here?

607
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,212
We expand or we die.

608
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,909
- Heave! Heave!
<i>- On the count of three...</i>

609
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,885
<i>you blow this anthill</i>
<i>to kingdom come!</i>

610
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,888
And a-one!

611
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,481
- Hey, hey, Jed! Stop that!
<i>- And a-two!</i>

612
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,494
All right? Don't do that. You blow a hole
in your mountain, all you're gonna hit is a wall.

613
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,996
Step aside, Gigantor.
We got us a railroad to build.

614
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,999
We're blowin' a hole in that thing.

615
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,865
Okay, first of all, enough
with the Gigantor giant stuff.

616
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,870
Okay? I'm just tryin'
to close up shop.

617
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,872
We're gonna blow it anyway!
And a-three!

618
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,772
- Whoo!
- Yeah, poof.

619
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,505
Wow. What are you doing?

620
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:07,208
What's it look like we're doin'?
It's manifest destiny.

621
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,946
You can't fight it, and neither can I!
Go! More dynamite!

622
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,249
<i>- Yeah, use it all! Whoo!</i>
- All right. Okay.

623
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,416
Listen, "Octavus"?
You gotta stop that.

624
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,517
It's Octavius, Mary.

625
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:22,359
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

626
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:26,196
- You cannot do this! I am
a Roman general! I have rights!
- And you.

627
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,203
Do it all— Hey! No!
Put me down!

628
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,035
- Keep heaving, men! I will return, I swear!
- You can't stop progress!

629
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,473
We're gonna have
a little talk, okay?

630
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,875
I told you, I don't like
to be manhandled!

631
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,072
No, I will manhandle you,
Jedidiah!

632
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:42,447
<i>Now listen, guys, what is your problem, huh?</i>
<i>Why can't you just get along?</i>

633
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,020
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

634
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,021
It's kinda how we pass the time.

635
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,614
You're, like, a— a giant,
a freak, if you will.

636
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,921
We can't expect you
to understand that.

637
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:55,691
You guys got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

638
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:59,929
- What? You mean—
- You're gonna let us out?

639
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,300
What, and just—
just roam free?

640
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,568
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

641
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,906
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

642
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:13,142
- You have my word, my liege.
- Yeah, n-no problemo, Gigantor.

643
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,016
Um, my name's Larry,
first of all, okay, Jed?

644
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,112
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you tiny, right?

645
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,488
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Hey, teeny. How does that sound?

646
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:27,620
L- I don't like it.
It hurts my feelings.

647
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,529
Okay, well, Gigantor makes me
feel like some sort of freak.

648
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,159
<i>- So, um, you know</i>—
- I don't— I just call you Larry.

649
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,331
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?
Now look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

650
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,967
If you don't do what I say, you're gonna end up
like your buddies in the Mayan worid.

651
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,204
<i>- Locked up. Take a look.</i>

652
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:46,840
- Do they look happy?
- No.

653
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,043
They look sad.

654
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:51,052
<i>'Cause they can't do</i>
<i>what they want to do.</i>

655
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,679
Now I'm letting you guys
have a little bit of leash here.

656
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,624
<i>Don't choke me with it, okay?</i>
<i>Now I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?</i>

657
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,161
Okay. Good. Thanks.

658
00:55:01,652 --> 00:55:04,086
Hey, how's that gum
treatin' you, dum-dum?

659
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:06,281
Good.

660
00:55:09,293 --> 00:55:11,784
<i>Oh, hey, Dexter.</i>
<i>I'm just locking up. You want in?</i>

661
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:17,660
Yeah? Whoa! All right.

662
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:26,141
Oh. What's that?
You got my keys?

663
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:30,145
I don't think so.

664
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:36,477
Looks like Uncle Larry
pulled a fast one on little Dexy.

665
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:38,487
Those are baby keys
for a little baby.

666
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:41,080
So have fun playin' with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

667
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:44,922
Maybe tomorrow night I'll bring you
a baby "diapie" so you can go poo-poo in it.

668
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:48,226
Then I'll give you a little tickle
'cause you're a cute little baby.

669
00:55:48,332 --> 00:55:52,063
Will you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

670
00:55:52,169 --> 00:55:54,694
Told you there was a storm comin'.

671
00:55:57,341 --> 00:56:00,333
This way.

672
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:04,203
- Hey, Teddy.
- Lawrence!

673
00:56:04,315 --> 00:56:07,011
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

674
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:09,017
You look like a man on a mission.

675
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,019
Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

676
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:21,356
- You, uh—
- What?

677
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:24,366
- You checkin' her out?
- The nerve!

678
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:28,461
"Checking her out."
I've never heard of such a thing.

679
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:32,167
No, no, no. I'm just— I mean,
you know, she's— she's very beautiful.

680
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:34,176
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

681
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:40,845
- Well, a handsome woman, I suppose.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

682
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:43,852
Maybe you should go, uh—
go talk to her.

683
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:45,922
- Indeed!
- Yeah.

684
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:48,014
- Bless ya, lad. Carry on.
- All right. Good.

685
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,093
See ya.

686
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:10,077
L— Uh—

687
00:57:55,826 --> 00:57:58,454
Hey. Hi.

688
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,860
No! It's okay. It's okay.

689
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:03,762
You guys speak English? No?

690
00:58:06,537 --> 00:58:08,437
Right. Okay, I don't know
what that means...

691
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:11,736
and I know that you and I kinda
got off on the wrong foot last night...

692
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:15,972
but... a little birdie...

693
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,210
told me that somebody
likes... magic.

694
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:24,481
- Magic?
- Magic.

695
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,852
Sorcery.

696
00:58:26,957 --> 00:58:28,925
Ah, "sorsor"—

697
00:58:29,026 --> 00:58:31,290
Yes, illusion.

698
00:58:31,395 --> 00:58:33,295
Everybody likes magic.

699
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:37,128
And flowers. People like flowers.

700
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:39,202
There you go.
Those are for you.

701
00:58:39,303 --> 00:58:41,567
You know what else
people like? Money.

702
00:58:41,672 --> 00:58:44,470
The almighty dollar, right?

703
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:48,306
But money can sometimes...
disappear.

704
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:50,903
Yeah.

705
00:58:51,014 --> 00:58:54,506
At least that's what I... hear.

706
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,420
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

707
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,729
Oh, check this out.
Anybody need a hanky?

708
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,060
Well, I wouldn't suggest
this little feller...

709
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:13,227
'cause he has a nasty habit...
of vanishing.

710
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:18,007
Into thin air.

711
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:21,407
Ah, no, no. Don't.
That defeats the— Don't— Don't—Ah!

712
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:29,911
Ah! Oh! Oh!

713
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:40,589
Not the limbs! Guys!

714
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:43,564
Please do not tear the limbs!

715
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:02,811
Cortés, right?

716
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:19,167
How?

717
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:25,164
You— Don't even think
about it. Don't you—

718
01:00:25,275 --> 01:00:29,075
Dexter!

719
01:00:32,015 --> 01:00:33,915
Ohhh.

720
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,786
Come on, guys.

721
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,779
<i>- Hey! Guys!</i>

722
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:13,384
Hey, guys! Hey! Guys!

723
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,685
- Ow!
- Sorry. What's going on?

724
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,987
What happened here?
I thought we had a deal.

725
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:20,529
We will never coexist
with these buffoons!

726
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,531
We're past words, Laredo.

727
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:25,659
Now it's time to let
Smith & Wesson do the talkin'!

728
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:27,669
Those guns don't even work.

729
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,535
- Oh, they don't? Take a look at this.
- Ay!

730
01:01:30,641 --> 01:01:32,575
Don't kick me!

731
01:01:32,676 --> 01:01:34,644
Dexter!

732
01:02:23,126 --> 01:02:25,788
Why?

733
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,636
Ho! Dexter!

734
01:02:41,378 --> 01:02:43,278
End of the line, cool breeze.

735
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:46,272
End of the line.

736
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:53,945
Huh?

737
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:06,402
I am not playing games here.

738
01:03:10,674 --> 01:03:12,437
Just hand them over.

739
01:03:17,414 --> 01:03:19,746
Easy. Easy, Dexter.

740
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:22,080
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

741
01:03:44,207 --> 01:03:46,869
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

742
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:50,777
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me
and pushing me, and I'm sick of it!

743
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:54,317
Poppycock. This little creature
is your primate brother.

744
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,112
Without him, there's no us.

745
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,620
Are you rabid? Wipe that off.

746
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:02,954
You have to deal with this
creature with love and respect.

747
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,027
May I have the keys,
dear friend?

748
01:04:05,128 --> 01:04:08,859
Thank you. Lawrence?

749
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:13,534
You know what? You seem to know
what you're doing, Teddy.

750
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:15,798
So, uh, I'm gonna let you
take over, all right?

751
01:04:15,906 --> 01:04:18,500
No, no! My dear boy,
you can't put up the white flag now.

752
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:20,872
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy!

753
01:04:20,977 --> 01:04:23,172
Look, I tried. I came back
tonight, didn't I?

754
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,306
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day!

755
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:30,318
Yeah, well, that's great, Teddy, but I'm dealing
with the most ridiculous job in history!

756
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,388
- Some men are born great, Lawrence.
- Yeah, I know, Teddy.

757
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:34,719
Others have greatness
thrust upon them.

758
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:36,884
You hit me with that
chestnut last night.

759
01:04:36,993 --> 01:04:39,052
The thing is,
not everyone <i>is</i> great.

760
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:41,596
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

761
01:04:41,698 --> 01:04:44,394
No, you're not, Lawrence. For the love
of Gideon, stop wallowing in self-pity.

762
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:46,662
Every great journey
begins with a single footstep.

763
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:50,365
If you could teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

764
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:53,237
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

765
01:04:53,343 --> 01:04:55,402
spying on a girl
he's never even talked to.

766
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:59,175
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

767
01:04:59,282 --> 01:05:01,876
I'm done, all right?

768
01:05:06,423 --> 01:05:09,415
No, Rexy! No!

769
01:05:40,423 --> 01:05:42,448
Oh, no.

770
01:06:46,523 --> 01:06:48,457
All right.

771
01:06:57,334 --> 01:07:01,668
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

772
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:04,069
I'm telling you.
My dad's gonna hook us up.

773
01:07:04,174 --> 01:07:07,405
<i>- Mr. Daley.</i>
- Yeah?

774
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,740
- Foam.
<i>- Yes, I know.</i>

775
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:12,212
- In the Neanderthal display.
- I know. I know.

776
01:07:12,315 --> 01:07:16,183
There was an incident last night with the fire
extinguisher. I was on my way to clean it up.

777
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:18,754
Okay, don't bother.
You're fired.

778
01:07:20,523 --> 01:07:22,889
I don't think we're
gettin' a tour today.

779
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:26,326
Your dad just got canned, dude.

780
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:28,556
Excuse me?

781
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:32,829
<i>Mr. McPhee?</i>
<i>Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?</i>

782
01:07:32,936 --> 01:07:35,598
Can I talk to you
about this, please, sir?

783
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:37,832
- What?
- I know I screwed up...

784
01:07:37,941 --> 01:07:40,239
but I think I finally understand
how to do this job.

785
01:07:40,343 --> 01:07:43,005
- You obviously don't. That's the point.
- No, I didn't, but now I do.

786
01:07:43,113 --> 01:07:45,911
- Really, Mr. McPhee, if you just give me one—
- Doctor.

787
01:07:46,016 --> 01:07:51,352
Dr. McPhee, just—
Can you please give me one more night?

788
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:56,417
- One more night.
- Okay. Thank you.

789
01:07:56,526 --> 01:08:00,428
And if anything is the tiniest—

790
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,430
after your shift—

791
01:08:02,532 --> 01:08:04,830
Whoo!

792
01:08:04,934 --> 01:08:07,630
Because—

793
01:08:07,737 --> 01:08:09,432
Got it.

794
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:10,767
- Okay?
- Okay.

795
01:08:10,874 --> 01:08:13,240
Fool me once, shame on you.

796
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:15,334
Fool me twice—

797
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:20,815
- Shame on me.
- Huh?

798
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:22,817
Fool me— Shame on me.

799
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:25,479
- You.
- Fool me twice— Got it.

800
01:08:25,588 --> 01:08:28,250
- Take it or leave it.
- Okay. Thank you.

801
01:08:31,928 --> 01:08:34,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

802
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:38,126
- What's wrong?
- Maybe you should ask Nicky.

803
01:08:40,103 --> 01:08:43,004
<i>Hey, buddy. What's goin'on?</i>

804
01:08:43,106 --> 01:08:45,165
You got fired.

805
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:47,766
What are you talkin' about?
I didn't get fired.

806
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:51,012
I came to the museum
this morning.

807
01:08:51,114 --> 01:08:53,014
I saw your boss yelling at you.

808
01:08:53,116 --> 01:08:56,347
Why didn't you tell me?
No, everything's fine.

809
01:08:56,453 --> 01:08:58,921
I just—We just had
a little misunderstanding.

810
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:01,616
Why?

811
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:05,626
It's hard to explain. It's got—
I mean, you wouldn't bel—

812
01:09:05,728 --> 01:09:08,822
You know what? Let me show you.

813
01:09:08,932 --> 01:09:11,765
- Show me what?
- Come to work with me tonight.

814
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:16,100
<i>Larry, can, um</i>—
<i>can I talk to you for a second?</i>

815
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:22,502
- Am I in trouble?
- Larry, what are you doing?

816
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:25,012
I just want to show him
what I do. That's all.

817
01:09:25,115 --> 01:09:28,482
I love that you want to share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

818
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:31,952
I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

819
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,224
He won't be disappointed.

820
01:09:35,325 --> 01:09:36,952
Larry—

821
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,494
He won't be disappointed.

822
01:09:45,468 --> 01:09:48,028
Listen, you're gonna hang out
in the security office till everyone's gone.

823
01:09:48,138 --> 01:09:51,539
- Then I'm gonna come get you, all right?
- Okay.

824
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,755
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

825
01:10:13,863 --> 01:10:16,388
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

826
01:10:16,499 --> 01:10:20,367
- Good place to think, huh?
- Yeah, definitely.

827
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,530
So, no big plans tonight or—

828
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,507
Yeah. No, I'm not really
a big plan person.

829
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:29,806
I prefer hanging out with people
who were dead for 200 years.

830
01:10:29,913 --> 01:10:32,438
It's the live ones that throw me.

831
01:10:32,549 --> 01:10:35,450
That's cool. Seriously, though,
you do have to leave.

832
01:10:35,552 --> 01:10:37,713
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Sorry.

833
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,516
- It's just museum rules, and we're
sort of locking everything up.
<i>- No. Okay.</i>

834
01:10:40,623 --> 01:10:43,888
You're really taking
your job seriously. Okay.

835
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:47,451
Well, you know,
once I clip on the tie, I'm all business.

836
01:10:47,564 --> 01:10:50,897
- I get it.
- Yeah. How's that dissertation coming?

837
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,027
Oh, I've hit a dead end.
I mean, research can only get me so far.

838
01:10:55,138 --> 01:10:57,538
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

839
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:02,805
<i>So, I think it's time that</i>
<i>I move on to another subject.</i>

840
01:11:02,912 --> 01:11:05,403
I'll let you get back to work.

841
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:07,415
- Okay.
<i>- Good night, Larry.</i>

842
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,951
Yeah. Okay.

843
01:11:10,053 --> 01:11:11,953
Night.

844
01:11:18,895 --> 01:11:20,487
Hey!

845
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:24,422
Rebecca!

846
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:28,302
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hey.

847
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:31,896
Hey, listen. I don't think
you should give up on your paper.

848
01:11:32,008 --> 01:11:33,839
Okay. Why?

849
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:36,673
All right, look.
This is gonna sound crazy, all right?

850
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:39,577
I mean, it's gonna sound
like really, really crazy.

851
01:11:39,682 --> 01:11:42,276
- Okay.
- No, I mean like insanely crazy.

852
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,285
- I can handle it.
- Okay.

853
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:49,086
You know how they say
in certain museums history comes alive?

854
01:11:49,192 --> 01:11:52,286
- Yeah.
- In this museum...

855
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,454
it actually does.

856
01:11:55,965 --> 01:11:57,865
What are you talking about?

857
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:06,705
Everything
in this museum comes to life at night.

858
01:12:10,213 --> 01:12:13,649
- Really?
- Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

859
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,116
- You know that tablet, the Tablet of Ahkmenrah?
- Mm-hmm.

860
01:12:16,219 --> 01:12:19,154
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

861
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:22,156
Since the '50s when it came here,
every night everything's been coming to life.

862
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:25,421
I know this because Teddy Roosevelt told me.
Seriously. The monkey, Dexter?

863
01:12:25,528 --> 01:12:28,053
Right? The cute little—
What is he? Like a-a—

864
01:12:28,164 --> 01:12:30,064
- A capuchin.
- A capuchin, right. The capuchin.

865
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,862
He urinated on me
and bit my nose.

866
01:12:32,969 --> 01:12:35,938
And Sakagawea is in her case...

867
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:39,702
alive every night, just listening
to Lewis and Clark argue.

868
01:12:39,809 --> 01:12:43,370
So if you really want
to get inside her head...

869
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:45,674
I can hook that up.

870
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:51,384
- That's cool.
- Yeah, it's cool. It's freakin' awesome!

871
01:12:54,657 --> 01:12:56,716
Make fun of the history geek.

872
01:12:56,826 --> 01:12:58,589
No. Rebecca!

873
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:00,754
Good night, Larry.

874
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:05,593
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca!

875
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:17,604
There you go.
Best seat in the house.

876
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:19,739
- What's going on?
- If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy...

877
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:21,747
so I'm just gonna show you.

878
01:13:22,018 --> 01:13:25,078
- What?
- You'll see in about 20 seconds.

879
01:13:25,188 --> 01:13:27,418
- Okay, you like <i>Tyrannosaurus rex?</i>
- Yeah.

880
01:13:27,523 --> 01:13:29,753
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

881
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:33,226
And he's about
to come to life, Nicholas...

882
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:35,229
in...

883
01:13:36,766 --> 01:13:41,567
five, four, three, two—

884
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:51,539
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec.

885
01:13:51,647 --> 01:13:54,878
Say hello to Rexy!

886
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:58,380
Dad, are you okay?

887
01:13:58,488 --> 01:14:01,116
This is weird.

888
01:14:01,224 --> 01:14:03,920
Guys? Come on!

889
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:05,926
Sundown!

890
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:11,498
Hey, T.R. Come on.
Rise and shine, buddy. I need you to wake up.

891
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:14,764
<i>Come on. My kid is here.</i>
<i>I need you to wake up. Texas?</i>

892
01:14:14,871 --> 01:14:17,032
Texas, come on! Texas, come on!
Get on, Texas!

893
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,131
Whoo! Get on, Texas! Giddap!

894
01:14:19,242 --> 01:14:21,437
Just stop, okay?

895
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:24,809
No. Nicky, I'm telling you.
There's this tablet, okay?

896
01:14:24,914 --> 01:14:28,111
It's called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah,
and every night at sundown—

897
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:30,185
- Now there's a tablet?
- Yeah, there is.

898
01:14:30,286 --> 01:14:32,277
Come on, Dad.

899
01:14:33,322 --> 01:14:35,017
Come on.

900
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:41,420
<i>- It's gone.</i>
<i>- What's gone?</i>

901
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:44,830
The tablet.
I think somebody stole it.

902
01:14:44,934 --> 01:14:46,834
Yeah, right.

903
01:14:46,936 --> 01:14:49,837
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

904
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:54,108
Nicky?

905
01:14:55,912 --> 01:14:59,313
Hey! Nicky!

906
01:14:59,415 --> 01:15:02,111
Hey! Hey, Nicky!
Where are you going? Huh?

907
01:15:02,218 --> 01:15:04,982
- Home.
- What? Wait a minute.

908
01:15:09,492 --> 01:15:11,790
Come on.

909
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:24,005
- You guys shouldn't be here.
- Give us the tablet, son.

910
01:15:24,106 --> 01:15:26,131
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

911
01:15:26,242 --> 01:15:28,540
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

912
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:32,045
I'm sorry to tell you this, son, but
your dad doesn't work here anymore.

913
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:34,742
Got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

914
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:38,014
Dad, I thought you said
you weren't fired.

915
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,714
I did, Nicky. They're lying.
They're trying to steal that thing.

916
01:15:40,823 --> 01:15:43,383
Just turn the middle piece.
You'll see what I was talking about.

917
01:15:43,493 --> 01:15:45,552
That is museum property, son.
Now give it back.

918
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:47,561
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

919
01:15:47,663 --> 01:15:49,858
<i> Give us the tablet!</i>

920
01:15:49,966 --> 01:15:52,560
Nicky, trust me.

921
01:16:14,357 --> 01:16:15,881
Nick, run, now.

922
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,055
Get back here, kid!

923
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:23,590
Bad idea, Larry.

924
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:26,190
You wanna dance, hot dog?
Do you wanna dance?

925
01:16:26,302 --> 01:16:29,362
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't want to hurt— Ooh! Ow!

926
01:16:29,472 --> 01:16:31,372
Ah!

927
01:16:31,474 --> 01:16:33,806
<i>You see, Larry,</i>
<i>a few years into thejob...</i>

928
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:37,402
the three of us realized that,
like everything else in this museum...

929
01:16:37,513 --> 01:16:39,276
we got new life at night.

930
01:16:39,382 --> 01:16:42,749
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

931
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:45,719
Okay. Did not see that coming.

932
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:48,085
Gave us an energy boost.

933
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,624
We love the nightlife, Larry.

934
01:16:50,726 --> 01:16:54,423
So when we found out they were gonna
fire us, we had to steal the tablet.

935
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:56,589
Everyone knows
you need the money.

936
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,826
Add to that the stuff
we planted in your place—

937
01:16:58,935 --> 01:17:02,234
Pretty obvious you committed the crime.
Take care of that cut.

938
01:17:02,338 --> 01:17:05,171
Come on, guys.
Let's go find that kid.

939
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:09,136
Sweet dreams, cupcake!

940
01:17:09,245 --> 01:17:11,179
- No!
- Pile driver!

941
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,510
Come on. Let's get our tablet.

942
01:17:39,075 --> 01:17:41,635
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

943
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:45,180
Nicky!

944
01:17:45,281 --> 01:17:48,182
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

945
01:17:49,619 --> 01:17:52,952
Sleep tight, hotshot.

946
01:17:53,055 --> 01:17:56,024
Let's grab everything we can fence.

947
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:58,616
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

948
01:18:06,902 --> 01:18:10,804
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

949
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:16,807
Someone call my name?

950
01:18:16,912 --> 01:18:18,812
Theodore Roosevelt at your service.

951
01:18:20,316 --> 01:18:22,614
- Teddy, can you get us out of here?
- Can't do it, man.

952
01:18:22,718 --> 01:18:26,415
- This is your moment.
- Will you save the lectures,
please? I'm not you, okay?

953
01:18:26,522 --> 01:18:30,151
I didn't build the Panama Canal.
I wasn't president of the United States.

954
01:18:30,259 --> 01:18:32,159
I need some help! Come on!

955
01:18:32,261 --> 01:18:37,324
Actually, I never did
any of those things.

956
01:18:37,433 --> 01:18:39,367
Teddy Roosevelt did.

957
01:18:39,468 --> 01:18:42,403
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

958
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:44,496
I never shot a wild beast.

959
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:47,940
I'm not even brave enough
to tell that beautiful woman I love her.

960
01:18:48,044 --> 01:18:49,773
But you—

961
01:18:49,879 --> 01:18:54,077
You gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

962
01:18:56,852 --> 01:19:00,618
I'm made of wax, Larry.
What are you made of?

963
01:19:05,127 --> 01:19:08,528
- Wait a minute!
That's all you got for me?
- That's it!

964
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:22,735
That's it. Come on.

965
01:19:22,845 --> 01:19:24,938
Duck!

966
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:28,708
Go over there!

967
01:19:47,803 --> 01:19:50,431
Hey. Hi. How you doin'?

968
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:54,134
Um, sorry to bother you, but, uh,
your guys there, your jackal guys—

969
01:19:54,243 --> 01:19:56,609
<i>Do you think you could actually</i>
<i>ask them to back off, please?</i>

970
01:19:56,712 --> 01:19:58,646
<i>We're not trying to hurt you,</i>
<i>and they think we are.</i>

971
01:19:58,748 --> 01:20:01,774
- Do you think you could
possibly do it, like, now?

972
01:20:05,755 --> 01:20:10,283
Thank you. Nicky. Thank you.

973
01:20:15,765 --> 01:20:19,166
Dad?

974
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:33,681
You would not believe
how stuffy it is in there.

975
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:36,941
How come you speak English?

976
01:20:37,052 --> 01:20:40,044
- I went to Cambridge University.
- You went to Cambridge?

977
01:20:40,156 --> 01:20:42,818
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

978
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:46,258
I am Ahkmenrah,
fourth king of the fourth king...

979
01:20:46,362 --> 01:20:49,229
ruler of the land of my fathers.

980
01:20:49,331 --> 01:20:52,300
Uh, I am Larry...

981
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:54,995
son of Milton...

982
01:20:55,104 --> 01:20:58,835
and, uh, this is my son, Nick...

983
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:01,239
and we hail from Brooklyn.

984
01:21:01,343 --> 01:21:06,542
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and stays with
me on Wednesdays and every other weekend.

985
01:21:06,649 --> 01:21:11,484
<i>That was the, uh, custody</i>
<i>agreement that we had.</i>

986
01:21:11,587 --> 01:21:15,284
<i>Larry, Nick,</i>
<i>guardians of Brooklyn...</i>

987
01:21:15,391 --> 01:21:17,689
I am forever in your debt.

988
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:20,455
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

989
01:21:20,563 --> 01:21:23,191
so that I may assume
command of my kingdom.

990
01:21:23,299 --> 01:21:25,733
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet.

991
01:21:25,835 --> 01:21:28,429
I would love
to bestow it upon you...

992
01:21:28,537 --> 01:21:32,405
but we don't actually have it.

993
01:21:40,182 --> 01:21:43,208
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him.

994
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:45,344
Thank you.

995
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,931
What is that?

996
01:22:01,036 --> 01:22:03,800
Huns.

997
01:22:05,507 --> 01:22:09,034
I gotta deal with this guy.

998
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,113
<i>Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.</i>

999
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:56,349
<i>He says that he wants</i>
<i>to rip you apart.</i>

1000
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:58,824
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

1001
01:22:58,928 --> 01:23:02,329
I get it. Ripping for you—
You want to rip things, okay?

1002
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:06,060
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

1003
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:08,602
In here.

1004
01:23:08,704 --> 01:23:12,140
Did somebody rip little—
little baby Attila...

1005
01:23:12,241 --> 01:23:15,438
a long time ago right here?

1006
01:23:15,544 --> 01:23:19,173
They ripped—They ripped
something out, didn't they?

1007
01:23:20,816 --> 01:23:22,875
They ripped love.

1008
01:23:22,985 --> 01:23:26,113
They ripped love
right out of you, didn't they?

1009
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:30,214
A little baby all alone in a tent...

1010
01:23:30,326 --> 01:23:33,295
whose daddy went off...

1011
01:23:33,395 --> 01:23:38,230
to pillage some town
or go and plunder somewhere.

1012
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:42,293
Just doing his job.
But who was left alone?

1013
01:23:45,574 --> 01:23:49,135
You.

1014
01:23:49,244 --> 01:23:52,611
It's okay. It's okay.

1015
01:23:52,715 --> 01:23:56,412
Let it out. Let it go.
Let it go.

1016
01:24:16,939 --> 01:24:19,772
It's okay. It's okay.

1017
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:23,335
You're next.

1018
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:28,180
Yeah.

1019
01:24:28,283 --> 01:24:30,945
Good. That's good.
Just breathe.

1020
01:24:31,053 --> 01:24:33,180
Just—Just—

1021
01:24:33,288 --> 01:24:35,449
- Yeah.
- Larry Daley?

1022
01:24:35,557 --> 01:24:39,254
Yeah?

1023
01:24:39,361 --> 01:24:42,057
Good. Yes.

1024
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:44,530
Yeah, okay. Good. Good.

1025
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,396
All right!

1026
01:24:47,503 --> 01:24:49,596
I need everybody to listen up!

1027
01:24:51,373 --> 01:24:54,365
Guys, come on!

1028
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,516
<i> Quiet!</i>

1029
01:25:14,163 --> 01:25:17,360
- My dum-dum want to speak.
- Thank you.

1030
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:20,765
Now this here
is King Ahkmenrah.

1031
01:25:20,869 --> 01:25:23,997
His tablet is what brings you
to life every night.

1032
01:25:24,106 --> 01:25:26,973
<i>And those old night watchmen</i>—
<i>they stole it.</i>

1033
01:25:27,076 --> 01:25:29,977
<i>Now we need to find those guards</i>
<i>and get the tablet back...</i>

1034
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:32,104
<i>and we need to do it</i>
<i>before morning.</i>

1035
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:35,445
Civil War guys, head over
to the Planetarium Wing.

1036
01:25:37,352 --> 01:25:40,446
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me—

1037
01:25:40,556 --> 01:25:43,081
- It's Columbus.
- Right, Columbus.

1038
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:46,127
<i>Right. I'm sorry. There's no nameplate.</i>
<i>So, Columbus...</i>

1039
01:25:46,228 --> 01:25:50,028
take the Neanderthals and do a sweep from
Invertebrates all the way through Reptiles.

1040
01:25:50,132 --> 01:25:53,863
Jed and Octavius, their van's
parked out back. Go take care of it.

1041
01:25:53,969 --> 01:25:56,494
No. No, sir.
I ain't workin' with toga boy.

1042
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:59,802
- Romans work alone. Ow!
- That didn't hurt.

1043
01:25:59,908 --> 01:26:01,808
- Don't be a baby.
- Yes, it did!

1044
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:04,879
Come on!
That was much harder!

1045
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:09,440
Guys, come on! Jed, Octavius...

1046
01:26:09,551 --> 01:26:11,610
<i>take away the fact</i>
<i>you were born 2,000 years apart.</i>

1047
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:16,384
You guys aren't that different.
You're both great leaders.

1048
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:18,790
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1049
01:26:18,894 --> 01:26:20,361
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1050
01:26:20,462 --> 01:26:22,054
Civil War dudes!

1051
01:26:23,732 --> 01:26:25,825
<i>You guys are brothers,</i>
<i>for God's sakes.</i>

1052
01:26:25,934 --> 01:26:28,698
<i>You've gotta stop fighting.</i>

1053
01:26:28,804 --> 01:26:33,332
North wins.
Slavery's bad. Sorry.

1054
01:26:33,442 --> 01:26:36,673
<i>Don't wanna burst your bubble.</i>
<i>But, South, you guys get...</i>

1055
01:26:36,778 --> 01:26:40,373
Allman Brothers and... NASCAR.

1056
01:26:40,482 --> 01:26:43,383
So just chill!

1057
01:26:43,485 --> 01:26:47,922
<i>Look, without that tablet,</i>
<i>all of this</i>—

1058
01:26:48,023 --> 01:26:51,151
this whole coming to life
at night thing— it all goes away.

1059
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,751
<i>Now, I don't want</i>
<i>to let that happen...</i>

1060
01:26:53,862 --> 01:26:55,762
<i>but I need your help.</i>

1061
01:26:55,864 --> 01:26:57,991
<i>We can get this done,</i>
<i>but we gotta do it together.</i>

1062
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,364
So who's with me?

1063
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:03,438
Yeah.

1064
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:06,269
Who's with me?

1065
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:09,435
Charge!

1066
01:27:09,545 --> 01:27:12,514
All right!
Let's do this, people!

1067
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:16,848
<i>And animals.</i>

1068
01:27:16,952 --> 01:27:19,352
<i>And weird, faceless</i>
<i>puppet creatures.</i>

1069
01:27:19,454 --> 01:27:21,513
Come on! Let's go! Let's do it!

1070
01:27:43,879 --> 01:27:46,473
Come on! Follow me, boys!

1071
01:27:46,582 --> 01:27:48,482
Geronimo!

1072
01:27:59,895 --> 01:28:01,920
Aw, geez!

1073
01:28:15,911 --> 01:28:20,177
Now, boys, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

1074
01:28:24,586 --> 01:28:27,851
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

1075
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,023
Right, men, we're almost there.

1076
01:28:54,883 --> 01:28:57,784
Save yourself!

1077
01:28:57,886 --> 01:29:00,150
I ain't quittin' you!

1078
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,990
Gus?

1079
01:29:05,927 --> 01:29:09,454
Reginald? Fellas?
Where are you?

1080
01:29:10,465 --> 01:29:12,456
Guys?

1081
01:29:23,078 --> 01:29:26,343
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
Good job, gentlemen.

1082
01:29:26,448 --> 01:29:29,042
Loving the teamwork.

1083
01:29:48,036 --> 01:29:51,528
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1084
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,575
I know someone
who could help. Come on.

1085
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:57,510
Watch out!

1086
01:30:03,885 --> 01:30:08,049
Hey, Sakagawea or "waya." Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

1087
01:30:08,156 --> 01:30:10,716
Do you think you can track
the guys who took it?

1088
01:30:10,826 --> 01:30:15,559
He went east,
but he lost control and crashed.

1089
01:30:15,664 --> 01:30:18,963
You're amazing.
How can you tell that?

1090
01:30:23,472 --> 01:30:26,703
He left the wagon and went back.

1091
01:30:26,808 --> 01:30:29,834
He went back?

1092
01:30:29,945 --> 01:30:32,072
Why would he go back?

1093
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,911
Get out of the way!

1094
01:30:44,059 --> 01:30:45,959
You saved me.

1095
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:48,393
You're worth saving, my dear.

1096
01:30:49,865 --> 01:30:52,333
Ooh. That's problematic.

1097
01:30:52,434 --> 01:30:55,835
- Teddy! Oh, man.
- Larry, relax. I'm wax.

1098
01:30:55,937 --> 01:30:59,429
You've gotta do something. Dawn's approaching,
and half the museum is running amok outside.

1099
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,338
He's got my tablet.

1100
01:31:01,443 --> 01:31:06,107
<i>Come on, Ockie!</i>

1101
01:31:11,086 --> 01:31:13,919
At your service, Gigantor.

1102
01:31:14,022 --> 01:31:16,456
How can we be
of assistance, my liege?

1103
01:31:16,558 --> 01:31:19,356
Just give me a second, guys.

1104
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:25,825
Rexy.

1105
01:31:25,934 --> 01:31:29,665
Here, boy.
Teddy, I need a horse.

1106
01:31:29,771 --> 01:31:31,500
Do it, man.

1107
01:31:31,606 --> 01:31:35,372
Hyah! Hyah!

1108
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:46,814
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1109
01:31:46,922 --> 01:31:49,322
Come on, boy!
Let me hear you yell!

1110
01:31:49,424 --> 01:31:52,222
- Yeah!
- Just livin' the dream, baby!

1111
01:31:52,327 --> 01:31:54,022
<i>I'm lovin'this!</i>

1112
01:31:57,566 --> 01:31:59,796
<i>Pull the stagecoach over now!</i>

1113
01:32:02,637 --> 01:32:06,198
<i>Can I make this turn up here?</i>

1114
01:32:06,308 --> 01:32:09,539
<i>I'll take that as a yes.</i>
<i>Hang on!</i>

1115
01:32:14,115 --> 01:32:17,710
I can't hold her!

1116
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:34,829
Come on, Tex. Let's finish this.
Hyah! Hyah! Come on!

1117
01:32:37,138 --> 01:32:40,403
Hyah! Hyah!

1118
01:32:40,509 --> 01:32:44,172
- Give me the tablet, Cecil!
- Can't do it, son!

1119
01:32:44,279 --> 01:32:47,271
Hyah!

1120
01:32:47,382 --> 01:32:49,111
Pull over!

1121
01:32:49,217 --> 01:32:52,414
It ain't gonna happen!
Moving on!

1122
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:55,888
Last chance, Cecil!
Stop the horses, or I will!

1123
01:32:55,991 --> 01:33:00,257
They can't be stopped, Larry.
Don't you know your history?

1124
01:33:00,362 --> 01:33:04,958
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

1125
01:33:05,066 --> 01:33:09,526
Really? You mean
a word like... Dakota!

1126
01:33:13,074 --> 01:33:16,043
Come on, Tex.

1127
01:33:20,148 --> 01:33:22,616
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

1128
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:26,949
Oh, and by the way, don't ever talk
to me like that in front of my son.

1129
01:33:29,024 --> 01:33:30,924
Moving on.

1130
01:33:33,428 --> 01:33:35,328
Hey, Huns.

1131
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:39,093
Tell Attila to have his boys take him back
to the museum, put him with the guards.

1132
01:33:42,137 --> 01:33:45,436
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1133
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,633
No, no, no, no.

1134
01:33:52,013 --> 01:33:54,243
<i>Makeekaka.</i>

1135
01:33:56,851 --> 01:33:58,648
<i>Makeekaka!</i>

1136
01:33:58,753 --> 01:34:00,914
Hey, w-wait. Hold the phone.

1137
01:34:01,022 --> 01:34:04,685
What does <i>"makeekaka"</i> mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

1138
01:34:06,561 --> 01:34:10,361
The year was 1909. I was going
up the Zambezi River in Africa...

1139
01:34:10,532 --> 01:34:13,626
and our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

1140
01:34:21,209 --> 01:34:23,109
Oh, there we are.

1141
01:34:25,981 --> 01:34:29,212
- Oh, boy.
<i>- What is it?</i>

1142
01:34:29,317 --> 01:34:32,150
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

1143
01:34:32,253 --> 01:34:33,982
<i> How?</i>

1144
01:34:36,524 --> 01:34:39,118
Ahkmenrah,
I'm gonna need your help.

1145
01:34:39,227 --> 01:34:42,526
This is your tablet. You know the instructions.
I need you to get everyone back.

1146
01:35:08,623 --> 01:35:11,353
Come on.

1147
01:35:11,459 --> 01:35:13,518
There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

1148
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:19,231
<i> What I'm saying is, for the type</i>
<i>of money that they pay A-Rod...</i>

1149
01:35:19,334 --> 01:35:22,599
he oughta be bringin' home
a Worid Series trophy every season.

1150
01:35:22,704 --> 01:35:26,231
Know what I mean?

1151
01:35:42,624 --> 01:35:45,855
Now who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1152
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,860
<i>- Inuit.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1153
01:35:47,962 --> 01:35:50,556
<i>- One terra-cotta soldier. Vikings.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

1154
01:35:50,665 --> 01:35:53,259
<i>- Alpaca. Llama.</i>
<i>- Welcome back, ladies.</i>

1155
01:35:53,368 --> 01:35:55,928
Hey, uh, Viking guys.

1156
01:35:56,037 --> 01:35:59,734
Do me a favor. Your fellows made some sort
of funeral pyre-type thing in Petrified Wood.

1157
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:02,401
Go clean that up, okay?
Thank you.

1158
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:04,842
He's back.

1159
01:36:04,946 --> 01:36:07,380
All right.
I'll deal with this joker.

1160
01:36:07,482 --> 01:36:09,609
Hey, hey, moose!
It's not gonna happen, buddy!

1161
01:36:09,718 --> 01:36:12,778
I told you three times. You can't come
through this door with those antlers.

1162
01:36:12,887 --> 01:36:15,617
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

1163
01:36:15,724 --> 01:36:18,488
<i>- Lawrence!</i>
- Hey, Teddy!

1164
01:36:18,593 --> 01:36:20,618
<i>Great to see you in one piece.</i>

1165
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:23,391
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

1166
01:36:23,498 --> 01:36:25,398
Larry?

1167
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:31,430
I told you I wasn't
making fun of you.

1168
01:36:31,539 --> 01:36:33,006
I know.

1169
01:36:33,108 --> 01:36:35,008
<i>Teddy?</i>

1170
01:36:36,344 --> 01:36:38,835
Oh, my God.

1171
01:36:40,281 --> 01:36:42,249
You wanna meet her?

1172
01:36:43,518 --> 01:36:45,418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1173
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,647
Come on. Excuse me.

1174
01:36:47,756 --> 01:36:49,815
President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

1175
01:36:49,924 --> 01:36:51,824
- An honor.
- Hi.

1176
01:36:51,926 --> 01:36:53,826
And this is "Sakagawaya."

1177
01:36:53,928 --> 01:36:55,054
- "Wee-ah."
- "Wee-ah."

1178
01:36:55,163 --> 01:36:57,063
"Wee-ah."

1179
01:36:57,165 --> 01:36:59,759
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

1180
01:37:01,269 --> 01:37:03,760
You rock! I am a big fan.

1181
01:37:04,873 --> 01:37:06,841
What would you like to know?

1182
01:37:06,941 --> 01:37:10,468
Um, well, I don't know
where to start, but, um—

1183
01:37:21,823 --> 01:37:25,088
- One Buddha<i>. Namaste.</i>
- Check.

1184
01:37:25,193 --> 01:37:28,356
Two zebras.

1185
01:37:28,463 --> 01:37:30,488
Uh, right. Check.

1186
01:37:30,598 --> 01:37:33,999
- Dexter! Welcome back.
<i>- Hey, Dex. So, look.</i>

1187
01:37:34,102 --> 01:37:36,730
No hard feelings, all right?

1188
01:37:36,838 --> 01:37:39,398
- Lawrence!
- You saw—You saw what he did just then!

1189
01:37:39,507 --> 01:37:41,407
- Who's evolved?
- I am.

1190
01:37:41,509 --> 01:37:44,342
- Who's evolved?
- I am!

1191
01:37:44,445 --> 01:37:47,073
Good.

1192
01:37:47,182 --> 01:37:50,640
<i> Well, they're all here.</i>
<i>Well done. Everyone's in.</i>

1193
01:37:50,752 --> 01:37:53,778
Yeah, well, not everyone.

1194
01:37:55,089 --> 01:37:58,183
We lost a couple of good
little men out there tonight.

1195
01:37:58,293 --> 01:38:01,854
With great victory
comes great sacrifice.

1196
01:38:03,798 --> 01:38:05,698
Yeah.

1197
01:38:08,336 --> 01:38:10,327
<i>Dad, look!</i>

1198
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:19,409
Bully!

1199
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,360
You ain't gettin' rid of us
that easy.

1200
01:39:01,456 --> 01:39:03,390
Until tomorrow
evening, Lawrence.

1201
01:39:03,491 --> 01:39:06,324
Yeah. I don't know
about that, Teddy.

1202
01:39:06,427 --> 01:39:09,362
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

1203
01:39:09,464 --> 01:39:13,628
<i>Well, if that's indeed the case,</i>
<i>then it's farewell, my friend.</i>

1204
01:39:15,536 --> 01:39:20,303
Nick? Your father's a great man.

1205
01:39:20,408 --> 01:39:22,638
I know.

1206
01:39:27,415 --> 01:39:29,076
I told you.

1207
01:39:33,087 --> 01:39:35,282
All right. Good night.

1208
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:38,359
No, Lawrence. Good day.

1209
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:45,392
Hey, Teddy?

1210
01:39:58,413 --> 01:40:00,313
Thanks.

1211
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:17,027
You're watching
New York 1. News all morning.

1212
01:40:17,131 --> 01:40:19,031
Thanks for joining us this morning.

1213
01:40:19,133 --> 01:40:21,363
There is a fresh blanket
of snow on the ground today...

1214
01:40:21,469 --> 01:40:23,460
but it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

1215
01:40:23,571 --> 01:40:27,871
It's what's <i>in</i> the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81 st Street.

1216
01:40:27,976 --> 01:40:30,467
<i>Here's the remarkable video.</i>

1217
01:40:30,578 --> 01:40:32,546
These appear to be
<i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> tracks...

1218
01:40:32,647 --> 01:40:35,081
and they lead straight to
the Museum of Natural History.

1219
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:39,586
<i> Authorities have found what</i>
<i>appear to be cave drawings in the subway.</i>

1220
01:40:39,687 --> 01:40:42,417
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.

1221
01:40:42,523 --> 01:40:44,388
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1222
01:40:44,492 --> 01:40:46,790
You be the judge.
But one thing's for sure.

1223
01:40:46,894 --> 01:40:50,193
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them—

1224
01:40:53,334 --> 01:40:55,734
Any explanation at all?

1225
01:40:58,773 --> 01:41:00,707
No. Got nothin'.

1226
01:41:00,808 --> 01:41:02,708
Good.

1227
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:05,608
I'll take your keys
and your flashlight.

1228
01:41:22,096 --> 01:41:25,190
<i>Folks, this way.</i>

1229
01:42:23,091 --> 01:42:27,084
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

1230
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:30,460
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1231
01:42:35,536 --> 01:42:37,663
Hey. How's it goin'?
Well, Nicky said it.

1232
01:42:37,772 --> 01:42:40,332
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1233
01:42:40,441 --> 01:42:43,706
Let me tell you something.
That's when history comes alive.

1234
01:42:45,313 --> 01:42:48,043
How many of you guys been over to the museum?

1235
01:43:08,769 --> 01:43:12,637
Goal!

1236
01:43:37,865 --> 01:43:41,699
Hey, it's gettin' late. You ready to go home?

1237
01:43:41,802 --> 01:43:44,828
Nope.

1238
01:43:49,677 --> 01:43:53,704
Let's ride.

1239
01:44:28,716 --> 01:44:32,277
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

1240
01:44:32,386 --> 01:44:35,321
We're night watchmen,
not janitors.

1241
01:44:35,423 --> 01:44:38,859
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.
I'm gonna catch a few Z's.

1242
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,860
You ain't goin' nowhere.

1243
01:44:40,962 --> 01:44:43,123
Start moppin', hot dog.

1244
01:44:47,902 --> 01:44:50,234
Over here.
