00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
25.000

2
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,874
Keep her straight...
level.

3
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,251
It's your first time up, so
don't do anything interesting.

4
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,336
- Who me?
- Yeah, you.

5
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,505
Remember, she stalls out
at about 100.

6
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,009
Keep the air speed up,
otherwise you'll be drifting all over.

7
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,888
- If the ailerons start to shimmy...
- I've flown a plane or two.

8
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,349
Not like this one.
This one's a handful.

9
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,603
You sneeze and you'll end up
upside down in a field.

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,566
- That's fresh paint, damn it!
- Do you want me to crash?

11
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,361
Gum ain't gonna keep
your butt in the air.

12
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,577
Treat her nice, Clifford. She's gonna
take us all the way to the nationals.

13
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,165
- Let's make some history.
- Yeah.

14
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:09,219
Crank her up, Goose!

15
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:15,809
- Make her hot!
- Hot and brakes.

16
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,801
Watch this, Peevy!

17
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,810
[Cheering]

18
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,816
National air race
is our next stop!

19
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:44,416
[Sirens]

20
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,965
[Gunshots]

21
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,929
You tryin' to save ammo?
Nail 'em!

22
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:00,140
I can't get a clean shot.
Wish that black-and-white
would get out of the way.

23
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:11,443
Careful what
you wish for.

24
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,310
[Engine Sputtering]

25
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:53,902
[Fitch] This is the 3rd car
in a month. Hoover'll be spittin' nails.

26
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,904
The heck with Hoover!

27
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,756
- Outta my way. I can't see.
- Keep drivin'!

28
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,599
Quit movin'. You're
ruining my shot!

29
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,018
Get back.
Get...

30
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:39,413
Let's go, Lenny.
We can't get caught with...

31
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:42,583
Lousy feds!

32
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,178
Somethin' ain't right.

33
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,770
- [Sirens]
- Sorry, Lenny.

34
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,620
He's gettin' away.

35
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,977
Get it off!

36
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,939
- Get him out!
- Peevy!

37
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,817
Hit the latch!
Hurry!

38
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,070
Get the hell
outta there!

39
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:55,447
Where you goin'?
Cliff!

40
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,244
You all right?
You okay?

41
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,879
Well... that's
the end of that!

42
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,801
- All right, get it outta here.
- [Peevy] Wait a minute.

43
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,595
You chase crooks
across our runway,

44
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,764
crash into my pilot,
and it's our fault?

45
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,184
No offence, pops, but we
got more important things...

46
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:26,770
- than get all sweaty
about whose fault it was.
- Listen, buddy,

47
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,815
building that plane took three years
and every cent we had.

48
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,192
File a claim with Uncle Sam.
You could get lucky.

49
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:36,613
And wait six months... a year?
We made a livin' with that plane.

50
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:39,658
Well maybe it's time
to get a real job.

51
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:45,789
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Relax! Relax!

52
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:47,916
You got that one
free, kid.

53
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,627
- One more and you'll be
eatin' soft food for a month!
- Yeah?

54
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:52,838
- Relax.
- That fly boy hangs one...

55
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,965
on my kisser and
you let him waltz?

56
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,302
Maybe you
had it comin'.

57
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:03,724
- We need a word with the patient.
- In private.

58
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,521
Your buddy's getting fitted
for a pine overcoat.

59
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:14,485
If you make it to County General,
Alcatraz is your new digs.

60
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,904
Spit it out, Wilmer.
Where's the package?

61
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:20,616
Blown to hell.

62
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:23,285
Why don't you
go look for it?

63
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,748
- Get him outta here.
- Hey, Fitch?

64
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,588
- Take a look at this.
- [Whistle]

65
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:38,926
[Wooly]
That must be the gizmo, all right.

66
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:41,053
Okay, button it up.

67
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:44,723
- Call 'im, Wooly.
- Why me? I called last time.

68
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:48,310
- But he likes you.
- [Sigh]

69
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,565
There's no mistake
about that, Wooly?

70
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,069
- [Wooly] I'm afraid not.
We got what's left of it.
- I see.

71
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,114
- It was damn sloppy.
- It could've been worse.
We got the gizmo.

72
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:04,451
- Yes, it could have.
- We'll take it down to headquarters.

73
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,621
Was that Wolinski?

74
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:11,458
They chased it to an
airstrip in the valley.

75
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,461
There was a wreck
on the runway.

76
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,339
The X-3 was destroyed.

77
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,800
Better lost than
in the wrong hands.

78
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:25,270
- How soon can you rebuild it?
- Rebuild it?

79
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:27,356
Not a chance.

80
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:31,151
My people in Washington will have
something to say about that.

81
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:35,489
Your people in Washington want to turn
anything that flies into a weapon.

82
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:37,616
Apparently someone else
had the same idea.

83
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:40,953
I'm afraid
we must insist.

84
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,414
I don't work
for the government.

85
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:46,875
I cooperate
at my discretion.

86
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,920
Two of my best pilots were
killed during the test phase.

87
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:53,507
God knows how many more men
would have died if it had flown.

88
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:57,261
No, gentlemen.

89
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,097
I'm sorry I ever dreamed
the damn thing up.

90
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:04,351
Sir, I wish
you'd reconsider.

91
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:07,187
What do we tell
the president?

92
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:11,817
Tell him
the dream is over.

93
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:15,988
Tell him
Howard Hughes said so.

94
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,409
[Peevy]
What's this 300 gallons here?

95
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,703
We don't burn that much fuel
in two years!

96
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:27,166
You burned it in two seconds when my
fuel truck went up. It's all itemized.

97
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,127
I didn't blow up your truck.
The guy in the car did.

98
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,337
After bouncing
off you.

99
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:35,007
Pilots are responsible
for a safe landing.

100
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:38,469
Where we gonna get this kind of dough?
We've gotta sell the Gee Bee for scrap!

101
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:42,139
I'm sorry. I hate to
kick you when you're down.

102
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:46,560
But business is business.
I'm out of pocket here.

103
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,272
Of course, I could always
use the old clown act.

104
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:53,108
We don't do the clown act
no more.

105
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,194
Peevy, it's worth
fifteen bucks a shot.

106
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:58,947
10 bucks a shot;
5 bucks goes toward your bill.

107
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:02,826
Think it over. See it my way
or see me in court.

108
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,746
The clown suit is
in the storeroom.

109
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:09,374
First show's at nine.
Don't be late.

110
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,129
Lousy nickel-nurser.

111
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:17,007
Clown act!

112
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:20,844
Good thinkin', Clifford!
You just set us back four years.

113
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,640
Plus which "Miss Mabel" here
is a flying coffin.

114
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:28,102
She never let us down before.
I'll go real easy on her.

115
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:32,815
Number five piston is shot,
nothing left but spit and wire.

116
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,733
I could fly a shoe box
if it had wings, Peev.

117
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,237
- Ouch!
- What's the matter?

118
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,739
There's somethin'
under this seat.

119
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:45,244
[Grunting]

120
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:48,330
That's my
duffel bag.

121
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:52,209
- What've you got in there?
- I don't know, but it's heavy.

122
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:55,629
- Peev, clean that table off.
- All right.

123
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,347
Open her up.

124
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,648
[Gasp]

125
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,777
Oh, my!
What've we got here?

126
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,779
Take the bag.

127
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:24,950
[Grunting]

128
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:30,289
- That's a piece of work, isn't it?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,750
What do you suppose it is,
a bomb or somethin'?

130
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,918
Too complex
to be a bomb.

131
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,796
I don't see
any moving parts.

132
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,132
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

133
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,660
- The housing's still cool.
- Huh.

134
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:12,998
[Sniffing]
Runs on alcohol.

135
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:15,542
What's the damn thing for?

136
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,337
- Hold it, Peev.
- Huh?

137
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,339
Hold it!

138
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,951
[Sawing]

139
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,789
[Cliff]
Tip her over. Tip her over.

140
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,791
- Easy, easy!
- I got it.

141
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,670
Watch it.
[Grunting]

142
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:03,389
What's goin' on, Sinclair?
Lenny is dead.

143
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,517
Wilmer's wrapped up like
a mummy in County General.

144
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,646
You didn't
play straight with me.

145
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:15,150
I'm sorry about your boys,
Eddie... truly.

146
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:19,863
- What went wrong?
- It's the feds that went wrong.

147
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,701
This was supposed to be
a simple snatch-and-grab.
What the hell is going on?

148
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,203
I didn't say
it'd be simple.

149
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:29,665
Snatch-and-grab is what
you're supposed to be good at.

150
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:32,251
That's what I pay you for.

151
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,378
Now where's the package?

152
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:36,463
Nothing's gonna happen
until you tell me...

153
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,216
why this merchandise is
so important to the feds.

- Let's get out of here, boys.
- It's a rocket.

156
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:55,190
A rocket?

157
00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:00,904
Yeah...
Like in the comic books.

158
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,994
- What happened to it?
- I don't know.

159
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,830
Wilmer knows. He's in
the hospital surrounded by cops.

He's gonna walk in with a smile
on his face and a handful of posies.

164
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,558
He's gonna charm

Who cares what
you had in mind?

168
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:42,529
You don't need
my services any more.

169
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,990
You can take it from here.
I'll tell you what.

170
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:48,160
You pay me what you owe me
'cause you're half lunatic.

Yes, shoot!

I want that rocket, Eddie, not
next week, not tomorrow... now.

We have a deal?

You bring me that rocket
and I'll double your price.

175

You'll triple my price.

cut you in half.

- Ha!

197
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:18,794
- You've gotta be outta your mind.
- I'm talkin' about making real money.

198
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:23,048
Not just 10 bucks a show but
enough to get us back on our

This thing is like strapping

- I don't want to keep it.

I just want to borrow it
for a while.

When you borrow something and don't
tell nobody, they call that stealing.

liked my reading the best.

No. He's too busy
killing someone.

- What?

The maiden voyage.
How'd she fly?

231
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:32,136
She flew great.
Landing had a few bumps.

Oh, Jen, you know

walking poodles in the park,
or doing any of...

Or getting shot down
behind enemy lines?

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,205
You said there were
a few bumps.

308
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,376
Boy, I'll say. She folded like a kite
when she hit the runway.

309
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:45,879
We thought Cliffie's number
was up, with the fire and all.

310
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,054
I was gonna tell ya.

311
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,392
I didn't want to ruin
your evening.

312
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:01,979
It's very thoughtful of you.
You'd rather make a fool of me?

313
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,566
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,861
I don't want you
to be sorry.

315
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:13,240
I want you to stop treating me
like... a stranger.

316
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,160
When something goes wrong,
I should be the first to know.

317
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:19,121
I shouldn't be
the last.

318
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:22,249
Everyone knows because
they were at the airfield.

319
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:26,587
I had an audition.

320
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:28,589
It was important to me.

321
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:30,925
I understand.

322
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,093
Just like the last time
when I flew the regionals.

323
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:36,639
You got a big part. You stood
behind Myrna Loy with a bowl of grapes.

324
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:42,770
Good night, Millie.
Thank you for the soup.

325
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:46,690
[Millie]
Well,

326
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:49,109
go after her,
you dope.

327
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,948
Jenny!

328
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,455
[Sigh]

329
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:04,416
Cliff,
I, uh...

330
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,004
- I'm sorry, I really stuck...
- Malcolm, it's okay.

331
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,507
It's not your fault.

332
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:34,571
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

333
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:37,700
Go ahead and stick that
welding torch in my ear.

334
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:41,078
We'll call it the end
of a perfect day.

335
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,959
What're you two
scrappin' about this time?

336
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,961
I don't know, Peev.

337
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:51,297
I just can't figure
this girl out.

338
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,341
She hangs around with
this Hollywood crowd all day,

339
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,136
talkin' about movie stars
and nightclubs...

340
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,471
That's her work. She don't care
about them phoney-baloneys.

341
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,473
She cares about you.

342
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:04,852
I want her to think
I'm makin' something of myself,

343
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,730
Not that I'm just
an out-of-work pilot.

344
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:10,149
You got a good thing
goin' with that girl.

345
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,234
If she flies the coop,
I'm tellin' you...

346
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,863
it's gonna be
your fault.

347
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,699
What do you know
about women, Peev?

348
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:22,953
You haven't had a date
since 1932.

349
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:25,748
Flora Maxwell.

350
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:30,169
There was no point
in datin' nobody after her.

351
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,853
[Rooster Crowing]

352
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,245
He's got to be kidding!

353
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,628
- [Grunting]
- Ha, ha, ha.

354
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:24,563
What? Kill me as I stand?
I thought you were a sporting man.

355
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:29,235
True. I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.

356
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,955
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

357
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:45,084
- Why wait?
- [Gasp]

358
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:47,836
Good heavens!
It's Sir Reginald!

359
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,881
None other!

360
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,060
Oh, my prince,

361
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,813
would that you'd drink
of my lips as deeply.

362
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:10,985
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Back to first positions.

363
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:18,075
Good lord! How many times
are we gonna have to do this?

364
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:22,121
Sweetheart, acting is acting
like you're not acting.

365
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:26,542
- So act... but don't act
like you're acting.
- All right.

366
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,924
Is she a block of wood!
Your audition was better.

367
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:38,137
Everybody's was better! Does it matter
when you're the producer's niece?

368
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:41,432
She gets a scene with Neville Sinclair
and we play scenery.

369
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:44,977
- I love Hollywood.
- Everybody, positions.

370
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,688
Let's try to get it
right this time.

371
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:51,150
"Laughing Bandit,"
scene 114, take 28.

372
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,694
[Director]
And... action!

373
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:56,697
[Sinclair]
Ha-ha-ha.

374
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,620
[Sir Alec] What?
Kill me as I stand?

375
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,705
I thought you were
a sporting man.

376
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,001
[Sinclair] I'd hate to stain my legend
on a villain such as you.

377
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:14,715
[Sir Alec]
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

378
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,719
- Why wait?
- It's Sir Reginald!

379
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:23,682
[Sinclair]
None other.

380
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:31,523
Oh, my prince, would that
you'd drink of my lips as deeply.

381
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,699
[Screaming]

382
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,252
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Jenny Blake.

383
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:54,588
Oh, Jenny...
Jenny Blake.

384
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:59,009
Does anyone know
a Jenny Blake?

385
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:00,636
Cut.

386
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,763
- I hope he's okay.
- Where's Mr Sinclair?

387
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:05,140
Give us a hand
with this flat.

388
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:10,020
- You okay, Mr Sinclair?
- I'm fine.

389
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:14,275
Never let it be said Neville Sinclair
failed to bring down the house.

390
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,237
Somebody call the nurse!
Charlie's been stabbed!

391
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,782
Charlie!

392
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,909
Charlie.

393
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:26,870
Forgive me, Charlie.
I had no idea.

394
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,915
Did you think I was
stealing the scene?

395
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,459
Don't talk.
Don't even move.

396
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:35,963
Get my car and driver.
Get him to The Queen of Angels.

397
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:39,091
Gladys, ride with him. I'll have
my personal physician meet you.

398
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:41,677
Victor, come here.

399
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:45,264
This is supposed to be
a closed set... no visitors!

400
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,934
I want that... Jenny
banned from the lot.

401
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:54,106
[Cliff]
Jenny, I said I'm sorry.

402
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:57,318
- I just want to patch things up.
- You're off to a great start.

403
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:01,071
Something really big has happened
and I want you to be the first to know.

404
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:03,616
Me and Peevy
found something...

405
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,951
that's gonna get us
back on our feet.

406
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:09,538
- What do you mean, found something?
- It's an engine...

407
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:12,082
[Cliff]
But you strap it to your back...

408
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,877
and it makes you fly
without wings.

409
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:19,006
[Jenny] You knocked down half
the castle to tell me about an engine?

410
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,592
You're always saying
you're the last to know.

411
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:24,793
Cliff, I meant
the important things.

412
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:27,646
- This is important.
- So is this acting job.

413
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,316
- Acting?
- Yes, acting.

414
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,068
Honey, you're walking
through the scenery.

415
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:35,404
That's not fair.
This is a good job.

416
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,615
The director thinks
I'm talented.

417
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,783
What's this?

418
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,286
Pay voucher. The director
wants you off the picture.

419
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:45,748
- You know this is a closed set.
- I have to go.

420
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,667
Come on. You know
what a closed set means?

421
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:03,557
Hey!

422
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:30,834
- Where's that girl I told you to fire?
- I fired her.

423
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:43,430
Hello.
I'm Neville Sinclair.

424
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:47,726
- You must be...
- Jenny Blake.

425
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:52,898
I... I'd hate
to think...

426
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:57,111
that I may have been... I'm responsible
for your having been dismissed.

427
00:36:57,236 --> 00:37:01,532
- Will you stay?
- But it's... really my fault.

428
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:06,704
Have you read for the part
of the Saxon princess?

429
00:37:06,787 --> 00:37:08,747
No.

430
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:12,042
I think you might be
wonderful in the role.

431
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:15,754
I'll see that you do. Perhaps
we could discuss it over dinner.

432
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,717
I've got a table at the South Seas Club
if you're not too bored with the club.

433
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:24,054
- I'd love to Mr...
- Neville.

434
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,390
- Neville.
- Tonight then.

435
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:31,437
[Director] Let's get all the
atmosphere over here.

436
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:39,737
Ladies in waiting?
We're waiting! Let's go.

437
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,574
[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

438
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:47,912
the Travelair Mystery Ship
has taken over the lead.

439
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:51,665
We have clocked him at
192 miles per hour.

440
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,085
Programmes!
Five cents!

441
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:58,214
- Here you are.
- Malcolm.

442
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:01,217
- I sold seven.
- Good. Here's more.

443
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,594
Programmes!
Programmes!

444
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:07,056
[Announcer] As you can see,
Miss Los Angeles is trailing badly.

445
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:09,099
She was down with some
mechanical problems...

446
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:13,270
- and she may be in trouble.
- Park it away from the runway.

447
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,898
- What's wrong with that kid?
I told him 9:00.
- He'll be here.

448
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,359
If he ain't in the air
in 5 minutes, find a new hangar.

449
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:22,029
[Announcer]
Howard in the Great Lakes Biplane...

450
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:25,533
is really pouring it on...
runnin' 3rd but movin'!

451
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:27,952
This could end up
in a three-way heat.

452
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:32,122
I know what Wilmer told Sinclair's goon,
but the rocket ain't in hangar three.

453
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:35,626
There's an old plane
but the only thing in it was this.

454
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:39,463
- That's it?
- We searched this place
from hell to breakfast.

455
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:42,841
I want you to start over.
Turn it inside out, upside down.

456
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,511
Keep your eyes open
for this dame.

457
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:48,973
She might be the one who knows
where this guy is who found our package.

458
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:51,308
Okay, Eddie.
Let's go.

459

[Announcer] To dazzle you
with an exhibition of skills...

460
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,868
is Cliff Secord, the Fearless Freep.
And there he goes!

461
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:22,673
That's not
the routine!

462
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:25,384
What the hell is
Secord trying to pull?

463
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:30,639
- I'm two minutes late.
Who'd you put up in Miss Mabel?
- Five cents!

464
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:35,067
- Get your programme!
- That's gotta be Malcolm.

465
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:38,988
Flag that biplane
down now!

466
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:45,327
He hasn't been behind the stick
in 25 years. What's he doin'?

467
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:49,748
Tryin' to save your job.
If he drifts into those race
lanes he's gonna kill somebody.

468

Oh, no.

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,011
The rocket's in
the tool chest?

471
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,597
Yeah, why?

472

[Announcer]
We have an emergency.

Please clear the field.

- Please clear...
- You outta your mind?

475
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,369
Ladies and gentlemen,
we had you fooled for a minute.

476
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,830
But it's all part
of the show.

477
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:39,298
Stay in your seats.

478
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:42,885
- What are you doin'?
- What's it look like? Give me a hand.

479
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,387
No, Cliff, no!
We haven't tested it enough.

480
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:49,391
- Look what she did to...
- Cut it out!
I'm scared enough as it is.

[Screaming]

482
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:57,525
I reworked the throttle, so just
squeeze her like a gas pedal.

483
00:40:57,608 --> 00:41:01,695
- If you want to stop,
mash down hard and let go.
- Okay.

484
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:04,657
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

485
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,619
A little luck.

486
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:16,460
- How do I look?
- Like a hood ornament.

487

[Screaming]

488
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,279
Look at that!

489
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:47,741

- I don't know what it is,
but I'm gettin' it.

It's me, Cliff.

Get up!
Get out of here.

I like it!

What in the hell
is the matter with you?

517
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:26,467
Are you trying
to kill yourself?

518
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:30,179
We don't know how long this thing
stays up, how much fuel's in her...

If you wanna look around
you gotta use your eyeballs.
This thing's got a rudder.

If you turn your head,
you change course. Hear what I'm sayin'?

You banged that up good. I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to fix that.

- They can't find out who we are.

gonna want it back...

Sorry, boys. It's a trade secret...
all part of the mystery.

- That stinks.

Next time you go after one of my men,
I'll kill you.

612
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:21,539
Don't threaten me.
Just do your job.

613
00:53:21,622 --> 00:53:24,875
Hey, Sinclair,
if the feds get me...

614
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:28,838
I'm takin' you with me.
I'm gonna tell 'em everything.

615
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:31,173
Who do you think
they'd believe?

616
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:35,094
A cheap crook or the number 3
box-office star in America?

617
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,763
Number 3 jerk!

618
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:47,606
[Radio Announcer] The helmeted mystery
man disappeared into the hills...

619
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:51,527
moments after the rescue
and has not identified himself.

620
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,072
But air circus owner, Otis Bigelow,
promises his bird man will return.

621
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:58,617
Los Angeles is buzzing.
Who is the Rocketeer?

622
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:02,079
Now, back to our programme
of dance band favourites.

623
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,795
Okay.
Here's the plan.

624
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,049
We call the FBI...
get rid of this thing.

625
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:15,259
The FBI's gonna
lock us up.

626
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:18,512
They think we were shooting
at them. What do you think
was going on at the house?

627
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:22,975
House? We don't got a house.
We got a gazebo.

628
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,228
Between the FBI and
that King Kong gentleman,

629
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:29,065
we're gonna get ourselves
killed over this thing.

[Knocking]
Peevy?

631
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,570
Open up.

632
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:39,533
We just come from the airfield.
It's Bigelow.

633
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:42,495
- What about him?
- His office is crawling with cops.

634
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,331
Somebody tore up his place
like they were looking for something.

635
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,958
- Yeah, so?
- They killed him.

636
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:52,296
[Millie] Cliff,
what's going on?

637
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:54,298
I'll make the call.

638
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:29,825
[Telephone] FBI, Los Angeles.
Agent Morris speaking.

639
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,410
Hello?

640
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:35,705
- I'll be home soon, honey.
- Who is this?

641
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:38,583
- I love you too.
- Okay, wise guy.

642
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:45,966
What can I do
for you gents?

643
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:50,929
Madam, we're looking for a pilot
by the name of Cliff Secord.

644
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:54,349
Does anybody here
know him?

645
00:55:54,474 --> 00:55:56,810
Haven't seen him
around.

646
00:55:56,935 --> 00:56:00,313
We need a flier
for a real special job.

647
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:02,482
There's a lot of lettuce
in this.

648
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:07,279
What do you say...
we lay out a finder's fee?

649
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:09,698
How 'bout it, dad?

650
00:56:09,823 --> 00:56:11,992
Secord!
Oh, yeah, I know him.

651
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:14,327
Short fella,
gimpy leg.

652
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:16,580
Didn't he move
to Cincinnati?

653
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:19,708
Cincinnati.

654
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,131
How 'bout you, bub?
You know this Secord?

655
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:29,759
If you boys aren't ordering,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

656
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,345
We'll order!
Let's see.

657
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:37,350
How 'bout those pies?
They look good, huh, boys?

658
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:41,062
Mmm! Betcha
they're home-made.

659
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:47,736
Don't interrupt
his meal.

660
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:50,530
Yeah, I like coffee
with my pie.

661
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:53,825
You know, it's funny.

662
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,369
I don't like music
while I'm digesting.

663
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:04,044
Listen, friend,
we don't know where he is.

664
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:07,631
Okay, pop, maybe we
can refresh your memory.

665
00:57:10,008 --> 00:57:13,159
Come on.
Follow me.

666
00:57:16,078 --> 00:57:18,080
Take a good look...

667
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:20,458
'cause you're next.

668
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:24,879
- Talk, dad, or get a facial.
- Drop dead, you weasel.

669
00:57:24,962 --> 00:57:28,633
- I don't know where the hell he is.
- Yeah?

670
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:31,093
[Millie]
Leave him alone!

671
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:33,721
- Naughty boy.
- [Groaning]

672
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:37,475
Please leave him alone.
Stop!

Startin' to smoke, old timer.

Lookie here, boys.

00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:55,159
Lady Luck...

677
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:58,287
left her phone number.

[Dialling]

679
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:03,000
- [Phone Ringing]
- Mine!

680
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:06,295
- Hello?
- Hello.

681
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,965
This is the florist.

682
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,592
I've got a lovely bouquet
of flowers for Jenny.

683
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:13,928
Who sent her flowers?

684
00:58:14,011 --> 00:58:16,264
Cliff Secord.

685
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:18,891
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

686
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:20,893
Well, he's too late.

687
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:24,480
She's gone to the South Seas
Club with Mr Neville Sinclair.

688
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:28,484
Hello?

689
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:30,319
Hello?

690
00:58:30,444 --> 00:58:32,321
Come here.

691
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:39,579
- You're not gonna believe this.
Guess where the dish went.
- Where?

692
00:58:39,662 --> 00:58:42,206
With the limey to
the South Seas Club.

693
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:45,334
[Rusty] Do you think fancy-pants
is pullin' a fast one on Eddie?

694
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,588
I don't know,
but I don't like this.

695
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:51,799
Jeff, you and Mikey stay and
watch who walks into this joint.

696
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,218
- Boys, been a pleasure.
- I'll call from the club.

697
00:58:54,343 --> 00:58:57,138
[Jeff] All right, Johnny.
We'll take care of it.

698
00:58:57,263 --> 00:58:59,682
Everybody,

699
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:03,811
relax and take it easy.
We're gonna be here a while.

700
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:07,231
Mom, how 'bout
a fresh pot of coffee?

701
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:13,321
Swell outfit, dad.

702
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:21,329
Hey!

703
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:23,414
Here's Mr Ketchup Bottle!

704
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,881
Hey, that's quite
a dish you got there.

705
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:34,967
Wait a minute.
That's Lady Luck!

[Cliff]
Get the gun!

707
00:59:37,386 --> 00:59:39,680
[Peevy]
I got it.

708
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:47,897
I'm sorry about all this.
I'll fix everything.

709
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:51,776
[Peevy] Clifford,
what's the deal? Are you nuts?

710
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:55,947
Cliff, no!
Not again.

711
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:58,783
Peevy, half the city
is looking for us.

712
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:02,286
- I can fly to that nightclub
in five minutes.
- Take a cab.

713
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,957
The only place this is going is back
to the feds. We had an agreement!

714
01:00:06,082 --> 01:00:09,085
Look!
Peev, I'm sorry.

715
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,171
I should've listened to you,
but Jenny's in trouble.

716
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:15,216
That girl means more
to me than...

717
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,718
I love her, Peev.

718
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:21,681
- Does she know that?
- She's gonna find out.

719
01:00:21,764 --> 01:00:24,767
Promise me when she's safe
this thing goes back!

720
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:28,354
You got my word.
I'm sorry I laid eyes on this.

721
01:00:29,689 --> 01:00:31,899
You might want this.

722
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:34,735
I'll meet you
back here.

723
01:00:34,819 --> 01:00:37,905
Hold it, you're leaking
like a sieve.

724
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:41,659
If you'd hit that button,
we'd be all over the map.

725
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:43,744
- Can you fix it?
- If I had a couple of hours.

726
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:48,291
We don't have a couple of minutes!
We need something quick.

727
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,628
Let's see if our luck's
still holdin'.

728
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:54,422
Go on!

729
01:00:54,505 --> 01:00:58,050
- Peevy, stand clear.
- What was that?

730
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:10,563
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

731
01:01:12,023 --> 01:01:13,941
It's so elegant.

732
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:17,862
You make it so.
Here's to you...

733
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:23,474
and to the extraordinary way
your face catches the light.

734
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:34,443
You must let me have
this dance.

735
01:01:34,526 --> 01:01:37,112
There's no music.

736
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:39,573
Really?

737
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:45,871
I hear music.

738
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:58,133
That's Neville Sinclair.

739
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:22,825
One day, Jenny,

740
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,245
a man will look into
those eyes and he'll drown...

741
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,456
and never be saved.

Hey.

01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:35,290
- Is it something I said?
- No, it's nothing.

01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:38,585
Oh, Jenny, I know
that look all too well.

01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:42,422
- Is it your boyfriend?
- I'm sorry, Neville.

751
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:45,926
It's just that Cliff and I
talked about coming here.

752
01:04:46,009 --> 01:04:49,263
Tell me about him.

753
01:04:49,346 --> 01:04:52,891
At least give me a chance
to know the competition.

754
01:04:52,975 --> 01:04:54,893
Well...

755
01:04:54,977 --> 01:04:57,813
he's a little rough
around the edges.

756
01:04:57,938 --> 01:05:00,107
He can be thoughtless
sometimes.

757
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:04,236
And then he can be the
sweetest guy in the world.

758
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:08,115
He gave me these little
oranges when we first met.

759
01:05:08,198 --> 01:05:11,160
- How nice.
- My family has a small farm.

760
01:05:11,285 --> 01:05:15,539
- Cliff was coming through,
dusting the groves.
- He's a flier?

761
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:18,375
Yeah. He flies
racing planes like this one.

762
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,878
At least he did
until yesterday.

763
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:23,464
- He was almost killed.
- What happened?

764
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:28,385
We didn't order anything.
Go on.

765
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:32,287
[Cliff] Yes, sir.
A fan of yours sent some soup over.

766
01:05:32,412 --> 01:05:35,331
You were saying?

767
01:05:35,457 --> 01:05:37,500
It was very silly.

768
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,919
He completely
missed the runway.

769
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:43,089
I don't know why the
real pilots let him fly.

770
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:46,634
I see. At least I'm feeling
better about the competition.

771
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:52,307
Have you
worked here long?

772
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:56,811
Oh, yes.
I waited on you last time.

773
01:05:56,895 --> 01:05:59,606
So... um...

774
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:06,070
where is he now?

775
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:09,824
He's probably hatching
some harebrained scheme.

776
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:12,786
Now he has an engine.
You strap it on...

777
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,788
I'm sorry.

778
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,706
- You idiot!
- How clumsy of me.

779
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:20,376
Go and get something
to clean this up.

780
01:06:20,502 --> 01:06:25,048
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- Will you just excuse me for a minute?

781
01:06:25,173 --> 01:06:28,551
- Please stay. Sit down.
- I'll be right back.

782
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:39,395
[Gasp]

783
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:42,065
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?

784
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,818
- Listen to me.
- You're jealous.

785
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:48,446
I'm not jealous!
Jenny, Bigelow's been murdered.

786
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,406
Murdered?

787
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:52,575
Remember the rocket
we found?

788
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,703
The people that are looking for it
murdered Bigelow to get to me.

789
01:06:55,787 --> 01:07:00,208
Now they're after you. They have
your picture, the one from the Gee Bee.

790
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:04,796
Jenny, prepare yourself
for a shock.

791
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,382
I'm the Rocketeer.

792
01:07:07,507 --> 01:07:11,511
- The rocka-who?
- For cryin' out loud!
Haven't you read the papers?

793
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:15,223
- No, I've been working.
- It's them!

794
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:17,392
The guys
with the snapshot.

795
01:07:17,475 --> 01:07:19,686
You gotta get out
of here.

796
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,397
Get in a cab,
go to your mom's in Redlands...

797
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:25,024
and stay there
until you hear from me.

798
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:29,195
Give me one good reason
why I should believe this?

799
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:34,909
If anything ever happened
to you, I'd go out of my mind.

800
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:38,580
Oh.

801
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:07,609
Go on, get out of here.
And don't let them see you.

802
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:32,175
Thank you.

803
01:08:42,227 --> 01:08:45,146
Taxi!

804
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:58,701
That's him.
Now go get him!

805
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:00,870
Cutting in.

806
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:06,668
Thank you!

807
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:32,360
[Rusty]
He's in the laundry room.

808
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,198
[Growling]

809
01:09:37,282 --> 01:09:40,349
Hit it!

810
01:09:45,354 --> 01:09:47,690
The laundry chute!
Get him! Get him!

811
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,711
- It's the flying man.
- It's the Rocketeer.

812
01:10:22,266 --> 01:10:25,394
[Screaming]

813
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:37,114
- Lock the doors.
We'll trap him like a fly.
- Right.

814
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:15,611
He's heading
for the door.

815
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:28,040
[Growling]

816
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:42,805
Get the rocket!

817
01:12:07,913 --> 01:12:09,707
[Gasp]

818
01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:13,627
Don't go, Jenny.
Our evening's just begun.

819
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:12,936
Welcome
to my home.

820
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,316
Here.

821
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,079
It's the chloroform.

822
01:14:31,163 --> 01:14:34,833
The effects will pass
in a moment.

823
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,881
Do you have to drug all
your women to seduce them?

824
01:14:41,006 --> 01:14:45,052
You're part of this.
You kidnapped me.

825
01:14:45,177 --> 01:14:50,474
Against my will, believe me.
I'm as much a victim as you.

826
01:14:50,557 --> 01:14:55,604
They're blackmailing me.
These are ruthless men.

827
01:14:55,687 --> 01:14:57,773
Neville, I'm scared.

828
01:14:57,856 --> 01:15:01,985
Oh, there, there.
Don't be frightened.

829
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:06,656
Tonight
when we danced,

830
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:10,702
I felt something
move inside me.

831
01:15:10,827 --> 01:15:13,705
I felt it tear loose
and take flight.

832
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,875
You said that
to Greta Garbo...

833
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,336
in "Napoleon's Mistress."

834
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:23,882
You'd have been a fantastic
Lady Catharine.

835
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:29,096
If you'd put yourself...
completely into my hands,

836
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:34,017
I could teach you, mould you
into a leading lady;

837
01:15:34,101 --> 01:15:38,188
clay... in the hands
of the master sculptor.

838
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:41,691
"Moonlight on Broadway."
Carole Lombard.

839
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:44,820
The scene on the top
of the Empire State Building.

840
01:15:44,903 --> 01:15:47,489
Yes.

841
01:15:47,572 --> 01:15:51,410
You can't be comfortable
in that gown.

842
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,809
They're beautiful.

843
01:16:30,615 --> 01:16:33,410
What am I doing?

844
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:36,163
You kidnapped me.

845
01:16:36,288 --> 01:16:38,582
I'm so confused.

846
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,251
I don't know
what to think.

847
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:46,089
Do you want me
to try this on?

848
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:48,925
Desperately.

849
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:01,104
Neville?

850
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:03,815
Could you come in here,
please?

851
01:17:07,778 --> 01:17:10,655
Can you help me?

852
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:29,758
I finally played a scene
with Neville Sinclair.

853
01:18:55,742 --> 01:18:58,828
Hello? Hello!
Can anyone hear me?

854
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:01,748
This is an emergency.
Can you hear me?

855
01:19:01,873 --> 01:19:05,376
[Radio] Sinclair?
Sind sie das?

856
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:09,672
Warum rufen sie an?

857
01:19:09,756 --> 01:19:12,967
My God!

858
01:19:13,092 --> 01:19:16,471
Neville Sinclair is a...
[Gasp]

859
01:19:20,141 --> 01:19:22,185
A what?

860
01:19:22,268 --> 01:19:24,562
Spy?

861
01:19:24,645 --> 01:19:27,440
Saboteur?

862
01:19:27,565 --> 01:19:30,443
A fascist?

863
01:19:30,568 --> 01:19:33,112
All of the above.

864
01:19:33,237 --> 01:19:36,240
Lothar.

865
01:19:37,116 --> 01:19:39,452
[Wicked Laugh]

866
01:19:41,704 --> 01:19:43,623
[Scream]

867
01:20:04,143 --> 01:20:06,062
[Whispering]
Millie?

868
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,948
Peevy!

869
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,285
Hey, Peev?

870
01:20:21,411 --> 01:20:23,204
[Patsy]
Hey, Cliff!

871
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,248
Aaah!

872
01:20:26,332 --> 01:20:27,959
Are you okay?

873
01:20:28,084 --> 01:20:33,297
- Patsy, you scared the livin'...
heck outta me.
- Sorry.

874
01:20:33,423 --> 01:20:35,425
[Telephone Ringing]

875
01:20:39,262 --> 01:20:42,056
- Peev?
- Wrong. This Secord?

876
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:46,269
- Wanna talk to your girlfriend?
- She's safe out of town.

877
01:20:46,394 --> 01:20:48,563
- Cliff?
- Jenny, where are you?

878
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:51,566
That's enough. Just to let
you know we're serious.

879
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:54,110
You wanna see your girlfriend,
bring us the rocket.

880
01:20:54,235 --> 01:20:57,655
Write this down. Griffith Observatory,
4 a.m., by the statues.

881
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,075
Come alone or we're gonna
have to kill the girl.

882
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,252
[Patsy]
What's happening?

883
01:21:11,335 --> 01:21:13,421
- What are they doing to Jenny?
- Quiet!

884
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:16,257
I gotta think.

885
01:21:19,302 --> 01:21:21,471
Patsy, I'm sorry.

886
01:21:21,596 --> 01:21:24,015
I didn't mean
to yell at ya.

887
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:27,602
Remember the guy
who saved Malcolm today?

888
01:21:27,685 --> 01:21:32,023
- The Rocketeer?
- He's gonna help me find Jenny.

889
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:34,734
Freeze!
FBI.

890
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:40,698
[Chuckle]

891
01:21:40,823 --> 01:21:43,201
Remember me?

892
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:50,666
[Peevy]
All I did was bypass the pressure valve
and that solved your throttle problem.

893
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:54,837
But adding a rudder to the helmet...
that was ingenious.

894
01:21:54,962 --> 01:21:58,383
Nothin' to it, Howard.
Just basic aviation.

895
01:21:58,508 --> 01:22:01,010
[Wooly] We're gonna make
your life miserable.

896
01:22:01,135 --> 01:22:03,221
Good to see you, son.

897
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:06,474
- You too, pal.
- This is all he had on him.

898
01:22:06,557 --> 01:22:09,310
There's no sign
of the rocket.

899
01:22:09,394 --> 01:22:12,461
He must've ditched it,
but he ain't talkin'.

900
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:19,843
Wooly, take off
the handcuffs.

901
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:27,685
- You know who I am?
- What pilot doesn't, Mr Hughes?

902
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,979
I designed the Cirrus X-3,
the rocket pack.

903
01:22:31,063 --> 01:22:33,524
It was stolen
from my factory.

904
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:36,527
I didn't take it.

905
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:40,656
I told him everything and he
believed it. Give the man his rocket.

906
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:44,660
- I can't. Not yet.
- We agreed to give it back...

907
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:47,413
to its rightful owner.
That's him.

908
01:22:47,538 --> 01:22:50,207
[Hughes] I don't think
you know the game you're playing.

909
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:52,543
Go ahead, roll it.

910
01:22:57,423 --> 01:23:01,719
The German prototype had
the same problem as our first design.

911
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:05,472
The combustion chamber
would overheat and explode.

912
01:23:05,597 --> 01:23:07,516
My boys figured it out:

913
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:11,061
A double-walled chamber
into which the fuel is pumped,

914
01:23:11,145 --> 01:23:13,439
cool the chamber and preheat
the fuel at the same time.

915
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:16,066
The German experiment
didn't seem...

916
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,569
like much
to worry about.

917
01:23:18,652 --> 01:23:21,447
But when we got our hands
on this next film,

918
01:23:21,572 --> 01:23:23,657
we realized the scope
of their plan.

919
01:23:23,782 --> 01:23:27,619
Keep watching, kid.
It cost a man's life...

920
01:23:27,745 --> 01:23:30,289
to get this
out of Germany.

921
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:28,472
Where's my rocket pack,
Secord?

922
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:31,767
You gotta let me use it
one more time.

I'm tired of

espionage, and that's my short list.

swap Jenny for the rocket.

Cheer up, Eddie. You're about to
make yourself a fortune.
