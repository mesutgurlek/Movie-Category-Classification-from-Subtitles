some of your information
about bombs is coming from cartoons.

93

00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,048
was there a duck who,
when the explosion is happens,

100

his bill goes
around to the back of his head,

101

he has to put it back this way?

00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,217
You know, he's got like
an artist inside himself,

323
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,055
but he's in this working class place
and no one understands him.

324
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,141
He's just like.“ (GRUNTS)
I'm gonna express myself in my dance.

325
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,650
And he expresses himself...

326
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,772
And he doesn't wanna use violence,
but he puts his violence into his dance.

327
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,155
You should try that.

328
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,660
Okay. So, we gotta get down
to business. Enough chit-chat.

329
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,237
I'm being paid to kill you.

330
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,038
But I'm gonna torture you for free.

331
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,165
Are you serious?

332
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,584
Where'd you get those relics?

333
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,257
From the Shah of Iran's garage sale?

334
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,667
Yeah, right.

335
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,172
I mean, I know there's
nothing more annoying

336
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,754
than a backseat torturer,
but, please, come on.

337
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,430
This is great stuff.

338
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,930
It's not great stuff.
That's like 1972, hello.

339
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,181
You won't be talking so much smack
with this up your butt.

340
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,859
That's the Anal Umbrella.
It's a good device, I grant you,

341
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,857
but where's the splash guard?

342
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,904
You're going to kill me
and your white shirt.

343
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,948
It didn't come with a splash guard.

344
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,025
You're gonna get chara on your trousers.

345
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,202
I can see it has a screw hole for one.

346
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,700
Apparently, I didn't get it.

347
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,081
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

348
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,376
check out this bad boy.

Oh, that's not bad.
The Kandahar Cock Wrench.

350
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,372
Okay, so, now we're getting somewhere.

351
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,299
It's actually been banned
in Saudi Arabia for being too safe.

352
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,795
You know, (SIGHS)
this is totally depressing.

353
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,463
Listen, just show me another one.

354
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,299
You know, honestly, I don't even want
to show you anything anymore'

355
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,305
Don't be like that.

356
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,811
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tortured.

357
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,230
I don't want to be tortured.

358
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,557
You're just, like,
taking all the fun out of it!

359
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,812
You just want me to say
compliments all the time.

360
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,819
So either you want the truth
or you want compliments. Decide!

361
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,399
It'd be nice if I got just a little bit
of positive feedback about my tools.

362
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,366
What else you got'?
I'm gonna love the next thing!

363
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,568
I will be supportive.

All right.

365
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,039
Just this. This pours hot fire out on you.

Oh, the Fallujah Firehose!

367
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,035
Someone's got a friend in Syria!

368
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,586
I am pretty proud of it.

369

There is a new model, you know.

Yo! Average American shopper!

I do not have any money on me,

387
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,192
but if you give me your clothes

388

I'll make a sizeable donation
in your name to al-Qaeda.

Hello. I am Admiral General Aladeen

392
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,589
I am here to deliver my speech
to the United Nations.

Look, Admiral, it's too hot for crazy.

He's not the legitimate leader!

TAMIR: You have rehearsed the speech
I prepared for you?

00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,579
Yes. But when is
the General coming'?

404
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,000
He's feeling ill.

405
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,340
Does he have worms in his shilshul?

406
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,587
Very possibly.

407
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,670
Admiral General Aladeen preparing

00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,847
to address the General Assembly
of the United Nations.

00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,923
An historic moment.

410
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,679
He's approaching the podium.

411
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,261
And he's walked right past the podium.

412
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,474
What is he doing?

413
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,847
You are making a fool out of me!

414
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,183
Let's bring in Denise,
our U.N. correspondent.

415

What do you make of that?

416
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,191
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention.

417
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,693
Every eye in the room
is on him right now.

418
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,196
MIKE: And he's returning to the podium.

419
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,861
And he's fallen off the stage.

420
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,618
What do you make of that, Denise?

421
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,539
You know, he's clearly implying
that the U.N. must fall before him.

422
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,455
MIKE: Drinking from
the pitcher of water directly,

423
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,086
as opposed to
the glass that I'm sure must be up there.

424
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,212
What do you think that means?

425
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,339
DENISE: Again,
it's another attempt to say,

426
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,637
"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules. "

427
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,385
And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.

428
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,100
MIKE: I believe he just urinated
in the pitcher.

He is now drinking his urine.

431
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,477
DENISE: It looks to be his own urine.

432
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,266
Sorry. You want?

on the Israeli delegation.

That might be the ambassador.

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,945
He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.

436
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,443
Oh, that's a good one.

437
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,120
Okay, he's returning to the podium.

438
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:54,039
Much has been made
of the hostility between our countries.

to sell Wadiya's oil rights. Gazprom,

Are you a homosexual?

481

No, no, no, it's more
of a power trip with me.

486

487

Oh.

499
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,124
Allison, could you please
take your hands off my breasts?

500
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,546
Those are breasts?
I thought you were a boy.

501

- To Brooklyn!

502

So, yeah, this is my store!

This is the Free Earth Collective.

511
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,834
in the lesbian bathroom, right there.

512
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,131
Right.

513
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,631
So, Allison,
we're the only store in New York,

514
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,929
other than that fascist
superchain Green World,

515
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,006
that sells your nation's
specialty fruit, mafroom,

516
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,559
which I know you people eat a lot of.

517
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,682
Oh, I hope that didn't come off
like a cultural stereotype.

518
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,230
Because I'm, like,
the furthest thing from a racist.

519
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,187
I pretty much haven't had
a white boyfriend since high school.

520
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,231
Well, the darker races are less choosy.

521
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,855
Okay, that came off as kind of offensive.

522
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,448
Thank you.

523
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,698
Anyway, let me give you the grand tour.

524
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,621
Up on the roof,
we have this amazing organic garden...

525
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,450
Boring! Do you sell any assault rifles?

526
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,540
Oh, wait. I got it. Humor. Right?

527
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,289
I took a feminist clown workshop once.

528
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,586
Help! Help!
I'm trapped under a glass ceiling!

I wasn't the best student, but...

531
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,385
We've got this wellness center
downstairs in the basement,

532
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,760
where we do water birth.
Have you ever seen a water birth?

533
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,395
Not a water birth,
but I've seen a water death.

534
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,139
Wow, Was it moving?

535
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,190
There was actually very little movement.

536
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,311
A little wriggling, then two bubbles,
and then a big bloop

537
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,694
and the wallet floats up.

538
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,569
You seem educated.

539
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,442
Yes. I went to Amherst.

540
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,781
I love it when women go to school.

541
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,864
It's like seeing a monkey on rollerskates.

542

It means nothing to them,
but it's so adorable for us.

543
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,624
Okay. Well, hey, Allison,

544
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,957

work here if you ever wanted to.

I am interested. We are interested.

640
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,772
Emploice.

641
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,434
Emploice what?

642
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,194
Emploice.,.Muswashans.

643
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,274
That is a made-up name.

644
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,488
- Uh-uh.
- Mmm-hmm.

645
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,693
Okay.

646
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,905
What is your real name?

647
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,868
Max.

648
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,241
Max what?

649
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,204
Imumoccupancyu
One-hundred-and-twenty.

650
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,501
- There's a number in the name?
- Mmm.

651
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,211
Who are you?
An Aladeen sympathizer?

652
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,673
No, no, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay. No, no, no!

653
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,257
- (KNIFE SHARPENING)
- No!

654
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,763
It's Aladeen!
It's Aladeen without the beard!

655
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,887
No! It's not Aladeen!

656
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,809
Hasan, Rock the door!

657
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,360
Wait, wait, wait, no!
There you are, cousin!

658
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,155
This is my cousin.
I see you've all met him.

659
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,154
He's very simple and backwards.
I'm sorry,

660
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,359
- Sorry.
- WAITER: It's okay, sit.

661
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,786
- Okay.
- Sit and eat.

662
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,616
Have a seat, cousin.

663
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,616
WAITER: Very sorry.
My apologies. Enjoy.

664
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,919
What are you doing here?
And what has happened to your beard?

665
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,543
I've been replaced by this
body double who's a total imbecile.

666
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,291
How are you alive?

667
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,132
How am I... Wait. You don't know'?

668
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,336
No.

669
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,799
Every single person
you had executed is still alive.

670
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,217
We all live here in Little Wadiya.

671
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,770
The executioner, he is
a member of the Resistance!

672
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,354
You mean I never executed anybody?

673
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,477
No.

674
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,558
Like, honestly, zero people.

675
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,642
(SIGHS)

676
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,398
Nadal, you must help me
get back into power.

677
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,324
What? No. Why would I do that?

678
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,777
I have a perfectly good job here.
I'm a Mac Genius!

679
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,446
Oh. What do you do?

680
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,956
Mostly, I clean semen out of laptops.

681
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,205
Congratulations.
Living the American dream.

682
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,421
Okay, fine. I will help you.
On one condition.

683
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,752
Name it.

684
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,461
You reinstate me
as Head of Nuclear Research,

685
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,839
so I can finish building my bomb.

686
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,215
Deal.

687
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,551
- Oh, one last thing.
- Mmm?

688
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,436
You will let me build
a round nuclear weapon.

689
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,018
Never. It must be pointy.

690
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,684
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Whoa.

691
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,487
Okay, compromise. Conical.

692
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,314
- Round. Round.
- Teat-shaped.

693
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,650
Okay.

694
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,285
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

695
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,456
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

696
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,752
our Supreme Leader
is indisposed to answer your questions

697
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,756
as he is currently
drafting Wadiya's new constitution,

698
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,087
which is scheduled to be signed

699
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,261
at the Lancaster Penthouse Ballroom
in three days.

700
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,009
Thank you. No further questions.

701
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,601
(CROWD CHEERING)

702
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,484
There is no way we're going to
get anywhere near this hotel

703
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,941
without a security pass.
This is ridiculous.

704
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,364
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

705
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,611
Hiding from that lesbian hobbit.

706
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,204
That woman, you know her?

707
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,415
I cannot begin to tell you
what an honor it is

708
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,367
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

709
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,747
Well, of course.

710
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,124
And the mafroom for this signing.

711
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,876
You just paid this month's rent!

712
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,003
ALADEEN: She offered me a job.

713
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,835
Can you imagine that? Me? Working?

714
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,381
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the only
thing that'll get you past security.

715
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,430
Okay, thanks.

716
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,974
Wait a minute.

717
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,180
Wait, her company is catering the event.
She has a security pass!

718
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,560
That is the answer. This is the plan.

719
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,142
Okay? You will take that job
and you will work for her.

720
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,319
I will get you
an identical beard and costume.

721
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,817
And then on the day of the event,

722
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,992
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff.

723
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,068
You will find the double, switch with him

724
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,621
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

725
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,291
Me? Work for that hairy titted yeti?

726
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,389
Kimberly?

727
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,219
Zoey.

728
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,520
WHO cares?

729
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,520
I've come here to apologize

730
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,191
about some of the comments
I may have made about

731
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,321
Captain Hook and Blackie.

732
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,274
Great!

733
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,903
And I accept your job offer
as general manager.

734
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,033
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

735
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,489
Well, I can if I killed you.

736
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:52,037
(BOTH LAUGHING)

737
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,243
I think I'm starting to get you.

738
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,455
All right, then... I will get you.

739
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,045
Great! Let's get you to work!

740
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,133
Yeah? Hold on one second.

741
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,004
Hey, my man! Excuse me. Hairnet!

742
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,129
Yeah.

743
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,141
I need a little of
the quinoa salad, please,

744
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,140
and throw a couple of
extra cranny-b's on top, if you could,

745
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,143
and I kind of need you to hurry up, chief.
Chop-chop.

746
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Next!

747
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,151
Whoa, whoa! Occupied!

748
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,528
Out. I have to clean.
Come on, out you go, out you go.

749
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,904
- What? You're hurting me!
- Out. Come on.

750
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,404
Hey, Allison,
can you take out the garbage? Thanks.

751
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,498
Look! One of the customers left a tip of

752
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,006
some Nair and some female razors.
Does anybody want to use it'?

753
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,092
Stop that.

754
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,390
Suck it, loser.

755
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,731
Clean-up on aisle four!

756
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,042
Hey, buddy, I saw that.

757
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,461
That is very disrespectful to your leader.

758
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,753
Whatever, dude. Who are you,

759
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,298
Osama bin Laden's best friend?

760
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,006
No, he is not my best friend!

761
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,882
Though he has been staying
in my guest house

762
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,055
ever since they shot his double last year.

763
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,966
Now the guy won't leave.

764
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,269
I know why this guy's
the most hated man in the world.

765
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,345
You just have to go
to the bathroom after him.

766
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,394
You go to the bathroom after Osama,

767
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,226
you will realize
the true meaning of terrorism.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

769
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,708
Here is the plan.

770
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,540
We're going to take this helicopter tour

771
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,092
and fly over the Lancaster
to spot its weaknesses.

772
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,012
Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

773
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,340
looking at the sights.

774
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,848
Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. It's a great plan, pointy.

775
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,804
Don't do anything
to arouse any suspicions.

776
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,731
Don't worry.
I am Wadiya's number one actor.

00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,481
You don't win four
Wadiyan Golden Globes for nothing.

778
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,903
Yes, you do,
because you gave them to yourself!

779
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,073
My performance in
Aladeen Jones and the Temple of Doom

780
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,195
was outstanding.

781
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,651
I give it thumbs clown.

782
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,452
Have you seen You've Got Mail Bomb?

783
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,414
Yes, I've seen them all!
They're all terrible movies!

784
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,866
Listen to me. Okay?

785
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,039
You are a terrible actor.

786
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:44,248
I urge you, right now,
keep your performance small and real.

787
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,253
All right, can you get me a cloak?

788
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,333
Why?

789
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,168
Because I think my guy
would be wearing a cloak.

790
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,473
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

791
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,549
I need the sheriff's badge.

792
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,054
For what?

793
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,431
You're sheriff of American douche-town!

00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,178
That's rude.

We're going to walk over there,
act very inconspicuous.

797

- Okay. No problem.
- This has to work.

Right.

I just jerked it completely off!

- With this hand right here!
- Ew!

993

And I smacked it
and I smacked it and I gave it a flick,

your voice down because...

I have to show you how to do it.

1019
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,970
It's called self juicing.

1020

You put your hand
on your bilbul and you rub it,

and then you can make
your own labeneh come out.

We all know about this
from the age of 12, 13.

Why does nobody ever tell me anything'?

1029

who tells you anything.

Whoa! No, what?
Why would you even do that?

1033
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,586
I think she'll be cool with it.

1034

She will not be cool with it

How is she to judge?
She shaves her armpits once a year,

and she takes lovers
outside of her ethnic group.

What? Why?

1428
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,304
Because no one has ever loved me!

1429
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,724
Your father would be ashamed of you!

1430
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,431
No, I've realized
I don't want to be like my father!

1431
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,063
In fact,
I don't want to be a dictator anymore!

1432
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,313
What's that now?

1433
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,317
I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, Love.

1434
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,236
Have you gone insane?

1435
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,530
I now know that on the outside,

1436
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,986
I am a bit of a cocksucker.

1437
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:53,156
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

1438
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,750
- Not really.
- Yes, lam! I'm like mafroom.

1439
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,161
Hard and spiky on the outside,

1440
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,338
but soft and really mushy on the in.

1441
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,883
You're not like mafroom at all.
You're like an onion.

1442
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,134
An outer layer of cocksucker,

1443
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,632
and when you peel it away,

1444
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:10,431
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath.

1445
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,893
You are such a schmuck!

1446
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,725
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up.

1447
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,315
What do you mean, "I picked it up"?
Who picks up Yiddish?

1448
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,562
I'm in New York!

1449
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,894
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

1450
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,071
I don't like the people,
but I like the way that

1451
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,820
their words really sound like
what they're meant to be.

1452
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,742
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I not get the Evite
to your bar mitzvah?

1453
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:31,990
Oh, my God!

1454
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,117
You've got real chutzpah saying that!

1455
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,415
Look, where has being
a nice guy gotten you, huh?

1456
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,918
Standing on the edge of a bridge
about to commit suicide?

1457
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,085
Still wearing Crocs?

1458
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,167
What's wrong with Crocs?

1459
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,250
They are the universal symbol
of a man who has given up hope!

1460
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,343
You might as well put sweatpants on

1461
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,342
and go to Applebee's
for the rest of your life!

1462
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,348
I'll give you that one.
I do look ridiculous.

1463
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:57,270
Yes! Listen, if you won't
come down from there for yourself,

1464
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,596
do it for your country.

1465
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,515
If this constitution is signed,

1466
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,818
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

1467
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:05,110
What are "civil rights"?

1468
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,647
I'll tell you later. They're hilarious.

1469
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:11,617
Look, you alone can stop
these terrible things from happening.

1470
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,495
You are the last great dictator!

1471
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,077
All of the others are gone! Qaddafi,

1472
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,784
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

1473
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,295
You are right, Nadal.

1474
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,840
I will become the greatest dictator of all,

1475
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,917
the envy of madmen everywhere!

1476
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,718
Yes, Supreme Leader!

1477
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,173
From the mountaintops of North Korea
to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

1478
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,510
let every child laborer
and sweatshop factory worker sing,

1479
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,267
"Oppressed at last! Oppressed at last!

1480
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:43,437
"Thank Aladeen, I am oppressed at last!"

1481
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,688
Yes! Whoa!

1482
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,064
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1483
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,520
- No, no, no, no, don't fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

1484
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,277
Just do like a pull-up.
You know how you do pull-ups'?

1485
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,573
I invented the pull-up.

1486
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,956
MIKE: If you're just joining us,
we are at the Lancaster Hotel,

1487
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,749
where in about 20 minutes,

1488
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,670
General Aladeen will be signing
the new Wadiyan constitution.

1489
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,588
Dignitaries from around the world

1490
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:09,588
are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy

1491
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,466
that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape

1492
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,263
of the entire region.

1493
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:17,509
As Wadiya goes, so goes North Africa.

1494
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,677
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1495
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,813
Eh, Eddie Norton, next time,
you pee on me.

1496
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:28,193
Whatever.

1497
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,521
And tell Viggo Mortensen
he is on my radar'

1498
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,360
How do you say, "Fly is in the soup"?

1499
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,285
Ah, gentlemen, Tamir.

1500
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,781
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

1501
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,745
Mrs. Lao, it is my very great pleasure.

1502
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,998
No, no, no, no.
She does not speak English.

1503
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,294
- Oh.
- Watch this.

1504
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,623
You ugly horse! (LAUGHS)

1505
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,337
She doesn't know.

1506
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:55,134
"Ohhh." See'?
She goes "Ohhh" all the time. Watch.

1507
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,344
Shaved ape.

1508
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,970
"Ohhh."

1509
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,483
Wait. That is how you intend to get me
across to the Lancaster?

1510
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:16,825
Absolutely.

1511
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,244
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it.

1512
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,905
When I was going to assassinate you.

1513
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,414
You mean my double.

1514
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,454
Um...

1515
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,452
Sure. Yeah.

1516
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,000
(BLEATS)

1517
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,087
Ha-ha! Bingo!

1518
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,138
(BOTH CHANTING TRIUMPHANTLY)

1519
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,174
Love it!

1520
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,304
- Here's what you do.
- Okay'

1521
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,387
Zipline across, kill the double,

1522
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,064
and then rip up the constitution
in front of the world's media.

1523
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,140
Piece of cake.

1524
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,745
(SCREAMING)

1525
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,782
Hello, Lancaster!

1526
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,046
I don't understand what has happened.

1527
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,219
My calculations were very precise.

1528
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,846
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

1529
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,640
Do you have anything in your pockets?

1530
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,388
Uh, let me check.

1531
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,562
What is that?

1532
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:28,935
It's Vita Coco water.

1533
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:31,058
Why do you have Vita Coco water?

1534
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,815
Because it has
as much potassium as three bananas.

1535
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,487
The line is still too heavy.

1536
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,985
Is there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down?

1537
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,828
Oh, you're kidding. So then
why did you bring three bananas?

1538
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:46,533
Because I don't trust the advertising.
I'm naturally suspicious.

1539
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,660
Is there anything else you're carrying?
You're still too heavy.

1540
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,869
Just this.

1541
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,831
What is that, a brick?

1542
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,337
All this time you've had a brick?
Why do you have that?

1543
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,340
Well, to balance out the weight
from the other one.

1544
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,671
You have two bricks?

1545
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:00,800
Yes!

1546
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,381
Throw them down immediately!

1547
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,841
Ow'

1548
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,396
Oh, my God!
There's a little goat eating the wire!

1549
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,276
You need to lose weight immediately!

1550
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,229
My pockets are empty. I could poo.

1551
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,197
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

1552
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,822
Yes, it will. I haven't gone since Wadiya.

1553
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,528
Losing power
has stopped me up like a cork.

1554
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,908
NADAL Hurry!

1555
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,582
Come on, Supreme Leader!
Make it rain! Make it rain!

1556
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,079
(DEFECATING)

1557
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,412
It's out! And it's pointy!

1558
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:34,751
Somebody stop that man!

1559
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,629
Yes!

1560
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,176
What? No, no, no, no!

1561
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:42,838
- No, no, no!
- (SCREAMING)

1562
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:45,966
(SCREAMS)

1563
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,145
(GRUNTING)

1564
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,783
Supreme Leader!

1565
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,331
Get out of here before Tamir kills you.

1566
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,170
Who is Tamir?

1567
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,956
(STAMMERS) Tamir...

1568
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,758
The bald bastard
who did all these terrible things to us!

1569
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,260
I thought his name was Dennis.

1570
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:28,472
How would you even make that leap?
Tamir to Dennis?

1571
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,678
- Go on, get out! Get out!
- Come on, Montzi!

1572
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:32,763
Quick!

1573
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,521
Just jump. It's not that far.

1574
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:39,937
Efawadh

1575
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,693
It is almost time.

1576
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,869
I like goats.

1577
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,497
I am very stupid.

1578
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,536
MIKE: This is an historic moment.

1579
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,462
Admiral General Aladeen of Wadiya

1580
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,040
is going to be signing

1581
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,798
the first democratic constitution
in the history of his nation.

1582
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,847
Across the globe,
people are glued to their television sets.

You could ignore the needs of the poor
for health care and education.
