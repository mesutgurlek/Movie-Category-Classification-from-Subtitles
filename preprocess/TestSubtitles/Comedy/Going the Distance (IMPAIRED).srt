-Yeah, that was a joke.

GARRETT:
You're such an asshole.

617

into this goddamn thing.

my actions were justified.

It was a pretty good hit.

-Are you in an exclusive relationship?
-I don't know.

627
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,871
What do you mean?
Don't you think you should know?

628
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:09,377
I mean, he could be out there dry humping
half of New York City right now.

629
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,015
"Dry humping"? Oh, that's scandalous.
That worries me.

630
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,174
Phil and I dry hump. Okay?

631
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,343
And it is intense. And it's very erotic.

632
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,785
And it's the only way
that I can actually get off.

633
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,981
Dry humping is no fucking joke.

634
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,027
So I think that you need to be clear
about what this relationship is.

Now what is the story
with you guys?

636
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,193
Are you doing it monogamous
or what's the deal?

637
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,800
Yeah.

638

-Maybe, yeah.
-"Maybe"?

640
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,364
Wow, okay.
You know what "maybe" gets you?

641
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,034
It gets her sucking every dude's dick
out there at Stanford. It really does.

642
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,645
Then you go and visit her.

643
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,442
You have to kiss that blow-job factory
she calls a mouth.

Thank you for that visual. Thanks, pal.

That was, Iike, extremely graphic.

He's thousands of miles away from here.
You don't know what he's doing.

647
00:34:55,193 --> 00:35:00,153
He could be at some bar,
doing shots with some sexy bartender...

648
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,389
...dry humping her.

We haven't set the boundaries yet.

-Okay?
-Oh, my God.

651

We're not trying to choke each other
with commitment.

652

But now you're freaking me out...

humping some bartender. Thank you.

-You don't wanna.

I don't wanna think about
what that Iooks Iike. It's not pretty.

-Can you masturbate?
-Masturbate?

Can you masturbate yourself off at all?

-Or "pop"? Like, "pop one off"?
