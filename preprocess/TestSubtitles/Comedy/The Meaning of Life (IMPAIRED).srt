00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:12,134
For each sperm that's spilt in vain

327
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:16,205
Every sperm is sacred

328
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:19,805
Every sperm is good

329
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,485
Every sperm is needed

330
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:26,966
In your neighbourhood

331
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:30,647
Every sperm is sacred

332
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:34,092
Every sperm is great

333
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:37,885
If a sperm is wasted

334
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:42,765
God gets quite irate

335
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:53,165
So you see my problem, little ones.

336
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:55,371
I can't keep you all here any longer.

337
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:56,729
CHILD: Speak up!

338
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,525
I can't keep you all here any longer!

339
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:03,891
God has blessed us so much
I can't afford to feed you anymore.

340
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,565
Couldn't you have your balls cut off?

341
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:10,133
It's not as simple as that, Nigel.
God knows all.

342
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:15,206
He'd see through such a cheap trick.
What we do to ourselves, we do to him.

343
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:18,453
You could have had them
pulled off in an accident.

344
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:19,888
[Children talk excitedly]

345
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:24,127
No. Children, I know you're trying to help,
but believe me, my mind's made up.

346
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:26,729
I've given this long and careful thought...

347
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:30,646
and it has to be medical experiments
for the lot of you.

348
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:35,924
CHILDREN: [Singing quietly]
Every sperm is sacred

349
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:41,732
Every sperm is great

350
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:44,967
BLACKITT: Look at them. Bloody Catholics.

351
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:49,367
Filling the bloody world up with people
they can't afford to bloody feed.

352
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:51,088
What are we, dear?

353
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,484
Protestant, and fiercely proud of it.

354
00:30:54,215 --> 00:30:56,809
Why do they have so many children?

355
00:30:56,895 --> 00:31:00,410
Every time they have sexual intercourse
they have to have a baby.

356
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:03,813
- But it's the same with us, Harry.
- What do you mean?

357
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:08,326
I mean we've got two children,
and we've had sexual intercourse twice.

358
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:11,806
That's not the point.
We could have it any time we wanted.

359
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:14,689
- Really?
- And what's more, since we don't believe...

360
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:17,687
in all that papist claptrap,
we can take precautions.

361
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,047
What you mean, lock the door?

362
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,844
No. I mean because we're members
of the Protestant Reformed Church...

363
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:27,325
which successfully challenged
the autocratic power of the Papacy...

364
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:31,169
in the mid-16th century, we can wear
little rubber devices to prevent issue.

365
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:32,370
What do you mean?

366
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,128
I could, if I wanted,
have sexual intercourse with you.

367
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:36,443
Oh, yes, Harry.

368
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:39,208
And, by wearing a rubber sheath
over my old fellow...

369
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:43,049
I could ensure that when I came off,
you would not be impregnated.

370
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:47,609
That's what being a Protestant's all about.
That's why it's the church for me.

371
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:50,892
That's why it's the church
for anyone who respects the individual...

372
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,012
and the individual's right
to decide for him or herself.

373
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:58,288
When Martin Luther nailed his protest
up to the church door in 1517...

374
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,845
he may not have realised
the full significance of what he was doing...

375
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:04,574
but 400 years later, thanks to him...

376
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:07,374
I can wear whatever I want
on my John Thomas.

377
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:10,373
And Protestantism doesn't stop
at the simple condom.

378
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:13,891
- Oh, no! I can wear French Ticklers if I want.
- You what?

379
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,967
French Ticklers, black mambos,
crocodile ribs.

380
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:19,728
Sheaths that are designed
not only to protect...

381
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:23,091
but also to enhance
the stimulation of sexual congress.

382
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,244
Have you got one?

383
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:27,805
Have I got one? No, but I can go down
the road anytime I want...

384
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:32,008
and walk into Harry's, and hold my head
up high and say, in a loud, steady voice:

385
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:34,563
"Harry, I want you to sell me a condom.

386
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:38,489
"In fact, today I think I'll have
a French Tickler, for I am a Protestant."

387
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:40,645
- Why don't you?
- But they cannot.

388
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:44,206
Because their church never made
the leap out of the Middle Ages...

389
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,173
and the domination of
alien Episcopal supremacy.

390
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:49,571
NARRATOR: But despite the attempts
of Protestants...

391
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,805
to promote the idea of sex for pleasure...

392
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:54,171
children continue to multiply everywhere.

393
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:05,447
WILLIAMS: "And spotteth twice
they the camels before the third hour.

Here endeth the lesson.

00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:38,365
Let us praise God.

404
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,129
Oh, Lord.

405
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:46,291
CONGREGATION: Oh, Lord.

406
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,371
You are so big.

407
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:52,285
CONGREGATION: You are so big.

408
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,168
So absolutely huge.

409
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:58,846
CONGREGATION: So absolutely huge.

410
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:03,926
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

411
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,891
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

412
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:13,367
Forgive us, Lord, for this,
our dreadful toadying.

413
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,689
CONGREGATION: And barefaced flattery.

414
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:21,810
But you're so strong,
and, well, just so super.

415
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:24,413
CONGREGATION: Fantastic.

416
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,085
CHAPLAIN: Amen, Reverend.
CONGREGATION: Amen.

417
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,366
Now two boys have been found...

418
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:32,333
rubbing linseed oil
into the school cormorant.

419
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:36,333
Some of you may feel
that the cormorant does not play...

420
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:40,090
an important part in the life
of the school, but I would remind you...

421
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:44,009
that it was presented to us by
the corporation of the town of Sudbury...

422
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,768
to commemorate Empire Day,
when we try to remember...

423
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:49,653
the names of all those from
the Sudbury area...

424
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:52,044
who so gallantly gave their lives...

425
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:54,486
to keep China British.

426
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:59,214
So from now on,
the cormorant is strictly out of bounds!

427
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:05,847
And Jenkins,
apparently your mother died this morning.

428
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,444
Chaplain.

429
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:09,332
[Religious organ music]

430
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:15,171
ALL: [Singing] O Lord, please don't burn us

431
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:18,612
Don't grill or toast your flock

432
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:23,248
Don't put us on the barbecue

433
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:27,045
Or simmer us in stock

434
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:31,324
Don't braise or bake or boil us

435
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:35,165
Or stir-fry us in a wok

436
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:40,334
Oh, please don't lightly poach us

437
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:43,771
Or baste us with hot fat

438
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:49,213
Don't fricassee or roast us

439
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:52,447
Or boil us in a vat

440
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:57,805
And please don't stick thy servants, Lord

441
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:01,644
In a Rotissomat

442
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:08,450
He's coming!

443
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:18,049
All right, settle down, settle down.

444
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,044
Before I begin the lesson,
will those of you...

445
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:25,172
playing in the match this afternoon
move your clothes down...

446
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,644
onto the lower peg
immediately after lunch...

447
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:30,568
before you write home,
if you're not getting a haircut...

448
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,614
unless you have a brother going out
this weekend as the guest of another boy...

449
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:38,483
then collect his note before lunch,
put it in your letter after your haircut.

450
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,726
Make sure he moves your clothes
onto the lower peg for you.

451
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,653
- Sir?
- Yes, Wymer?

452
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,169
My brother's going out
with Dibble this weekend...

453
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,610
but I'm not having my hair cut,
so do I move...

454
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:51,812
I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

455
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:56,014
If you're not getting your hair cut, you
don't have to move your brother's clothes.

456
00:36:56,095 --> 00:37:00,452
You simply collect his note before lunch,
after you've done your scripture prep...

457
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:03,214
when you've written your letter home
before rest...

458
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,412
move your clothes onto the lower peg,
greet the visitors...

459
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,612
and report to Mr. Viney
that you've had your chit signed.

460
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:11,889
Now, sex.

461
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:17,773
Sex, sex, sex. Where were we?

462
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:26,213
Well, had I got as far as
the penis entering the vagina?

463
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,765
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

464
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:35,531
Well, had I done foreplay?

465
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,529
Yes, sir.

466
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:44,134
As we all know all about foreplay,
no doubt you can tell me...

467
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:46,723
what the purpose of foreplay is...

468
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:48,964
Biggs.

469
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,893
Don't know. Sorry, sir.

470
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:56,484
Carter?

471
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:01,405
Was it taking your clothes off, sir?

472
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:03,968
And after that?

473
00:38:05,135 --> 00:38:07,205
Putting them on a lower peg, sir.

474
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:13,169
WILLIAMS: The purpose of foreplay is
to cause the vagina to lubricate...

475
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:16,851
so that the penis can penetrate more easily.

476
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:18,928
Could we open a window, sir?

477
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:20,573
Yes. Harris, will you?

478
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:25,285
And, of course, to cause the man's penis
to erect and harden.

479
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:31,892
Now, did I do vaginal juices last week?

480
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,170
Pay attention, Wadsworth!
I know it's Friday.

481
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:35,483
Watching the football?

482
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,169
Boy, move over there. I'm warning you.

483
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:41,654
I may decide to set an exam this term.

484
00:38:42,295 --> 00:38:43,774
- Oh, sir!
- Sir!

485
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:45,806
So just listen.

486
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:52,571
Now did I or did I not do vaginal juices?

487
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:55,843
Yes, sir.

488
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:58,927
Name two ways
of getting them flowing, Watson.

489
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,413
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

490
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:08,206
What's wrong with a kiss, boy?

491
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,849
Why not start her off with a nice kiss?

492
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:16,005
You don't have to leap
straight for the clitoris like a bull at a gate.

493
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:17,892
Give her a kiss, boy.

494
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:22,527
- Suck the nipple, sir?
- Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

495
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,732
DUCKWORTH: Stroking the thighs, sir?
WILLIAMS: Yes. I suppose so.

496
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:28,011
STUDENT: Biting the neck.
WILLIAMS: Yes, good.

497
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,491
Nibbling the ear lobe, kneading
the buttocks, and so on and so forth.

498
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:34,806
So we have all these
possibilities before we...

499
00:39:34,895 --> 00:39:37,887
stampede towards the clitoris, Watson.

500
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,967
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

501
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:45,050
Now, all these forms of stimulation
can now take place.

502
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:56,729
Of course,
tonguing will give you the best idea...

503
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:59,773
of how the juices are coming along.

504
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:01,370
Helen?

505
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:04,771
Now, penetration and coitus,
that is to say, intercourse...

506
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:07,733
up to and including orgasm.

507
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:10,050
Hello, dear.

508
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:13,614
Do stand up when my wife
enters the room, Carter.

509
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,844
Sorry, sir.

510
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:19,453
Humphrey, I hope you don't mind. I told
the Garfields we'd dine with them tonight.

511
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:22,811
- Yes, well, I suppose we must.
- I said we'd be there by 8:00.

512
00:40:22,895 --> 00:40:25,693
It'll give me a reason
to wind up the staff meeting.

513
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:28,847
I know you don't like them,
but I couldn't make another excuse.

514
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,607
It's just that I felt...

515
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,244
Wymer!

516
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:36,173
This is for your benefit.
Would you kindly wake up?

517
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,533
I've no intention
of going through this all again.

518
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,768
We'll take the foreplay as read,
if you don't mind, dear.

519
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:53,924
No, of course not.

520
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:58,770
So, the man starts by entering
or mounting his good lady wife...

521
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:00,533
in the standard way.

522
00:41:00,615 --> 00:41:04,574
The penis is now, as you will observe,
more or less fully erect.

523
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:07,530
There we are. That's better.

524
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:08,924
Now, Carter.

525
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:11,773
CARTER: Yes, sir?
WILLIAMS: What is it?

526
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,164
- It's an ocarina, sir.
- Bring it up here.

527
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:21,449
The man now starts making
thrusting movements with his pelvic area...

528
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:24,493
moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina.

529
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,175
Put it there, boy. Put it there on the table.

530
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:30,854
While the wife maximizes
her clitoral stimulation...

531
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:33,654
by the shaft of the penis
by pushing forward.

532
00:41:33,855 --> 00:41:35,083
Thank you, dear.

533
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:37,609
Now, as the sexual excitement mounts...

534
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,174
What's funny, Biggs?

535
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:41,210
Nothing, sir.

536
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:43,934
Do, please,
share your little joke with the rest of us.

537
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,449
Obviously something
frightfully funny is going on.

538
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:47,684
No, honestly, sir.

539
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:51,370
Well, as it's so funny,
I think you'd better be selected to play...

540
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:55,608
for the boys' team in the rugby match
against the masters this afternoon.

541
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:56,412

Blackitt, Sturridge and Walters,
you take the buggers on the left flank.

550
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,051
Hordern, Spadger and I will go
for the gun post.

551
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:56,285
Hang on. You'll never make it. Let us come.

552

553
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,685
Right, Skipper. Oh, sir?

554
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,967
If we don't meet again, sir...

555
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:07,447
I'd just like to say it's been
a real privilege fighting alongside you, sir.

556
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:10,971
Yes, well, this is hardly the time
or place for a good-bye speech.

557
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:15,333
Me and the lads realise that, sir,
but, well, we may never meet again, so...

558
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,332
All right, Blackitt. Thanks a lot.

559
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:19,053
No, just a moment, sir.

560
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:21,524
Me and the lads,
we've had a little whip around.

561
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:24,652
We've bought you something.
We bought you this.

562
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:29,245
I don't know what to say.

563
00:44:29,975 --> 00:44:33,092
It's a lovely thought. Thank you.
Thank you all.

564
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:35,690
But I think we'd better get to cover...

565
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,167
We've got something else
for you as well, sir.

566
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:44,127
Sorry it's another clock,
only there was a bit of a mix-up.

567
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,171
Walters thought he was buyin' a present...

568
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:49,133
and Spadger and I
had already got the other one.

569
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:52,253
Well, it's beautiful. They're both beautiful.

570
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:57,291
We'd better get to cover now.
I'll thank you properly later on.

571
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,206
Corporal Sturridge got this for you.

572
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:01,889
He didn't know about the others. It's Swiss.

573
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:05,167
Now, that is thoughtful, Sturridge.
Good man.

574
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:09,288
There's a card, sir, from all of us.
Sorry about the blood, sir.

Thank you all.

I'll be all right.

578
00:45:22,295 --> 00:45:25,731
There's just one other thing, sir.
Spadger, give him the cheque.

579
00:45:26,175 --> 00:45:28,052
This is really going too far.

580
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:31,885
I don't seem to be able to find it, sir.
It'll be in No. 4 trench.

You've hurt his feelings now.

Don't mind me, Spadge.

I can reassure you about?

You see, a virus is what we doctors call
very, very small.
