And, wow,
I didn't peg you as the snobby type.

323
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,700
Snob? Me?

324
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,180
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

325
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,660
I am not a snob.

326
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,766
Okay, well, let's just say I was a billionaire,
and we were out on my giant yacht

327
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,460
in the middle of the Mediterranean,
sipping champagne,

328
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,820
and I went in to kiss you.

329
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
Would you have kissed me back, then?

330

the White House right now?

333
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,524
I'll be there in 15.

334
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,860
While I'd love to stick around

335
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,100
and listen to you lie about not wanting to
make out with the yacht guy,

336
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,201
I have to go.

337

'Cause we appreciate it more.

I guarantee she's here to shoot the President.

they even let you in here.

right into the Situation Room.

in the Situation Room,

- So there's no mass panic yet.
- Well, good.

Then let's solve this thing
before there is.

It's an Iranian black-ops sideshow.

I guarantee it.

I have a theory.

I think, based on analysis
of the footage,

402
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,325
that preliminary indications
are that we were attacked by

Mr. President, there is no nation on Earth

Anyway, more to the current point,

430
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,060
uh, Mr. Brenner here
was the World Galaga Champion.

He knows everything
there is to know about this game.

So, what is it you and your orange shorts
barged in here to say?

433
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,580
Oh, just the Galaga that attacked us,

434
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,580
that doesn't exist anymore.

435
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,571
Hello. You can download Galaga
on your phone for $1.99.

436
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,300
Yeah, not this version though,
Blue Lagoon.

437
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,100
The Galaga that exists
now came out in 1986.

438
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,726
But this is the 1982 arcade version.

439
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,460
And all those machines, they recalled them,
they reprogrammed them,

440
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,340
because there were glitches
in the original code.

441
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,700
You can see from the giant space bugs,
the way they come swoopin' in.

442
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,060
Kind of ziggy-zaggy.

443
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
Ziggy-zag? Is that the snobby term?

444

VIOLET: So someone
designed these space bugs

445
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,780
after an old out-of-print version
of a video game from 30 years ago

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,140
that nobody would know today?

She's not even at the grown-ups table.

448
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,500
I'm sorry. Is this a National
Security Council meeting,

449
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,965
or a dorm-room drug party?

450
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,180
Our nation has just been attacked
by an unknown military force.

451
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,660
If this gets out to the press
that we're pinning the blame

452
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,220
on some old computer game,

453
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,211
they'll not only mock you in the news,
Mr. President, they'd impeach you!

454
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,890
So I suggest the man in the orange shorts
leave the room immediately.

455
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,740
And those of us with long pants
and government positions

456
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,650
can discuss our options.

there was a tape of the event

that was then put in a capsule

from the aliens to prove my theory.

Because the government spies on us
through our cable boxes, Brenner.

That's been proven.

They have been
the best years of my life.

631

we have something very special.

Hi. Ludlow Lamonsoff.

649
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,900
We've actually met before,
but you wouldn't remember

650
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,049
because it was in the back of Brenner's van
and I was watching you through a window.

651
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,688
(SNIFFS) You smell so nice,
like the Book of Genesis.

652
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,060
Mr. Lamonsoff and Mr. Brenner

653
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,140
have agreed to share their video game
expertise with you and your team.

654
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,220
Happy to do it.

655
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,380
With all due respect, sir,

656
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,660
having civilians with zero security
clearance in this facility is...

657
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,900
These civilians have
better insight into our current crisis

658
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,570
than my entire administration.

659
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,100
I dunno if I wanna do it now.
She's being so mean.

660
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,300
- I kind of wanna leave.
- Okay.

- If he leaves, I leave. We're a team.
- Stop it.

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,780
So have we made any progress, Colonel?

666
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,620
Enormous progress, sir.

667
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,620
We now understand the entities
that attacked us were made of energy.

- Good morning, Michael.

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,060
Michael's a robot!

671
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,420
I think maybe the extraterrestrials
took what they saw in the orbiter

672
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,410
and recreated the same things
using light energy.

673
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,364
And then sent these light creatures
back at us.

674
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,100
That's why solid matter,
bullets and missiles, won't harm them.

675
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,340
Can anything harm them?

676
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,680
Maybe.

677
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,180

681
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,100
But they calm down pretty quick

682
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,931
when we hit them with
some super-charged light particles.

683
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,980
And the slut-seeking missile,
I'd love to see that.

684
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,260
- Do you have that around here?
- You are so smart.

685
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,780
Yeah? You think so?

686
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,460
Is that how you got into
the Mississippi Institute of Technology?

687
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,820
You know, I wish I never went
in that closet with you.

688
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,660
I was very happy
drinking and crying by myself.

689
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,140
I so regret trying to kiss you.

690
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,323
I would kiss the guy in the yacht
100 times before I kissed you.

- Moving on.
- Yeah.

- To win!

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,500
- When do we quit?
- Never!

- Never!

would like to say a few words to the SEALs.

Looks to me, Brenner,

725
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,660
like someone forgot to send us

But the truth is we've been training.

759
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,820
Since childhood, we've been training
our prefrontal cortex

760
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,100
to perform extremely complex motor feats

761
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,380
with hand-eye coordination
unique to a very specific cognitive acuity.

762
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,290
I learned a lot of big words
at the dorm-room drug parties.

763
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,168
All of it's been meaningless
in all areas of our life.

That is to destroy every rock
and every saucer.

770
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,420
You don't wanna get hit
by any of these boulders.

That's why I recommend
stayin' in the middle.

Just 'cause you see a hammer
doesn't mean grab it.

773
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,980
You're not gonna climb a ladder
with a hammer in your hand.

And no sales tax.
If I wanna buy some, for instance, gum,

I'm pretty sure the federal government

could do without your income taxes
and be fine.

01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,940
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!

1262
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,260
- Yes, Hal.
- HAL: Mr. President,

1263
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,900
your approval ratings have tripled
since this crisis began.

1264
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,020
Do you feel the heretofore
sanguine causata

1265
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,327
are tracking toward
an auspicious denouement?

1266
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,580
REPORTER: Oh, shut up, Hal.

1267
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,445
You're just using big words
to try to make him look like an idiot.

1268
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,211
We love you, Mr. President.
Thank you for saving us.

1269
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,300
Please, don't thank me.

1270
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,882
It's Sam Brenner and his team who have
brought us here to the brink of victory.

1271
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,242
And we understand
you're holding a soirée in their honor.

1272
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,848
Is that a good idea when another attack
may be imminent?

1273
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,140
COOPER: No need to worry.

1274
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,180
They will have their Arcader uniforms on
underneath their tuxes,

1275
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,362
ready to go at a moment's notice.

1276
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,220
And for the record, Hal,

1277
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,369
I happen to know
what several of those big words meant.

1278
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,700
I drank a few cold sanguines
on my last trip to México.

1279
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,780
(ALL LAUGHING)

1280
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,609
Bite on that, Hal!

1281
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,724
ALL: (CHANTING) You! You! You! You! You!

1282
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,481
(TURNS TV OFF)

1283
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,722
I don't know what would be worse.

1284
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,085
Them failing,

1285
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,140
or them actually pulling this off.

1286
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,620
WOMAN: What was that, Jim?

1287
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,087
Can you shut up for five seconds?

1288
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,780
We need to increase the rate of fire.

1289
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,929
Now you already calculated
that in your beautiful mind, didn't you?

1290
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,768
BRENNER: There's no
rhyme or reason to this game.

1291
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,140
I mean, where are the patterns?
He just attacks out of left field.

1292
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,289
Patterns? Is that why you were so good
with Pac-Man and Centipede?

1293
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,780
You memorized the patterns?

1294
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,660
Yeah. Only way to beat these things.

1295
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,820
Count the bullets, calculate the speed,
crunch the numbers.

1296
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,180
Where's the fun in that?

1297
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,009
Oh, boy. Why? What do you do?

1298
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,164
You gotta pretend you're the guy
and you don't wanna die.

1299
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,860
Yeah, that sounds cool,
but it's not gonna work every time.

1300
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,167
Well, that's why you have
your reset button.

1301
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,642
Yeah, we didn't have those growin' up.

1302
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,060
Most violent game I've ever seen.

1303
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,820
I don't think it's healthy for you.

1304
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,060
It's fine. I can handle it.

1305
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,447
No, I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to homeboy.

1306
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,327
(SHIVERING) So much blood!

1307
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,007
Yeah. Hey.
You know what'll cheer you up?

1308
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,900
- A cheese ball.
- Q*BERT: Yep.

1309
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,001
Huh?

1310
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,645
Come on, suck one up.

1311
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,970
- (GULPS)
- Take a handful.

1312
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,203
That was smooth.
(CHUCKLING) That was very smooth.

1313
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,140
You know, we should
get him some exercise.

1314
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,004
Maybe throw him
on the trampoline for a little bit?

1315
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,380
Q*BERT: Trampoline!
Trampoline! Trampoline!

1316
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,900
Okay. How about me and him do that

1317
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,049
while you go ask my mom
to the ball tomorrow night?

1318
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,647
Unfortunately,
I'm not attracted to your mother.

1319
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,490
Q*BERT: Bullcrap.

1320
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,210
You're right, I am. Okay.

1321
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,850
Here. Finish these.

1322
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,205
- You're gettin' chubby.
- (Q*BERT CHUCKLES)

1323
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,966
- Hi.
- (Q*BERT WHOOPING)

1324
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,687
Hi.

1325
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,161
So...

1326
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,526
So...

1327
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,881
Q*BERT: Whoo!

1328
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,841
(LAUGHING)

1329
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,700
Sorry!

1330
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,962
Q*BERT: Again! Again! Again! Again!

1331
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,740
So I'm feeling obligated to make
an appearance at that thing tomorrow night.

1332
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,620
I was wondering, when you got there,

1333
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,420
if possibly you'd like to hang out
with me while I was there?

1334
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,726
- Like a date?
- Like a date, but...

1335
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,860
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

1336
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,380
I dunno about that.

1337
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,780
I'm a snob.
I have mental problems, so...

1338
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,060
Well, you know, you are and you do,

1339
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,686
but I'm willin' to overlook that
for the evening.

1340
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,140
Okay.

1341
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,526
- You will?
- Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,687
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1343
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,685
MAN: Three, four.

1344
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,291
(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

1345
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,140
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks.

1346
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,049
Nice welcome, for a change, huh?

1347
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,371
Bring it down, Travolta. Bring it down.

1348
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,084
They love the Big Man!
Good to see the respect, pal.

1349
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,100
Well, lookie here, Serena.

1350
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,680
They threw me a big party to thank me
for savin' the world.

1351
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,368
And you get to stand
next to me all night.

1352
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,723
- MAN: Champagne, sir?
- Thanks.

1353
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,680
- They promised me an island if I did this.
- Ah.

1354
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,900
I'm dying to meet Sam's new ladyfriend.

1355
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,740
She's nothin'.
It's just a little hangin' out thing.

1356
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,966
Yeah, right.

1357
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,685
Is she pretty, Will?

1358
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,969
Uh, define pretty.
I mean, you're pretty. (CHUCKLES)

1359
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,140
- Extremely pretty.
- Thank you.

1360
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,340
She, I think, in the classical sense
of the word, is certainly... I mean, I feel...

1361
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,180
- Brenner, help me out here.
- No, you're doing great.

1362
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,500
- Keep going.
- Okay.

1363
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,820
Uh, You know, she, for
military personnel, certainly.

1364
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,921
I mean...

1365
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,764
You're the First Lady,

1366
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,365
she's a 10.

1367
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,966
Hey, Brenner.

1368
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,490
Q*BERT: Hey, Brenner.

1369
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,488
Excuse me for a second.

1370
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,526
Come on, Matty. Let's dance!

1371
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,285
You look nice in a tux.

1372
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,481
Green's officially
my favorite color now.

1373
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,050
I have a question for you.

1374
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,380
President said I'm on call tonight,
so I can only have half a beer.

1375
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,540
Um...

1376
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,564
I know you like drinkin'
out of sippy cups,

1377
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,170
but wanna split a bottle with me?

1378
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,570
- (SNIFFS)
- What happened?

1379
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,260
- You brushed your teeth.
- Yes! Yes.

1380
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,500
All right. Lead the way.

1381
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,761
You got it.

1382
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,887
(SINGING) Welcome to your life

1383
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,740
There's no turning back

1384
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,700
Even while we sleep

1385
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,020
We will find you

1386
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,522
Acting on your best behavior

1387
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,887
So let's hear about Sinnamon.
What does she look like?

1388
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,980
- Oh, God. Are you kidding?
- I wanna know.

1389
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,940
She's a husband-stealing
Pilates teacher. She's hot!

1390
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,485
- Uh-huh.
- And limber.

1391
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,420
That doesn't matter.

1392
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,568
Yes! Actually, it does.

1393
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,540
She's not perfect, though, right?

1394
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,529
Girls like that who steal husbands,

1395
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,962
they always got one
thing wrong with them.

1396
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,321
Come on.

1397
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,420
- Her forehead's too big?
- (CHUCKLES) No.

1398
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,900
- Mole on the chin?
- No.

1399
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,809
- Two different nostrils?
- No!

1400
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,690
She's flawless.

1401
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,246
She is.

1402
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,247
I mean, her eyes.
Okay, her eyes are a little far apart.

1403
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,060
Kind of looks like a flounder.

1404
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,420
- There it is! Good.
- (CHUCKLES)

1405
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,020
So tonight, your dopey ex-husband's
gonna be lookin' into those eyes and sayin',

1406
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,980
"What kind of choice did I make?

1407
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,540
"I used to stare into the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen,

1408
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,740
"and now I'm stuck starin'
at the Filet o' Fish sandwich."

1409
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,444
Did you just say I have beautiful eyes?

1410
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,529
While insulting the other chick.

1411
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,220
Wow. That is really,
really, really, really good.

1412
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,651
Thank you.

1413
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,929
Can I have some of that? No?
I thought we were splitting it.
