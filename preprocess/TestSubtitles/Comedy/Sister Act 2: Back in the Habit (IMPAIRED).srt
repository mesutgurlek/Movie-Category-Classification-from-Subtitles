00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,063
at St. Francis.

147
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:30,737
We seem to have got in
slightly over our heads.

Help us

Oh, no.
[ Chuckling ]

152
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:43,315
Listen, I'm not cut out
to be a teacher.

153
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:45,656
Who would I teach ?
What would I teach ?

154
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,822
Teach the children.
Teach music.

155
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:52,994
You weren't cut out to be a nun either,
but look what you accomplished
at St. Katherine's.

156
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,766
You brought a new spirit into
the convent and into the community.

157
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:59,432
You were... infectious.

158
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,510
You could be just
as infectious here.

159
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,512
You're making me
sound like a disease.

160
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,072
We are struggling here with
a community that is tired...

161
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:10,846
and worn
and despairing.

162
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,856
We saw this school
as some sort of renewal,

163
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,189
but it's becoming
a hopeless situation.

It is our duty.

I'm a lounge singer.

You are the perfect example
of how a sow's ear...

172
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:46,816
can be turned
into a silk purse.

173
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:49,914
Hmm.

174
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:52,893
Well, I probably wouldn't have
put it quite like that.

175
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:55,123
I mean, look.
I mean, really.

176
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:59,395
My career's starting to take off.
I kind of want to get into my success.

177
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:02,096
A success you might not
have had...

178

Oh, so you're going to be like
that, huh, with the guilt ?

181
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:15,105
Guilt ?
I would never use guilt.

182
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,175
I'm a nun.

183
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:19,777
All right,
I'll do it for you.

184
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:23,450
Oh, thank you, Deloris.
I knew we could count on you.

185
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:26,120
But you're just talking
about like a week, right ?

186
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:30,427
I don't think we should restrict
ourselves to a time frame.

188

Deloris has agreed
to join our teaching staff.

189

- So, could you take her
to the changing room ?
- Sure, absolutely.

He--

[ Deloris ] Somebody tell me
why I'm dressed like this again.

192
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:51,514
The Fathers here
at St. Francis are very strict.

193
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,021
If they were to find out you're neither
a nun or a teacher, they might--

194
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,456
- Ask me to leave ?
- In a New York minute.

195
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,893
- Yeah, well, now, I'm undercover again.
- It could be fun.

196
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:03,863
- Convent living is kind of grim.
- All I need is a bed...

197
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:07,402
- and a place to kneel.
- Wait until you see what
we have in the room for you.

198
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:10,199
- You didn't go out and do
something silly, did you ?
- Well, maybe.

199
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,638
- What did you put in, a bidet ?
- A bi-what ?

200
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,802
- Never mind. What is it ?
- A watched pot never boils.

201
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,971
- No, no, don't tell her.
It's a surprise.
- Okay.

202
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,381
- Ready ? One, two, three.

He's only been here

It was a traumatic enjoyment of an
experience that I should not have had...

- Oh, Father Maurice.

- Sister Mary Clarence.

- Yes, as a matter of fact.
- I am familiar with the dilemma.

- You are ? How did you know ?

592

You'll find that when one deals
with Sister Mary Clarence,

593
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:26,863
one is smothered with more information
than one wishes to possess.

Mary Clarence communicates.

No, I wouldn't
want to frighten you.

599
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:50,314
But in my experience,
I found it easier and ultimately...

600
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:54,952
quite effective to give
Mary Clarence a free hand.

601

extremely radical ?

603
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,832
the term ''radical'' was
applied to us in our day.

604
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:07,339
Or have you forgotten the trouble
we caused Bishop O'Malley ?

00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:22,508
'' Letters To a Young Poet''
by Rainer Maria Rilke.

959
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:25,739
He's a fabulous writer.
A fellow used to write to him and say,

960
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:29,079
''I want to be a writer.
Please read my stuff.''

961
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:34,588
And Rilke says to this guy,
'' Don't ask me about being a writer.

962
00:57:34,656 --> 00:57:38,592
If, when you wake up in the morning,
you can think of nothing but writing...

963
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,651
then you're a writer.''
