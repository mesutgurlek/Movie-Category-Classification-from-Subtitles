But isn't it true
that Wednesday last...

314
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,112
...you were found playing Barbie dolls
with young Stephanie?

315
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,512
Well, there's nothing else to do.
It was raining and--

316
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,792
No further questions, Your Honor.

317
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,713
I'd like to call Stephanie Judith Tanner
to the stand.

318
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,114
I can't live with Michelle.
I'll go nuts.

319
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,318
- Please wait for the question.
- Sorry.

320
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,358
So why can't you live with Michelle?

321
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,557
- I'll go nuts!
- No further questions.

322
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,039
I have a question.
Why did you move out in the first place?

323
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,919
Because I can't live with D.J...

324
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,673
...at least not this D.J.

325
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,073
I miss the old D.J.,
the one who used to like me.

326
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,038
Steph...

327
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,557
...it's not that I don't like you.

328
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,719
I'd like you better
if you were in a different room.

329
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,398
Well, that is just
not gonna happen.

330
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,440
Michelle is still very young, and I don't
want her to have a roommate right now.

331
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,193
Stephanie...

332
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,149
...you have to realize that
D.J. is becoming a young woman.

333
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,551
Things aren't gonna be exactly
the way they were.

334
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,594
- You have to understand that.
- Okay.

335
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,271
D.J., you have to understand
that Stephanie is still your roommate.

336
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,796
So you have to find some way
to get along with her.

337
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,469
Okay.

338
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,634
I realize this five-year age difference
seems like a lot now...

339
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,236
...but before you know it,
it won't mean a thing.

340
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,917
You know, some day, girls, you'll realize
how lucky you are to have one another.

341
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,996
Okay, let's move Stephanie's stuff
back into her room.

342
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,072
- Let's go.
- Can't we play more lawyer?

343
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,276
So, Mr. Bear, do you think anyone else
will be dressed as Batman this year?

344
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,991
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

345
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,080
Boy I'm gonna get tired
of doing this laugh all night.

346
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,273
Well, have fun at your party.

347
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,709
Why are you moping around?
You love the carnival.

348
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,271
Yeah, but it's gonna be
my first carnival without you.

349
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,796
I don't get it.

350
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,078
Why do you wanna hang out
with me so much?

351
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,879
Well, the truth is...

352
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,279
...I like to hang out with you
because I wanna be just like you.

353
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,399
You're smart and pretty
and really cool.

354
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,392
Wouldn't you wanna
hang out with you?

355
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,079
Can't argue with any of that.

356
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,639
Well, I guess some times
I like hanging out with you too.

357
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,753
Really? How come?

358
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,953
Well, you're a little nutty,
but you always make me laugh...

359
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,351
...and you have definite cool-potential.

360
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,357
Tell you what, I'll go to that
Halloween carnival with you...

361
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,239
...and I'll go to my party later.

362
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,080
Really? Aw, thanks, D.J.

363
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,516
Hold that hug.

364
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,394
I don't want a roommate.

365
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,836
But, since I have to have one...

366
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,310
...I guess I couldn't think
of anyone better.

367
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,954
Wow! Two nice things in a row!

368
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,995
- Now?
- Now.

369
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,958
Aw.

370
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,120
Batman hugging the Joker.

371
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,719
Now this is how the movie
should have ended.

372
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,712
Meow.

373
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,235
Aw, Michelle!

374
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,359
You are the cutest kitten in town.

375
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,073
Guys, we don't wanna be late
for the kids' Halloween carnival.

376
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,515
JOEY:
Oh, yes, we do!

377
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,630
Yuk it up all you want, Danny.
There's one thing we forgot to tell you:

378
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,110
We're your dates.

379
