Go home, then!

170
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,580
You go home, I've lived here
way longer than you.

171
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,200
What's that?

172
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,370
This? It's a Rubik’s cube.

173
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,000
Is it some kind of puzzle?

174
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,910
Yeah...

175
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,750
You want to try it?

176
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,830
You can give it back tomorrow.

177
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,250
I might not be here tomorrow.

178
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,040
That's okay. You can borrow it till Monday.

179
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,200
How does it work?

180
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,580
You want each side to be a solid color.

181
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,870
Like this...

182
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,200
You smell funny.

183
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Aren't you cold?

184
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,620
- No.
- Why not?

185
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,870
I guess I've forgotten how.

186
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,040
Guess I'll see you Monday, then.

187
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,870
Okay.

Jocke...

228
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,750
There was an animal behind...
I was out on the balcony and I saw...

229
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,870
And then I saw Jocke... and a little kid.

230

It was here somewhere.

12 years, eight months, and nine days.

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
What do you mean, "about 12"?

258
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,620
When's your birthday?

259

I don't know.

260
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,500
Don't you celebrate your birthday?

261
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,790
Your parents... they have to know.

262
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,660
Then you don't get any birthday
presents, do you?

263
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,790
No.

264

You can have this if you want.

265
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,500
It's yours.

317
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,700

Hit back harder than you dare.

322

Do you know who I am?

860
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:04,870
- Yes.
- Good.

861
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:06,790
Then you understand.

862
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:08,540
We're going to have a little contest now.

863
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:12,870
You'll stay under water...

864

...for three minutes.

865
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:19,700

I'll poke one of your eyes out.

869
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:28,580
An eye for an ear, okay?

870
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:34,040
But... that's impossible.

871
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,330
That's your problem.
