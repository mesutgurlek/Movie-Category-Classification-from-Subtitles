ARE YOU SURE?

164
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,026
YEAH. IT WAS MY IDEA TO LET
THEM HELP PLAN THE WEDDING.

165
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:57,595
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

166
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:00,098
IT'S NICE TO SEE THEM
GETTING ALONG FOR A CHANGE.

167
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,399
IT'S AMAZING HOW WELL
THEY'RE GETTING ALONG.

168
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:05,302
[ENGINES REVVING]

169
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,343
AH. HA!

170
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:15,378
HA?

171
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,380
YOU DIDN'T WIN.
I QUIT.

172
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,014
I GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN
DICK AROUND WITH YOU ALL DAY.

173
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,183
REALLY? WHAT?

174
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,252
WE GOT A WEDDING TO PLAN,
BONEHEAD. REMEMBER?

175
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,621
HOW COULD I FORGET?

176
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,056
SEE YOU LATER, JOHN.

177
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,424
SEE YOU LATER, MAX.

178
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:47,339
HEY, POP.

179
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,842
SHUSH! HE'S HERE.

180
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,477
WHAT? CATFISH HUNTER?

181
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:53,177
BY THE SAND BAR.

182
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:55,179
YOU KNOW
THAT DAMN FISH

183
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:57,081
IS OLDER THAN I AM?

184
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:58,549
THANKS.

185
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:01,685
MMM. WHAT THE...

186
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:03,453
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

187
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,154
WHAT?
THAT'S LIGHT BEER.

188
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,156
GEE. I WEIGH
90 GODDAMN POUNDS,

189
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,558
AND YOU BRING ME
THIS SLOPPIN' FOAM?

190
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,494
ARIEL'S GOT ME
ON A DIET

191
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:13,496
BECAUSE THE DOC SAID MY
CHOLESTEROL'S A LITTLE TOO HIGH.

192
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:16,664
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING NOW, JOHNNY.

193
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:20,134
LAST THURSDAY,
I TURNED 95 YEARS OLD.

194
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:21,536
YEAH.

195
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:25,606
AND I NEVER EXERCISED
A DAY OF MY LIFE.

196
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,908
EVERY MORNING,
I WAKE UP,

197
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,977
AND I SMOKE
A CIGARETTE,

198
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:34,046
AND THEN I EAT
5 STRIPS OF BACON.

199
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,884
AND FOR LUNCH, I EAT
A BACON SANDWICH,

200
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,285
AND FOR
A MIDDAY SNACK...

201
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,720
BACON?

202
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,255
BACON! A WHOLE
DAMN PLATE,

203
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
AND I USUALLY
DRINK MY DINNER.

204
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,795
NOW, ACCORDING TO ALL OF
THEM FLAB-BELLY EXPERTS,

205
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,131
I SHOULD HAVE TOOK
A DIRT NAP,

206
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,733
LIKE, 30 YEARS AGO,

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,968
BUT EACH YEAR
COMES AND GOES,

208
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:00,469
AND I'M
STILL HERE...

209
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,872
HA! AND THEY
KEEP DYING.

210
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,340
YOU KNOW?

211
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,474
SOMETIMES I WONDER

212
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,277
IF GOD FORGOT
ABOUT ME.

213
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:12,447
IT JUST GOES
TO SHOW YOU, HUH?

214
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,916
WHAT?

215
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:16,784
HUH?

216
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:18,686
IT GOES
TO SHOW YOU WHAT?

217
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,288
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

218
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:23,790
YOU SAID YOU DRINK BEER,
YOU EAT BACON,

219
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,291
AND YOU SMOKE
CIGARETTES,

220
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,794
AND YOU OUTLIVE
MOST OF THE EXPERTS.

221
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,162
YEAH?

222
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,764
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THERE'S A MORAL.

223
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,932
NO, THERE AIN'T
NO MORAL.

224
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:35,734
I JUST
LIKE THAT STORY.

225
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:38,103
THAT'S ALL.

226
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,608
I LIKE THAT STORY.

227
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:50,497
GOOD AFTERNOON.

228
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:52,966
OH, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

229
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:56,969
AREN'T YOU
BEAUTIFUL TODAY?

230
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:59,472
ARE YOU THIRSTY?
HUH?

231
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,874
OH, THERE WE GO.
DRINK UP.

232
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:05,477
YEAH. DRINK UP.

233
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:06,978
THAT'S RIGHT.

234
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:09,981
OOH, THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

235
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,349
DRINK UP.

236
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,817
HI, ARIEL.

237
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:14,451
OH, HI!

238
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,454
ISN'T IT A GLORIOUS
AFTERNOON?

239
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:18,955
IT'S NOT BAD.

240
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,257
YOU OK?
FEELING ALL RIGHT?

241
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:22,892
SPLENDID. WHY?

242
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,229
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING THAT YOU
WERE TALKING TO THE FLOWERS.

243
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:27,963
WELL,
PLANTS AND FLOWERS

244
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,964
ARE LIVING
ORGANISMS, AND...

245
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,467
AND THEY RESPOND
TO VOICE AND TOUCH,

246
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,702
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER
CREATURE WOULD.

247
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,938
YOU SHOULD TRY IT
YOURSELF SOMETIME.

248
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,440
I GOT A CACTUS
IN MY BATHROOM,

249
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,208
BUT WE GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

250
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:43,610
OH.

251
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,346
HA HA!
I BETTER GET GOING.

252
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,048
MAX.

253
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,115
YES.

254
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,117
LISTEN, I'M, UH...

255
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,785
LOOK, I'M COOKING
CANTONESE TONIGHT.

256
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,920
WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN US?

257
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,058
I ALREADY MADE
OTHER PLANS.

258
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,959
ARE YOU SURE?

259
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,095
THANKS ANYWAY.
APPRECIATE IT.

260
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:15,939
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
BONNIE AND CLYDE

261
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,442
TURN OUT TO BE BONNIE
AND BONNIE?

262
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,376
<i>LESBIAN BANDITS,
NEXT ON GERALDO.</i>

263
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,911
OH! LESBIANS. YUMMY.

264
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,413
Ariel: WAIT.

265
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,914
WOULD YOU...

266
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,416
John:
YEAH, BUT I LIKE THOSE.

267
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:30,785
CAN I DO THIS?

268
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,921
NO, NO, NO, NO.

269
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,940
YOU GOT TO WAIT.

270
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,440
HA HA HA!

271
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,942
WHY DON'T
WE JUST

272
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,443
PUT EVERYTHING
IN HERE?

273
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:43,013
THROW IT ALL IN THERE.
CHOP IT UP.

274
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,414
HA HA HA!

275
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,550
NEED TO BORROW
A PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER.

276
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:50,252
OH, HI, JACOB.
YOU BEEN HERE LONG?

277
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,654
MMM, NO.

278
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:52,654
PHILLIPS.

279
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,556
POP, DON'T YOU
THINK IT'S TIME

280
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,057
YOU START
DATING AGAIN?

281
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,291
WHO WITH?

282
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,227
I HAPPEN TO KNOW FLORENCE
GILBERT AT THE ROTARY CLUB

283
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:00,595
THINKS YOU'RE
QUITE A CATCH.

284
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:03,196
SHE LOOKS LIKE
ERNEST BORGNINE.

285
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,532
IS THAT SUCH
A BAD THING?

286
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,699
YEAH.

287
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,200
WHAT ABOUT JANE CLARK?

288
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,202
JANE OF THE JUNGLE! GOT
MORE BODY HAIR THAN I DO.

289
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,540
SHE'S A FUR- BEARING
MAMMAL, FOR GOD'S SAKES!

290
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,041
DORIS ZABRINSKI,
HUH?

291
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,475
I KNOW
SHE'S HEAVY,

292
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:18,644
BUT SHE LOVES
TO FISH.

293
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,513
DORIS ZABRINSKI
IS DEAD.

294
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:22,681
SHE IS?

295
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:26,517
SHE CHOKED TO DEATH
ON A STACK OF PANCAKES

296
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:30,655
2 WEEKS AGO AT THE LIONS
CLUB CHARITY BREAKFAST.

297
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:31,756
WOW.

298
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:35,692
I THINK IT'S HOW SHE
WOULD HAVE WANTED TO GO.

299
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,093
POP.

300
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,194
YEAH.

301
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,529
LISTEN TO ME.

302
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:41,031
YOU CAN'T SIT AROUND
WAITING FOR ANOTHER ARIEL

303
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:42,765
TO WALK INTO
YOUR LIFE.

304
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,704
THANKS
FOR THE PHILLIPS.

305
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,305
JACOB.

306
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,609
WHAT?

307
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,678
REMEMBER,
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

308
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:00,013
YOUR MOTHER BAKED THAT
RHUBARB PIE FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

309
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,984
SHE SWELLED UP
LIKE A BALLOON,

310
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,518
BROKE OUT IN HIVES.

311
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:08,487
SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
ALLERGIC TO RHUBARB.

312
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,790
OH, SHE KNEW.
SHE BAKED IT ANYWAY

313
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,325
'CAUSE SHE KNEW
IT WAS MY FAVORITE.

314
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,628
WHAT MADE YOU
THINK OF THAT, POP?

315
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,161
I DON'T KNOW.

316
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,899
I THINK ABOUT THINGS
LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME.

317
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,971
HEY, POP.

318
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,206
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

319
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,609
WOULD YOU GET OUT OF HERE AND
LET ME WATCH MY PROGRAM?

320
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,542
AND CLOSE THE DOOR
WHEN YOU GO

321
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:36,479
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
THOSE MOSQUITOES COMING IN.

322
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,981
THEY'RE CRAZY ABOUT

323
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,983
MY MACARONI
AND CHEESE DISH.

324
