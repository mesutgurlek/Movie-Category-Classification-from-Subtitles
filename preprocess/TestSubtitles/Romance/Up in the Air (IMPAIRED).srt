1
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:07,594
This is what I get in return
for 30 years of service for my company?

2
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,563
And they send some yo-yo like you
in here

3
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:13,105
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

4
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,266
They should be telling you
you're out of a job.

5
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:19,472
You have a lot of gall coming in here
and firing your number one producer.

6
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:20,706
And then you're going
to go home tomorrow

7
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,714
and make more money
then you've ever made in your life,

8
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:24,943
and I'm going to go home
without a pay check. Fuck you.

9
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:27,282
I just...
I guess you leave me dumbfounded.

10
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,322
I don't know where this is coming from.

11
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,016
How am I supposed to go back as a man

12
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,286
and explain this to my wife
that I lost my job?

13
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,422
On a stress level,

14
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:39,431
I've heard that losing your job
is like a death in the family.

15
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,325
But personally, I feel more like

16
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:49,065
the people I worked with were my family
and I died.

17
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,669
I can't afford to be unemployed.
I have a house payment. I have children.

18
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,715
I don't know how you can live
with yourself,

19
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:00,116
but I'm sure that you'll find a way
while the rest of us are suffering.

20
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,279
Who the fuck are you, man?

21
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,018
Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?

22
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,823
Poor Steve has worked here
for 7 years.

23
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:13,293
He's never had a meeting with me
before or passed me in the hall

24
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,391
or told me a story in the break room.

25
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,992
And that's because I don't work here.

26
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,471
I work for another company that lends
me out to pussies like Steve's boss

27
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,940
who don't have the balls
to sack their own employees,

28
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,806
and in some cases, for good reason.

29
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:28,177
Because people do crazy shit
when they get fired.

30
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,720
Did I do something wrong?

31
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,982
I mean, is there something
I could do differently here?

32
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,389
This is not an assessment
of your productivity.

33
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,053
You got to try not to take this personally.

34
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,224
''Don't take it personally.''

35
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:47,266
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

36
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:51,100
Take it seriously. I think you're going to
find a lot of good answers in here.

37
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,799
I'm sure this is going to be very helpful,
a packet.

38
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:56,034
Thank you. A packet.

39
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:02,714
Well, anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

40
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,080
sat where you are right now.

41
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,518
And it's because they sat there
they were able to do it.

42
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,351
That's the truth.

43
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,826
I'm going to need your key card.

44
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,498
Great. Okay.

45
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,868
Now, I want you to take the day,
go get together your personal things,

46
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,272
and then tomorrow,
you get yourself some exercise.

47
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:30,809
You go out for a jog,

48
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:35,041
you give yourself some routines,
and pretty soon you find your legs.

49
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:36,980
How do I get in touch with you?

50
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,150
Don't worry,
we'll be in touch with you soon.

51
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,346
This is just the beginning.

52
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,616
I'll never see Steve again.

53
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:03,935
Thank you.

54
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,169
To know me is to fly with me.

55
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,237
This is where I live.

56
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:14,377
When I run my card, the system
automatically prompts the desk clerk

57
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,513
to greet me with this exact statement.

58
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,188
Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.

59
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,590
It's these kinds of systemized,

60
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,652
friendly touches
that keep my world in orbit.

61
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,263
All the things you probably
hate about travelling,

62
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:05,361
the recycled air, the artificial lighting,
the digital juice dispensers,

63
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:09,067
the cheap sushi,
are warm reminders that I'm home.

64
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,780
Do you want the cancer?

65
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,626
-The what?
-Do you want the cancer?

66
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,254
The cancer?

67
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,562
The can, sir?

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,468
No. I'm fine, thank you.

69
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,127
How much does your life weigh?

70
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,897
Imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

71
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,627
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders.

72
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,625
Feel them?

73
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:14,804
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

74
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:18,469
You start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers,

75
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,139
the knickknacks, the collectibles.

76
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,813
Feel the weight as that adds up.

77
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,680
Then you start adding larger stuff,

78
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:29,848
clothes, tabletop appliances,
lamps, linens,

79
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:31,981
your TV.

80
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,186
The backpack should be
getting pretty heavy now.

81
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,887
And you go bigger.

82
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,989
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.
Stuff it all in there.

83
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,159
Your car, get it in there.

84
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:46,996
Your home, whether it's a studio
apartment or a 2-bedroom house,

85
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,167
I want you to stuff it all
into that backpack.

86
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,873
Now try to walk.

87
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,782
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

88
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,486
This is what we do to ourselves
on a daily basis.

89
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:03,386
We weigh ourselves down
until we can't even move.

90
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:06,755
And make no mistake, moving is living.

91
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:10,152
Now, I'm going to set that backpack
on fire.

92
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,131
What do you want to take out of it?
Photos?

93
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,393
Photos are for people
who can't remember.

94
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:18,164
Drink some ginkgo
and let the photos burn.

95
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:24,100
In fact, let everything burn and imagine
waking up tomorrow with nothing.

96
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,707
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

97
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,686
Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.

98
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,592
Ryan Bingham's office.

99
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,898
You put me in a Dodge Stratus
in Kansas City.

100
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,961
They were completely out of
all full-size sedans.

101
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,131
-Did you try...
-Yes.

102
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,902
I reminded them of your remarkable

103
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,034
No.1 Gold Club status
and years in the program.

104
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,308
They are literally moving mountains
to see you in a Sebring.

105
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,579
Fair enough. Any other messages?

106
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,810
Your sister Kara called.

107
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:07,284
Needs to speak urgently
about your sister's wedding.

108
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:10,618
I told her you were mid-air and
not even I knew your final destination.

109
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,481
-Well done.
-And you got an invitation

110
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:14,549
to speak at Goal quest in Vegas.

111
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,355
Goal quest 20?

112
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:21,033
Every once in a while, I do speaking
engagements, motivational kind of stuff.

113
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,729
But Goal quest?
We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.

114
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,869
It's got a hologram on it.

115
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,568
They're calling it Dos Equips.

116
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:30,734
All right, I'll check in.

117
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,506
-Hold on. I've got Craig Gregory for you.
-Wait...

118
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,705
Fuck.

119
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,583
How is my little road warrior?

120
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,813
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding
into a world of bliss.

121
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,048
Real good numbers out of Phoenix,
Rey guy.

122
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:44,987
Hey, you know that Big Auto
is about to cut

123
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,650
another 10K before the end
of the month?

124
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,488
-No kidding.
-Yeah. Christmas came early.

125
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,256
I wish I could have you
in about 5 places at once,

126
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,161
but I do need you back here in Omaha
by the end of week.

127
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,994
-All right?
-I thought you needed me everywhere.

128
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:57,295
Well, you know, we got something
real big here, a real game changer.

129
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,632
What are we talking about here?

130
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:04,439
You'll see. Today I took my first crap
in 2 weeks, hallelujah.

131
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,280
-That's me hanging up on you.
-Great, love that sound.

132
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,392
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

133
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,263
Yeah, I am.

134
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,306
A little stingy with their miles.
I like Hertz.

135
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,572
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

136
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,478
If a car has over 20,000 miles,
I won't drive it.

137
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:46,740
Maestro doesn't instant checkout.
I like to park and go.

138
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,616
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.

139
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,849
It's funny. You don't seem like a girl
who needs directions.

140
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:54,950
I hate asking for directions.
That's why I get a nav.

141
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,892
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

142
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,662
-Is that a joke?
-Yes.

143
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,194
-Because their kiosk placement blows.
-They never have available upgrades.

144
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,036
Basically, it's a fleet of shit-boxes.

145
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,542
I don't know
how they're still in business.

146
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,704
-I'm Ryan.
-I'm Alex.

147
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:19,977
Maplewood card.

148
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,544
How dare you bring that
into this palace?

149
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,283
Hilton offers equal value and better food,

150
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,552
but the Maplewood gives out
warm cookies at check-in.

151
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:27,854
They got you with the cookies, did they?

152
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,020
Yeah. I'm a sucker for
simulated hospitality.

153
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,723
You know,
there's an industry term for that.

154
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:35,325
It's a mixture of ''faux'' and ''homey.''
''Fumy.''

155
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,001
My God.

156
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,562
I wasn't sure this actually existed.

157
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,574
This is the American Airlines...

158
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:44,906
It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

159
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,783
-What is that, carbon fibber?
-Graphite.

160
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,250
God, I love the weight.

161
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,412
I was pretty excited the day
that bad boy came in.

162
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,251
Yeah. I'll say.

163
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:59,553
I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.

164
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,820
60 thou a year, domestic.

165
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:04,794
-That's not bad.
-Don't patronize me.

166
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,627
-What's your total?
-It's a personal question.

167
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,257
-Please.
-And we hardly know each other.

168
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:11,826
Come on. Show some hubris.
Come on, impress me.

169
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,039
-I bet it's huge.
-You have no idea.

170
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:17,874
How big?

171
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,978
What is it, this big?

172
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:22,481
-This big?
-I don't want to brag.

173
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,482
Come on! Come on.

174
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:28,818
Let's just say I have a number in mind.
I haven't hit it yet.

175
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,721
This is pretty fucking sexy.

176
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:36,318
Hope it doesn't cheapen
our relationship.

177
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,059
We're 2 people who get turned on
by elite status.

178
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,430
I think cheap is our starting point.

179
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,731
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

180
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,174
So, we came up with this master plan,
which was for me

181
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:56,438
to put gauze,
to put bandages on both my hands.

182
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,880
Then we got on the plane,

183
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:02,318
transatlantic, flying to Zurich.

184
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,619
Walked up... Waited till it was dark,

185
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,215
and walked up to the bathroom with her.

186
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,955
Everybody was watching the movie,
and I was like...

187
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,758
Opened up, went inside.

188
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,389
She opened the door for me,

189
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,297
and came in
like she was going to help me.

190
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,666
And then, you know, we gave it
our best shot. It wasn't great.

191
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,568
But it was fun. It was tricky.

192
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,834
-Give me some details.
-Well, it's not so easy.

193
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:24,706
-Have you ever tried it? It's not so easy.
-Yes, I have.

194
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,376
-Really?
-Really.

195
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,179
-You've done that?
-I have done that.

196
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,417
On a transatlantic flight?

197
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:41,426
On a domestic flight. Regional, actually.

198
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,291
-Like nighttimes?
-No, like daytime.

199
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,227
-You...
-What?

200
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:46,758
I mean, how do you do that?

201
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,823
I'm really flexible.

202
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:54,267
Look.

203
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,671
I should throw these out.

204
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,887
We can always use that room
with the ice machine.

205
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,354
Here, look.

206
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,005
Good call on that towel rack.

207
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,475
I like how you burr toed me
in the sofa cushions.

208
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,273
I was improvising.

209
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,414
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

210
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,510
-We got to do this again.
-Yeah.

211
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,690
All right, I'm in Newark on the 12th,
Modesto on the 13th,

212
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,363
Oklahoma City on the 15th.

213
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,797
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by
Albuquerque week of the 16th.

214
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,664
No, but I'll be in Florida on the 20th.

215
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:58,761
-Fort Lauderdale?
-Miami.

216
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,832
-That's nothing.
-40 minutes.

217
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,815
I should probably go back to my room
so I can wake up in my bed.

218
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,321
I think that would be
the ladylike thing to do.

219
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,059
Nice meeting you.

220
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,890
A pleasure.

221
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,466
-Hello?
-Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?

222
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,270
Every family has the one person
who keeps the genealogy in check.

223
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,504
That's my sister Kara, the glue.

224
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:15,108
Fine. You and the kids?

225
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:19,276
Missy's outstanding,
Matthew made varsity. How's the road?

226
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,980
-Couldn't be better.
-Good. So, Ryan?

227
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,044
Yeah?

228
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:25,556
I didn't even want to have to ask you this

229
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:28,787
because I know how you are
about doing things for others,

230
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,489
but we're coming up on 3 weeks
to go to Julie's wedding

231
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,555
and there's something
we could really use your help on.

232
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:34,656
Yeah?

233
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,429
We've been sending people these kits

234
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,096
so they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardboard

235
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:41,662
and then take photos of them
in interesting places,

236
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,470
kind of like that gnome
in the French movie.

237
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:44,566
Why?

238
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,712
Because it's Julie's wedding
and she thinks it would be fun.

239
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,305
-Does it matter why?
-How is Julie?

240
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,313
Would you call her?
She thinks you've turned to butter.

241
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,580
You're awfully isolated the way you live.

242
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,450
Isolated? I'm surrounded.

243
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:59,013
So, your assistant said
you were going to be in Vegas.

244
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:00,115
Did he?

245
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:04,060
Can you get a photo of the cut out
in front of the Luxor pyramid?

246
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,121
The place is a shithole.
Nobody stays there.

247
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,030
Jesus, Ryan,
I'm not asking you to check in.

248
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,228
Can you just take a stupid photo?

249
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,566
I'll try my best.

250
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,339
Thank you for trying your best.

251
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:38,526
Last year, I spent 322 days on the road,

252
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:42,055
which means I had to spend
43 miserable days at home.

253
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:08,119
Hey, neighbour.

254
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,793
Hey. Hi!

255
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,020
Hi. Hey, I signed for this
while you were gone.

256
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,699
Thanks.

257
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,198
-I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.
-Nah.

258
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:28,403
Yeah, it's my sister. I haven't met
the guy yet. They're getting married.

259
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,906
-Lots of luck.
-I know, right?

260
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:34,443
What are you doing tonight?
You want to come over later?

261
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:39,087
I've started seeing somebody.

262
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:41,756
Okay. Great.

263
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,291
Hey, it's good to see you.

264
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:49,532
-You, too.
-It seems like it's been a while this time.

265
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,176
Okay.

266
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,886
I am just... I'm thrilled that
everyone's back under one roof.

267
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,081
Welcome home, boys.

268
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,482
I know there's been a lot of whispering
about why we're here,

269
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,928
so let me jump right in.
Retailers are down 20%.

270
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,431
Auto industry is in the dump.

271
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,831
Housing market
doesn't have a heartbeat.

272
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:26,201
It is one of the worst times on record
for America.

273
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,773
This is our moment.

274
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:34,406
Now, last summer, we received
a dynamite young woman here

275
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,209
from Cornell,

276
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:39,740
and she had some pretty big ideas
that she challenged me with.

277
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,343
And my first reaction was,
''Who does this kid think that she is?''

278
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,719
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out.

279
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,658
So, with a peek into our future,
Natalie Keener.

280
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:55,058
If there's one word I want to
leave you with today, it's this.

281
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,367
''Glacial''?

282
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,203
Glacial.

283
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:05,475
Our global must become local.

284
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,546
This company keeps 23 people
on the road at least 250 days a year.

285
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:14,845
It's expensive, and it's inefficient.

286
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,121
When I came to Craig
3 months ago with this,

287
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,786
he told me, and quite astutely,
it's only a problem if you have a solution.

288
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:25,921
Well, today I stand before you
with just that.

289
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:31,230
You all know Ned in reception.
Today I'm going to fire Ned.

290
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,768
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR
will hire you back this afternoon.

291
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,638
We'll see about that.

292
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:42,576
Now Ned could be any employee in any
one of our clients' locations worldwide.

293
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,775
Strategy packets
will be shipped in advance.

294
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,874
Ned would be given a seat

295
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:48,852
and find one of our transition specialists
waiting for him.

296
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,890
Mr. Laski, the reason
we're having this conversation

297
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,051
is your position is no longer available.

298
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:57,391
I don't understand. I'm fired?

299
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,795
Hearing the words ''you've been let go''
is never easy.

300
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:02,299
Change is always scary,
but consider the following.

301
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,666
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

302
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:05,829
sat where you are now.

303
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:08,896
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

304
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:10,669
That's my fucking line.

305
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,608
But what happens now?

306
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:14,168
This is the first step of a process

307
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,373
that will end with you in a new job
that fulfils you.

308
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:18,279
Yeah. But how does it work?

309
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,215
I want you to take the packet
in front of you.

310
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:23,516
Review it. All the answers
you're looking for are inside.

311
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:25,216
Start filling out
the necessary information,

312
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,020
and before you know it, you'll be
on your way to new opportunities.

313
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,323
Now, Ned,
I need you to go back to your desk

314
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,091
and start putting together your things.

315
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:35,895
As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread the news just yet.

316
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,663
Panic doesn't help anyone.

317
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:39,827
I understand.

318
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:42,736
Give it up for Ned.

319
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:50,504
You can start the morning in Boston,
stop in Dallas over lunch,

320
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,447
and finish the day in San Francisco,

321
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,613
all for the price of a T1 line.

322
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:58,419
Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by 85%.

323
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:01,852
And more importantly
to you guys on the road,

324
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,259
no more Christmases
in a hotel in Tulsa,

325
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,627
no more hours lost to weather delays.

326
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,690
You get to come home.

327
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:13,596
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

328
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,466
That's why I brought
the entire company in from the road,

329
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,066
because we're not taking it seriously.

330
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,169
There is a methodology to what I do.
There is a reason why it works.

331
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:23,237
Coke and IBM have been doing this
for years, all right.

332
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:24,873
Are you familiar with them?

333
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,042
Now just like anything else, you know,

334
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,745
it's going to take a few months
of sort of transition

335
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,913
and then everybody is going to settle in.

336
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:31,182
Who are you taking off the road?

337
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:33,520
How are you not getting this?
You're grounded.

338
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:35,890
Everybody's grounded. It's done.

339
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:39,488
What we do here is brutal,
and it does leave people devastated.

340
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,227
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

341
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:45,600
By stabbing them in the chest
instead of the back, is that right?

342
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:47,468
-You wanted to see me?
-Well...

343
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,166
Yeah. You know what?
Yeah, come on in.

344
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,004
-Come on in here.
-Great job out there, Natalie.

345
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,375
-Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
-Great.

346
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:58,283
Listen, I admire your... Your zeal.

347
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,942
And I think
you have some very good ideas.

348
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:03,784
But you know nothing
about the realities of my industry.

349
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:07,314
You can set up an chat,
but you don't know how people think.

350
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,826
-Actually, I minored in psychology.
-Nice.

351
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,797
-Okay, kiddo, fire me.
-Ryan.

352
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,596
Well, since she's going to be doing this
on a regular basis,

353
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,158
don't you want to know if
she can fire somebody?

354
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,899
-She's fired Ned.
-My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

355
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:24,500
-You don't need to do this.
-No, it's okay. I got this.

356
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:28,139
Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you

357
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:31,671
that your position at this company
is no longer available.

358
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,684
-Who the hell are you?
-My name is Miss Keener.

359
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:36,084
-I'm here today to discuss your future.
-My future?

360
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,747
The only one who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.

361
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:39,415
Mr. Gregory hired me
to handle this for him.

362
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,152
Handle what? Handle me?

363
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,786
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one who can fire me.

364
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,921
You know what?
I'm going to go talk to him.

365
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,363
-Mr. Bingham.
-No, no, no. You can't follow me.

366
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,798
You're on a computer screen,
remember?

367
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,495
-Ryan.
-All right. Let's try this again.

368
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,935
-Fire me again.
-I just did.

369
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,632
Actually, you didn't. Fire me.

370
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:56,139
That's enough. I think we get it.

371
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,903
Mr. Bingham,
I'm here today to inform you

372
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,467
that your position is no longer available.

373
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,181
-I'm fired?
-Yes, you're fired.

374
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,478
-Never say fired.
-You've been let go.

375
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,610
-Why?
-This is a mythical situation.

376
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,244
How could I possibly know why?

377
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,585
Why doesn't matter.
You never know why.

378
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,090
It's important not to focus on the why

379
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:15,456
and rather to spend your energy
thinking about your future.

380
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:18,587
Well, I'm going to spend my energy
on suing you unless you give me

381
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,097
-a good reason why you're firing me.
-Mr. Bingham,

382
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:21,291
the reason's not important.

383
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:24,233
So, you're firing me without grounds?
Now I really have a lawsuit.

384
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,736
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.

385
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:28,830
-Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.
-Personally?

386
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:31,740
This is the most personal situation
that you are ever going to enter,

387
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,973
so before you try to revolutionize
my business,

388
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:38,448
I'd like to know
that you actually know my business.

389
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,985
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.

390
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:53,965
Am I the only one that sees
that by doing this

391
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,897
we're making ourselves irrelevant?

392
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,368
No, frankly, we're making you irrelevant.

393
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,836
-Nice.
-Don't blame me.

394
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:03,363
Blame the high fuel costs. Blame
insurance premiums. Blame technology.

395
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:04,773
You know, you better watch yourself.

396
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:06,674
You're a little too young
to become a dinosaur.

397
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,144
I'm not a dinosaur.

398
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:09,737
I want you to show her the ropes.

399
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:13,410
What do I know what goes on here?
Get Ferguson to do it.

400
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,443
I'm not talking about here.

401
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,288
-No.
-Yeah.

402
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,758
Come on.
You're very, very confident this girl

403
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,419
-doesn't know what she's doing, so...
-Well, I'm sorry.

404
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:26,931
I don't think a MySpace page qualifies
you to rewire an entire company.

405
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,465
Well, then great. Here's your chance.

406
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,660
Go out there, show her the magic,
take her through the paces.

407
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,704
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

408
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:36,971
Now here we go.

409
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,135
Bingham, here's the boat.

410
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:42,671
And here's you.
Do you want to be in the boat?

411
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:44,215
Yeah, alone.

412
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,214
We're ringing the bell.
We're rounding everybody up.

413
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:50,550
You want to stay out there
a little bit longer,

414
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:53,682
you're welcome to do it,
but you will not be alone, okay?

415
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,454
You let me know.

416
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,709
Christ.

417
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,662
-What?
-Follow me.

418
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:11,362
I really like my luggage.

419
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,336
That's exactly what it is, it's luggage.

420
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,373
You know how much time you lose
by checking in?

421
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,570
-I don't know. 5, 10 minutes?
-35 minutes a flight.

422
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:22,169
I travel 270 days a year.

423
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:25,478
That's 157 hours.
That makes 7 days.

424
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:28,181
You're willing to throw away
an entire week on that?

425
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:39,493
You don't need this.
Sorry, you don't need that.

426
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:43,457
You're not going to need that.
They have neck pillows on the plane.

427
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:46,003
This, they have better ones there.

428
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,936
I'll get rid of this.

429
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,169
I can just meet you at security.

430
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:53,942
Thank you.

431
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:58,907
Bingo, Asians.

432
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:01,377
You can't be serious.

433
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,512
Never get behind people
travelling with infants.

434
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:06,318
I've never seen a stroller collapse
in less than 20 minutes.

435
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:07,517
Old people are worse.

436
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:09,184
Their bodies are littered
with hidden metal,

437
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:12,458
and they never seem to appreciate
how little time they have left on earth.

438
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,520
Here you go.

439
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:17,534
5 words. Randomly selected
for additional screening.

440
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:18,830
Asians.

441
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:22,402
They pack light, travel efficiently,
and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.

442
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:24,704
-You've got to love them.
-That's racist.

443
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:27,939
I'm like my mother. I stereotype.
It's faster.

444
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,170
Are you mad at your computer?

445
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,211
I type with purpose.

446
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:05,482
What is it that you're working on
so furiously?

447
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,682
I'm building a workflow
of firing techniques.

448
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:12,348
It's questions and responses,
actions and reactions.

449
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,484
It's a script taking you through
the steps of firing someone.

450
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,152
Who's it for?

451
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:20,027
Well, theoretically,
you could put it in the hands of anyone

452
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:22,225
and they'd be downsizing immediately.

453
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,030
All you have to do is follow the steps.

454
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,764
Natalie, what is it you think we do here?

455
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,102
We prepare the newly unemployed

456
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:31,972
for the emotional and physical hurdles
of job hunting,

457
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,908
while minimizing legal blowback.

458
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,209
That's what we're selling.
It's not what we're doing.

459
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:37,908
Okay. What are we doing?

460
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:40,781
We are here to make limbo tolerable,

461
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:44,987
to ferry wounded souls
across the river of dread

462
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:48,389
until the point where hope
is dimly visible.

463
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:55,192
And then stop the boat, shove them
in the water and make them swim.

464
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:59,226
That was really impressive.
Are you going to put that in your book?

465
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,375
I got to grab this.
I'll meet you at the car rental.

466
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,678
Okay.

467
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,885
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

468
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:19,219
I'm in Hotlanta,
and I need a rib-joint recommend bad.

469
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,316
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

470
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,053
You never called.

471
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,460
Well, I wasn't sure
what was appropriate.

472
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,588
Appropriate?

473
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,634
Ryan, I'm not some waitress
you banged in a snowstorm.

474
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,462
That word has no place
in our vocabulary.

475
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:35,502
I am the woman that you don't have
to worry about.

476
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,836
Sounds like a trap.

477
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,846
Listen, the next time that you're worried
about manners, don't.

478
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:45,080
If you want to call, call.

479
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,517
Just think of me as yourself,
only with a vagina.

480
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:51,119
When am I going to see you?

481
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:54,989
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,

482
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,893
with a connection at ORD into SDF.

483
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,328
-Sorry.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

484
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:04,061
How long's your layover?
They got multiples into SDF.

485
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:05,568
Think you could push?

486
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,900
Yeah, I can push.

487
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:25,085
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.

488
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:29,252
And when I talk about a strategy packet,
hand them one of those.

489
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:31,122
Sounds great.

490
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:34,359
So, although I wish I were here
with better news,

491
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:37,193
the fact is that
you and I are sitting here today

492
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:41,865
because this will be your last week
of employment at this company.

493
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:44,099
-Why me?
-What am I supposed to do now?

494
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:47,235
Am I supposed to feel better
that I'm not the only one losing my job?

495
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:49,075
This is ridiculous!

496
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,945
I have been a fine employee
for over 10 years,

497
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:53,780
and this is the way you treat me.

498
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:57,180
How do you sleep at night, man? How?

499
00:32:57,822 --> 00:33:00,586
How's your family?
They sleeping well at night?

500
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,718
Electricity still on?

501
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,627
Heat still on? Refrigerator full of food?

502
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,389
Gas tank full of gas?

503
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,265
Going to Chuck E. Cheese
this weekend or something?

504
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,564
Not me.

505
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,497
No, my kids,
we're not going to do anything.

506
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:23,213
What do you suggest I tell them?

507
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:30,153
Perhaps you're underestimating
the positive effect

508
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,588
that your career transition
can have on your children.

509
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,523
The positive effect?

510
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:39,123
I make about 90 grand a year now.

511
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:42,956
Unemployment is what,
250 bucks a week?

512
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,559
Is that one of your positive effects?

513
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:46,763
Well, we'll get to be cosier,

514
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,170
because I'm not going to be able
to pay my mortgage on my house.

515
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,730
So, maybe we can move
into a nice fucking

516
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:53,175
one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

517
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,270
And I guess without benefits,

518
00:33:56,348 --> 00:34:00,978
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,
you know, suffers from her asthma

519
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:04,283
that I won't be able to afford
the medication for.

520
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:07,883
Well, tests have shown that children
under moderate trauma

521
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:11,292
have a tendency
to apply themselves academically

522
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:14,231
as a method of coping.

523
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,429
Go fuck yourself.

524
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,800
That's what my kids’ think.

525
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,807
Your children's admiration
is important to you?

526
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,810
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

527
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:29,873
Well, I doubt they ever
admired you, Bob.

528
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:34,106
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?

529
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:37,219
I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake-up call.

530
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:38,983
You know why kids love athletes?

531
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,082
I don't know.
Because they screw lingerie models?

532
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,717
No, that's why we love athletes.

533
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:46,628
Kids love athletes
because they follow their dreams.

534
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,737
-Well, I can't dunk.
-No, but you can cook.

535
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:54,929
What are you talking about?

536
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:58,965
Your resume says that you minored
in French culinary arts.

537
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:02,269
Most students,
they work on the fryer at KFC,

538
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:05,578
but you bussed tables at El Picador
to support yourself.

539
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:09,245
And then you get out of college
and you come and you work here.

540
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,380
How much did they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?

541
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:14,820
27 grand a year.

542
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:16,861
And when were you going to stop

543
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:19,920
and come back
and do what makes you happy?

544
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,059
Good question.

545
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:26,831
I see guys who work at
the same company for their entire lives,

546
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:28,839
guys exactly like you.

547
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:30,932
They clock in, they clock out,

548
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:33,944
and they never have
a moment of happiness.

549
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:38,238
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

550
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,579
This is a rebirth.

551
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:44,722
Now, if not for you,
do it for your children.

552
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:16,420
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?

553
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:20,151
We reserve priority assistance
for our Hilton Honours members.

554
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:23,558
The promotions are great.
You should check it out.

555
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,133
Hungry much?

556
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:34,427
Our business expense
allots $40 each for dinner.

557
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:37,168
I plan on grabbing
as many miles as I can.

558
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:39,472
Okay, you got to fill me in
on the miles thing.

559
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:40,909
What is that about?

560
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:44,210
Are you talking about, like,
frequent flyer miles?

561
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:47,542
-You really want to know?
-I'm dying to know.

562
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:49,914
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it

563
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,082
unless it somehow profits
my mileage account.

564
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:55,887
So, what are you saving up for,
Hawaii, South of France?

565
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,952
It's not like that. The miles are the goal.

566
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,257
That's it?

567
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,391
You're saving just to save?

568
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:06,198
Let's just say that I have a number
in mind and I haven't hit it yet.

569
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:08,535
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?

570
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,001
I'd rather not.

571
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,768
Is it a secret target?

572
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:17,104
It's 10 million miles.

573
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:20,209
Okay. Isn't 10 million just a number?

574
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:23,448
-Pi's just a number.
-Well, we all need a hobby.

575
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:27,048
No, I...
I don't mean to belittle your collection.

576
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,093
I get it. It sounds cool.

577
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,891
I'd be the 7th person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.

578
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:36,923
-Do they throw you a parade?
-You get lifetime executive status.

579
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,366
You get to meet the chief pilot,

580
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:39,528
Maynard Finch.

581
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:41,231
And they put your name
on the side of a plane.

582
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,206
Men get such hard-ones
from putting their name on stuff.

583
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:45,469
You guys don't grow up.
It's like you need to pee on everything.

584
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:47,010
Now who's stereotyping?

585
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:50,946
Fear of mortality. It's like,
''Yeah, you're going to die one day.''

586
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:53,813
And why do you suppose
that's singular to men?

587
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:55,409
Probably because you can't have babies.

588
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,010
The baby argument.

589
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:03,784
If I had that many miles,

590
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:05,719
I would show up at an airport,

591
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:09,164
look at the destination board,
pick a place and go.

592
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:47,160
Thanks for the advice.

593
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,382
Jesus.

594
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,604
Okay. Closer.

595
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:33,182
Way closer.

596
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,080
Still closer.

597
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:38,918
Closer. Okay.

598
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,085
A little left.

599
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:44,284
Okay, down a little.

600
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,020
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.

601
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:51,900
I don't get it. Why does your sister
want a fake photo?

602
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,529
My sister is kooky.
She thinks this is charming.

603
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:55,799
It's like the gnome thing.

604
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:57,602
No, I mean,
why would your sister want a fake photo

605
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,472
in front of the St. Louis airport?

606
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:01,444
Are you kidding, Lambert Field?

607
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:03,173
The Wright brothers flew through there.

608
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:06,375
That domed main terminal,
it's the first of its kind.

609
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:09,579
It's a precursor from everything,
from JFK to de Gaulle.

610
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:12,316
-Pretty sweet.
-Just take the picture.

611
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,489
Well, that's a keeper.

612
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,422
Let me see it.

613
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,255
Why she wants dozens of reminders

614
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,961
of all the places she hasn't been
is beyond me.

615
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,334
Well, I'm sure she'll be crushed
for having missed this airport.

616
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,339
Look, before Lindbergh could cross
the Atlantic,

617
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,341
he took off from one of those runways.

618
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,775
Do you ever wonder why they called it
the Spirit of St. Louis?

619
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,608
-No.
-Well...

620
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:46,748
Do you know how fucked
this place is now?

621
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,883
I am the one thing, the one thing,

622
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,794
preventing this place
from being totally fucked in the ass.

623
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,538
Sometimes they just need to vent.

624
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:07,609
Please, for the love of God,
can I fire the next one?

625
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,038
-Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.
-I'm here to be fired, right?

626
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,314
Well, we're here to talk about
your future.

627
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:18,446
You don't have to sugar coat it.
I get the drill.

628
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:20,354
What are they offering?

629
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:23,120
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly
worked out severance package.

630
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,253
Give me the bullet points.

631
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:27,621
It's actually pretty good.

632
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,962
3 months' pay, 6 months' medical

633
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:33,003
and a full year of placement services
through our company, CTC.

634
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,834
Placement services. That's generous.

635
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,410
Commonly, it takes one month of
searching for every $10,000

636
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,673
you expect to earn in salary.

637
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:45,238
So, I could be looking for a while.

638
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:47,409
-Not necessarily.
-Don't even sweat it.

639
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,476
I'm pretty confident about my plans.

640
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,079
-Really?
-Yeah.

641
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:55,490
There's this beautiful bridge
by my house.

642
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,251
I'm going to go jump off it.

643
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:01,225
Natalie.

644
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,725
Hey!

645
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,465
Natalie!

646
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:15,904
People say these things all the time.

647
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,572
It's part of the trade.

648
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,138
-They do?
-Yeah.

649
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:21,879
I mean, they say crazy things.

650
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,184
They get worked up.

651
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:27,157
She was really calm.

652
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,752
I think that's a good sign.

653
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:32,118
So, they don't ever actually do it?

654
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:34,187
No. No, it's just talk.

655
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,791
How do you know? Do you follow up?

656
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:39,928
I mean, no.
Nothing good's going to come of that.

657
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,398
I wouldn't worry about it.

658
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,333
This is what we do, Natalie.

659
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,278
We take people at their most fragile,
and we set them adrift.

660
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,612
You ready to go back in?

661
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,720
All right, let's go. Come on.

662
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,731
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.

663
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:50,162
I'll be back soon.

664
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,506
I'm not really sure how long
this whole exercise is supposed to last.

665
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:56,045
No, I don't even think of him that way.
He's old.

666
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:38,279
I'm done?

667
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,381
I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.

668
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,447
Just like that?

669
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:45,325
I'm disappointed that I've given
so much of my life...

670
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:46,761
This is not fair.

671
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:49,231
There are people that are going to be
way more qualified than me now.

672
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,564
I don't know what to do when I wake up
in the morning tomorrow.

673
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,035
Are you okay?

674
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,713
-Are we going?
-Yeah.

675
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:26,235
This is how I start every day of my life.

676
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:31,702
Now, this is going to be a little difficult,
so stay with me.

677
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:33,710
You have a new backpack.

678
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:37,214
Only this time,
I want you to fill it with people.

679
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:40,849
Start with casual acquaintances,
friends of friends,

680
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:43,215
folks around the office.

681
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,413
And then you move into the people

682
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:46,479
that you trust with
your most intimate secrets.

683
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,219
Your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

684
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:52,194
your brothers, your sisters,
your parents.

685
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:57,791
And finally your husband, your wife,
your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

686
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,804
You get them into that backpack.

687
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:06,571
Don't worry. I'm not going to ask you
to light it on fire.

688
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:10,104
Feel the weight of that bag.

689
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:13,445
Make no mistake,
your relationships are the heaviest

690
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:15,542
components in your life.

691
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:20,587
Do you feel the straps
cutting into your shoulders?

692
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:27,493
All those negotiations and arguments
and secrets and compromises.

693
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:34,133
You don't need to carry all that weight.

694
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:36,939
Why don't you set that bag down?

695
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:41,376
Some animals were meant
to carry each other,

696
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:44,107
to live symbiotically for a lifetime.

697
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:47,281
Star-crossed lovers,
monogamous swans.

698
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:49,342
We are not those animals.

699
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:54,616
The slower we move, the faster we die.

700
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:56,887
We are not swans.

701
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,054
We're sharks.

702
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:15,678
-Never?
-No.

703
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,713
-Ever?
-No.

704
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,747
-You never want to get married?
-Nope.

705
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:23,184
-Never want kids?
-Not a chance.

706
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:25,051
-Ever?
-Never.

707
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:28,584
-Is that so bizarre?
-Yes.

708
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:30,459
Yes, it is.

709
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:33,361
I just don't see the value in it.

710
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:36,723
-All right, sell it to me.
-What?

711
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,563
Sell me marriage.

712
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,762
-Okay, how about love?
-Okay.

713
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,666
Stability, just somebody
you can count on.

714
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,769
How many stable marriages
do you know?

715
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:51,781
Somebody to talk to,
someone to spend your life with.

716
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:55,842
I'm surrounded by people to talk to.
I doubt that's going to change.

717
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,086
How about just not dying alone?

718
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:00,917
Starting when I was 12,

719
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:03,653
we moved each one of
my grandparents into a nursing facility.

720
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:05,524
My parents went the same way.

721
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:08,087
Make no mistake, we all die alone.

722
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:13,096
Now, those cult members in San Diego
with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers,

723
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:15,401
they didn't die alone.

724
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:18,066
I'm just saying there are options.

725
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:22,545
Fuck.

726
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:25,572
Brian left me.

727
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:34,590
All right.

728
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,660
Okay, okay. All right.

729
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:42,098
All right.

730
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:45,527
Yeah.

731
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,001
Hey.

732
00:48:57,081 --> 00:49:00,278
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.
This is Natalie.

733
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,811
I should give you both a moment.

734
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,650
No. No, that's fine.

735
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:08,419
I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.

736
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:13,193
Maybe we should just all go up
to our rooms and freshen up.

737
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:14,928
Or maybe a drink?

738
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:16,233
Now you're talking.

739
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:22,105
He broke up with you
over text message?

740
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:25,471
It's kind of like firing someone
over the Internet.

741
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:28,506
What a weasels prick.

742
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:30,740
Yeah. But what does that make me?

743
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:33,374
-Someone who falls for a prick.
-We all fall for them.

744
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,248
Pricks are spontaneous,
they're unpredictable, and they're fun.

745
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,653
And then we're surprised
when they turn out to be pricks.

746
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:41,816
I followed him to Omaha.

747
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,291
You did?

748
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:45,123
I had a job waiting for me
in San Francisco

749
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:47,720
when he got an offer from ConAgra.

750
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,327
He said we could start a life together.

751
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,060
So, I followed him.

752
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:55,605
To Nebraska?

753
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:00,903
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

754
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,179
No offense.

755
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:05,613
-None taken.
-That's all right.

756
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:09,978
When I was 16,
I thought by 23 I'd be married,

757
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:11,779
maybe have a kid,

758
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:14,915
corner office by day,
entertaining at night.

759
00:50:14,992 --> 00:50:16,926
I was supposed to be driving
a Grand Cherokee by now.

760
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:19,929
Yeah, life can underwhelm you that way.

761
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:23,332
I mean, where did you think
you'd be by...

762
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,764
It doesn't work that way.

763
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:29,897
At a certain point,
you stop with the deadlines.

764
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:31,736
It can be a little counterproductive.

765
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,800
I don't want to say anything
that's anti-feminist.

766
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:37,244
I really appreciate everything
that your generation did for me.

767
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:38,804
-It was our pleasure.
-Well done.

768
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:41,851
But sometimes it feels like
no matter how much success I have,

769
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:44,547
it's not going to matter
until I find the right guy.

770
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:47,889
You really thought this guy
was the one?

771
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,255
I could have made it work.

772
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:53,492
He... He really fit the bill.

773
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:56,089
-You know?
-The bill?

774
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,134
White-collar, college grad,

775
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:03,131
loves dogs, likes funny movies,
6'1'', brown hair, kind eyes,

776
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:07,337
works in finance but is outdoorsy,
you know, on the weekends.

777
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:15,149
I always imagined he'd have a single
syllable name like Matt or John or Dave.

778
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,585
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner.

779
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:22,489
And the only thing he loves
more than me is his golden Lab.

780
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,454
And a nice smile.

781
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:30,629
-What about you?
-Let me think.

782
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,529
You know, honestly,
by the time you're 34,

783
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:38,370
all the physical requirements
just go out the window.

784
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:42,344
I mean, like, you secretly pray
that he'll be taller than you,

785
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:44,974
and not an asshole would be nice.

786
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,915
Just someone who enjoys my company,
comes from a good family.

787
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,715
Because you don't think about that
when you're younger.

788
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:53,586
I don't know. Someone who wants kids.

789
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,518
Likes kids. Wants kids.

790
00:51:57,561 --> 00:52:00,189
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

791
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:06,562
Please let him earn more money
than I do.

792
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:09,606
You might not understand that now,
but believe me, you will one day.

793
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:12,540
Otherwise, that's a recipe for disaster.

794
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:16,771
And hopefully some hair on his head,

795
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:20,708
but, I mean, even that's not
a deal breaker these days.

796
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:25,713
A nice smile.

797
00:52:27,825 --> 00:52:31,056
Yeah, a nice smile.
Nice smile just might do it.

798
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:36,055
That was depressing.

799
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:40,429
-I should just date women.
-Tried it.

800
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:43,233
We're no picnic ourselves.

801
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,278
I don't mind being married to my career,

802
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:54,143
and I don't expect it to hold me in bed
as I fall asleep.

803
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:00,353
I just don't want to settle.

804
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:04,726
You're young. Right now you see
settling as some sort of a failure.

805
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:07,457
It is, by definition.

806
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:12,634
Yeah. But by the time someone is right
for you, it won't feel like settling.

807
00:53:12,703 --> 00:53:14,193
And the only person left to judge you

808
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:17,968
will be the 23-year-old girl
with a target on your back.

809
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:24,203
So, what's the plan for the evening?

810
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:28,781
Well, we were going to hit that party
for the tech conference at the hotel.

811
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,581
I didn't know you could just attend those.

812
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,849
I thought you had to be registered.

813
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,322
Well, technically, I don't think

814
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:37,121
-it's open to the public.
-Just going to stop by.

815
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,587
You're going to crash it?

816
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:42,290
-They throw a really nice party.
-Well, they have more money

817
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:44,800
-than they know what to do with.
-And they have a good time, usually.

818
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:47,132
No, no, I get it. I'm in.

819
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:09,683
Jennifer Chu?

820
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,318
-Shit!
-It'll be fine.

821
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:36,679
Doing all right?

822
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:40,582
Yeah. This was a great idea.

823
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,454
You're so pretty.

824
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:48,660
You're exactly
what I want to look like in 15 years.

825
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:50,896
Thank you, Natalie.

826
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:52,829
You should dance.

827
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:57,699
-Come on.
-No, no, no.

828
00:54:57,774 --> 00:54:59,298
Come on.

829
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:19,391
-Hi. I'm Dave.
-I'm Natalie.

830
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:22,091
Who's Jennifer?

831
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,257
I don't know.

832
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,505
All right.
How's everybody doing out there?

833
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:34,575
All right. Right about now, give it up
for a very special alpha TECH guest.

834
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:36,738
Young MC!

835
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:40,949
What's up, alpha TECH?

836
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:44,618
I got a busted computer at home.
Can somebody fix it for me?

837
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:19,377
Bust a move!

838
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:20,821
-Say, "Yeah!"
-Yeah!

839
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,118
-Say, "Oh, yeah!"
-Oh, yeah!

840
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:25,052
-Say, "Bust a move!"
-Bust a move!

841
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:26,852
-Say, "Bust a move!"
-Bust a move!

842
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,398
-Let me hear you say, "Yeah!"
-Yeah!

843
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:36,300
I want you to have a key to my place.

844
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:43,078
I had no idea we were
at that point in our relationship.

845
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,507
Yes.

846
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:50,913
Where is she?

847
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:54,750
Lying in my bed I hear the

848
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:58,386
Clock tick and think of you

849
00:56:58,462 --> 00:57:01,454
Caught up in circles

850
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:05,729
Confusion is nothing new

851
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:07,235
Flash back

852
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,465
To warm nights

853
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,174
Almost left behind

854
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:17,069
Suitcase of memories

855
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:18,739
Time after

856
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:21,682
Sometimes you picture me...

857
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:29,153
Back home I don't get to act the way
I do with you.

858
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:33,094
-That's why I don't have a back home.
-I know.

859
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,991
You're so cool.

860
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:37,490
Mr. Empty Backpack.

861
00:57:39,002 --> 00:57:40,833
-You know about my backpack?
-I goggled you.

862
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:42,166
You did?

863
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,764
It's what us modern girls do
when we have a crush.

864
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,633
Did it bother you?

865
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:48,871
It depends.

866
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:51,243
Is the bag empty
because you hate people

867
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:53,407
or because you hate the baggage
that they come along with?

868
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:55,974
I don't hate people.
I'm not exactly a hermit.

869
00:57:56,052 --> 00:58:00,512
You just don't want to be tied down
with the whole responsibility thing?

870
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:04,154
I don't know what originally sparked
the backpack.

871
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:06,195
Probably needed to be alone.

872
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:11,725
Recently, I've been thinking
that I needed to empty the backpack

873
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:14,964
before I knew what to put back in it.

874
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:36,522
-No!
-I think we're out of gas.

875
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,262
Hey. You're up?

876
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:23,470
Yeah, I have to fly standby
and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

877
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:26,568
Okay.

878
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,179
I made you feel cheap.

879
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:34,281
It's all right.
Just leave the money on the dresser.

880
00:59:35,118 --> 00:59:38,144
I'll text you later
so we can swap schedules.

881
00:59:41,524 --> 00:59:42,650
Hey.

882
00:59:44,628 --> 00:59:46,357
I really like you.

883
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:50,723
-I like you, too.
-Good.

884
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,933
Go catch your plane.

885
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,175
Last night...

886
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:12,947
It was kind of out of hand,
and I said things...

887
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:17,552
I'm not actually sure of everything
that I said,

888
01:00:17,627 --> 01:00:20,425
-but I didn't want you to think...
-Just relax.

889
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:22,988
It was nice to see you cut loose.

890
01:00:23,366 --> 01:00:25,630
So, did you wake him up or slip out?

891
01:00:27,404 --> 01:00:30,134
-What?
-This morning. Your new friend.

892
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:31,696
Did you wake him up
for an awkward goodbye

893
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:34,869
or did you just slip out
and make him feel like a whore?

894
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,978
-I just left.
-Protocol's always tricky.

895
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,183
What happened to Alex?

896
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:47,348
She had to leave town early
to get to a meeting.

897
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:50,587
-That's too bad. Where does she live?
-Chicago.

898
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:53,386
Thinking of going to see her?

899
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:55,829
We don't really have that
kind of relationship. Try right over there.

900
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:57,457
That direction.

901
01:00:57,968 --> 01:01:01,199
What kind of relationship do you have?

902
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:03,830
Well, you know, casual.

903
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:07,739
-Sounds pretty special.
-It works for us.

904
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:12,447
Don't you think there's a future there?

905
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,813
I never really thought about it.
What's going on here?

906
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:17,444
-Really never thought about it?
-No.

907
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:21,315
How can you not think about that?

908
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:22,915
How does it not even cross your mind

909
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,722
that you might want
a future with someone?

910
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:27,820
It's simple. You know that moment
when you look into somebody's eyes

911
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:30,229
and you can feel them
staring into your soul

912
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,861
and the whole world goes quiet
just for a second?

913
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:36,132
-Yes.
-Right. Well, I don't.

914
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,399
-You're an asshole.
-No.

915
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:41,307
Look, I'm just decking around. Come on.
Give me a hand.

916
01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:42,868
Don't you think it's worth
giving her a chance?

917
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:45,710
-A chance to what?
-A chance at something real.

918
01:01:45,782 --> 01:01:48,478
Natalie, your definition of real
is going to evolve as you get older.

919
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:50,485
Can you stop condescending
for one second

920
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:53,147
or is that one of the principles
of your bullshit philosophy?

921
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:55,885
-Bullshit philosophy?
-The isolation, the travelling.

922
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:58,484
-Is that supposed to be charming?
-No, it's simply a life choice.

923
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:01,826
-It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
-Big words.

924
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:03,493
Screw you.

925
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:05,329
Screw you, too.

926
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:07,927
You have set up a way of life
that basically makes it impossible

927
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:09,938
for you to have any kind of
human connection.

928
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,337
And now this woman comes along

929
01:02:11,408 --> 01:02:14,844
and somehow runs the gauntlet
of your ridiculous life choice

930
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:18,506
and comes out on the other end smiling
just so you can call her ''casual''?

931
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:21,379
I need to grow up?
You're a 12-year-old.

932
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:23,978
I don't have a gauntlet...

933
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,318
Fuck.

934
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:12,091
Now, listen,
these Detroit guys can be tough.

935
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:13,328
They've been getting hammered.

936
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:15,462
So, you don't get distracted.
Stick with the simple stuff.

937
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:19,838
You get these packets in their hand
and you get them out the door, okay?

938
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:34,853
Hey, welcome to Detroit.

939
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:36,655
What's going on here?

940
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,751
I've been looking at those
great numbers over the last few days.

941
01:03:38,828 --> 01:03:41,092
I thought maybe we should just nut up
and give this a try.

942
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:42,495
We could use a little more time.

943
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:45,500
Well, you got to leave the nest
at some point.

944
01:03:45,568 --> 01:03:48,196
This is a real company, Craig.
We're here to do some damage.

945
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:50,501
I know. It's a good thing
we brought our best, okay.

946
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:52,040
Let's stop screwing around.

947
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:55,202
All right. Just give me a minute
to prepare and get my things together.

948
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:58,645
I was thinking that Natalie
was going to take this one.

949
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,239
She's hardly ready for that.

950
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,546
I've been watching her results
the last few days. She's great.

951
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:04,018
This is a whole other animal.

952
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:06,112
You know, she created it
and everything, right?

953
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:08,589
Natalie, are you not up for it?

954
01:04:10,793 --> 01:04:13,159
-Yeah, I'm game.
-That's my girl.

955
01:04:14,597 --> 01:04:18,761
Just remember, don't apologize,
don't tell them how hard this is for you.

956
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:21,201
Today's one of the worst days
they're ever going to have in their life.

957
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,762
How we feel doesn't even compare.

958
01:04:25,008 --> 01:04:26,669
-Got it.
-All right. Just keep it professional.

959
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:28,267
You'll be fine.

960
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:34,239
What's all this? What's going on?

961
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:38,048
Hello, Mr. Samuels.
I wish I were here with better news.

962
01:04:39,756 --> 01:04:43,783
However, your position here
at Wertheimer is no longer available.

963
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,055
What are you talking about?

964
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:48,953
You've been let go.

965
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:51,628
Just like that?

966
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:54,993
Who are you?

967
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:58,373
My name is Miss Keener,

968
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,166
and I'm here today
to talk about your options.

969
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:04,008
I worked for this company for 17 years

970
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,776
and they send a 4th-grader
to can me?

971
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,114
What the fuck is this?

972
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:21,855
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

973
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:24,559
However, the sooner you can
tell yourself that greater

974
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,431
-opportunities are waiting for you...
-Greater opportunities?

975
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:28,732
I'm 57 fucking years old.

976
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,171
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

977
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:35,677
sat where you are now.

978
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:41,749
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

979
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:49,883
There's a packet in front of you. I want
you to take some time and review it.

980
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:54,992
All the answers you're looking for
are inside those pages.

981
01:05:58,635 --> 01:06:00,535
The sooner you trust the process,

982
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:04,266
the sooner the next step of your life
will unveil itself.

983
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:13,246
I need you to go back to your office now

984
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,410
and start putting together
your personal things.

985
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:37,206
Mr. Samuels,
that's all we can discuss now.

986
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:43,001
Mr. Samuels.

987
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:53,612
Mr. Samuels.

988
01:06:57,527 --> 01:06:59,154
Mr. Samuels!

989
01:07:15,378 --> 01:07:17,005
You did good.

990
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:21,875
You okay? You want me to take over?

991
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:23,882
No, I'm all right.

992
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:41,696
No. Look, we just got here.

993
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,535
That's one place.
I think we need to try a few more.

994
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:46,766
Maybe it doesn't make a difference,

995
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:49,334
but it's comforting to know
that we're in the next room.

996
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:52,540
I know you don't give a shit
about my comfort.

997
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:56,210
I think we could try a few more,
that's all I'm saying.

998
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:01,216
Fine.

999
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:06,818
All right. Okay. All right.

1000
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:18,072
He thought you did a great job.
You did. I'm real proud of you.

1001
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:20,504
Thanks.

1002
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:25,478
They're pulling us off the road.

1003
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,808
We're going home.

1004
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:31,620
Really? For good?

1005
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:33,950
Yeah.

1006
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:37,590
Good job.

1007
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:07,280
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex.
That was out of line.

1008
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,324
It's all right. I understand.

1009
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:12,953
I mean, who am I to be doling out
relationship advice, right?

1010
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:14,462
No kidding.

1011
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:20,836
Are you going to be okay?

1012
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,866
-What do you mean?
-In Omaha?

1013
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:28,438
I don't know.

1014
01:09:30,613 --> 01:09:32,945
It's better than you'd think.

1015
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:43,622
Ryan.

1016
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,290
Ryan. Where are you going?

1017
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:49,058
I'm grabbing another flight.
Something I've got to take care of.

1018
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:51,224
I'll see you back at home.

1019
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:13,019
Okay, just walk it in a little.

1020
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:14,947
A little more.

1021
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,684
There you go. Yeah.

1022
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,692
Got it.

1023
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:28,302
They're a cute couple.

1024
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:31,631
-You think so?
-Yeah, they'll make cute kids.

1025
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:35,604
How do you like Wisconsin in February?

1026
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:38,611
I like it if you're there.

1027
01:10:38,681 --> 01:10:40,649
And I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

1028
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:42,581
Northern Wisconsin.

1029
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:46,718
What are you doing this weekend?

1030
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,149
-No.
-What, I haven't...

1031
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:54,026
-Well, you want me to be your date?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1032
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:58,032
-At your sister's wedding?
-It's not like I know her that well.

1033
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:01,199
Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?

1034
01:11:01,537 --> 01:11:04,597
But for the first time in my life,
I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.

1035
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:07,472
I want a dance partner.
I want a ''plus one.''

1036
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:10,876
And if you can stomach it,
I'd like it to be you.

1037
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:38,337
Excuse me. Are you available?

1038
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:42,141
This line's for members
of our Matterhorn Program.

1039
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,150
Hey. Ryan.

1040
01:11:50,486 --> 01:11:53,148
-Hey.
-Kara. Hi.

1041
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:55,486
-Hi.
-Hey. Hi.

1042
01:11:55,658 --> 01:11:57,148
Alex, this is my sister Kara.

1043
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:58,853
-Hi.
-Well, hello.

1044
01:12:00,296 --> 01:12:03,026
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

1045
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,534
So, you two are dating?

1046
01:12:09,005 --> 01:12:11,599
-Not exactly.
-Well, hey, don't worry about it.

1047
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:14,939
We're all getting a little old
to be calling someone girlfriend.

1048
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:17,479
I remember when Mom
used to call Jack her boyfriend.

1049
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:21,482
God. Drove me up the wall.
Boyfriends are for kids, right?

1050
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:25,212
So, what are you doing at the hotel?

1051
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:30,850
Yeah. Okay, Frank and I are trying out
a trial separation.

1052
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,987
I'm sorry.
So, you're not staying at the house?

1053
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:35,087
No, there was a room on hold here,

1054
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:37,997
so I thought I'd just take it
for the weekend.

1055
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,797
-So, the rehearsal dinner.
-Yeah, tonight. I'll see you two there.

1056
01:12:48,244 --> 01:12:49,677
Nice digs.

1057
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:54,510
There's a packet.

1058
01:13:00,856 --> 01:13:02,721
Hey, look who's here.

1059
01:13:03,325 --> 01:13:04,815
-My God!
-He finally made it.

1060
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:07,021
-My God! Ryan!
-Hey.

1061
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:10,092
Hi.

1062
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:14,725
-You must be Alex.
-Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?

1063
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,739
-You are so beautiful. Kara was right.
-Thank you.

1064
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:24,073
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

1065
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:26,372
I do?
You're the one that's getting married.

1066
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,212
I know, right?

1067
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:31,745
You haven't even seen my ring.

1068
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:35,089
-Look at that.
-It's lovely.

1069
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:37,785
-Jim designed it.
-That's...

1070
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,350
Hey, Jim.

1071
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:43,656
-Hey.
-How's it going?

1072
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:46,293
-Hey. I'm Ryan.
-Jim. Good to meet you.

1073
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:48,461
-Alex. Pleasure.
-Pleasure.

1074
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:51,736
Thank you, guys, for coming.

1075
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,540
Brother!

1076
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:58,239
-It's true, though.
-Yeah, it's crazy.

1077
01:13:59,448 --> 01:14:01,416
I got the pictures you asked me to get.

1078
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:03,975
You can just put them right there.

1079
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,678
Yeah, okay.

1080
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:39,184
You got so many of them up there,
I almost didn't have room.

1081
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:42,452
I know. It's so great.
Everyone just chipped in.

1082
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:46,293
What gave you the idea
to do something so...

1083
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:47,386
Substantial.

1084
01:14:47,463 --> 01:14:53,424
Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
invested in this real estate venture.

1085
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,199
It's a real estate investment.

1086
01:14:56,272 --> 01:14:59,241
It's exciting,
but we went over our finances and...

1087
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:01,242
A honeymoon just kind of at this state
in the game

1088
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,335
just doesn't really seem affordable.

1089
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:05,573
So, you know, we just thought,

1090
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:09,243
''Just because we can't travel
doesn't mean we can't have pictures.''

1091
01:15:09,318 --> 01:15:11,946
-No, I think that's a fabulous idea.
-Yeah, it's a good one.

1092
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:14,785
I mean,
the concept is turnkey everything.

1093
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:17,382
Okay? You buy a maintenance contract
when you get the home.

1094
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:19,791
You know, we'll whack your weeds,
we'll change your light bulbs.

1095
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:21,261
Furniture, you can bring your own

1096
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,560
or else you can pick one
of our beautiful packages.

1097
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:26,362
Seamless traditionalism,
yet all the perks.

1098
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:27,697
Nice.

1099
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,533
And we all need a place to call our own.

1100
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:32,699
This is America.
This is what we were promised.

1101
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:35,504
-It's a nice touch.
-What?

1102
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:38,872
The bit at the end about the promise.
I like that part.

1103
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:40,609
Thanks.

1104
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:46,552
You... You still renting
that one-bedroom?

1105
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:50,190
-No. I gave it up.
-So, you own now?

1106
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:52,386
-No.
-But you're looking?

1107
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:55,188
No, not really.

1108
01:15:56,599 --> 01:15:58,464
So, you're just good?

1109
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:00,533
I'm good.

1110
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:02,631
Well, that's good.

1111
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:06,038
Can you believe it's tomorrow?
How are you going to sleep?

1112
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,632
I don't know.

1113
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:11,643
-Well, do you want some Xanax?
-I don't think that's for sleeping.

1114
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:15,480
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have
a glass of warm milk.

1115
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:18,349
-That'll do the trick.
-Okay. See you tomorrow.

1116
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,751
-Okay.
-Bye.

1117
01:16:19,822 --> 01:16:20,811
Bye.

1118
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:23,221
Hey. There's another box inside.

1119
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,021
-I'll grab it.
-You sure?

1120
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:26,823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:39,274
-Jim seems like a good guy.
-Yeah, isn't he great?

1122
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:42,003
He's going to make a great husband.

1123
01:16:43,712 --> 01:16:45,612
You know, Julie, I was thinking,

1124
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,411
you know, with Dad not being here,

1125
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:53,987
I was wondering if you had anybody
to walk you down the aisle.

1126
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:56,984
Yeah.

1127
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:00,859
No, Jim's uncle is going to do it.

1128
01:17:01,263 --> 01:17:03,458
He's been really supportive.

1129
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:05,423
He's been great.

1130
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,629
Well, good. That's great.
I just wanted to make sure that you...

1131
01:17:09,571 --> 01:17:12,369
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.

1132
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:17,943
So, I should be there, what?

1133
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:20,481
Yeah, the guests
are arriving around 5:00,

1134
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:24,610
and things get going at 5:30,
so around then.

1135
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:26,086
Okay.

1136
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:32,888
Let me... I'm going to help you with those.

1137
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:34,857
Got it.

1138
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,399
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1139
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:50,470
None of that was here.

1140
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:52,309
This is all new.

1141
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:04,824
Really?

1142
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:08,159
-Is that all you got?
-What?

1143
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:17,432
Give me a boost.

1144
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:20,739
Watch...

1145
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:23,174
Hang on.

1146
01:18:30,486 --> 01:18:32,147
I took Geography in here.

1147
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:35,813
You ever fool around
with one of your teachers?

1148
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:38,917
-No. Did you?
-No. Not until college.

1149
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,591
That's me on the right.

1150
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:50,604
It's kind of hard to tell.

1151
01:18:50,672 --> 01:18:53,140
You can tell by the eyebrows.

1152
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:56,336
-You played basketball?
-I was a point guard.

1153
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:57,879
Don't act so surprised.

1154
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,540
I didn't know you were such a jock.

1155
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,010
That's me, too.

1156
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:05,652
And that.

1157
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:10,590
-My first fight.
-How'd it go?

1158
01:19:10,659 --> 01:19:12,388
Got my ass kicked.

1159
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,959
This is where we used to go
to make out.

1160
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:19,895
Yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.

1161
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:27,909
Go, Cougars!

1162
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:35,879
I'm really happy I came here.

1163
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:37,575
So am I.

1164
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:44,757
It's Kara.

1165
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:47,859
-Hey.
-Ryan, where are you?

1166
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,557
We're having a meltdown here.

1167
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:50,723
What's going on? What happened?

1168
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,233
It's Jim. Can you get back here?
We need your help.

1169
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:54,599
Okay.

1170
01:19:56,305 --> 01:19:57,863
We got to go.

1171
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,305
-I'll grab your suit.
-Thanks.

1172
01:20:23,065 --> 01:20:25,829
-What happened?
-Jim's got cold feet.

1173
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:28,768
-Today?
-Yeah, that's how cold feet work.

1174
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:31,431
-What do you want me to do?
-Talk to him.

1175
01:20:31,507 --> 01:20:34,567
-You want me to talk to him?
-Hey, it's either you or me.

1176
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:37,305
You know my track record.
I've already struck out once.

1177
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,643
I haven't been to bat.
I haven't been in the dugout.

1178
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:42,115
Don't you talk for a living?
Motivational-type stuff?

1179
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:44,379
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

1180
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,644
What kind of
fucked-up message is that?

1181
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,212
-It's a philosophy.
-It's stupid.

1182
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,087
Hey, it could have helped you.

1183
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:56,029
Ryan, you haven't been around much.
Fuck, basically, you don't exist to us.

1184
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:59,291
I know you want to be there for her.

1185
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:03,128
Well, here it is. This is your chance.

1186
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,984
Hey. What's up, Ryan?

1187
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:31,031
-Jim.
-You ever read this before?

1188
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:35,793
-Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
-Yeah, I'll say.

1189
01:21:40,742 --> 01:21:44,269
Kara mentioned that
you were having some thoughts.

1190
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:49,109
I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.

1191
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:52,876
And why would you say that today?

1192
01:21:54,523 --> 01:21:58,721
Well, last night I was kind of laying
in bed and I couldn't get to sleep,

1193
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:01,126
so I started thinking about the wedding
and the ceremony,

1194
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:05,132
and about our buying a house
and moving in together,

1195
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,067
and having a kid
and then having another kid.

1196
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:12,072
And then Christmas
and Thanksgiving and spring break

1197
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:15,507
and going to football games. And then,
all of a sudden, they're graduating,

1198
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:17,408
they're getting jobs,
and they're getting married,

1199
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:19,777
and, you know, I'm a grandparent.

1200
01:22:19,848 --> 01:22:23,340
And then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair.
I'm getting fat.

1201
01:22:23,418 --> 01:22:25,648
And then the next thing you know,
I'm dead.

1202
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:29,657
I'm just, like... I can't stop from thinking,
''What's the point?''

1203
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:37,229
-I mean, what is the point?
-The point?

1204
01:22:37,299 --> 01:22:39,961
Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?

1205
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:44,463
Jim, it's marriage.

1206
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:50,205
It's one of the most beautiful things
on earth. It's what people aspire to.

1207
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:53,476
-You never got married.
-That's true.

1208
01:22:53,548 --> 01:22:57,416
-I mean, you never even tried.
-Well, it's hard to define try.

1209
01:22:57,486 --> 01:22:58,976
I don't know, just...

1210
01:22:59,054 --> 01:23:01,215
You seem happier
than all my married friends.

1211
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:07,521
Look, Jim, I'm not going to lie to you.
Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

1212
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:12,499
And you're kind of right. This all is just
stuff that leads to your eventual demise.

1213
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:14,660
-Yes.
-And we're all on running clocks,

1214
01:23:14,736 --> 01:23:16,863
and they can't be slowed down
or paused,

1215
01:23:16,972 --> 01:23:20,464
and, you know,
we all end up in the same place.

1216
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:21,907
Yeah.

1217
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:24,941
There is no point.

1218
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:27,743
There is no point.
That's what I'm saying.

1219
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:34,445
You know,

1220
01:23:35,857 --> 01:23:38,985
I'm not normally the guy
you would talk to about stuff like this.

1221
01:23:43,131 --> 01:23:45,122
If you think about it,

1222
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:51,305
your favourite memories, the most
important moments in your life,

1223
01:23:51,373 --> 01:23:52,931
were you alone?

1224
01:23:54,976 --> 01:23:56,500
No, I guess not.

1225
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:01,510
Hey, come to think of it, last night,
the night before your wedding,

1226
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,551
when all this shit
is swirling around in your head,

1227
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:05,882
weren't you guys
sleeping in separate bedrooms?

1228
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:07,785
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment,

1229
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:10,950
and I was just by myself
in the honeymoon suite.

1230
01:24:11,026 --> 01:24:14,223
-Kind of lonely?
-Yes, it was pretty lonely.

1231
01:24:16,064 --> 01:24:20,262
-Life's better with company.
-Yeah.

1232
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:23,531
Everybody needs a co-pilot.

1233
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,973
-That was a nice touch.
-Thanks.

1234
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:35,010
-So, what's the mood like out there?
-It's not good.

1235
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:38,178
-She's pretty pissed?
-She's upset.

1236
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:42,683
What should I do?

1237
01:24:44,593 --> 01:24:45,992
Go get her.

1238
01:25:01,209 --> 01:25:03,973
I'm such a fuck-up. I love you so much.

1239
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:06,670
Will you be my co-pilot?

1240
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:10,852
Yes. Yes.

1241
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:18,081
Welcome home.

1242
01:27:53,248 --> 01:27:55,978
Okay, this is your stop.

1243
01:28:03,425 --> 01:28:07,384
-When am I going to see you?
-You're just going to have to come visit.

1244
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:09,755
So settled.

1245
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,491
You're not going to change on me,
are you?

1246
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:17,060
No. Same guy. Just one address.

1247
01:28:19,074 --> 01:28:20,371
This is your final boarding call

1248
01:28:20,442 --> 01:28:23,468
for American Airlines
flight number 3972 to Chicago.

1249
01:28:25,547 --> 01:28:28,243
All right. Call me when you get lonely.

1250
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:32,918
I'm lonely.

1251
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:08,250
Some guy sits down
in a conference room somewhere

1252
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:11,884
and our server routes his session
to one of our termination engineers.

1253
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,791
''Termination engineers''? Really?

1254
01:29:13,862 --> 01:29:16,353
I preferred ''terminators,''
but it bumped with Legal.

1255
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:17,898
Can't imagine why.

1256
01:29:17,966 --> 01:29:19,957
They follow a workflow
that takes them through anything

1257
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:21,593
from a standard dismissal
to a violent aggressor.

1258
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:24,230
What are they doing now?
Are they practicing?

1259
01:29:24,305 --> 01:29:27,706
Well, beta testing, role-playing.
We go live at the end of the month.

1260
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:30,705
Kyle, you're running through the events
too quickly.

1261
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:32,940
You need to give them time
to acknowledge each statement, okay?

1262
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:34,777
It's a legal thing.

1263
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,749
-Ryan?
-Yeah. There's more?

1264
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:47,019
This is ridiculous.

1265
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:49,120
But, you know, Legal's really starting to
come hard at me

1266
01:29:49,197 --> 01:29:51,927
on this term ''terminate,'' so...

1267
01:30:30,405 --> 01:30:32,168
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1268
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,368
for today's challenge speaker,
Mr. Ryan Bingham.

1269
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,146
Go get them.

1270
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:52,685
Last year, I flew 350,000 miles.

1271
01:30:54,362 --> 01:30:56,023
The moon is 250.

1272
01:30:59,267 --> 01:31:03,761
I want you to imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

1273
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:06,534
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders.

1274
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:08,965
You feel them?

1275
01:31:10,578 --> 01:31:15,140
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

1276
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:21,520
Start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers.

1277
01:31:41,643 --> 01:31:43,110
Excuse me.

1278
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:48,545
What the fuck are you doing?

1279
01:31:48,616 --> 01:31:50,709
Okay, everyone, just relax.

1280
01:32:15,777 --> 01:32:18,371
-Hey, you got to sign.
-Thought I did that already.

1281
01:32:19,747 --> 01:32:21,806
-Okay, thank you.
-All right.

1282
01:32:24,652 --> 01:32:28,019
Hey, you forgot to give me
your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

1283
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:05,688
So, I was in the neighbourhood.

1284
01:33:09,564 --> 01:33:11,725
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait, wait.

1285
01:33:20,742 --> 01:33:24,678
-Hey, honey, who's at the door?
-It's just somebody who's lost.

1286
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:25,003
Alex?

1287
01:34:25,073 --> 01:34:28,042
What were you thinking,
showing up at my door like that?

1288
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:30,270
What do you mean? I...
I wanted to see you.

1289
01:34:30,345 --> 01:34:33,314
I didn't know you had a family.
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1290
01:34:33,381 --> 01:34:34,643
Look, I'm sorry I ruined your evening,

1291
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:36,980
but, I mean, you could have seriously
screwed things up for me.

1292
01:34:37,051 --> 01:34:40,578
That's my family. That's my real life.

1293
01:34:43,691 --> 01:34:45,625
I thought I was a part of your real life.

1294
01:34:47,295 --> 01:34:49,422
I thought we signed up
for the same thing.

1295
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:55,401
Try and help me understand
exactly what it is that you signed up for.

1296
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:59,763
I thought our relationship
was perfectly clear.

1297
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:03,743
I mean, you are an escape.

1298
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:10,442
You're a break from our normal lives.
You're a parenthesis.

1299
01:35:14,255 --> 01:35:16,155
I'm a parenthesis?

1300
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,452
I mean...

1301
01:35:18,326 --> 01:35:22,558
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.

1302
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:30,594
You don't even know what you want.

1303
01:35:33,307 --> 01:35:35,298
I'm a grown-up, okay?

1304
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:39,806
So, if you would like to see me again,
then give me a call.

1305
01:35:41,883 --> 01:35:42,975
Okay?

1306
01:35:59,434 --> 01:36:02,403
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a special announcement to make.

1307
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:06,907
Our pilot has just informed me that we
are passing over the city of Dubuque,

1308
01:36:06,974 --> 01:36:09,534
which might not mean much
to most of you,

1309
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:12,170
but means a lot
to one of our flyers today.

1310
01:36:12,246 --> 01:36:17,149
-No.
-Because he just hit 10 million miles!

1311
01:36:20,855 --> 01:36:22,413
Congratulations.

1312
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:26,017
-Such an amazing accomplishment.
-You must be very, very excited.

1313
01:36:26,727 --> 01:36:29,287
-Hi, Captain.
-Captain.

1314
01:36:29,397 --> 01:36:31,092
That seat taken?

1315
01:36:32,066 --> 01:36:33,397
No. No.

1316
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:42,701
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

1317
01:36:44,045 --> 01:36:49,108
-Don't know where you found the time.
-Yeah. I don't know.

1318
01:36:50,818 --> 01:36:52,251
Yeah.

1319
01:36:55,389 --> 01:36:56,856
Here you go.

1320
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:02,994
7th card we've made. Small club.

1321
01:37:06,467 --> 01:37:08,935
We really appreciate your loyalty.

1322
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:15,107
You know how many times
I thought about this moment?

1323
01:37:17,478 --> 01:37:20,777
Played out the conversation
that you and I would have right here.

1324
01:37:20,882 --> 01:37:22,144
Really?

1325
01:37:25,219 --> 01:37:27,210
What did you want to say?

1326
01:37:32,226 --> 01:37:34,160
You know, I don't remember.

1327
01:37:36,564 --> 01:37:39,556
That's all right. It happens to all of us.

1328
01:37:44,038 --> 01:37:46,029
So, where are you from?

1329
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:53,772
I'm from here.

1330
01:38:12,433 --> 01:38:14,128
Hello, Mr. Bingham.

1331
01:38:15,469 --> 01:38:18,597
-How did you know it was me?
-This is your dedicated line.

1332
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:22,040
We reserve them for our most loyal
and appreciated flyers.

1333
01:38:22,109 --> 01:38:23,906
I'd like to transfer some of my miles.

1334
01:38:23,978 --> 01:38:27,141
Can I open up an account
to Jim and Julie Miller?

1335
01:38:27,782 --> 01:38:30,250
Certainly. How many miles
would you like to transfer?

1336
01:38:30,318 --> 01:38:32,980
How many miles does it take
to circle the globe?

1337
01:38:33,054 --> 01:38:37,184
We have our round-the-world tickets.
They're 500,000 miles each.

1338
01:38:37,258 --> 01:38:38,953
-That'd be fine.
-Got a second?

1339
01:38:39,026 --> 01:38:40,323
I'll call you back.

1340
01:38:40,394 --> 01:38:41,452
What the hell happened
to you yesterday?

1341
01:38:41,529 --> 01:38:43,190
I was trying to get hold of you all day.

1342
01:38:43,264 --> 01:38:46,700
I was... Some personal stuff.
What's going on?

1343
01:38:46,767 --> 01:38:49,065
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

1344
01:38:50,071 --> 01:38:53,666
part of a 30-person reduction
a few weeks back in Wichita?

1345
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:55,504
Natalie fired her.

1346
01:38:56,077 --> 01:38:58,307
I fire dozens of people a day. I...

1347
01:38:58,379 --> 01:39:01,109
She killed herself, jumped off a bridge.

1348
01:39:03,184 --> 01:39:04,378
Fuck.

1349
01:39:04,852 --> 01:39:06,342
I need to know

1350
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:10,413
if you remember any woman
that gave you any signals, depression...

1351
01:39:10,491 --> 01:39:12,049
They're all depressed.
We're firing them.

1352
01:39:12,126 --> 01:39:14,993
Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, okay?

1353
01:39:15,062 --> 01:39:19,158
No, I don't remember anything.
You never think that they're...

1354
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:23,498
You don't remember any woman
that gave you any signals?

1355
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:26,836
-Anything at all, Ryan?
-No, nothing stands out.

1356
01:39:30,611 --> 01:39:33,239
-Natalie all right?
-Natalie quit.

1357
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:40,316
-She quit?
-Text message.

1358
01:39:42,056 --> 01:39:44,923
Yeah, fucking nice, right?
No one's got any manners anymore.

1359
01:39:46,027 --> 01:39:49,656
-She say where she was going?
-No. She was a little upset.

1360
01:39:52,066 --> 01:39:54,159
I should give her a call.

1361
01:39:57,271 --> 01:39:59,432
I need you back in the air.

1362
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:06,537
Hey, did you hear what I said?
I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

1363
01:40:06,614 --> 01:40:09,174
It's fine.
What about the videoconferencing?

1364
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:12,913
CTC is going to pause
the new-media front.

1365
01:40:12,987 --> 01:40:15,421
They're going to give it
some more thought.

1366
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:17,423
We are going to get
our workhorses back in the air,

1367
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:19,823
doing what they do best, okay?

1368
01:40:21,262 --> 01:40:25,426
-How long are you sending me out?
-We're going to let you sail and sail.

1369
01:40:25,499 --> 01:40:28,491
You send us a postcard
if you ever get there.

1370
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:44,574
So, what happened?

1371
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:50,146
-How exactly do you mean?
-You graduated top of your class.

1372
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:53,487
You seemed to have your pick
of employment, including right here.

1373
01:40:53,561 --> 01:40:56,997
Instead you went to Omaha
to fire people for a living?

1374
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,364
-It's challenging work.
-I'll say.

1375
01:41:02,536 --> 01:41:05,505
I can't imagine doing that day in,
day out.

1376
01:41:05,573 --> 01:41:07,336
Not in this climate.

1377
01:41:09,777 --> 01:41:11,438
I followed a boy.

1378
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:18,412
Well, I guess everybody does that
at one point or another.

1379
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:26,817
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

1380
01:41:27,294 --> 01:41:29,421
To whom it may concern,

1381
01:41:29,497 --> 01:41:32,728
I can't even count the number of people
I've fired in my lifetime.

1382
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,634
So many that I've actually forgotten
what it's like to hire somebody.

1383
01:41:36,704 --> 01:41:40,663
We've never met, but I know
you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.

1384
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:44,477
My advice?
Take her and don't look back.

1385
01:41:44,545 --> 01:41:47,412
She'll be the best decision
you've made in a long time.

1386
01:41:51,952 --> 01:41:53,920
I sure hope he's right.

1387
01:42:05,332 --> 01:42:07,425
Well, I don't have a lot of hope,

1388
01:42:07,501 --> 01:42:10,231
and I really don't know
when it's going to get better.

1389
01:42:10,304 --> 01:42:13,102
There's a lot of people unemployed,

1390
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:17,270
and I really don't know when there's
going to be light at the end of the tunnel.

1391
01:42:17,812 --> 01:42:20,076
I can't find much to talk about.

1392
01:42:20,147 --> 01:42:22,513
Talk about being proud.
I'm proud of my kids.

1393
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:28,044
I think the anger comes from the fact
that I just wasn't needed anymore.

1394
01:42:28,122 --> 01:42:30,056
I would say, you know,

1395
01:42:30,758 --> 01:42:34,854
without my friends and my family,
I wouldn't have made it.

1396
01:42:34,929 --> 01:42:37,727
It would have been a lot tougher if
I would have had to make it on my own.

1397
01:42:37,798 --> 01:42:41,791
When I wake up in the morning
and I look over and I see my wife,

1398
01:42:43,304 --> 01:42:44,862
that gives me the sense of purpose.

1399
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:48,067
It's not all about the money.
Money can keep you warm.

1400
01:42:48,142 --> 01:42:51,543
It pays your heating bills, you know.
It can buy you a blanket.

1401
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,107
But it's not as... Doesn't keep you as
warm as when my husband holds me.

1402
01:42:57,885 --> 01:43:01,548
Let me get up. Let me get out.
Let me find something.

1403
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:06,318
So, my kids are my purpose, my family.

1404
01:43:36,457 --> 01:43:38,482
Tonight most people
will be welcomed home

1405
01:43:38,559 --> 01:43:41,084
by jumping dogs and squealing kids.

1406
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:46,131
Their spouses will ask about their day,
and tonight they'll sleep.

1407
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:50,934
The stars will wheel forth
from their daytime hiding places.

1408
01:43:52,606 --> 01:43:56,269
And one of those lights,
slightly brighter than the rest,

1409
01:43:56,343 --> 01:43:58,777
will be my wingtip passing over.

1410
01:46:09,677 --> 01:46:11,645
Hi, Jason. My name is Kevin,

1411
01:46:11,712 --> 01:46:14,112
and I recently lost my job.

1412
01:46:15,182 --> 01:46:20,051
I wrote this song as sort of
a statement about uncertainty

1413
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,647
and having a certain amount of anxiety
about the future.

1414
01:46:25,225 --> 01:46:27,921
So, maybe you can use it in your movie.
