1
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,302
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro

2
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,371
of Arragon comes this day to Messina.

3
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,440
LEONATO'S AIDE:
He is very near by this, not three leagues off.

4
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,775
Have any gentlemen been lost in this action?

5
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,812
But few of any sort, and none of name.

6
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,748
A victory is twice itself

7
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,584
when the achiever brings home full numbers.

8
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,819
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor

9
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,422
upon a young Florentine called Claudio.

10
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,457
Much deserved on his part

11
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,726
and equally remembered by Don Pedro,

12
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,595
he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age,

13
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,198
doing, in the figure of a lamb, the feats of a lion.

14
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,299
Rarh!

15
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,572
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto
returned from the wars or no?

16
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,574
LEONATO'S AIDE: I know none
of that name, lady.

17
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,675
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

18
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,376
O, he's returned

19
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,946
and as pleasant as ever he was.

20
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,782
I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars?

21
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,650
But how many hath he killed?

22
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,553
For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

23
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,456
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much,

24
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,292
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

25
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,596
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

26
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,432
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it.

27
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a very valiant trencherman,

28
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,668
he hath an excellent stomach.

29
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,637
LEONATO'S AIDE:
And a good soldier too, lady.

30
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,973
And a good soldier to a lady.

31
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,409
But what is he to a lord?

32
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,745
A lord to a lord, a man to a man,

33
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,513
stuffed with all honorable virtue.

34
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,282
It is so, indeed,

35
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,951
he is no less than a stuffed man.

36
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,621
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.

37
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,991
There is a kind of merry war
betwixt Signior Benedick and her.

38
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,728
They never meet but there's a
skirmish of wit between them.

39
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,465
Who is his companion now?
He hath every month a new sworn brother.

40
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,399
LEONATO'S AIDE:
Is't possible?

41
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,901
Very easily possible.

42
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,437
He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat,

43
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,939
it ever changes with the next block.

44
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,807
(CHUCKLES)

45
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,877
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

46
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,446
No, and he were, I would burn my study.

47
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,018
But, I pray you, who is his companion?

48
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,786
Is there no young squarer now that will

49
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,422
make a voyage with him to the devil?

50
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,892
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

51
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,929
O, lord, he will hang upon him like a disease.

52
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,798
He is sooner caught than the pestilence,

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,701
and the taker runs presently mad.

54
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,037
O, God help the noble Claudio!

55
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,838
If he have caught the Benedick,

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,740
it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.

57
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,574
(ALL LAUGHING)

58
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,054
Good Signior Leonato,

59
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,523
you are come to welcome your trouble.

60
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,691
The fashion of the world is to avoid cost,

61
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,527
and you encounter it.

62
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,731
Never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of your grace.

63
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,102
For trouble being gone, comfort should remain.

64
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,905
But when you depart from me sorrow
abides and happiness takes his leave.

65
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,742
DON PEDRO:
Hmm, you embrace your charge too willingly.

66
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,784
I think this is your daughter.

67
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,586
Her mother hath many times told me so.

68
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,488
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

69
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,857
Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.

70
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,526
Truly, truly, the lady fathers herself.

71
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,928
Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.

72
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,131
BENEDICK:
If Signior Leonato be her father,

73
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,166
she would not have his head on
her shoulders for all Messina

74
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,602
as like him as she is.

75
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,737
I wonder that you would still
be talking, Signior Benedick.

76
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,406
Nobody marks you.

77
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,808
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
Are you yet living?

78
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,177
Is it possible disdain should die

79
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,081
while she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signior Benedick?

80
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,151
Courtesy itself must convert to
disdain, if you come in her presence.

81
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,920
Then is courtesy a turncoat.

82
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:07,526
But it is certain I am loved of
all ladies, only you excepted,

83
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,896
and I would I could find it in my
heart that I had not a hard heart,

84
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,064
for, truly, I love none.

85
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,567
Dear happiness to women, else would they

86
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,170
have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.

87
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,740
I thank God and my cold blood,
I am of your humor for that.

88
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:25,777
I had rather hear my dog bark at a
crow than a man swear he loves me.

89
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,913
God keep your ladyship still in that mind

90
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,149
so some gentleman or other shall
'scape a predestinate scratched face.

91
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,717
Scratching could not make it worse,

92
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,486
an 'twere such a face as yours were.

93
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,822
Well, you are
a rare parrot-teacher.

94
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,824
Um, a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.

95
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,592
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,

96
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,061
and so good a continuer.

97
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,964
But keep in your way, God's name, I have done.

98
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,802
You always end with a jade's trick.

99
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,104
I know you of old.

100
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,177
Signior Benedick, my dear friend
Leonato hath invited you all.

101
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,580
I tell him we shall stay here at the least the month,

102
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,915
and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer.

Let me bid you welcome, my lord.

Being reconciled with the prince your brother,

107
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,961
I owe you all duty.

108
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,734
I am not of many words, but I thank you.

109
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,172
Please it your grace lead on?

110
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,641
Your hand, Leonato.
We will go together.

111
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,018
Benedick, didst thou note the
daughter of Signior Leonato?

112
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,187
I noted her not, but I looked on her.

113
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,189
Is she not a modest young lady?

114
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,124
Do you question me, as an honest man should do,

115
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,260
for my simple true judgment,

116
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,595
or would you have me speak after my custom,

117
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,831
as being a professed tyrant to their sex?

118
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,901
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

119
00:08:55,903 --> 00:09:00,272
Why, i' faith, methinks she is too low for a high praise,

120
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,942
too brown for a fair praise,
too little for a great praise.

121
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,677
Only this commendation I can afford her,

122
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,145
that were she other than she is,

123
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,080
she were unhandsome,

124
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,250
and being no other than as she is, I do not like her.

125
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,588
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray
thee tell me truly how thou likest her.

126
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,758
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?

127
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,326
Can the world buy such a jewel?

128
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,094
Yea, and a case to put it into.

129
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,100
But speak you this with a sad brow?

130
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,037
In mine eye she is the sweetest
lady that ever I looked on.

I can see yet without spectacles
and I see no such matter.

There's her cousin,
an she were not possessed with a fury,

00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,283
exceeds her as much in beauty

And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.

00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,788
That I neither feel how she should be loved

161
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,356
nor know how she should be worthy

162
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,692
is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me.

163
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,228
I will die in it at the stake.

164

Thou wast ever an obstinate
heretic in the despite of beauty.

165

That a woman conceived me, I give her thanks,

166
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,302
that she brought me up, I likewise
give her most humble thanks.

167
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,805
But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead,

168
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,307
or hang my bugle from an invisible baldrick,

169
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,410
all women shall pardon me.

170
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,946
Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any,

171
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,816
I will do myself the right to trust none.

172
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,886
And the fine is, for the which I may go the finer,

173
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,126
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.

174
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,262
With anger, with sickness,

175
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,165
or with hunger, my lord, not with love.

176

bull doth bear the yoke."

The savage bull may,

179
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,209
but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,

180
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,978
pluck off the bull's horns and plant them in my forehead

181
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,847
and let me be vilely painted,

182
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,082

183

"Here is good horse to hire,"

"Here may you see Benedick
the married man."

Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice,

Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

No child but Hero, she's his only heir.

191
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,178
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

192
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,517
O, my lord, when you went onward on this ended action,

193
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,452
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,

194
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,087
that liked,

195
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,856
but had a rougher task in hand

196
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,457
than to drive liking to the name of love.

197
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,532
And that war-thoughts
have left their places vacant,

198
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,302
in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires,

199
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:56,007
all prompting me how fair young Hero is,

200
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,543
saying, "I liked her
ere I went to wars."

201
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,881
Thou wilt be like a lover presently

202
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:06,317
and tire the hearer with a book of words.

203
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,355
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,

204
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,125
and I will break with her and with
her father, and thou shalt have her.

205
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,798
I know we shall have
reveling to-night. Hmm.

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,567
I will assume thy part in some disguise

207
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,237
and tell fair Hero I am Claudio,

208
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,040
and in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart

209
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,343
and take her hearing prisoner with the force

210
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,012
and strong encounter of my amorous tale.

211
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,850
Then after to her father will I break,

There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,

00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,651
Nor will you tell me who you are?

319
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,053
Not now.
(ALL LAUGHING)

320
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,954
That I was disdainful,

321
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,623
and that I had my good wit

322
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,993
out of the <i>Hundred Merry Tales..</i>

323
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,997
Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.

324
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,865
What's he?

325
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,834
BEATRICE: I'm sure you know
him well enough.

326
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,437
Not I, believe me.

327
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,771
Did he never make you laugh?

328
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,041
I pray you, what is he?

329
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,945
Why, he is the prince's jester.
(ALL CHUCKLING)

330
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:31,048
A very dull fool,

331
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,652
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.

332
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,121
None but libertines delight in him,

333
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,924
and his commendation is not in his wit,

334
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,959
but in his villainy,

335
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,029
for he both pleases men and angers them,

336
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,131
and then they laugh at him and beat him.

337
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,566
(ALL CHUCKLING)

338
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,835
I'm sure he's in the fleet.

339
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,604
I would he had boarded me.

340
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,507
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.

341
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,976
Do, do.

342
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:03,114
He'll but break a comparison or two
on me, which, peradventure not marked

343
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:06,684
and not laughed at, sends him into melancholy,

344
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,953
and then there's a partridge wing saved,

345
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,722
for the fool will eat no supper that night.

346
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,925
We must follow the leaders.

347
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,061
In every good thing.

348
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,131
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will
leave them at the next turning.

349
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,012
(BREATHING LOUDLY)

350
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,523
Are not you Signior Benedick?

351
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,860
You know me well, I am he.

352
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,763
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love.

353
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,500
He is enamored on Hero.

354
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,502
I pray you, dissuade him from her.

355
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,539
She is no equal for his birth.

356
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,143
You may do the part of an honest man in it.

357
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,647
CLAUDIO:
How know you he loves her?

358
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,818
I heard him swear his affection.

359
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,588
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her to-night.

360
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,161
Come, let us to the banquet.

361
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,960
'Tis certain so, the prince woos for himself.

362
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,237
Friendship is constant in all other things

363
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:10,140
save in the offices and affairs of love,

364
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:14,078
for beauty is a witch against whose
charms faith melteth into blood.

365
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,982
Count Claudio?

366
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,650
Yea, the same.

367
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,253
Come, go with me.
The prince hath got your Hero.

368
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,124
I wish him joy of her.

369
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,261
Did you think the prince would have used you thus?

370
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,296
I pray you, leave me.

371
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,065
Ho! Now you strike
like the blind man.

372
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,801
'Twas the boy that stole your
meat, and you will beat the post.

373
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,770
If it will not be, I'll leave you.

374
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,143
Alas, poor hurt fowl.

375
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,747
Now will he creep into sedges.

376
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,657
But that my Lady Beatrice

377
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,092
should know me, and not know me.

378
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,261
The prince's fool?

379
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,263
(GRUNTS)

380
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,867
It may be I go under that title because I am merry.

381
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,070
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself
wrong, I am not so reputed.

382
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,243
It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice

383
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,646
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out.

384
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,716
Well, I will be revenged as I may.

385

(GUITAR STRUMMING)

386
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,180
Now, signior, where's the count?
Did you see him?

387
00:26:56,182 --> 00:27:00,951
Troth, my lord, I found him as
melancholy as a lodge in a warren.

388
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,887
I told him, and I think I told him true,

389
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,025
that your grace had got the good
will of this young lady here.

390
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,728
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.

391
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,129
The gentleman that danced with her

392
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,198
told her she is much wronged by you.

393
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,401
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!

394
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,739
She told me, not thinking I had been myself,

395
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,308
that I was the prince's jester.
(CLICKS FINGERS)

396
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,912
That I was duller than a great thaw,

huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance

398
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,052
that I stood like a man at a mark,

399
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,820
with a whole army shooting at me.

400
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,091
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs.

(LAUGHS)

402
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,197
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations,

403
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,700
there would be no living near her.

404
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,268
She would infect to the north star.

405
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,139
I would not marry her,

406
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,740
though she were endowed with all that

407
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,442
Adam had left him before he transgressed.

I would to God some scholar would conjure her.

411
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:15,025
For certainly, while she is here, all disquiet, horror,

412
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,927
and perturbation follows her.

413
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,465
Look, here she comes.

414
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,268
Will your grace command me
any service to the world's end?

415
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,403
I will go on the slightest errand now

416
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,239
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.

417
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,175
I will fetch
you a tooth-picker

418
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,077
from the furthest inch of Asia,

419
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,113
bring you a hair off the great Cham's beard,

420
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,282
do you any embassage to the Pigmies

421
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,184
rather than hold three words'
conference with this harpy.

422
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,921
BENEDICK:
You have no employment for me?

423
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,225
None, but to desire your good company.

424
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,462
O God, sir, here is a dish I love not.

425
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,230
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.

426
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,069
Come, lady, come.

427
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,475
You have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

428
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,311
Indeed, my lord,

429
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,780
he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for it,

430
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,517
a double heart for his single one.

431
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,323
Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,

432
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:23,026
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

433
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,130
But you have put him down, lady,
you have put him down.

434
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,832
So I would not he should do me, my lord,

435
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,367
lest I should prove the mother of fools.

436
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,973
I have brought Count Claudio,
whom you sent me to seek.

437
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,111
DON PEDRO: Why, how now, Claudio!
Wherefore are you sad?

438
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,080
Not sad, my lord.
How then? Sick?

439
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,215
Neither, my lord.

440
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,519
The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well,

441
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,388
but civil count, civil as an orange,

442
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,491
and something of that jealous complexion.

443
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,861
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon
to be true, though, I'll be sworn,

444
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,496
if he be so, his conceit is false.

445
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,967
DON PEDRO: Here, Claudio,

446
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,138
I have wooed in thy name.
Fair Hero is won.

447
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,440
I have broke with her father, and his good will obtained.

448
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,544
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!

449
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,516
(GRUNTS)

450
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:25,122
Count, take of me my daughter and with her my fortune.

451
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,925
His grace hath made the match
that all grace say "Amen" to it.

452
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,002
Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.

453
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,443
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.

454
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,846
I were but little happy, if I could say how much.

455
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,952
Lady, as you are mine, I am yours.

456
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,021
I give myself for you and dote upon the exchange.

457
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,559
Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot,
stop his mouth with a kiss

458
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,995
and let him not speak neither.

459
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,136
DON PEDRO: In faith, lady,
you have a merry heart.

460
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,005
Yea, my lord.
I thank it, poor fool,

461
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,207
it keeps me on the windy side of care.

462
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,279
My cousin tells him in his ear he is in her heart.

463
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,382
And so she doth, cousin.

464
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,352
BEATRICE: Oh, good Lord,
for alliance!

465
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:32,923
Thus goes every one into the
world but I, and I am sunburnt.

466
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,126
I will sit in a corner and cry,
"Heigh-ho for a husband!"

467
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,395
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

468
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,265
I'd rather have one of your father's getting.

469
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,900
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?

470
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,534
Your father got excellent husbands,

471
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,970
if a maid could come by them.

472
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,139
Will you have me, lady?

473
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,574
(CHUCKLING)

474
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,343
No, my lord,

475
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,313
unless I might have
another for working-days.

476
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,549
Your grace is too costly to wear every day.

477
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,019
But, I beseech your grace, pardon me.

478
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,688
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

479
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,959
Your silence most offends me,
to be merry best becomes you,

480
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:12,029
for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour.

481
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,065
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried,

482
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,001
but then a star danced, and under that was I born.

483
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,538
Cousins, God give you joy!

(CHUCKLES)

485
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:34,051
By my troth,
a pleasant-spirited lady.

486
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:37,187
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord.

487
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,557
She is never sad but when she
sleeps, and not ever sad then,

488
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,092
for I have heard my daughter say,

489
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,994
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness

490
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,029
and waked herself with laughing.

491
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,531
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

492
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,166
O, by no means.

493
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,500
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.

494
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,537
She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

495
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,539
(GASPS)

496
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,508
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,

497
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,544
they would talk themselves mad.

498
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,182
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?

499
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,284
To-morrow, my lord.

500
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,419
Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.

501
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,122
Not till Monday, dear son,

502
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,490
which is hence
a just seven-night,

503
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,392
and a time too brief, too,

504
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:18,161
to have all things answer my mind.

505
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,631
DON PEDRO: I warrant thee, Claudio,
the time shall not go dully by us.

506
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,335
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labors,

507
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,705
which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice

508
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:32,342
into a mountain of affection, the one with the other.

509
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,479
I would fain have it a match, and
I doubt not but to fashion it,

510
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,016
if you three will minister assistance.

511
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,352
My lord, I am for you, though it
cost me 10 nights' watchings.

512
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,121
And I, my lord.

513
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,589
DON PEDRO:
And you too, gentle Hero?

514
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,557
I will do any modest office, my lord,

515
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,260
to help my cousin to a good husband.

516
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,764
Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know.

517
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,367
Thus far can I praise him, he is of a noble strain,

518
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:02,105
of approved valor and confirmed honesty.

519
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,609
I will teach you how to humor your cousin,

520
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,044
that she shall fall in love with Benedick,

521
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,779
and I,

522
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,815
with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that,

523
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:15,318
in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach,

524
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,654
he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

525
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:22,292
If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer.

526
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:26,463
His glory shall be ours,
for we are the only love-gods.

(ALL LAUGHING)

528
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,772
It is so.

529
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,108
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.

530
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,212
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.

531
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:48,452
Any bar, any cross, any impediment
will be medicinable to me.

532
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,457
I am sick in displeasure to him,

533
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,825
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection

534
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:57,327
ranges evenly with mine.

535
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,833
How canst thou thwart this marriage?

536
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,378
I think I told your lordship a year since,

537
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,714
how much I am in favor of Margaret,

538
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,516
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

539
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,119
I remember.

540
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,689
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,

541
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,458
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.

542
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,196
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?

543
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,632
The poison of that lies in you to temper.

544
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,907
Go you to the prince your brother,

545
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,543
spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor

546
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,279
in marrying the renowned Claudio,

547
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,148
whose estimation do you mightily hold up,

548
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,919
to a contaminated stale

549
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,722
such a one as Hero.

550
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,726
What proof shall I make of that?

551
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,664
Proof enough to misuse the prince,

552
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,435
to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato.

553
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,608
Look you for any other issue?

(SIGHS)

555
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,904
I do much wonder that one man,

556
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,940
seeing how much another man is a fool

557
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,576
when he dedicates his behaviors to love,

558
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,845
will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others,

559
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:59,249
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love.

560
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,219
And such a man is Claudio.

561
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,987
I have known when there was no music

562
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,456
with him but the drum and the fife,

563
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,593
now he had rather hear the tabor and the pipe.

564
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,294
I have known when he would have walked

565
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,530
10 mile a-foot
to see a good armor,

566
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,398
and now will he lie 10 nights awake,

567
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,801
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

568
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,803
He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,

569
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,272
like an honest man and a soldier.

570
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:26,409
Now is he turned orthography, his
words a very fantastical banquet,

571
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,511
just so many strange dishes.

572
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,749
May I be so converted and see with these eyes?

573
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,952
I cannot tell, I think not.

574
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:40,457
I will not be sworn, but love
may transform me to an oyster.

575
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,526
But I'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me,

576
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,462
he shall never make me such a fool.

577
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,300
One woman is fair, yet I am well.

578
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,602
Another is wise, yet I am well.

579
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,439
Another virtuous, yet I am well.

580
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,009
But till all graces be in one woman,

581

one woman shall not come in my grace.

Rich she shall be, that's certain.

583
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,019
Wise, or I'll none.

584
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,921
Virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her.

585
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:15,859
Fair, or I'll never look on her.
Mild, or come not near me.

Come hither, Leonato.

What was it you
told me of to-day,

597
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:02,339
that your niece Beatrice was
in love with Signior Benedick?

598
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:03,873
I did never think that lady would have loved any man.

599
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,543
No, nor I neither,

600
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:10,347
but most wonderful that she should
so dote on Signior Benedick,

whom she hath in all outward
behaviors seemed ever to abhor.

Sits the wind in that corner?

603

By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it

604
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,961
but that she loves him with an enraged affection.

605
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,529

I would have sworn it had, my lord,

especially against Benedick.

611
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,111
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

No, and swears she never will, that is her torment.

that she should be so immodest

tears her hair, prays, curses,

"O, sweet, Benedick!

I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.

I would have daffed all other
respects and made her half myself.

634
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,815
She doth well.

635
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,650
If she should make tender of her love

636
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,852
'tis very possible he'll scorn it,

637
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:59,622
for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
(GROANS)

638
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,724
He is a very proper man.

639
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,861
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.

640
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,665
Before God!
And, in my mind, very wise.

641
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,501
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.

642
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,738
Well, I'm sorry for your niece.

643
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,675
I love Benedick well, and I could wish

644
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,910
he would modestly examine himself,

645
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,847
to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

646
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,650
My lord, will you walk?

647
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,952
Dinner is ready.

648
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,062
This can be no trick.
The conference was sadly borne.

649
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,164
They have the truth of this from Hero.

650
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,701
Love me?

651
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,838
(LAUGHING)

652
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,176
Why, it must be requited.

653
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,212
I hear how I am censured.

654
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,815
They say I will bear myself proudly,

655
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,283
if I perceive the love come from her.

656
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,188
They say too that she will rather die

657
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,956
than give any sign of affection.

658
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,693
I did never think to marry.

659
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,073
I must not seem proud.

660
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,577
Happy are they that hear their
detractions and can put them to mending.

661
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,980
They say the lady is fair,

662
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,850
'tis a truth, I can bear them witness.

663
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:37,253
And virtuous, 'tis so, I cannot reprove it.

664
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:41,691
And wise, but for loving me.

665
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,093
By my troth, it is no addition to her wit,

666
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,195
nor no great argument of her folly,

667
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,032
for I will be horribly in love with her!

668
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,199
(ECHOING)

669
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,574
I may chance have some odd quirks

670
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,910
and remnants of wit broken on me,

671
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,646
because I have railed so long against marriage.

672
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,085
But doth not the appetite alter?

673
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,154
A man loves the meat in his youth

674
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,290
that he cannot endure in his age.

675
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,327
Shall quips and sentences and
these paper bullets of the brain

676
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:19,796
awe a man from the career of his humor?

677
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,665
No, the world must be peopled.

678
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,937
When I said I would die a bachelor,

679
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,640
I did not think I should live till I were married.

680
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,110
Here comes Beatrice.

681
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,848
By this day.
She's a fair lady.

682
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,817
(FLY BUZZING)

683
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,855
I do spy some marks of love in her.

684
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,295
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.

685
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,698
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.

686
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,036
I took no more pains for those thanks

687
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:02,405
than you take pains to thank me.

688
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,774
If it had been painful, I would not have come.

689
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,651
(EXHALES)

690
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,426
You take pleasure then in the message?

691
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,328
(CHUCKLES)

692
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,998
Yea, signior,

693
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,869
just so much as you may take upon a knife's point.

694
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,704
(BENEDICK LAUGHS)

695
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:35,772
(PANTS)

696
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,110
You have no stomach, signior.
Fare you well.

697
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,185
(CHUCKLES)

698
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,889
"Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner."

699
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,792
There's a double meaning in that.

700
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,460
"I took no more pains for those thanks"

701
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,195
"than you took
pains to thank me."

702
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,730
That's as much as to say, any pains

703
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:04,000
that I take for you is as good as thanks.

704
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,769
If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain.

705
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,243
If I do not love her, I am a fool.

706
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,047
I will go get her picture.

707
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,723
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.

708
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,125
I know her spirits are as coy and wild

709
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,193
as haggerds of the rock.

710
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,431
But are you sure Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

711
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,432
(GASPS)
(THUMPS)

712
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,741
So says the prince
and my new-trothed lord.

713
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,876
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

714
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:50,012
They did entreat me to acquaint
her of it, but I persuaded them,

715
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,380
if they loved Benedick,

716
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:54,417
to wish him restle with affection,

717
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,918
and never to let Beatrice know of it.

718
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,054
Why did you so?

719
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:01,491
Doth not the gentleman
deserve as full a fortunate a bed

720
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,860
as ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

721
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,962
HERO: O, god of love!
I know he doth deserve

722
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,164
as much as may be yielded to a man.

723
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,833
But nature never framed a woman's heart

724
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,301
of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.

725
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,103
(THUDS)

726
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:17,006
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,

727
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,841
misprising what they look on,

728
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,277
and her wit values itself so highly

729
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,148
that to her all matter else seems weak.

730
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:29,051
HERO: She cannot love, nor take no
shape nor project of affection,

731
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,319
she is so self-endeared.

732
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,390
Sure, I think so.

733
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,360
And therefore certainly it were
not good she knew his love,

734
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,829
lest she make sport at it.

735
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,232
No, rather I will go to Benedick

736
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:46,903
and counsel him to fight against his passion.

737
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:51,307
Truly, I'll devise some honest
slanders to stain my cousin with.

738
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,044
One doth not know how much an
ill word may empoison liking.

739
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:58,281
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.

740
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:01,417
She cannot be so much without true judgment.

741
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,086
Having so swift and excellent a wit,

742
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,856
as she is prized to have,

743
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,493
as to refuse so rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

744
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,295
He is the only man of Italy.
Mmm.

745
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,164
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

746
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,275
Come, go in.
I'll show thee some attires,

747
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,411
and have thy counsel which is the
best to furnish me to-morrow.

748
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,282
(GASPS)

749
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,285
What fire is in my ears?

750
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,157
Can this be true?

751
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:47,263
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?

752
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,434
Contempt, farewell.

753
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,172
And maiden pride, <i>adieu.</i>

754
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,574
No glory lives behind the back of such.

755
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,949
And, Benedick,

756
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,220
love on.

757
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,893
I will requite thee,

758
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,331
taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.

759
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,601
If thou dost love,

760
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,104
my kindness shall incite thee

761
00:48:30,603 --> 00:48:32,104
