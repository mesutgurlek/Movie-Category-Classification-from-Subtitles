BORIS: That's not
what I'm saying,
you imbecile.

22
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,420
God, you completely
misrepresent my ideas!

23
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,755
Why am I even bothering
talking to such idiots?

24
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,923
Boris, calm down.

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,091
No, don't tell me to...
I am calm.

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,159
Don't jump on us
just because

27
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:19,427
we don't understand
what you're saying.

28
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:20,896
I didn't jump on you.

29
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:22,764
It's not the idea
behind Christianity
I'm faulting,

30
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,966
or Judaism,
or any religion.

31
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,502
It's the professionals
who've made it into
a corporate business.

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,571
There's big money
in the God racket.
Big money.

33
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,039
Here we go.
- We know, Boris.

34
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:33,374
Hey, the basic
teachings of Jesus
are quite wonderful.

35
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,911
So, by the way,
is the original intention
of Karl Marx. Okay?

36
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:37,412
Oh.

37
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,814
Hey, what could be bad?
Everybody should
share equally.

38
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,117
Do unto others. Democracy.
Government by the people.

39
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,420
All great ideas.
These are all great ideas,

40
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:48,690
but they all suffer
from one fatal flaw.

41
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,124
Which is?
Yeah, what's that?

42
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:53,361
Which is they're
all based on the
fallacious notion

43
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,297
that people are
fundamentally decent.

44
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,800
Give them
a chance to do right
and they'll take it.

45
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,169
They're not stupid,
selfish, greedy,

46
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,971
cowardly,
short-sighted worms.

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,039
They do the best
they can.

48
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:05,173
Speak for yourself, man.
Speak for yourself.

49
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,808
All I'm saying is
that people make life

50
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,777
so much worse
than it has to be

51
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:11,446
and, believe me,
it's a nightmare
without their help.

52
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:14,849
But on the whole,
I'm sorry to say,
we're a failed species.

53
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,317
I wouldn't go
that far.

54
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,786
Not Ed.

55
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,055
That's why this
woman you like, Joe,

56
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:22,023
so what if she's
an embalmer's assistant,

57
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,358
so she stinks
from formaldehyde?

58
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:25,961
For Christ's sake,
you got to take

59
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,029
what little pleasure
you can find in
this chamber of horrors.

60
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:31,032
A little
formaldehyde, okay,
but she reeks of it.

61
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,867
You know, they don't
know your story.

62
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,803
Boris, tell them
your story.

63
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,672
My story is,
whatever works.

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,675
You know, as long as
you don't hurt anybody.

65
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,410
Any way you can
filch a little joy

66
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,445
in this cruel,
dog-eat-dog,

67
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,115
pointless, black chaos.
That's my story.

68
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:49,784
No. That's not...
Tell them the story.

69
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:51,219
Tell them.
Yeah. Tell them.

70
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:53,287
You just want me
to say it again,
so they can hear.

71
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:54,923
Who?
- Them.

72
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,491
Who?
- Who's them?

73
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:58,093
JOE: You see something out there?
- Where?

74
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,494
What are you?
An imbecile?

75
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,762
There's an audience
full of people
looking at us.

76
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,963
An audience?
- What's he talking about?

77
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,698
You feel you're
being watched.

78
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,667
They paid good
money for tickets,
hard-earned money,

79
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:08,803
so some moron
in Hollywood can buy
a bigger swimming pool.

80
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:11,506
Okay, you're saying
there are human beings
out there

81
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:14,009
who bought tickets
to watch us.

82
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:17,478
Well, mostly they're
interested in me,
I have to say.

83
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:20,048
Yeah, they're
just sitting there.
Don't you see them?

84
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,184
Some are eating popcorn,
some are just
staring straight ahead

85
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:24,719
breathing
through their mouths
like Neanderthals.

86
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,921
So they're there
to listen to your story?

87
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,556
Total delusions of grandeur.

88
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:30,424
Completely.

89
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,527
Why would you want
to hear my story?

90
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,797
Do we know each other?
Do we like each other?

91
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,567
Let me tell you
right off, okay?

92
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:44,139
I'm not a likeable guy.
Charm has never been
a priority with me.

93
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:48,476
And just so you know,
this is not the feel-good
movie of the year.

94
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:50,812
So if you're one
of those idiots
who needs to feel good,

95
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,580
go get yourself
a foot massage.

96
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,816
Mom, that man's
talking to himself!

97
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:55,950
Come away, Justin.

98
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,351
(SCOFFS)

99
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,189
What the hell does
it all mean anyhow?
Nothing. Zero. Zilch.

100
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,590
Nothing comes
to anything,

101
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:05,560
and yet
there's no shortage
of idiots to babble.

102
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:08,963
Not me. I have a vision.
I'm discussing you.

103
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:12,734
Your friends,
your co-workers,
your newspapers, the TV.

104
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,937
Everybody's happy to talk,
full of misinformation.

105
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,774
Morality, science,
religion, politics,
sports, love.

106
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,611
Your portfolio,
your children, health.

107
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,446
Christ. If I have to
eat nine servings

108
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,415
of fruits and vegetables
a day to live,

109
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:30,418
I don't want to live.
I hate goddamn
fruits and vegetables.

110
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:33,922
And your omega-3's
and the treadmill
and the cardiogram

111
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,457
and the mammogram
and the pelvic sonogram

112
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,227
and, oh, my God,
the colonoscopy!

113
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:42,831
And with it all,
the day still comes
when they put you in a box

114
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:44,933
and it's on to the next
generation of idiots

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,835
who'll also tell
you all about life

116
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:49,804
and define for you
what's appropriate.

117
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,040
My father
committed suicide

118
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:54,809
because the morning newspapers
depressed him.

119
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,211
And could you blame him?

120
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:59,480
With the horror and corruption
and ignorance and poverty

121
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:03,118
and genocide and AIDS
and global warming
and terrorism

122
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:07,822
and the family-value morons
and the gun morons!

123
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,959
"The horror,"
Kurtz said at the end
of  <i>Heart of Darkness.</i>

124
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,761
"The horror."

125
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,863
Lucky Kurtz didn't have the  <i>Times</i>
delivered in the jungle,

126
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,965
then he'd see
some horror.

127
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,299
But what do you do?

128
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,068
You read about some
massacre in Darfur

129
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,637
or some school bus
gets blown up,

130
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,605
and you go,
"Oh, my God, the horror!"

131
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,107
And then you
turn the page

132
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:29,210
and finish your eggs
from free-range chickens.

133
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:32,580
Because what can you do?
It's overwhelming.

134
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,383
I tried to commit
suicide myself.

135
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,052
Obviously,
it didn't work out.

136
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,687
But why do you even
want to hear about
all this?

137
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,756
Christ, you got
your own problems.

138
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,124
I'm sure you're
all obsessed with

139
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,060
any number of sad
little hopes and dreams.

140
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:49,130
Your predictably
unsatisfying love lives.

141
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:50,832
Your failed
business ventures.

142
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,168
"Oh, if only I'd
bought that stock!"

143
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:56,437
"If only I had purchased
that house years ago!"

144
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:58,706
"If only I had made
a move on that woman."

145
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,642
If this, if that.
You know what?

146
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,312
Give me a break
with your "could haves"
and "should haves."

147
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,014
Like my mother
used to say,

148
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:09,017
"If my grandmother had wheels,
she'd be a trolley car."

149
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,353
My mother didn't have wheels.
She had varicose veins.

150
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:16,090
Still, the woman gave birth
to a brilliant mind.

151
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,960
I was considered for
a Nobel Prize in physics.

152
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,261
I didn't get it.

153
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,762
But, you know,
it's all politics,

154
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,199
just like every
other phony honor.

155
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,600
Incidentally,
don't think I'm bitter

156
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,804
because of some
personal setback.

157
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:33,441
By the standards
of a mindless,
barbaric civilization,

158
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,443
I've been pretty lucky.

159
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,546
I was married
to a beautiful woman,
who had family money.

160
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,916
For years we lived
on Beekman Place.

161
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,518
I taught at Columbia.

What's the matter, Boris?

164
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,328

JESSICA: What is it?

166
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:57,265
I'm dying!

167
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,733
Should I call
an ambulance?

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,204
No! No, not now! No, not tonight!
I mean, eventually!

169
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,873
Boris, everybody dies.

170
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,507
It's unacceptable!

171
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,844
Your panic attacks are
getting more frequent
and more intense.

172

You have to go
back on your medicine.

173
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,514
I'm not going back
on my goddamn medicine.

174
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:15,316
I won't have my mind
befuddled by chemicals

Boris, I have clients to see
tomorrow morning.

It is 4:00 a.m.!

to fill it full of art and
expensive possessions,

182
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:29,764
so they can
flaunt their money

183
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:34,102
and be in the top 1%
of this shameful,
violent, prejudiced,

Can you spare me this sophomoric tirade!

186
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,678
I'm a man with
a huge worldview.

187
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,114
I'm surrounded
by microbes!

And what about me?
Am I a microbe?

189

Is our son at Yale
a microbe?

190
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,621
Let's face it,
Jessica, okay?

191
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:56,224
Our marriage hasn't
been a garden of roses.

192
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,960
Botanically speaking,
you're more of
a Venus flytrap.

193
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,862
You are a very
difficult man
to live with.

194
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:02,931
Is that why you
had an affair?

195
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,598
I didn't have an affair.

196
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,568
It was a brief
interlude of infidelity,
and it happened years ago.

197
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,737
You still can't forget it!

198
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:13,507
I see everything
so clearly now.
Everything!

199
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,643
I married you for
all the wrong reasons.

200
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,011
What's that
supposed to mean?

201
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,181
You're brilliant.
I wanted someone
to talk to.

202
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,118
You loved classical music,
you loved art,
you loved literature.

203
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:26,220
You loved sex!
You loved me!

204
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,022
Those sound like
pretty good
reasons to me!

205
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,759
Yes! Exactly!
That's the problem!
That's the problem!

206
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,429
It was rational,
it made sense!

207
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,297
I don't know
what went wrong.

208
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,633
When you examine it,
there is so much
right about us.

209
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,469
On paper we're ideal.

210
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,607
But life isn't on paper.

I hit the goddamn canopy.

Moron doctors!
Look. Look at this limp.

218
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,228
I never had a limp before.

219
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,232
Meanwhile, I divorced Jessica,
moved downtown and gave up.

He'll be an
incompetent idiot at 58.

225

More important than
how I make my living,

226
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:29,117
is why I bother

In America,
as much as they

they hate Jews
even more.

Did you pick up
a chessboard
full of pieces

247
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:14,429
and hit my son with it
at his lesson today?

Do me a favor.
Don't send that cretin
to me anymore.

Which is skewed,
because he's your
unfortunate issue.

254
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,580
So you threw
a chessboard at him?

255
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,115
I didn't throw it at him.

256
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,718
I picked up the board
and dumped the pieces
on his head

257
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:40,988
as an object lesson
to shake him out of
his vegetable torpor.

He will punch you
in the nose.

Her husband's in
Fort Lauderdale.

262

He's probably hanging
out with naked coeds
on spring break.

263
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,001
He tells her it's
a business trip.

You said you were starving.
What do you like?

305
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:36,770
I like oysters,
blackened redfish,

306
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,306
gumbo, crab legs,
black-eyed...

307
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:39,940
Are you nuts?
What do you think
I'm running?

308
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,509
A Creole restaurant?

309
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:42,876
How about
a can of sardines?

310
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,179
Oh, yes, please.

311
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:48,349
Gumbo.
So what's your name?

312
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,918
Melody. Melody Celestine.

313
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:53,120
Melody Celestine.

314
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,656
Melody Saint Anne Celestine.

315
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:58,992
It's French.
My mama's family was
from New Orleans.

316
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,130
I'm from Mississippi,
Mr...

317
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:06,033
Um...

318
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:09,704
(STAMMERING) Muggeridge.
Lionel Muggeridge.

319
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,305
Mr. Muggeridge.

320
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,108
(SIGHS)

321
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:17,612
Eden, Mississippi.
You ever hear of it?

322
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,447
No, I haven't.

323
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,449
Not even the people
who live there
have heard of it.

324
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,752
So...

325
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:26,754
So what are you
running away from?

326
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,656
(SIGHING) Home.

327
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,791
Could you be more specific,
Melanie?

328
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,694
Melody. Melanie was
from  <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

329
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:36,830
Oh, yeah.
I preferred the one
who played Scarlett.

330
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:40,167
MELODY: Why?
Melanie was the nice one.
She marries Ashley.

331
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,469
(SCOFFS) Ashley.
What an imbecile!

332
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:43,537
I couldn't stand him,
I couldn't stand his wife,

333
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,374
that goody two-shoes,
sexual nothing.

334
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:51,646
Scarlett, bitch that she was,
with those green eyes...

335
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:54,014
You know,
I came in first dressed
as Scarlett O'Hara

336
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:55,583
in one of the pageants.

337
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,818
BORIS: Pageant?
- Mmm-hmm.

338
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:01,221
(CHUCKLING) My mom always
used to keep me busy
in all these beauty contests.

339
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,091
That's why I didn't
get to schooling much.

340
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,795
All right,
my advice to you,
go back home.

341
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:10,598
Oh, no,
I'm never going back home.

342
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,166
You're a
brainless little twit

343
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,101
who won't last
three days in New York.

344
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,869
You'd be dead
now of starvation

345
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,838
if I hadn't a heart
as big as all outdoors.

346
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:20,174
I can't go back home,
Mr. Muggeridge.

347
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:21,509
All right,
stop calling me Muggeridge.

348
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:23,076
But that's your name.

349
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:24,945
No, it's not my name.
My name is Boris Yellnikoff.

350
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:26,781
I was using an alias.
I thought, who knows,

351
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,783
you might be
from the Taliban
or something.

352
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,951
Can I stay here?

353
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,455
Stay here?
What are you? Nuts?
How old are you?

354
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:35,790
I'm 21.

355
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:38,292
Twenty-one? Yeah.

356
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,362
You're 21 like
I play for the Yankees.
Twenty-one!

357
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,764
You're a professional
athlete with that limp?

358
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,165
Oh, Christ!

359
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,034
All right, look,
I don't want to go back.

360
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,969
Okay? I want to
make a new life here
in New York.

361
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,372
You'll wind up a prostitute,
like those Asian girls

362
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,106
who come here
full of high hopes.

363
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,876
And then they wind up
turning tricks to keep alive.

364
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,945
And many of them are
actually good-looking.

365
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:01,915
That's so funny you
just mentioned tricks!
You know, I do magic.

366
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,917
I do. I can show you.
I just need...

367
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,619
Do you have any
silk handkerchiefs?

368
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,656
Yeah, you know,
some other time,
you're...

369
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:11,058
Look, you're a sweet kid.

370
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,094
Stupid beyond
all comprehension,

371
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,929
but you'll
never survive here.

372
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:18,899
You got nothing
going for you.
Zero. Zilch.

373
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,002
You know, you may be
beauty contest material
in the Deep South,

374
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,972
but this is the big time.
Here, you're a three.

375
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,843
A five maybe
after you bathe.

376
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,144
Did you get that limp
playing for the Yankees?

377
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,247
Imbecile child.
Brainless inchworm.

378
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:34,515
I didn't play
for the Yankees!

379
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,950
I was being
sarcastic before.

380
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:40,354
Oh, you...
I took it seriously.

381
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,122
Yes.

382
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,527
I usually get jokes.
At the church's social,
I was the comedian twice.

383
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,295
I've a way with jokes. Yes.
- Really?

384
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,597
Spare me
and just get out.

385
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,399
No, Mr. Muggeridge...

386
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,501
Stop calling me
Muggeridge, okay?
I already explained that!

387
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,771
I know, I know.
I'm sorry. I just...

388
00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:00,775
I just need a place to
stay for a few nights,
till I get on my feet.

389
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:04,111
I don't have
anywhere to go.

390
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:07,981
And if you throw me out
and I wind up
an Asian prostitute,

391
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:10,551
that's gonna be
on your conscience.

392
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,186
(SIGHING)

393
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,389
I give up.
Sleep on the couch, imbecile.

394
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:17,658
I'm too tired to prolong
this brutal exchange

395
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,261
between a bedraggled microbe
and a Nobel-level thinker.

396
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,130
Keep out of my way.

397
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:24,965
I will, I promise.

398
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm just gonna use
the little girl's
to freshen up,

399
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,835
and then I'm gonna
go right to sleep.

400
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,371
Yes, yes,
use the little girl's.
Freshen up.

401
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,973
Don't forget to
tip the attendant.

402
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,675
MELODY: I won't.
Thank you so much, Mr...

403
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,343
Oh, what?

404
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,011
You were going to say Muggeridge again?
- No!

405
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,915
It's Boris Yellnikoff!
You call me Muggeridge one more time,

406
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,484
I'm gonna throw you
out the goddamn window.

407
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,985
Do you mind if
I watch a little TV?

408
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:46,554
Yes, I do, simpleton.

409
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,756
I just like to turn
some on at
night to unwind.

410
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,625
Yeah. You touch that dial,
I'll unwind your head
with my bare hands.

411
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,293
How about that?

412
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:57,798
Did you hear about Boris?
- What?

413
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,065
I tried to call him
yesterday

414
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,433
and a woman
answered the phone.

415
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,202
No! Who is she?

416
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,237
He got conned
into letting some
little runaway

417
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,306
bed down in his apartment
while she looks for
a job and gets settled.

418
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,108
Apparently she's
never been to
New York before

419
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:10,377
and she's asked him
if he would
show her around.

420
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:12,078
Boris is going to be sightseeing?
- Yeah.

421
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,413
Not a chance.
- No way.

422
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,681
No way.

423
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,918
BORIS: My whole life
I've lived in New York,

424
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,186
I never wanted to
go to Grant's Tomb.

425
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:22,623
Now I know why.
- Why?

426
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,859
I should never go
to a tomb, ever.

427
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,828
My mom brought me
up to believe that

428
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:31,131
the good Lord has a plan
that we're all a part of.

429
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:32,766
He has His eye
on the sparrow.

430
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,802
Yeah, I pity the sparrow.

431
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,139
I'm not getting
into heaven, though.
I sinned.

432
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:42,042
You? You're kidding.
You sinned?

433
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,310
I made love
before I was married.

434
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:46,046
Oh, my God.

435
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:50,083
Plenty of my friends have,
but in my house,
that's just unforgivable.

436
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,685
I just couldn't
resist Bobby Klaxon.

437
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:53,654
All right, okay,
spare me the details,
all right.

438
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,488
No, it was
really beautiful!

439
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:59,492
I mean, he was just this
pretty boy guitar player
in this amazing rock band.

440
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:00,794
I mean, if you think
you're a genius,

441
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:01,895
he can double
on the drums.

442
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,496
No! Doubles on drums?

443
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,998
Yeah.

444
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,936
All the girls
had a crush on him,
but he liked me.

445
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:11,371
He was so sweet
and sensitive,

446
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,941
and he caught
the biggest catfish
in Plaquemines County.

447
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,109
I wondered who
caught that catfish.

448
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,343
Hey, you know,
my mom always told me

449
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,212
that it was gonna
hurt the first time,

450
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,681
you know, she said it was,
you know,

451
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:25,251
it's a woman's duty
to just lie down,
bear it and...

452
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,320
You know, she said
there were a lot of
perversions involved,

453
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:30,190
and that, you know,
it's God's will,
you shouldn't do it

454
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:33,393
unless you were married
and you planned

455
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,695
She said it could
be dangerous,

456
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,096
but I just felt
like it was

457
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:39,032
the most natural
thing in the world.

458
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,801
You know,
it just felt right.

459
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:45,672
And all the little
extras were just fun.
It wasn't complicated at all.

460
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,140
And I think Bobby
really liked it,

461
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,543
because he was
going to dump
his Betty Jo Cleary,

462
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:51,712
this girl he was
going steady with.

463
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,781
But I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hear of it.

464
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,249
It was just what it was,
you know,

465
00:18:56,317 --> 00:19:00,721
it was a nice moment
behind the tent
at the fish fry.

466
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:03,757
That is the most
disgusting story

adenoidal guitar player
slaking your lust

468
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:09,262
at some barbaric
social function.

No, I do not. No.

00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,939
Boris, do you want to
be buried or cremated?

473
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,774
All right,
I really don't want to
talk about that. Okay?

474
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,142
I think I want
to be cremated.

I used to think
it was AIDS,

I have a morbid
fear of the dark

Soon as they came over,
each ethnic group

was met with
violence and hostility.

Each one had to claw
and fight its way in.

519

People always
hated foreigners.
It's the American way.

520

focus on the positive
things about America.

Chained in ships!

My daddy says that
America bends over
backwards for the blacks

524
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:31,171

and it's crazy.

originally conceived.

00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:12,392
is finally the best way
to make one's point.

607
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,561
Boris,

608
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:21,667
what would you say
if I was to say

609
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,938
that I was developing
a little crush on you?

610
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:29,209
I'd say don't.

611
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:31,544
Why?

612
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:35,281
Because anything deeper,
more significant between us,

613
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,250
is out of the question.

614
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:38,451
Because why?

615
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,453
Because it's
too preposterous

616
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:42,755
to even dignify
with an answer.

617
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:44,524
It is?

618
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:47,927
Every single thing
is against it.

619
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:51,264
Our ages, our backgrounds,
our brains, our interests.

620
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,400
Not to mention,
I have no desire

621
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,801
to have a relationship
with a woman, any woman,

622
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:59,439
nor any urge to make love,
nor any desire to be anything

623
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:02,075
but isolated
from the world.

624
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,245
And, you know,
you're a beautiful girl

625
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:09,815
who should be meeting
normal healthy men
and going out.

626
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:13,353
Yeah, but I don't like
normal healthy men.

627
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:16,789
I like you.

628
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:19,192
(CHUCKLING) I...
You're hallucinating!

629
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,063
I'm sure you'll make
some man very happy

630
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,630
at a fish fry
or a dog fight

631
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:27,167
or however you
people spend time.

632
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:30,937
You really think
I'm beautiful?

633
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:35,375
I admit I didn't give
you your full due
at first, physically.

634
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:38,278
However, as only
a great mind can do,

635
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:42,148
I've reassessed
my position,

636
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:46,152
and changed my mind.

637
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,189
So you could never
think of marrying me?

638
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,092
Have you lost your mind?

639
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,095
Why on Earth
would you even fantasize
about such a thing?

640
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:58,931
What could I offer you,
but a bad temper,
hypochondriasis,

641
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:03,836
morbid fixations,
reclusive rages
and misanthropy?

642
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:05,472
And what could you
offer me?

643
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,875
A character
out of Faulkner,
not unlike Benjy.

644
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:12,845
The answer to
your question is no.

645
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:17,984
I think you should
stay here for a while,
accumulate some money,

646
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:21,687
and then find
a place of your own,
and move on with your life.

647
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:23,923
Well, what about your life?

648
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:27,227
Let me teach you
something about love.
Okay?

649
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:29,496
Naturally,
there are exceptions
to what I'm going to say,

650
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:32,265
but they're
the exception,
not the rule.

651
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:36,536
Love, despite
what they tell you,

652
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:40,706
does not conquer all.
Nor does it
even usually last.

653
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:43,943
In the end, the romantic
aspirations of our youth

654
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:46,779
are reduced to

655
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,015
whatever works. Okay?

656
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:54,654
Why do I think
your bark is worse
than your bite?

657
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,389
Cliche, Melody.

658
00:27:56,457 --> 00:28:00,326
Oh, I don't care!
If the shoe fits, wear it,
and that's another one.

659
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:15,074
We need to talk
for a minute.

660
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:18,978
Can you believe
this little inchworm
setting her sights on me?

661
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:23,082
Yes, yes, we had
some pleasant moments.

662
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,052
Some dinners,
some walks in the park.

663
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,556
I gave her the benefit
of my vast knowledge
and experience.

664
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:33,092
Tried to impart to her
the perceptions and values

665
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,095
of a truly
original mentality.

666
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:39,031
I only wish I could do
a Pygmalion on her.

667
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:40,900
But if Henry Higgins
ever tried to

668
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,769
transform Melody
Saint Anne Celestine,

669
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:46,673
he, too, would have
jumped out the window.

670
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,176
Come on.

671
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,111
Oh, boy! New friends.
- I'm sorry.

672
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,712
Oh, yeah.
They like each other.

673
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,115
It's okay.
I rather like dogs.

674
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,017
Well, I'm more of
a cat person, myself.

675
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:15,885
I just do this
professionally. Sorry.

676
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,387
I never met
a professional
dog walker.

677
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:22,225
Really? It's not
really the career
that I want, but...

678
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,127
What do you want to do?

679
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,629
I'd like to work
with children.

680
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:29,132
You're very pretty,
you know that?

681
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,599
Shut up! Thank you.

682
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,535
Can I ask your name?

683
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:35,905
It's Melody.
Melody Saint Anne Celestine.

684
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:39,575
What a beautiful name!
Mine's Perry Singleton.

685
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:41,311
It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

686
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:44,047
May I walk along
with you?

687
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,781
I don't see why not,
you know,

688
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,750
since we're all
doomed anyway.

689
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:49,085
Pardon me?

690
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:50,553
Well, you know,
everything ends.

691
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:53,323
I don't think I follow.

692
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:58,527
Well, you know,
it's like the cosmos,
or eternity.

693
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:01,664
Whichever's bigger.
I just know that
we're all flying apart.

694
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,835
What is that?
What is that?
Is that a move?

695
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:07,170
Well, I thought
your bishop was...

696
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,739
My bishop what? What?
You patzer, you earthworm!

697
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:12,842
How many times do
I have to tell you?
You don't take that pawn.

698
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,744
That's called
the poisoned pawn,
because look!

699
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:15,845
Boris!
- Look what happens!

700
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:17,347
(SCREAMS)

701
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:18,948
Sorry, Mr. Yellnikoff.
-Yeah, you're sorry, you're sorry.

702
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,783
Use your head next time,
you won't be sorry!

703
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,685
Boris!

704
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,787
Yeah. Do your
homework next week.
Don't waste my time.

705
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:26,589
Hey!
- Poisoned!

706
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,258
I got off work early
today and I thought

707
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:29,859
maybe we could
walk home together.

708
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:32,095
Maybe I can make
black-eyed peas and
crab cakes for dinner.

709
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,196
No, I'm not hungry.

710
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,297
What's the matter?

711
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,999
My ulcer's been
killing me all day.

712
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:37,633
I thought you
didn't have an ulcer.

713
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,203
No, I said they
can't find an ulcer,
not that I don't have one.

714
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,305
Those malpractice
medical mental midgets.

715
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,773
They drop that endoscope
down my throat

716
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,174
and probe me
like coal miners,

717
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:47,643
and they always
come up with nothing!

718
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,612
Well, guess
what happened today?

719
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,514
I got to talking to
this boy on the job,

720
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,682
and he asked me
out on a date.

721
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,886
Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

722
00:30:56,954 --> 00:30:59,255
I could tell he
liked me right off

723
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:02,959
and we went and had coffee
and just had, you know,
funny banter.

724
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,928
You know what banter is,
it's like flirty talk.

725
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:07,230
Yeah, yeah,
I'm familiar with banter.

726
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,066
Yeah, so, anyway,
he asked if I had
a boyfriend.

727
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:14,137
I said, "Not really."
He said, "I'll pick
you up Friday at 8:00."

728
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:16,705
What do you think?

729
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:22,178
Great. I just hope
he's not a Ted Bundy,
you know.

730
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,047
A who?

731
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:26,182
You have to
keep an eye out
for serial killers.

732
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,752
He's not a serial killer.
At least he didn't
mention it.

733
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,554
Yeah, well,
you have to be careful.

734
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:34,190
Sometimes they put you
in the trunk of a car
and you can't breathe.

735
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:36,159
I'm not...
I'm serious.

736
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:39,329
I told him your theory
about capital punishment.

737
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,864
What did you say?

738
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:45,668
That it should include
people that don't pick up
after their dogs,

739
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:47,370
people who ride their
bikes on the sidewalk,

740
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,340
people who call
mothers "moms" and...

741
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:53,343
I can't remember them all,
you have so many.

742
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,984
How do I look?
- Subnormal.

743
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,853
Why? What's wrong?

744
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,554
That's an awfully
aggressive ensemble.

745

MELODY: I want
to look nice.

747
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,394
Just kind of
give him an idea

748
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,197
of what he might be in for
if he plays his cards right.

749
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:16,866
Oh, yeah?
What's he in for?

750
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,102
All the stuff
with a woman
that you reject,

751
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,670
because you're a genius
and you're above it all.

752
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,706
But I happen to be
pretty sharp, too,

753
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:26,775
and I have a natural talent
in the field of
fooling around.

754
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:29,045
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Yeah, well, I just hope
you're saving your money

755
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,215
so you can move out
quickly, you know,
now that you're working.

the nose on your face.
Cliche, sorry.

I thought he was
acting peculiar,

because things was going
so bad for us, darling.

How often did you
have intercourse?

in the stock market
after you left

and we were forced
to sell the house.

1048

You sold the house?
- I'm sorry, yes. We took a beating,

1049
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:06,589
because we were
so desperate.

1050
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:09,157
And then he lost his job,
the company went
out of business.

1051
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,594
And then we
spent all our savings
on medical bills,

I turned to Jesus
in a deeper way

00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:21,937
than I had ever
done in my life.

1057
00:47:22,004 --> 00:47:25,974
I prayed and I prayed,
every day and every night,

1058
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:28,110
asking God to help me.

1059

(PANTING)
Let me guess what happened,
your shingles got worse.

1060
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,549

just give me one sign

"that all my suffering
is for a purpose."

1062
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:38,387
I said, "Please, God,
just say something."

1063
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,223
"Break your silence.
I can't take
any more misery!"

1064
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,026
Nothing, right?
And all that money you put
in the tin box every Sunday.

00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:06,815
That's how I feel. Well...
- Even if the woman is raped?

1067
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,983
Why are you wasting
your breath, Brockman?

1068
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,385
You're dealing
with an aborigine.

1069
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:11,453
You don't mind
killing the unborn,

1070
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,722
but when some fiend
has raped and murdered,

1071
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,691
you're against
giving him that
big old injection?

1072
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,393
Well, not me,
Mr. Genius,

1073
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,428
and I don't care
how many Academy
Awards you've won.

1074
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,029
I've never won
an Academy Award

1075
00:48:21,097 --> 00:48:23,499
and I've never played
for the Yankees!

1076
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:27,770
Where's the little girl's? Thank you.
- It's back there.

1077
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:31,407
Don't forget to sing
<i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i>
before you sit.

1078
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:43,452
Oh.

1079
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,087
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1080
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:47,856
I realize
this is forward,

1081
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,426
but who's that
beautiful young girl
you're with?

1082
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,695
May I ask why
you want to know?

1083
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:54,330
Well, because
she's very beautiful.

1084
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:56,498
And I'm assuming
she's your daughter?

1085
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,572
What did you say
your name was, darling?

1086
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,675
Randy. Randy Lee James.
- Randy Lee James.

1087
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,444
Nice to meet you.

1088
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,645
It's too good.
I think they're putting
mayonnaise in here.

1089
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,146
No, they can't put
mayonnaise in hummus.

1090
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,582
Hello.
Oh, thank you.

1091
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,717
Who were you
talking to?

1092
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,819
I wasn't talking
to anybody. Nobody.

1093
00:49:16,886 --> 00:49:19,321
Listen, listen,
I want to go
someplace fun.

1094
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,824
Take me someplace fun!
It's New York! Let's go.

1095
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:23,792
Boris, where can I
take her that's fun?

1096
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,026
How about
the Holocaust Museum?

1097
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,562
Oh, for God's sake, Boris.
- No.

1098
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:28,630
Oh, the wax! The wax figures.
- Oh, yes.

1099
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:31,400
Yes, yes, let's go. Come on.
- Let's do that.

1100
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,535
It was so nice to meet you, Leo.
- You, too. Have a nice day.

1101
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,070
Bye. Bye, bye.

1102
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:38,073
Bye. Have fun!

1103
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,777
You know, I have to say,
even with a textbook
right-wing mentality,

1104
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,680
your mother-in-law has
beautifully shaped breasts.

1105
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,249
You know,
you're a man of learning,

1106
00:49:47,316 --> 00:49:50,452
of cultivation of
aesthetic sensibility.

1107
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,088
This is what you
take away from the
school-prayer hokum

1108
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:55,424
and "my country
right or wrong"?
Her bosom?

1109
00:49:55,492 --> 00:50:01,129
It's not just her bosom.
Her behind is also
beautifully contoured.

1110
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:03,231
Well, I'm sure
you'll have no problem
getting her into bed.

1111
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:06,101
She's vulnerable,
she's stupid and
she's been abandoned.

1112
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:07,803
Personally, I lose
all erotic inclination

1113
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,439
when the woman's a
member of the National
Rifle Association.

1114
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,374
It's pear-shaped.

1115
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,842
Degas used to
distinguish between

1116
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,612
an apple-shaped behind
and pear-shaped.

1117
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,080
And I'm a big fruit eater.

1118
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:21,283
Melody.
- That's so weird.

1119
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,586
Oh, my God.
Oh, hello.

1120
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,254
They're made out
of real wax, too.

1121
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:27,623
Oh, it's Billy.
Billy...

1122
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,625
Billy Graham!

1123
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:31,627
Oh, sweet pea,
sweet pea,

1124
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:34,229
this is the kind of man
you should be married to,

1125
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,197
not that Communist
who sings  <i>Happy Birthday</i>

1126
00:50:36,265 --> 00:50:38,366
every time he
washes his hands.

1127
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,302
How long are
you staying, Mom?

1128
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:42,905
Honey, I don't know
where else to go.

1129
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:44,706
I have nothing
to hold onto.

1130
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:46,975
Nothing! I have to
have something.

1131
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:51,146
I mean, I'm never
going to attract a man
again, but you can. Yes.

1132
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:52,714
I don't want to
get in an argument.

1133
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:55,818
Honey, I met a young man today
who is perfect for you.

1134
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,352
Mom!
- Yes. Listen to me.

1135
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,655
He is talented,
handsome, sweet,

1136
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:03,224
and he has the proper
reverence for life
and its higher purpose.

1137
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,827
What are you
talking about?

1138
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:06,995
Face it, Melody,
Boris is not
like a real husband.

1139
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,065
He's more of an outpatient
and you're his keeper.

1140
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:12,367
I really wish you
hadn't showed up, Mom.

1141
00:51:12,435 --> 00:51:15,403
His name is
Randy Lee James.

1142
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,572
Who?

1143
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,973
This delightful young actor.

1144
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,475
He fell in love with you
at first sight.

1145
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:21,743
He did. He did.
- Mom, I'm married!

1146
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:25,347
I refuse to recognize it.
What are you doing
with a gimpy chess bum

1147
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,015
who has to sleep
with the light on?

1148
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,317
How'd he get that limp?

1149
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:31,753
He jumped out the window
and his suicide didn't work.

1150
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:34,422
Well, you can't
win them all.
Now, listen,

1151
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,092
I have a good lawyer
who can get all
of this annulled.

1152
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:40,195
All of it. Yes. Yes.
- No, no, Mom, no, you're crazy!

1153
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:42,197
Oh, hello.

1154
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:45,033
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

1155
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,102
# Happy birthday to you

1156
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,872
# Happy birthday to you

1157
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:52,040
# Happy birthday to you

1158
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:55,477
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

1159
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:59,280
# Happy birthday to you #

1160
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:02,050
(PHONE RINGING)

1161
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,585
Who could be calling
at midnight?

1162
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,054
Could be burglars,
casing the place.

1163
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,624
To steal what?
Your Flomax?

1164
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,759
Hello?

1165
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:12,661
Oh, hi.

1166
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,631
Yeah, just a second.

1167
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:18,066
It's for me?
- Yes.

1168
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,402
Don't give away
any information about me!

1169
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:22,137
MARIETTA: Hello?
Oh, hello, Leo.

1170
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:23,304
It's Leo Brockman.

1171
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:24,406
Brockman?

1172
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:25,674
Really?

1173
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:26,909
(CHUCKLES)

1174
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:29,144
Well, that sounds wonderful.

1175
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,083
Well, yeah,
Sunday's fine. Yeah.

1176
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,986
3:00? Well, 3:00's perfect.

1177
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,090
Okay. Yeah.
See you, darling.

1178
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:47,029
"See you, darling"?
"See you, darling"?
Oh, God, poor Brockman!

1179
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:48,597
Good night, y'all.

1180
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,231
I'm going to say
my prayers.

1181
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:52,467
I'm praying
Brockman has herpes.

1182
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,470
MARIETTA: That was
so wonderful!

1183
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:58,306
I never in my life
saw a movie in
Japanese before.

1184
00:52:58,374 --> 00:53:00,008
Did you like it?
- Oh, yes!

1185
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,711
I've never seen
a movie made by
a foreigner.

1186
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,714
John, my husband,
took me to see
stupid movies,

1187
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,816
which was
all there was.

1188
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,985
How do you say this?
"Chateau" what?

1189
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,286
BROCKMAN: Meyney.

1190
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:12,788
The what?
- Meyney.

1191
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:14,522
Meyney?
- Yeah.

1192
00:53:15,524 --> 00:53:16,925
It is so delicious.

1193
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,359
(WHOOPING)
I'm glad you like it.

1194
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,398
What do you do?
What do you do, Leo?

1195
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,935
I teach philosophy
at the university
around the corner.

1196
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,706
Tell me something.
Is Boris really a genius?

1197
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:33,475
There was a time
when he was
a very fine physicist.

1198
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:35,243
Yeah, your daughter's
very good for Boris.

1199
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,713
It's my theory that
she keeps him going.

1200
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,882
Would you like to see
some pretty pictures
of Melody?

1201
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,250
Ooh. Goodness.

1202
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,254
BROCKMAN: Well, all right.

1203
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:48,023
Okay.

1204
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,693
Look, here they are.
Look at these.

1205
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,730
Right there, that's where
she is Miss Natchez.

1206
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:58,667
Wow.
- Look at her. And she was Miss Tupelo.

1207
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,435
Oh, God!
Look how gorgeous she is!

1208
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,804
She's so beautiful.
I love her! I love her!

1209
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,606
Very lovely.
- I was so proud of her.

1210
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,207
These pictures are
kind of interesting.

1211
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:07,943
I know!
She's just gorgeous!

1212
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,345
And she has this...
She's just my
little sweet pea.

1213
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:12,648
I mean the photos.
Did you take them?

1214
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:15,450
Yes. Yes.

1215
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:16,652
And this?

1216
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:19,021
That's our house.

1217
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:21,623
(GROANING) Well, it was.
Is there more wine?

1218
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,391
Yeah. You took all these?

1219
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:26,094
Yes, with my
little old Kodak.

1220
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,195
Uh-huh.

1221
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,530
These are outstanding.

1222
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:31,299
I mean,
there's such a sense of
texture and composition.

1223
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:33,135
In these? No.

1224
00:54:33,202 --> 00:54:35,003
No, I mean it. I know
what I'm talking about.

1225
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,206
I occasionally write
about the aesthetics
of photography.

1226
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,608
Oh, my God. I have to
tell you something.

1227
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:41,843
Aside from
Melody's career,

1228
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,112
there is nothing,
nothing in the whole world

1229
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,815
that gave me more pleasure
than taking those snapshots.

1230
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,283
Of course, John...
Cheers.

1231
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,153
John hated them and
didn't want me to do it.

1232
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,621
Why?
- Well,

1233
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,291
he actually was fine,
and then I set up
this darkroom

1234
00:54:56,358 --> 00:55:00,261
and he thought I was,
like, squandering all
this time on silliness

1235
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:01,997
and I guess he
had a point, but...

1236
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,332
I mean, nowadays,
who uses a Kodak anymore?

1237
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,336
It's a little Kodak,
and I have to tell
you something, it is...

1238
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:10,706
It is so simple to use.
It's tiny!

1239
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:12,540
I picked it up at,
like, a garage sale

1240
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:16,277
and it just is
so much better than
those big foreign ones.

1241
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:18,580
No, they're pretty good.
They've got a real

1242
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:20,849
haunting quality.
They're very primitive.

1243
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,985
I really think you should
talk to my friend
Al Morgenstern.

1244
00:55:24,053 --> 00:55:25,453
He runs
a photography gallery.

1245
00:55:25,521 --> 00:55:26,722
Why?

1246
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:28,456
Have you got more of these?

1247
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,325
Oh, Lord, yes.

1248
00:55:30,392 --> 00:55:32,393
You know,
all my travels
with the pageants.

1249
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:35,363
I have the kids
and the towns

1250
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,365
and the winners.
And the losers!

1251
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:40,535
The losers are the best.
And then I have
all these show folk,

1252
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,537
the twirlers,
the magicians,

1253
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,206
the fire eaters, you know,
things like that.

1254
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:46,474
They're amazing.
They've got such
an original quality.

1255
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,276
I'll talk to Al
first thing in the morning.

1256
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,213
Oh, no. You know, I think
you're making too much

1257
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,815
over a little gift
the good Lord Jesus
gave me.

1258
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:56,284
That's not the only gift
He gave you.

1259
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:03,225
You know those clean-cut,
churchgoing young men,

1260
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,826
who are model kids,

1261
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:08,363
and good to their neighbors
and quote the Bible,

1262
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,999
and never do a wrong thing,
and then one day,

1263
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:13,702
for whatever reason,

1264
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:15,837
they grab a rifle,
go to a tower

1265
00:56:15,904 --> 00:56:18,172
and pick off
everyone in town?

1266
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,509
Okay, this is her,
but sexually.

1267
00:56:21,577 --> 00:56:23,478
She slept with Leo Brockman,

1268
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,180
never having been to bed
with anyone before
but her husband,

1269
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,384
and suddenly, the genie
was out of the bottle!

1270
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:31,185
She liked sleeping
with Brockman,

1271
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,255
and she liked sleeping
with Brockman's friends,

1272
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:37,692
Brockman's acquaintances,
Brockman's acquaintances'
acquaintances.

1273
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,961
<i>BORIS: Brockman took</i>
<i>her photos to Morgenstern.</i>

1274
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:41,496
<i>He loved them.</i>

1275
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,431
<i>He decided to show them</i>
<i>in his gallery.</i>

1276
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:45,634
<i>When he did,</i>
<i>everyone thought</i>
<i>they were great.</i>

1277
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:47,135
<i>A brilliant primitive.</i>

1278
00:56:47,202 --> 00:56:50,238
<i>Soon Morgenstern would</i>
<i>become smitten with her.</i>

1279
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,106
<i>First she moved in</i>
<i>with Brockman.</i>

1280
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:54,208
<i>Then she moved in</i>
<i>with Morgenstern.</i>

1281
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:57,044
<i>Then she moved in</i>
<i>with Brockman</i>
<i>and Morgenstern.</i>

1282
00:56:57,112 --> 00:56:59,481
<i>She started dabbling</i>
<i>with collages.</i>

1283
00:56:59,548 --> 00:57:02,751
<i>Small ones at first,</i>
<i>but they would become bolder.</i>

1284
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,687
<i>She started</i>
<i>dressing differently.</i>

1285
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,355
<i>Soon all her</i>
<i>deep-rooted beliefs</i>

1286
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,692
<i>went right down the toilet,</i>
<i>where they belonged.</i>

1287
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,398
<i>She experimented</i>
<i>with exotic pleasures.</i>
<i>A new Marietta was born.</i>

1288
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:20,635
<i>The one thing that</i>
<i>remained constant,</i>
<i>she hated her son-in-law.</i>

1289
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,003
Well, there's some
pictures over there.

1290
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,372
Yes, maybe that.
Okay.

1291
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,108
What do you think, Mom?

1292
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:29,143
I'm not sure, you know,
it's for this collage,

1293
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:34,616
and I've had this vision
in black and white
of nude men, women,

1294
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,518
body parts, squares.

1295
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,920
That sounds confusing.

1296
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:42,056
Well, it's an homage
to lust. Yeah.
To lust.

1297
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:54,602
Excuse me.

1298
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,604
Hi, I need
a female opinion.

1299
00:57:56,672 --> 00:58:00,542
Which of these two
would a young woman
prefer? I can't decide.

1300
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:04,779
I don't know.
They're both so beautiful.

1301
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:08,115
It depends.
What type is she?

1302
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:11,319
Well, she's quite young
and very lovely-looking.

1303
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,988
Blonde hair.
Blue eyes.

1304
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:15,824
Yeah, but what's she like?

1305
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:18,292
Well, okay.
She's from the South,

1306
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,662
although she lives
here in New York now.

1307
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,130
Really?
- Yeah.

1308
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:24,999
And she's a nanny.
I mean, well,
to tell you the truth,

1309
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:27,034
she's actually
living with some man.

1310
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:30,137
I mean, they're married,
although he's not
the best she can do.

1311
00:58:30,205 --> 00:58:32,039
And she thinks
she loves him,
but it's only because

1312
00:58:32,107 --> 00:58:34,876
she mistakes his
pessimistic despair
for wisdom,

1313
00:58:34,943 --> 00:58:36,611
believing he's a genius.

1314
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:42,049
I'd say she's more
of a nurse to him
than a wife,

1315
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:44,652
because he's
much older than she is.

1316
00:58:47,222 --> 00:58:49,657
That sounds so familiar.

1317
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:53,027
I just can't...
I can't put my finger on it.

1318
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:56,831
It's sort of like mine, actually. Yeah.
- It is?

1319
00:58:56,899 --> 00:59:00,902
I mean, not exactly,
but I can't help but
seeing some similarities.

1320
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,405
I'd say that one.

1321
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:04,539
Okay.

1322
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,851
Here.

1323
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:20,855
Here what? For me?
- It's for you.

1324
00:59:20,923 --> 00:59:24,191
Yes, I thought I'd buy
you something lovely.

1325
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:27,529
Oh, no, I can't accept
a gift from a stranger.

1326
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:28,663
Well, why not?

1327
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,931
I'm married.

1328
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:32,767
Yes, but it may
not last forever.

1329
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,869
Well, you know,
nothing lasts forever.

1330
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:39,541
Not even Shakespeare
or Michelangelo

1331
00:59:39,608 --> 00:59:42,544
or Greek people.

1332
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:44,779
I mean, even as
we're standing here
talking right now,

1333
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:48,616
we're just flying apart
at an unimaginable speed.

1334
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:50,785
Gee, I never
thought of it that way.

1335
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,087
Yeah.

1336
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:57,459
Should we be
holding each other
so we don't fall?

1337
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,328
Well, you have to
hold onto whatever
love you can

1338
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:02,163
in this cruel existence.

1339
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,265
Speaking of love,

1340
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:07,068
I've been in love
with you ever since
that first moment I saw you,

1341
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:10,371
and met your mother
at the Mogador Cafe
many months ago.

1342
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:15,510
Oh, you're... You're...

1343
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,012
Did my mother...
- Randy James.

1344
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,316
Oh, the actor! Of course.
I can hear your accent now.

1345
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:24,218
Oh, my mother talks
about you all the time,

1346
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:25,920
and she's always telling me
I have to meet you

1347
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:27,722
and I'm saying, "Why?
Why do I have to meet him?"

1348
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,157
"But he's so good-looking!"
And, yeah, you are.

1349
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:32,393
Thank you.
I've moved to New York
permanently now

1350
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:34,796
and I live in a houseboat
with a friend of mine.

1351
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:37,599
You live on a boat?
- Yes, I do.

1352
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:40,368
I'm very romantic by nature,
so I live on a boat

1353
01:00:40,435 --> 01:00:43,471
and I read and think
and play my flute...

1354
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,840
Mom?
- Oh, be still, Melody.

1355
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,876
There's nothing wrong
with expanding
your horizons.

1356
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,578
I certainly expanded mine.

1357
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,447
You know what?
I'm really sorry, but...

1358
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,917
I think that my mother
badly gave you
the wrong impression,

1359
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,552
because I'm
happily married.

1360
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,687
No, no, no,
no, no, no,
she's not, Randy.

1361
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:03,224
She's nursemaid
to a roach. He is.

1362
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,860
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, Mr. James.

1363
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:10,765
I told you you'd
get the hang of it.

1364
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,100
Okay, you know what?
Let's just stop.
Let's stop.

1365
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:15,570
Let's stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, stop, stop.
- Stop?

1366
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:19,774
Yeah. I need to sit for a minute.
- All right.

1367
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,475
You know,
I'm just doing it for
the aerobics, anyway.

1368
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:23,011
Otherwise, it's moronic.

1369
01:01:23,078 --> 01:01:24,546
I think it's relaxing.

1370
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:28,215
Relaxing?
What? Are you kidding?
It's too nerve-wracking.

1371
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:30,952
To mingle with all
those sub-mentals
on bicycles?

1372
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,787
It's like driving a car.

1373
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,424
Those hostile,
belligerent morons
all get driver's licenses.

1374
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:38,927
Of course,
to have children,
you don't need a license.

1375
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:40,795
No proof of anything.

1376
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,263
You need a license to fish.

1377
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,932
You need a license
to be a barber.

1378
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:45,867
You need a license
to sell hot dogs.

1379
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,603
You know, you read
about these poor kids,
beaten and starved,

1380
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,805
you wonder,
why are these parents
allowed to even have them?

1381
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,307
Okay, Boris, Boris.

1382
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,109
You know,
sometimes I think
you're so determined

1383
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:58,913
not to enjoy
anything in life,
just out of spite.

1384
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,949
You know,
like a child who's
throwing a tantrum,

1385
01:02:01,016 --> 01:02:02,884
because he can't
have his own way.

1386
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:05,486
Wow! Listen to you!

1387
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,455
That's a reasonably
wise insight

1388
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:10,324
for a simple-minded
type like yourself.

1389
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:14,896
Honestly. Yeah,
you surprise and delight me
sometimes, you know that?

1390
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:20,534
I really don't know
what I'd do without you,
seriously.

1391
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,837
What are you doing
with that?

1392
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:27,508
This? Nothing.
I just got it at
the flea market.

1393
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:29,711
Who needs
an antique handkerchief?

1394
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:31,345
I thought it was pretty.

1395
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:35,216
Yeah, but God knows
throughout history
who blew his nose in it.

1396
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,186
Marietta? Honey?
MARIETTA: Yes, darling?

1397
01:02:39,254 --> 01:02:42,090
I think you should
include these photos
at your opening next week.

1398
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:43,557
I love those photos.
Al, what do you think?

1399
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:44,959
MORGENSTERN: I chose those.

1400
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,494
MARIETTA: Oh, you did?
- Absolutely.

1401
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:47,595
Sweetheart, you've managed to make...
- Thank you.

1402
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,330
...an existential
statement about

1403
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:51,633
sexual perversity and human freedom.
- Who? Yes.

1404
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,534
It's so full of
erotic imagination.
Okay, hold on a sec.

1405
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:54,702
Oh, thank you so much!
Thank you!

1406
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,903
Marietta?

1407
01:02:55,971 --> 01:03:00,174
Who is it?
- Somebody named Randy Jones?

1408
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:02,010
Oh, Randy, Randy James.

1409
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:04,545
Hello? Hello? Hey!

1410
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:07,248
Young man, hello, hello!

1411
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:10,417
Listen, she's going to be
at Uniqlo at around 3:00.

1412
01:03:10,485 --> 01:03:13,387
You can run into her
and try your luck.

1413
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:15,422
You know, she saved
the handkerchief you gave her,

1414
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,391
so it's not
a hopeless cause.

1415
01:03:17,459 --> 01:03:21,262
And I'm telling you,
I saw fire behind her eyes.
Fire.

1416
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,631
Yeah. Good luck, darling.

1417
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,634
Who was that?
- Oh, nothing. Come on, gumbo! Let's go.

1418
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:27,902
Who'd have ever
thought that gumbo

1419
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,070
would become my
favorite dinner?

1420
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,372
All this and
she cooks, too.

1421
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:39,781
Oh, my God! Hello.

1422
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:44,085
So I guess you
just happened to be
shopping here. Right?

1423
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,987
Well, I was
buying this shirt,
if you must know.

1424
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,088
Uh-huh.

1425
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,622
You like it?

1426
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,925
It's okay.
- Just okay?

1427
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,894
I thought it'd
make me look dashing.

1428
01:03:52,961 --> 01:03:54,896
Looks aren't your problem.

1429
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:56,263
Oh, no? What is?

1430
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:57,498
You're too forward.

1431
01:03:57,566 --> 01:03:59,000
I think about you a lot.

1432
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,569
Well, I don't
think about you.

1433
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:05,606
So what's it like
being married to a genius?

1434
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:07,441
Who wants to know?

1435
01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:10,778
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be a boor, I just...

1436
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:12,947
Just that,
well, you know.

1437
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,616
It has its
pluses and minuses.

1438
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:19,153
Yes?
And what are the drawbacks?

1439
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,122
I don't know.
I mean...

1440
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,557
Well, naturally,
with a very advanced mind,

1441
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,961
you find a lot of things
wrong with everything

1442
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,696
and, mainly,
he just doesn't
like people.

1443
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,098
You know,
he says at the rate
they're going,

1444
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:31,799
they're going to make
themselves extinct.

1445
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,634
Right.

1446
01:04:33,702 --> 01:04:37,404
It can just be exhausting
being around a genius
all the time.

1447
01:04:37,472 --> 01:04:41,142
So what are the pluses
of being the wife of
such a dazzling mind?

1448
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:43,577
Well, he's smart.

1449
01:04:43,645 --> 01:04:45,046
You said that.

1450
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,280
He's clever.

1451
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:48,249
Uh-huh.

1452
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:53,487
He really means well, you know?
He's just a little crazy.

1453
01:04:53,555 --> 01:04:57,458
I guess the good part
is that I'm the wife
of a genius,

1454
01:04:57,525 --> 01:04:59,827
which I never
really thought
I could swing.

1455
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:01,062
Why not?

1456
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:06,700
I guess I thought
I'd have to be smarter.

1457
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:10,304
You want to see my boat?
I mean, my friend's boat,
where I live?

1458
01:05:10,372 --> 01:05:12,473
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1459
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,109
I dreamt about you
last night. I...

1460
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,811
Don't use that line.
Because Boris said

1461
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,445
that he dreamt
about me last night.

1462
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,481
And I really doubt
it's mathematically
possible

1463
01:05:20,548 --> 01:05:23,251
for me to be in
two dreams at one time.

1464
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,525
It's down there,
on the right-hand side.

1465
01:05:34,562 --> 01:05:36,030
Well, this is it.

1466
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,901
It's not much,
but it's home and
I don't pay rent, so...

1467
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:42,770
This is kind of sweet,
living on the water.

1468
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,338
It rocks
just the tiniest bit,

1469
01:05:44,406 --> 01:05:47,942
so I sleep
like a baby on it.

1470
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,112
Randy, I don't know
what I'm doing here!
I'm married!

1471
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,247
That doesn't mean
I can't have
feelings for you.

1472
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:54,849
You don't
really know me.

1473
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:58,452
Yes, but I'm a romantic
and I believe in
love at first sight.

1474
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,622
Well, that's true.
You know, Boris says
that love isn't logical.

1475
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,524
And I adore
the way you talk

1476
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:05,759
and the funny things
you say.

1477
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:09,297
Where can it lead?

1478
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:11,565
Let's drink to
love at first sight.

1479
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:15,203
I can't. When I drink,
I get very silly
and touchy and...

1480
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,004
That's what
your mum said.

1481
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:18,906
That's why
I bought the bottle.
She's quite a mum.

1482
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:21,309
Don't use that locution.
It's for inchworms.

1483
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:22,543
Sorry.

1484
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:27,081
Is that you
in the picture?

1485
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,017
Yeah. That's me in
<i>Juno and the Paycock.</i>

1486
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:32,419
I bet you're
a really good actor.

1487
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:35,223
I try. Although
I'll never be a genius.

1488
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:39,426
You certainly
are handsome enough
to be a star.

1489
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:42,330
Thank you. I'll cherish
that compliment.

1490
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,872
Oh, my God.
- What are you thinking?

1491
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:54,008
Entropy.
- Entropy?

1492
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,344
Yeah, entropy.
Boris explained it.

1493
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:59,847
It's why you can't
get the toothpaste
back in the tube.

1494
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,516
You mean,

1495
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:07,355
once something happens,
it's difficult to put it
back the way it was?

1496
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:10,391
I mean, Boris says
love is all about luck.

1497
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,094
I think so, too,
but isn't that
just because

1498
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:15,029
we're young and we think
we're going to live forever

1499
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,598
and then we grow old
and get diabetes, and...

1500
01:07:17,665 --> 01:07:19,200
Maybe.

1501
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,002
Look, I do agree
there's not much

1502
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:23,771
you can be sure of
in this world, but...

1503
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,375
Have you ever heard of
Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle?

1504
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:29,143
I've heard of it, yeah.

1505
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,579
You know, the observer
influences the experiment?

1506
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:33,781
Uh-huh.

1507
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:35,649
It's just like

1508
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:38,119
when my mother makes love
to one of the guys
she's living with

1509
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:40,321
a certain way
when they're alone,

1510
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:44,825
but when she's in
front of the other guy,
she does it differently.

1511
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:47,361
Is that Heisenberg?

1512
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:49,596
I had no idea
he was so sexual.

1513
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:59,673
Wait. I always carry
some Viagra with me.

1514
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:02,376
That's all right.
I eat a lot of red meat.

1515
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:11,452
(SIGHING)

1516
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:23,464
I really like the way
these pants fit.

1517
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:31,005
Hey, are you okay?
You seem awfully
quiet lately.

1518
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:33,807
Yeah.

1519
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:36,377
We're going to be late
for Mom's gallery opening.

1520
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,079
I hope you're not
coming down with anything.

1521
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:41,048
You know, Brodsky's
kid's got the measles.

1522
01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:42,583
Can you still
get the measles?

1523
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,952
I had a shot
when I was younger,

1524
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,054
but how long
does it last?

1525
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,056
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1526
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,525
Who's that?

1527
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,295
I don't know.
I'm not expecting anyone.

1528
01:08:57,732 --> 01:08:59,300
Melody!
- Daddy!

1529
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,668
Oh, my little girl,
I found you!

1530
01:09:01,736 --> 01:09:03,904
Oh, Lord,
your mother and I
searched and searched,

1531
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:05,473
but then we
ran out of leads.

1532
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,541
I used every connection
I had at the police force.

1533
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:09,810
We even called the FBI!
But you're okay.

1534
01:09:09,878 --> 01:09:12,380
Things are going
to be fine now.
Your ordeal is over.

1535
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,215
What ordeal?

1536
01:09:14,282 --> 01:09:16,183
You were abducted!
Tell me if my theory
is correct.

1537
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,585
You were chloroformed
by polygamous Mormons.

1538
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:20,087
They took you off to
be someone's bride!

1539
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:23,190
I was not abducted.
Didn't anybody
read my letters?

1540
01:09:23,258 --> 01:09:26,327
Yeah, but I assumed
you were forced to
write them at gunpoint.

1541
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,861
Who's this?
- Who are you?

1542
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:29,096
This is Boris,
my husband.

1543
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:30,264
Boris, your who?

1544
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,733
He's my husband.
I'm Mrs. Boris Yellnikoff.

1545
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,535
Who are you?
- I'm her husband.

1546
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:36,670
You want to pass out here
or go in the living room?

1547
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:37,938
Where's your mother?

1548
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,840
What do you care?
You cheated on her

1549
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:42,143
and then dumped her
for Mandy Blackburn,
of all people!

1550
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,811
I made a terrible mistake,
I committed the sin
of self-indulgence.

1551
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:46,680
I've come to beg your
mother's forgiveness.

1552
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:47,915
You might want to
rethink that, Daddy.

1553
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:49,150
I want to see her.

1554
01:09:49,217 --> 01:09:51,152
I see death
by culture shock.

1555
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:53,687
You can tell me, Melody,
she has every right
to hate me.

1556
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:55,122
And she does, believe me.

1557
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,924
I can handle the truth.
Does she hate me?

1558
01:09:56,991 --> 01:09:59,860
Well, it was a pretty
awful thing you did
with her best friend.

1559
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:00,928
Then she hates me?

1560
01:10:00,995 --> 01:10:03,164
Yes, yes, she hates you!
I can't stand this.

1561
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,965
I hate you
and I just met you!

1562
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:07,234
Lord, you tell me
this creature
took you to bed?

1563
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:08,936
No, no, no, no.
Actually, she took me.

1564
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:11,004
Yeah, when I met Boris,
he hated sex.

1565
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,540
Yeah, think of it,
Mr. Celestine.

1566
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:15,309
The absurd choreography,
like a sewing machine,

1567
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,611
up and down,
up and down,
up and down,

1568
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,413
toward what end?
Making more children?

1569
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,747
What the hell are
you talking about?

1570
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:24,185
Reproducing the species
over and over.
Toward what goal?

1571
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:26,087
Carrying out
what moronic design?

1572
01:10:26,154 --> 01:10:27,288
What happened to Mandy?

1573
01:10:27,355 --> 01:10:28,456
It was a mess,
a nightmare.

1574
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:31,258
Lord, I've sinned!
Please forgive me.

1575
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:33,594
Why do all the religious
psychotics wind up

1576
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:35,362
praying at my doorstep?
Can you tell me?

1577
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,998
Lord, in Your
infinite mercy,
I've done wrong.

1578
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:39,467
You want to tell him,
or should I?

1579
01:10:39,534 --> 01:10:40,901
Tell me what?

1580
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,839
Daddy, there's
nobody out there!

1581
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:49,410
Honest.
You're praying to no one.

1582
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:50,611
You're wasting
your breath,

1583
01:10:50,678 --> 01:10:52,746
just like you're
gonna be wasting it
on Mom.

1584
01:10:52,814 --> 01:10:54,515
What? You're telling me
she met another man?

1585
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,617
Not just a man.
- What?

1586
01:10:56,684 --> 01:10:58,219
Daddy, you couldn't
expect her to not,

1587
01:10:58,286 --> 01:11:01,455
you know,
move on with her life
and, you know...

1588
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:04,158
Oh, Lord.
What's he like?

1589
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,393
He's got four arms
and two noses.

1590
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:07,894
You better butt out,
stranger!

1591
01:11:07,962 --> 01:11:09,530
Melody will tell you
I don't need my shotgun

1592
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,964
to be a whole
passel of trouble.

1593
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:13,300
Now, I want to
see Marietta!

1594
01:11:36,357 --> 01:11:38,292
Now, Dad,
try and remember,

1595
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,994
you haven't
seen Mom in a year.

1596
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,230
A year is not forever.
How much can
a person change?

1597
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:46,033
And with that,
they entered the gallery.

1598
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,014
MARIETTA: I had more people
than I knew what to do with.

1599
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,249
Everybody said,
"I'll be naked with you, Marietta!"

1600
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,650
And I was like, "Okay."

1601
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,086
(LAUGHING)

1602
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,321
Oh, my God.

1603
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,224
Marietta?

1604
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:14,595
John Celestine!
Look what the cat
dragged in.

1605
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,496
Marietta, what happened to you?
- Oh, my God!

1606
01:12:16,564 --> 01:12:18,498
Well, darling,
it's you that absconded.

1607
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:20,234
He showed up at
the door today.
Whoa, whoa. "Absconded"?

1608
01:12:20,301 --> 01:12:22,069
Yes, yes, with the
promiscuous whore

1609
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,704
who called herself my best friend.
- Darling, I'll be...

1610
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,472
I'll find you.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1611
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,742
It's over, Marietta.
Mandy and I were
a terrible mistake.

1612
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:29,276
I've come back for you.

1613
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:30,811
Well, honey,
I'm in the middle
of my opening.

1614
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,914
Yeah, Dad,
this is Mom's exhibition.
Isn't it great?

1615
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,515
Exhibition of what?

1616
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,051
Well, the collages.

1617
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,586
What? She's thinking
of buying this pornography?

1618
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:41,688
I got news for you,
she's the pornographer.

1619
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,657
Marietta, who are you?

1620
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:46,326
John, you never
understood me, honey.

1621
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:48,595
Your vision never extended
beyond the backyard.

1622
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:49,764
You always had
your gun clubs

1623
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:51,431
and your fishing trips
and football.

1624
01:12:51,499 --> 01:12:54,068
You never took
a little minute
to find out about me.

1625
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,970
And you were always
too busy putting her
in pageants

1626
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:58,505
and coaching her speeches
and teaching her
baton twirling!

1627
01:12:58,573 --> 01:13:01,608
Yes, yes, that's true.
I was sublimating
my own creative needs

1628
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:03,177
and forcing them
on our daughter.

1629
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,345
You were what?
Yes, she was sublimating.

1630
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:06,580
Sublimating.

1631
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,816
Honey, why don't
you go on back
to Mandy Blackburn?

1632
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,185
Her pygmy mentality is
much closer to you now.

1633
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,553
Much closer.
- Yeah. Well, I can't go back to her.

1634
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,621
Oh, why not?

1635
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:16,590
She cast aspersions
on my manhood.

1636
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:19,994
What are we talking?
Size? Duration?
Erectile dysfunction?

1637
01:13:20,061 --> 01:13:21,862
Would you mind
your own business?

1638
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,631
Marietta, how could you
forsake your own family?

1639
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:26,700
I want us all back home
to start over.

1640
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:29,736
I'm a different woman, John.

1641
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,339
I can't believe what
I'm seeing. I mean...

1642
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:35,209
Your clothes are different,
your speech is
a little more affected,

1643
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,178
but deep down,
I know you're the same

1644
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:40,681
pretty, small-town,
God-fearing, churchgoing,
pie-baking...

1645
01:13:40,748 --> 01:13:42,283
I'm living with two guys.

1646
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,384
...Girl Scout mom.
You're what?

1647
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:48,455
I'm an artist.
I don't bake pies.
I don't go to church.

1648
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:51,859
I do collages,
sculpture, photography.

1649
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,395
I live in Manhattan
with two men who I love

1650
01:13:55,463 --> 01:13:58,332
in a very happy
menage a trois.

1651
01:13:58,399 --> 01:13:59,499
JOHN: A what?

1652
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:04,004
We all sleep together.
A menage a trois.

1653
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:07,507
I knew we should
never trust the
goddamn French.

1654
01:14:07,575 --> 01:14:09,443
It's amazing, Melody.

1655
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:13,547
Thousands of years ago,
ancient peoples,
Egyptians, Romans, Mayans,

1656
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:16,683
were walking home,
just like us,

1657
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:19,920
discussing where
should they eat
or making small talk.

1658
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:23,090
"Hey, we just
bought a great house
on the Nile with a yard,

1659
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,959
"overlooking the
Pharaoh's new pyramid."

1660
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:27,928
Boris...
- Or, "My physician says

1661
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,764
"peacock tongues are bad for your heart."
- Boris...

1662
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:36,403
Or, "I'm worried I can't get
my kid into a really good
Aztec preschool."

1663
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:38,906
What the hell does it
all mean now? Zilch.

1664
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,407
But they thought
it was important.

1665
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,076
Boris, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1666
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:44,945
And I was raised
in a religious home.

1667
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:47,581
Job's wife was my
favorite character
in the Bible,

1668
01:14:47,648 --> 01:14:49,250
because she chose death

1669
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:50,885
rather than
obsequious acceptance,

1670
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:52,953
like that masochist
she married.

1671
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,726
Boris, Boris,
can we sit down
for a second?

1672
01:14:59,794 --> 01:15:00,961
Well, but we have to
go home.

1673
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,364
I know, but come here.
I have to say something.

1674
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:05,266
But we always
go home now.

1675
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,634
I know. I know.
I know we have
a standard routine.

1676
01:15:07,702 --> 01:15:11,372
I need to have my drink,
and a shower.

1677
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:13,240
And, you know,
you see it as routine,

1678
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:16,377
but for me
the consistency helps keep me
from becoming unnerved.

1679
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:18,678
I know you require
a certain ritual.

1680
01:15:18,746 --> 01:15:20,480
And then after the shower,
our dinner,

1681
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:22,016
but not crawfish pie
again.

1682
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,683
I got indigestion
from it last time.

1683
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:25,819
I thought I had
thyroid cancer.

1684
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:29,223
Boris, I met someone else.
I've fallen in love.

1685
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,626
And then some Beethoven,
maybe some Schubert
for a change,

1686
01:15:32,693 --> 01:15:34,995
but, you know...

1687
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,531
You met someone else?

1688
01:15:37,598 --> 01:15:41,936
I'm not saying
I don't have very deep
feelings for you. I do.

1689
01:15:44,906 --> 01:15:46,573
You met someone else?

1690
01:15:47,675 --> 01:15:49,643
Yes.

1691
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:53,680
And you want us to
live in a threesome,
like your mother?

1692
01:15:53,748 --> 01:15:56,650
Boris, when you found me,
I was very young.

1693
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:00,520
You're still very young.

1694
01:16:00,588 --> 01:16:02,990
Yes, but I've grown.

1695
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:06,093
I've grown so much.
And mainly because of you.

1696
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,997
Yes, it's true.
I have been very patient

1697
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,199
with your
phenomenal ignorance.

1698
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:17,004
You can always
count on me
for anything.

1699
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:21,075
I just...

1700
01:16:21,142 --> 01:16:24,711
I guess I'm at a very
impressionable age,
and I...

1701
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,849
I can't think of a way
to say this well.

1702
01:16:30,885 --> 01:16:32,453
You don't have
to say it well.

1703
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,820
I want to.

1704
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:37,257
I completely understand.
I do.

1705
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:40,227
This does not run counter
to my convictions that

1706
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:43,830
love relationships are
almost invariably transient.

1707
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,635
I don't really think
that's true if they're right.

1708
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:54,641
Really?
You have your own ideas?

1709
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:58,879
Just a couple.
You know, they're not
very deep, but...

1710
01:16:58,946 --> 01:17:04,218
As cruel as life is,
I miss participating
in the world.

1711
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:08,822
And I even miss people,
even the inchworms
and the cretins,

1712
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,691
because I don't
really think they're bad,

1713
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:13,760
I think they're
just scared.

1714
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,032
I think you're making
the correct decision.

1715
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:19,866
Boris...
- I mean it.

1716
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:27,241
I'm a profound
and sensitive soul
with an enormous grasp

1717
01:17:27,308 --> 01:17:29,910
of the human condition.

1718
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:32,179
It was inevitable you would

1719
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:35,682
eventually grow tired
of being so grossly
overmatched.

1720
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,053
Greatness isn't
easy to live with,

1721
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,988
even by someone of
normal intelligence.

1722
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,759
You're upset.

1723
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:48,462
I don't expect you
to understand.
How could you?

1724
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,199
Believe me,

1725
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:53,667
(CLEARING THROAT)

1726
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:56,836
if I can understand
quantum mechanics,

1727
01:17:56,904 --> 01:17:59,906
I can certainly comprehend
the thought process

1728
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,410
of a sub-mental
baton twirler.

1729
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,912
Boris...

1730
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,114
It's okay.

1731
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:12,719
I knew this day would come.
I really did.

1732
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:15,889
The universe is winding down.
Why shouldn't we?

1733
01:18:21,162 --> 01:18:22,362
Again!

1734
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:24,898
MAN: I'll have another, too.

1735
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:31,271
(SIGHING) She left me.
Can you believe it?

1736
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:34,741
What am I talking about?
I left her. She's alone.

1737
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:38,579
Now, no matter
which way she turns in bed,
she's got a husband.

1738
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,616
My wife left me, too.

1739
01:18:42,683 --> 01:18:45,619
I'm sure she was beautiful,
just like my wife.

1740
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,188
Norman?

1741
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,458
Norman was gorgeous.

1742
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:58,465
He was the greatest
runway model
Versace ever had.

1743
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,101
I thought you said
your wife.

1744
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:03,003
We were married
in Holland.

1745
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:07,541
You married a guy?

1746
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,410
What else?

1747
01:19:10,478 --> 01:19:12,546
But that would make you...

1748
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:16,483
What? A widow?
Norman didn't die.

1749
01:19:17,418 --> 01:19:19,052
Not a widow, a...

1750
01:19:20,821 --> 01:19:21,921
Gay?

1751
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,123
A member of the...

1752
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:26,826
Of what?

1753
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:28,928
The homosexual persuasion.

1754
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,765
My God.

1755
01:19:31,832 --> 01:19:34,234
You make it sound
like a religion.

1756
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:38,138
Yes. If it's a religion,
you could call me devout.
A fanatic.

1757
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,975
But that's a sin
against God's law.

1758
01:19:43,077 --> 01:19:45,512
God is gay.

1759
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,847
He can't be.
He made the whole
universe perfect.

1760
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:52,619
The oceans, the skies,
the beautiful flowers,
the trees everywhere.

1761
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,888
That's right.
He's a decorator.

1762
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:58,358
But what do you
miss about him?
I still don't get it.

1763
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,427
Everything.

1764
01:20:01,095 --> 01:20:03,096
His face.

1765
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:06,032
His kindness,
his sense of humor.

1766
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,635
Our mutual passion.

1767
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,105
The way we'd dance
and he'd dip me back
and kiss me.

1768
01:20:12,973 --> 01:20:15,141
Jesus.

1769
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:18,312
Why did he leave you?
She leave you. Norman.

1770
01:20:18,379 --> 01:20:20,714
He wants to live in Paris,

1771
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:23,149
and I can't leave
my sick mother.

1772
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:26,453
Is your mother a woman?

1773
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:31,091
She used to look
like Marlene Dietrich.

1774
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:35,095
What's the difference?
They all hurt you in the end,
every woman,

1775
01:20:35,162 --> 01:20:37,163
whether they're
male or female.

1776
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:40,834
Why did yours leave you?

1777
01:20:40,901 --> 01:20:45,071
I left her
for her best friend,
but it didn't work out.

1778
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:47,241
Why not?

1779
01:20:49,577 --> 01:20:51,911
Can I be perfectly
frank with you?

1780
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:53,813
I don't shock easily.

1781
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:56,883
I couldn't make love to her.

1782
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:00,287
Why not?

1783
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:04,924
It was fine at first,
but then I lost interest.
I wanted Marietta back.

1784
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:06,760
Which is funny,
because in the last years,

1785
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:10,464
I really didn't have
a lot of sexual
interest in Marietta.

1786
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:14,534
That happens
with you heteros.
We always have interest.

1787
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:20,073
Christ, if I'm going
to be honest,

1788
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,342
you know, I never,
ever really had

1789
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,544
a burning sexual desire
for Marietta.

1790
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:28,114
Why'd you marry her?

1791
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,718
It was the thing to do.
Everybody where I lived,

1792
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,220
you had a wife
and children and...

1793
01:21:37,191 --> 01:21:39,192
Can I really level with you?

1794
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:41,595
Of course.

1795
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,430
John. John Celestine.

1796
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:48,001
Of course, John.
I'm Howard Cummings,
nee Kaminsky.

1797
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:52,639
I married Marietta,
because I was afraid.

1798
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,676
Of what?

1799
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:59,346
The way I felt
towards the tight end
on the football team.

1800
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,880
No.

1801
01:22:00,948 --> 01:22:04,984
Every time he got in
the line of scrimmage
and bent over.

1802
01:22:05,052 --> 01:22:07,688
Bartender, another round
for my friend and me,
please.

1803
01:22:50,431 --> 01:22:51,431
(THUD)

1804
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:55,702
Can you believe
I blew it twice?

1805
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:59,506
I jumped out the window
and landed on a woman
walking her dog.

1806
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:02,308
She got hurt.
I got off scot-free.

1807
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,679
Don't you realize
the consequences

1808
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:08,147
of your actions
impact on other people?

1809
01:23:08,215 --> 01:23:09,349
Oh, come on.
Seriously.

1810
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,485
No. What if you had
committed suicide?

1811
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,119
Think, think if

suddenly change in
ways you can't imagine.

1813
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,090
Oh, my God.
You know what?

1814
01:23:17,157 --> 01:23:19,025
You sound like
that movie they ram

1815
01:23:19,093 --> 01:23:20,594
down your throat
every Christmas.

1816
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:22,729
What?
- What if the guardian angel

1817
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:24,264
had saved Jimmy Stewart,

1818
01:23:24,331 --> 01:23:27,000
and Jimmy Stewart
was the guy who
smoked in bed,

1819
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:32,138
and he lived
and caused a fire
that killed 60 people? So?

1820
01:23:32,206 --> 01:23:35,909
How about that?
Everybody's life is
still worth saving?

1821

Even if it's Christmas?
Come on, seriously.

1822
01:23:38,178 --> 01:23:41,214
You must have
a very dim view
of the human race.

1823
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:44,050
Oh, the human race.
They've had to install

1824
01:23:44,118 --> 01:23:46,286
automatic toilets
in public restrooms,

1825
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:49,222
because people
can't be entrusted
to flush a toilet.

1826

Come on, flushing a toilet!
They can't even
flush a toilet!

1827
01:23:53,694 --> 01:23:55,228
Visiting time is over.

1828

What? You're kicking me out?

1829
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:58,231
Yeah.

1830

Seriously?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

1831
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:06,573
All right, listen.
Honestly, I'm really
sorry about all this

1832
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,544
and is there
anything I can do
to make this up to you?

1833
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:13,346
Can I get you something?
What can I do?

I'm sorry. Really?

I was born with
a very rare gift.
I can see into the future.

1839

If you can see
into the future,
how come you didn't know

1840
01:24:32,633 --> 01:24:35,769
I was gonna
jump out a building
and land on top of you?

1841

Maybe I did.

an antique shop in Chelsea.
Yeah. Art deco.

We're going to have
a wonderful collection
of movie posters.

My shrink says
that the guns were all

1851
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:19,245
a manifestation of
my sexual inadequacy.

1852
01:25:19,313 --> 01:25:20,814
Yeah, if it weren't
for sexual inadequacy,

1853
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:24,350

And not only is
he sleeping with a man,

soon he'll be
celebrating Purim.

More important,

in his adult life,

your womanly needs.

Which turned out to
be quite considerable.

1862
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:46,606
Mine, too, but not with
the sex I'd been raised
to be attracted to.

You're like
a changed man, John.

Your whole personality
is sunnier.

been that way.

I couldn't when I was
making love to you.

you should pardon
the metaphor.

1869

Well, I just hope
you two lucked out

1870
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,756
and found the right person
in each other.

1871
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:04,724
I know I lucked out.

1872

What about you, Boris?

As you would say
in the crude fashion
of your generation,

1874

I totally lucked out.

1875
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:19,205
It just shows what
meaningless blind chance
the universe is.

1876

Everybody schemes and dreams
to meet the right person,

am I a member

Yes. Don't worry.
