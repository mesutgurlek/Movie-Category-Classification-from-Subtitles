Stepped upon my feet

But couldn't squeak

He stayed on with me

Just to stand

-We'll fix him fine.

Does he poison cats?

He buys meat, and then he buys poison,
and then he puts them all together.

652

Then he burns the cats at midnight
in his furnace. You can smell the smoke.

And Mr. Braukoff was beating his wife
with a red-hot poker.

-She fell and cut her lip. She's fine.

914
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:26,202
That's a brave little girl.

915
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,871
Anna?

916
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,540
-Sweets to the sweet.
-Louis Sherry!

917
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:33,251
Why, Lonnie, what a lovely box--

918
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,170
Is anything wrong?

919
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:39,883
Just because I bring you a present,
you think I've been up to something.

920
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,512
Well, I have. I have good news.
Don't fly up in the air.

921
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,892
I'm as cool as a cucumber.
You're shaking like I don't know what.

922
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:53,897
I was going to tell you before,
but I wanted to wait until it was definite.

923
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,941
The firm is sending me to New York.

924
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,320
Is that all? Well, we can live
without you for a while.

925
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:03,323
They'll be safe with me.
I've got 12 guns in my room.

926
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:08,286
-You'll be back by Thanksgiving.
-You don't understand.

927
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,705
They're sending me to New York
for good.

928
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,749
To be head of the New York office.

929
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,168
-New York!
-What?

930
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,628
New York?

931
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,547
I don't believe it.

932
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,883
I simply don't believe it.

933
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,885
It's true.

934
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,138
I start the first of the year.
We'll leave after Christmas.

935
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:30,225
I thought we'd like to have
Christmas in St. Louis.

936
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,976
I think I'll go pack.

937
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:35,647
It will take a week to dig up
all my dolls from the cemetery.

938
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:38,775
MRS. SMITH: Come back.
There'll be no packing as yet.

939
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:44,113
There are many things to talk over and
you two are being very cool about it.

940
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,782
Why, Anna.

941
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,784
I thought you'd be overjoyed.

942
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,873
New York is a big city.

943
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,209
Not that St. Louis isn't big...

944
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,587
...but it just doesn't seem very big
out here where we live.

945
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,132
And what will the children do?

946
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,468
The same as they do here...

947
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,638
...go to school, play,
have their friends over.

948
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,974
What friends?

949
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,477
-Yes. What friends?
SMITH: The friends they'll meet in school.

950
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,396
I don't go to school.

951
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:18,898
You will someday,
if they'll take you in.

952
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:22,318
Agnes just ready to be promoted
and Esther going to be a senior.

953
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:26,239
-I've worked all my life to be a senior.
-And Rose is to be graduated.

954
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:30,159
Graduation is the least. All the people
I care about are in St. Louis.

955
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:33,246
And what about me and my life?

956
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,790
You can take that with you.

957
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,167
It's settled.
We're moving to New York.

958
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:42,839
You're being very calm
about the way you pack us off.

959
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,217
I've got the future to think about.
The future for us all.

960
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:50,513
I've got to worry about money, with Lon
in Princeton and Rose going to college.

961
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,766
Maybe Rose won't have to go.
Things are happening.

962
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:57,520
Tonight she met Colonel Darly,
and he was very smitten with her.

963
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:01,357
I'm sure he was, but next year
she'll still want to go to college.

964
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:04,152
I hate, loathe, despise
and abominate money.

965
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,322
-You also spend it.
-And what about Katie...

966
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,866
...and Grandpa and the chickens?

967
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,701
A minor detail we can discuss later.

968
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,037
I'm a minor detail, am I?

969
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,831
You all know I was talking
about the chickens.

970
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,043
Of course.
Never mind what happens to your family.

971
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,379
At a time like this,
talk about the chickens.

972
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,348
Now, I guess you're all a little excited.

973
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,476
We'll talk this over calmly tomorrow.

974
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:39,687
Well, hickory nut cake
as only Katie can make it.

975
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,398
I can't move to New York.
I just can't.

976
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,610
I'm taking my cat.
Lady Babbie goes wherever I go.

977
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,571
Where you gonna keep her?
Cooped up in a tenement?

978
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,032
Don't they have houses in New York?

979
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,661
Rich people have houses.
People like us live in flats.

980

I'd rather be poor
if we could stay here.

981
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:02,752
I'd rather go with the "orphalins"
at the orphalins home.

982
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,754
And what about the world's fair?

983
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:09,258
Just when St. Louis was going to be
the center of attraction of the universe.

984
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,054
We'll come back here to see the fair.
Maybe.

-Katie, it's as light as a feather.
-You can bake anything in that stove.

986
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,938

-You can have the candy flower, Tootie.
-No, thank you just the same.

995

our garden under the streetcar tracks...

...and into Mrs. Middleton's terrace.

lawn someday, I'll grab her by the leg.
