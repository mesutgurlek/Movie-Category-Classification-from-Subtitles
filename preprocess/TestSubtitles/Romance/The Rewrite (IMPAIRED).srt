1
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,045
KEITH: So thanks very much
for having me in and here's my pitch.

2
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,049
Um, this is a movie I've had in my
head for a long time. It's a comedy.

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,384
Hopefully. (LAUGHING)

4
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,585
Anyway...

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,389
Let's say Jack Nicholson decided

6
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,475
that he wanted to know
what people truly thought of him.

7
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,060
Whether his life had
actually amounted to anything.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,935
So he fakes his death
and stages his own funeral.

9
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:25,152
I just think the possibilities
are pretty hilarious.

10
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,407
Ultimately, amid all the cliché eulogies

11
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,659
and insincere expressions of grief,

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,363
he discovers one grandson
who truly misses him.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,078
It could be very heartwarming.

14
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,206
I don't get this.

15
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,460
Just like I didn't get it when
you pitched it to me six months ago.

16
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,216
I did? Where was that?

17
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,589
At the Red Sunset premiere.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,337
Glad I left such an
impression that night.

19
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,848
Oh, right, sorry, yeah, yeah.
I knew I knew you.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,350
Sorry. Yes! Yes!

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,770
Yeah, you were between jobs
and looking for a development position.

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,188
So, bravo!

23
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,981
(STUTTERING) No, that was a great night.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,611
Oh, of course, there's no reason
why it couldn't be a woman.

25
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,984
You know, everyone loves Betty White.

26
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,782
Keith, we love you.

27
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,074
We're huge fans.

28
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,828
This is the studio that made
your Paradise Misplaced 15 years ago,

29
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,907
- when Jenny over here was just an embryo.
- (ALL LAUGH)

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,827
It's a fun idea, it's just not for us.

31
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:30,717
We're looking more for edgy comedies
with a kick-ass-type woman.

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,921
Now if you have something like that,
we'd love to hear it.

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,788
You are a fantastic agent
as you have frequently told me.

34
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,125
I just wanted to ask, do you think
you could possibly find me just, uh...

35
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,498
Just one job, you know? Just any job.

36
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,999
OK.

37
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,755
There is something.

38
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,173
You have to hear me out.

39
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,716
KEITH: If it pays, I'll take it.

40
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,263
My brother-in-law is a chem professor at
Binghamton University in upstate New York,

41
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,682
and they're looking for a writer
in residence this semester,

42
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,635
cos the one they had died,
so I thought of you.

43
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,522
You thought of me for a teaching job?

44
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,025
ELLEN: Look, you're going
to teach a screenwriting class.

45
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,569
You're going to take some time
to figure out your life

46
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,737
and write something great.

47
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,823
And they're going to give you a car,
a house, a salary.

48
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,575
Yeah, a pitiful one I don't doubt.

49
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,368
Well, it's a lot more
than you're making now.

50
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,371
Yeah, but I can't teach
and I hate teachers, you know.

51
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,915
They're frustrated losers who haven't
done anything with their own lives

52
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,412
so they want to instruct other people.

53
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,789
Oh, forget it, I will just
write my script on spec and...

54
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,670
(RINGING)

55
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,293
Keith?

56
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,592
KEITH: OK. Where exactly is Binghamton?

57
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,942
KEITH: The city of Binghamton
is 2,754 miles from Los Angeles

58
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,316
and 172 miles northwest
of New York City.

59
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,861
IBM was founded there.

60
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,037
Sir, is this your bag?

61
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,997
- Yeah.
- Well, we have to check it.

62
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,323
OK.

63
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,495
KEITH: Rod Serling, creator of Twilight Zone
grew up and was raised there.

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,127
I admit there's a somewhat
ominous quality to that factoid.

65
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,470
What is this?

66
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,091
- Uh...
- "Best Original Screenplay."

67
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,519
Dude, you wrote Paradise Misplaced?

68
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,104
I did. Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,939
That's such a great flick.

- Yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,200
A long time ago but I did, yeah.

Wow, look at this.

00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,292
I could have brought a bomb on board
and no one would have minded.

80
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,835
Don't say that. That's not good.

81
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,464
Oh, you're so right.

82

Thank you. Thank you.

85

KEITH: Binghamton is also
the birthplace of the Spiedie,

86
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,105
a sandwich consisting of cubes
of marinated beef, chicken, or pork

87
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,023
grilled over a charcoal pit.

88
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,534
Binghamton is amongst the top 10
most cloudy and rainy American cities.

89
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:48,032
On the plus side, it is considered
"the carousel capital of the world".

90
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,454
It has never been the
site of a major riot.

91
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,459

it is the absolute end of civilisation.

anyone could have to teach here

Ah, excellent.

Uh, let me grab something
and I'll show you to your new digs.

Good use of their parents'

at 5:00 tonight in the Susquehanna Lounge.

Give you a chance to meet
the rest of the department.

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,981
Good. Great.

169
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,692
- All right. Give me a call if you need anything.
- Yep, yep, yep.

170
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,522
Thank you. Oh, Dr Lerner,
you forgot your box.

00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,532
Oh, I'm sorry, no. That's yours.

About 70 of them.

00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,706
And you teach day after tomorrow,

so we're going to need
your selections right away.

You only have to pick 10.

178
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,045
We would have let you know sooner,

179
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,374
but we didn't know you were
taking the job until a couple days ago.

OK.

I'm Holly Carpenter.

Uh... Hello. Hello.
And what do you teach, Holly?

189
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,944
What, teach? No, I don't teach.
I learn. I'm a sophomore.

- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

Oh, you are? That's great. That's good.
It's wonderful going back to school at your...

- Height?
- Yes, exactly.

193
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,036
I thought that's what you meant.

194

It was, it was. We're very simpatico.

Uh, Holly, listen,
I'm a little late for this thing.

196
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,125
Am I going the right way
to the Susquehanna Lounge?

197
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,710
Uh, yes, it's straight ahead.

198
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,128
OK, great. Thank you.

199
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,751
I'm actually a psych major.

- And, um...
- Uh-huh.

201

We have a lit requirement,

202
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:43,139
and I've written short stories
and I've written poems. I love writing.

203
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,390
I have an idea for a screenplay,

204
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,268
I know the class submission deadline
was yesterday...

205
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,481
But I stayed up last night and wrote this
and I hope that you would still consider me.

Uh, thank you. Thank you.

Well, I hope you watch a DVD
and not one of those illegal web sites.

Oh, I didn't know that was an option.
I'll have to check that out.

This is Ron Jenson, Medieval Literature.

Professor Weldon holds the Bainbridge Chair
in Comparative Literature

No, no, she's obviously brilliant.

a bit trivial, you know?

In other words, why should
a 21st century man care

255
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,658
about the obstacles facing
a 19th century woman?

256
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,745
No, that makes me sound like a misogynist.
I love and respect women.

257
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,121
As long as they're not writing.

258
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,995
On the contrary, there are
myriad women writers I adore.

259
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,873
- Can you name one?
- Elaine May.

260
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,171
I'm not familiar with her work.

261
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,547
Oh, she wrote A New Leaf, The Birdcage,
she did an uncredited rewrite on Tootsie.

262
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,388
- Movies?
- Mmm-hmm.

263
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,681
We're talking about literature.

264
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,810
And while you may not think much
of the women writers of that period,

265
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,020
Austen, Woolf, and the Bronte sisters
were artists

266
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,065
who represented
the female empowerment of their age.

267
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,441
Oh, well, forgive me,

268
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,985
but I'm just a little bit tired
of "female empowerment."

269
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,279
Whoa! Battle stations.

270
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,324
Dr Lerner, you must
have an opinion on this?

271
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,994
(LAUGHS) I have a wife and
four daughters. I have no opinions.

272
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,997
What exactly is
your opinion, Mr Michaels?

273
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,708
- Another glass?
- Thank you so much, that's nice.

274
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,587
It's just, honestly, everything seems to be
about female empowerment nowadays.

275
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,965
You know, any meeting I go
to in Hollywood, someone says,

276
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,926
"You know what we need? A kick-ass girl.
That would be a great twist."

277
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,845
Except every movie has a kick-ass girl.

278
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,931
You know, some martial-arts,
CGI, slow-motion woman

279
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,642
who kicks the crap out of
every man in her path.

280
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,645
Can I tell you what would be
truly innovative?

281
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,772
A movie without a kick-ass girl.

282
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,272
Or, better yet, a movie where
a woman gets her ass kicked.

283
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,241
Perhaps you'd like to kick mine.

284
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,532
No, don't be silly.
I didn't mean literally.

285
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,614
Besides, not much of a target there.
(LAUGHS)

286
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,750
- Which I mean in a very nice way...

00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,381
I'm sure you'd like to meet, uh...

291
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,251
Somebody.

292
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,107
JIM:
Hey. So this worked out great, right?

293
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,693

next door to each other.

Oh, thank you, Jim.

00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,407
You know, you're a lovely man
with an unusual dog...

297
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,326
But I don't think I can do this.

298
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,200
I actually miss LA,
and I didn't think that was possible.

would make me beloved.

304
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,302
It's surprisingly unhelpful.

305
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,970
Yeah, it seems to really annoy people.

306
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,798
- (MOBILE RINGING)
- Sorry, hang on, hang on, hang on.

307
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,146

I think I can find my house from here.

308
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,148
OK, sure, you go for it.

309
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,025
- Listen though...
- Hang on one second.

310
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,820
Give teaching a shot, OK?
It gets its hooks in you, you'll see.

311
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,239
With all respect, I don't believe

312
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,533
that anything worth knowing
can be taught in a classroom.

313
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,286
And I intend to do as little as possible
while carrying on with this charade.

314
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,160
Yeah, if I gave it any thought,
I'd probably feel the same way.

315
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,457
Yeah, hi.

316
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,001
Oh, hi. I'm stuck in traffic,
I thought I'd check in. How's it going?

317
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,129
I'm very, very, very,
very cold, and, uh,

318
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,131
I have to read a huge box of scripts,

319
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,843
and I just got into a fight with
Professor McGonagall about Jane Austen.

320
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,346
You know, it's interesting
that you should bring that up.

321
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,265
You know what J.K. Rowling said?

322
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,308
"Where did I put
that last billion dollars?"

323
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,353
She said that failure was the best
thing that ever happened to her

324
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,146
cos it freed her from the inessential.

325
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,234
It allowed her to concentrate on the
thing that mattered most. Writing.

326
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,487
Maybe the time has come for me to write
that sequel to Paradise Misplaced

327
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,781
that you've been hounding me
for all these years.

328
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,491
Hey, hey. I thought
you weren't interested.

329
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,160
You said the story was over,
and if I remember correctly,

330
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,538
continuing it would be creative suicide.

331
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,332
Yeah, well, that was when I was young
and believed in myself.

332
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,159
So now is the perfect time.

333
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,917

334
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:36,469
Hello, Flo. Congratulations
and welcome to the screenwriting class.

335
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,719
"Dave Fenman."

336
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,479
You're a good-looking guy, Dave.
Get your own screenwriting class.

337
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,624
Not even close.

338
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,325
Hello. Good morning. I'm Keith Michaels.

339
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,119
Oh, thank you.

340
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,167
Thanks very much. Thanks, yeah.

341
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,712
Thank you.

342
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,255
Well, now, um...

343
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,466
Since it will be easier for me
to evaluate your material

344
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,801
if I read an entire script,

345
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,636
and you've all turned in 30 pages

346
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,763
and the average screenplay is 120,

347
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,636
that leaves roughly 90 to go.

348
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,977
So if you write three pages a day,
six days a week,

349
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,478
you should all be done in about a month.

350
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,679
Let's meet again then.

351
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,015
Great. Looking forward to it.

352
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,831
Hey. That's the way all classes
should be. Five minutes.

353
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,500
I had no intention of going that long,
I am so sorry.

354
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,669
(LAUGHS) So maybe later,
do you want to catch up...

355
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,005
Excuse me. Hi. Do you have a minute?

356
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,798
Ah. Holly.

357
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,801
Oh, yes. I work at the Campus Bookstore.

Uh, so, Holly, this is Karen.

360
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,184
- Yeah, we've taken some classes together.
- Hi.

361
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,894
So you didn't accept my screenplay

362
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,605
but I was wondering if you could give me
some constructive criticism.

363
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,352
I thought that
I could come during office hours.

364
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,649
Yes. Yes.

365
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,443
- I'll see you later, Mr Michaels.
- Oh, Karen.

366

(SNAPPING FINGERS)

367
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,199
Hi. I'm still here.

368
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,784
Yes. Yes, you are.

369
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,577
Well the thing is, Holly...

370
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,831
I'm not entirely sure that I have anything
very helpful to say regarding your screenplay.

371
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,958
- Oh. That bad, huh?
- No, not at all.

372
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,669
It's just that I don't really believe
that writing can be taught.

373
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,631
Oh, interesting position
for a creative writing teacher to take.

374
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,591
But true. You know,
you can't teach talent.

375
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,051
I think most people have talent,

376
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,761
they just haven't been exposed
to the right teachers.

377
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,845
I beg to differ.

378
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,722
You can get me the best music teacher
in the world

379
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,808
and I still wouldn't be able to
write songs like Paul McCartney.

380
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:29,975
How do you know? Have you tried?

381
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,060
No.

382
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,513
- Do you want to write songs?
- Not at all.

383
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,014
What are we talking about?

384
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,778
About the fact that the most idiotic
thing that anyone has ever said

385
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,280
is that if you just put your mind to it
and believe in yourself,

386
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,032
there is nothing you can't accomplish.

387
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,245
(LAUGHING)
I say that! Does that make me an idiot?

388
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,368
No, no, not you. Other people.

389
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,674
How can I make my script better?

390
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,926
Uh...

391
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,970
Right, well, it could be more...

392
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,098
Um, organised.

393
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,346
"More organised" how?

394
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,352
- Uh, structurally.
- Structurally.

395
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,017
Yep.

396
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,565
Yeah. Structurally.

397
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,445
Did you like that part
where she looks in the mirror

398
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,114
and she sees herself as an old woman?

399
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,575
Honestly, I found that
a little heavy-handed.

400
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,578
(CLICKS TONGUE) So did I.
Which is why I didn't write it.

401
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,955
You didn't read my screenplay, did you?

402
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,083
No. But I didn't read anyone's screenplay,
don't take it personally.

403
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,293
It's entirely personal.

404
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,753
I worked on it and
I would like to tell this story.

405
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,463
OK. You're in the class.

406
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,086
No. I want you to read my script
and tell me if I have any potential.

407
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,923
All right. I will read your screenplay.

408
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,513
Thanks. I think.

409
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,974
I'll let you eat in peace.

410

I am so sorry.
Honestly, I was nervous meeting everyone

416
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,452
and you combine that
with the free-flowing wine

417

for Austen-bashing.

around here, you know?

She's tenured, she's published.

She's also head of the Ethics Committee

421
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,213
which means
she can make your life miserable.

to me like "harassment".

00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,916
Like Habitat for Humanity?

466
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,127
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

467
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,328
Who is it?

468
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,383
Hello. Uh, am I interrupting?

469
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,510
I'm having office hours, Mr Michaels.

470
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,886
Oh, OK.

471
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,556
Hi, Mr Michaels.
I'm in your screenwriting class.

472
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,890
Andrea Stein-Rosen.

473
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,934
Oh, yes, yes. Andrea.

474
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,645
Great Neck High School.
Likes Adele and Pinkberry.

475
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,846
Yeah.

476
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,439
I can come back.

477
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,108
Oh, no, I think we're done.
Right? Are we done?

478
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,523
Ten minutes ago.

479
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,276
Nice to see you.

480
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,783
Good morning.

481
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,984
Uh...

482
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,747
It could be said that we got off to a
poor start at the wine and cheese event.

483
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,290
"We" did?

484
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,959
I did. I did.

485
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,211
Bit too much wine,
not quite enough cheese.

486
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,790
Which is why I brought these
few small peace offerings.

487
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,218
These are DVDs of every
Jane Austen novel

488
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,221
including my favourite,
Clueless with Alicia Silverstone.

489
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,472
What is Clueless?

490
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,433
Oh, I think you'll like it.
It's based on Emma.

491
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,977
Bit hit. Spun off into
a mildly successful series.

492
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:52,608
Also, a gift certificate from Amazon
covering all the following items.

493
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,812
My personal favourite is
the "What Would Jane Do?" tote bag.

494
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,315
Mr Michaels...

495
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,941
Thank you.

496
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,329
This is the finest public university
in the Northeast.

497
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,455
Yes. I understand.

498
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,000
We expect a degree of professionalism
even from a non-professional.

499
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,210
Yes, of course.

500
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,421
Which means that you
behave at faculty events.

501
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,632
You read the material
that has been submitted to you.

502
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,092
You do not dismiss your
class for a month.

503
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,420
- Oh.
- Yes, I heard about that.

504
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,973
But I want to be fair,
and act without pride or prejudice,

505
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,266
if you'll forgive the reference...

506
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,644
No, I very much enjoyed it. It was good.

507
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,314
So I'll give you one more opportunity
to conduct yourself like a teacher.

508
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,393
Absolutely. I will watch
Dead Poets Society to prepare.

509
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,112
It's a film. It's about teaching, um...

510
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,861
I'll get to it right after... Clueless.

511
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,200
- Clueless? Great.
- Yes.

512
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,300
(HOLLY SIGHS)

513
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,464
Good afternoon.

514
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,351
- Oh, Mr Michaels.
- Please, call me Keith.

515
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,520
Sorry, my youngest was
throwing up all night.

516
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,393
- Oh, had she been drinking?
- (LAUGHS)

517
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:17,063
She's nine. But maybe,
I'm a really permissive mother.

518
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,528
How can I help you?

519
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,655
Well, by thanking me
for reading your script.

520
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,699
- Really?
- You want to test me?

521
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,242
It is called Local Girl,

522
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,537
and it is about a perky
Binghamton lass called Peggy,

523
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,874
who dreams big dreams about being a dancer
and is attracted to the wrong boys

524
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,710
and her father is a police officer

525
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,337
and her mother is a beautician
and opera singer.

526
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,756
- Wow, you really did read it.
- Uh-huh.

527
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,630
So, what did you think?

528
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,013
I think that
your characters are quite interesting,

529
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,307
but that it's a little
randomly structured.

530
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,643
Anyway, I have sent an email telling everyone
that we have class today

531
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,969
and I would like you to attend.

532
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,605
(CHUCKLES) Great.

533
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,478
Congratulations.

534
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,985
I just have a question.

535
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,320
I would expect no less.

536
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,696
If you don't believe writing can be taught,
what are we going to be doing in class?

537
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,867
Well, we're going to, uh...

538
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,862
Uh...

539
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,761
(CLEARS THROAT) So...

540
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,351
Why don't we deal with attendance,
you know?

541
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,770
Get that out of the way.

542
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,941
Rachel Anslow.
Now am I pronouncing that right?

543
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,189
Is that "Ans-low" or is it "An-slow"?

544
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,770
(QUIETLY) "Ans-low."

545
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,447
Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.

546
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,615
(LOUDLY) "Ans-low!"

547
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,159
OK. OK, OK. That's fine. Tick.

548
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,660
Um...

549
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,036
And another tricky one.
Flo Bai? Or should I say "bay", "bai"?

550
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,459
It's "bay". But I could go either way.

551
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,286
KEITH:
Good. I appreciate your flexibility.

552
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:03,837
Could be either, or indeed, "eye-ther".
(CHUCKLES)

553
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,838
Let's call the whole thing off.

554
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,971
Uh, I'm sorry, Miss Stein-Rosen,
but you will have to wait for the "S's".

555
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,891
Or is it the "R's"?
Um, interesting question.

556
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,727
I was just going to say,
I think everyone is here.

557
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,023
There were 10 of us last time,
there's 10 today, plus...

558
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,650
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

559
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,070
Everyone, welcome the new student
to our class. Holly Carpenter.

560
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,232
Holly, perhaps you'd like to tell us
a little bit about yourself.

561
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,318
No, I'm good, good.
Thanks, thanks for asking.

562
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,115
I see.

563
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,738
Uh...

564
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,542
So, the consensus is that
we're all here, yeah?

565
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,668
ALL: Yeah.

566
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,838
All right, all right, if you think so.
Seems a little rash to me, but, uh...

567
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,804
Mr Michaels?

568
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,682
Maybe you could tell us
a little bit about

569
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:57,853
why you decided to come
to Binghamton and teach?

570
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,435
I certainly could, Miss Carpenter.

571
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,143
The truth is that, uh...

572
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,603
I...

573
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,948
The truth is that I'm going
to be writing a movie

574
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,950
- about a teacher and this is all research.
- (ALL MURMUR EXCITEDLY)

575
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,364
Who's going to be in it?

576
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,666
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

577
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,493
You know, Matt hasn't committed yet...

578
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,129
Matt Damon? Oh, my God!

579
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,547
- Oh, my God!
- I did not say that, no.

580
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,007
No, the point is that, you know,

581
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,427
I have to learn who
my protagonist really...

582
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,550
Protagonist, protagonist, protagonist.

583
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:37,559
Pro-tag-on-nist

584
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,977
is all about, you know,

585
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:43,182
what he aspires to be,
what goal he wishes to achieve.

586
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,439
You mean like how in A New Hope,
Luke wants to become a Jedi Knight?

587
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,196
Yeah, perfect example, Mr...

588
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,906
Frazier. Billy Frazier.

589
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,449
Yeah. Billy, good, yes.

590
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,702
A goal has been established and
the story consists of trying to overcome

591
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,324
the obstacles in the way of that goal.

592
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,583
Feel free to write that down.

593
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,420
And, I bet that if you all thought
of your favourite movie

594
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,625
you could identify the hero or heroine
and what their goal was.

595
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,010
Dirty Dancing.

596
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,679
Are you serious?
That's not even a movie.

597
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,225
It's a wack Cinderella fantasy
that's totally devoid of reality.

598
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,472
(MOBILE RINGING)

599
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,143
Uh...

600
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,604
Just excuse me one second.

601
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,564
You know, Hollywood never rests.
(CHUCKLES)

602
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,766
- Yeah, hi.
- ELLEN: Hey. Are you OK?

603
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,027
You sounded like you were going to kill
yourself last night.

604
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,279
I was, but it was
far too cold and rainy.

605
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,323
Listen, I am actually
teaching at the moment.

606
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:36,076
OK, good, good.
Well, I'm just checking in.

607
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,161
You hang in there
and I'll talk to you soon, OK?

608
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,247
Yeah, I will do, will do.

609
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,957
And just one other thing.

610
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,083
Um...

611
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,460
Tell them if Matt wants a meeting
he's going to have to come here.

612
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,962
Matt? Who is Matt?

613
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,964
Because, you know, there's always Ryan.

614
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,341
(GASPS) Gosling or Reynolds?

615
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,094
- OK. Talk to you soon. Yeah, ciao.
- Ciao.

616
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,922
I'm so sorry about that.
They never leave me alone.

617
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,432
So, any other favourite movies?

618
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,146
HOLLY: Hey.

619
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,448
You made it through. Sort of.

620
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,326
I couldn't have done it without
your probing and annoying question.

Mr Ronson.

623
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,162
Your pages were excellent.

624
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,377
- Really?
- Yeah.

625
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,749
Thanks, Mr Michaels.

626
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,626
- (SNEEZES) Sorry.
- Oh!

627
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,883
I think I might be coming down
with something.

628
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,960
Do you have any idea
where you might be going with the story?

629
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,304
Um...

630
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,598
Yes. I have more pages.

631
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,974
All of them, actually.

632
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,219
Sorry, why did you only hand in 30?

633

Well, I'd love to see the rest, if and
when you're comfortable sending them.

00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,749

- Evening, Jim.
- Evening.

641
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,514
- Henry, how are you?
- Hey, boy.

642
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,938
You know, Karen,
I want to have a quick chat with Jim

643
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,442
about the correct schedule
for garbage pickups for a moment,

644
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:36,442
- so why don't you go on in and I'll catch up.
- OK.

645
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,115
OK, don't be too long. You want it hot.

646
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,821
Take care, Professor Harper.

647

OK, all right, Henry.

00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,616
Quiet, Henry.

651
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,663
Sorry about Henry here.
I think he's why my wife left me.

652
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,674
Your wife? I didn't realise
you were married.

653
00:37:55,774 --> 00:38:01,888
Yeah. She's with some visiting professor
in the Physics Department.

654
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:06,476
One of the guys that helped discover
that whole Higgs boson thing.

655
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,144
The glue to the universe.

656
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,517
She's impressed with that kind of stuff.

657
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,648
Listen, um...

- About Karen...
- Mmm.

659
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,239
You know, we've been spending
some time together.

660
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,323
Uh-huh.

661
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,325
Yeah, I think I may have seen that.

662
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,526
Right.

663
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,620
You know, she's been
very welcoming, very friendly.

664
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,997
- Lot of school spirit. Uh-huh.
- Right, right.

665
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,292
And she's actually
also taking my course.

666
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,419
Ah. Ah.

667
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,670
OK. I gotcha.

668
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,423
Right. So I was just wondering
if there's any kind of, you know,

669
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,259
university policy or official position
on that kind of thing.

670
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,302
Yeah, it's totally against the rules.

671
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,971
- Is that right?
- Yeah, no, big time.

672
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,969
People get fired for that.

673
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,176
Wow, I didn't realise, so...

674
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,311
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

675

- Thank you very much, Jim.
- Sure.

- Gentlemen.
- JIM: Well, hey.

678
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,479
Just coming back from a grocery run.
What are we talking about?

679
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:06,411
I was just trying to remember
which Shakespeare play, the line

680
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,664
"Tomorrow and tomorrow,
creeps in this petty pace" comes from

681
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,537
and Jim was assisting me.

682
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,668
Macbeth. Act V, Scene V.

683
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,870
- Very impressive, very impressive.
- Wow.

684
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,298
- That is why he's Department Chairman.
- Right.

685
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,674
Actually, I'm Department Chairman

686
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,926
because it pays more
and I have four daughters

687
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,800
who spend so much time at the mall,
the mannequins call them by name.

688
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,515
Wow. So it's just you in the house
with five women, huh?

00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,809
Yup. Me and the girls.

and brush up on my classics,

Thank you. Here you are.

00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,634
Good timing. Last umbrella.

697
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,761
Yeah, I'm quite excited.
I haven't actually owned one of these

698
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,888
since I left England
about 100 years ago.

699
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,265
But your horrendous weather
has forced my hand.

700
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,226
No, you're looking
at it all the wrong way.

701
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,555
First of all, think about how much
you save in suntan lotion.

702
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,606
Yes, I see that. And sunglasses.

703
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,690
And convertibles.

704
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,193
And bikinis. I'm now very
glad I did not bring mine.

705
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,569
I can lend you one when it gets sunny.

706
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,780
Oh, you're saying there actually
will be a sunny day?

707
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,033
Oh, yeah. It gets sunny,
and it is worth the wait.

Professors teach outside
and it's just, you just...

710

You soak it all in, you absorb it, like the
best scoop of ice cream you ever had.

711
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,415
What a sad, pathetic story.

712
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,838
Too randomly structured?

713
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,256
- Bit cliché.
- Mmm.

714
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,629
Saying "a bit cliché" is a bit cliché.

715
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:48,179
Mark Twain said that, "The difference between
the almost right word and the right word

716
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,139
"was the difference between
the lightning bug and lightning."

kind of stuff I want to learn.

Yes, and this is exactly
what can't be taught, so...

I know, I know.
No one can learn anything.

It's all set in stone,
let's just all kill ourselves.

- Mmm-hmm.

723

Looks like one of those Victorian plays
where many people say, "arse".

724
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,663
Well, it is about people who find
their true talents later in life.

Sylvester Stallone,
he was a deli counter attendant.

726
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,087
Rodney Dangerfield gave up selling
aluminium siding to go on to become

727
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,965
- one of the most famous comedians ever.
- Yeah?

728
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,967
Alan Rickman, a fellow countryman,

729
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,303
didn't get a movie role until he was 48.

730
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,638
- Wow.
- Susan Boyle was 46.

731
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:35,093
Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't write Little
House on the Prairie until she was 65.

732
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,561
Incredible. And look at that.

733
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,014
Jesus didn't give up carpentry
until he was 30.

734
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,021
Yeah, and now he's,
like, a top guy in his field.

735
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,154
The thing is, you see, I would argue
late bloomers may have had talent all along.

736
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,197
It was just unrecognised.
There's a difference.

737
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,197
I disagree. I think
it's just about focusing.

738
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,827
Right.

739
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,028
Uh-oh.

740
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,867
I wish you'd focused on my umbrella.

741
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,325
Oh, it's a good thing
I don't work on commission.

00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,781
- Are you all right?
- I noticed this discolouration on my arm.

748
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,485
I thought it was the flesh-eating virus,
but the infirmary says it's just a dry patch.

749
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,070
Well, better luck next time.

750
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,704
But the good news is,

751
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,623
I have now finished
your completed script, and...

752
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,034
It's brilliant.

- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

754
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,546
It's unbelievable. It's annoying, actually.
Have you always written?

755
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,049
Pretty much. Especially in high school.

756
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,343
It gave me something to do
in between getting beaten up.

757
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,254
Yeah well, most good writers spend
a lot of their time getting beaten up.

is just give you my few, inane notes

which if you've seen my last few movies,
you will know to ignore

and then, I'd like to
show this to my agent.

who's ever walked the planet.

776
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,720
She's based on me.

777
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,605
Maybe you need a villain.

778
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,025
He could wear a mask that covers his face.
You could hear his breathing.

779
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,311
I thought it had some
really nice touches.

780
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,192
Me too. I really enjoyed it.

781
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,443
Very quick read.

782
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,576
You start with two pages
describing clouds.

783
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,786
If it was a movie about
a meteorologist, fine,

784
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,489
but it's a story about
a Bat Mitzvah gone wrong.

785
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,415
KEITH: Ok, Andrea, good.

786
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,542
Let me just ask you
this question. Sit down.

787
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,878
Why did you write this?

788
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,714
- What do you mean?
- KEITH: Well,

789
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,417
what was the thing that made you
want to write this story?

790
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,170
- I don't know.
- KEITH: OK.

791
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,346
Your favourite film, Dirty Dancing,
what's that about?

792
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,557
A girl who learns to dance
and falls in love.

793
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,805
Yes. But isn't it about more than that?

794
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,228
Isn't it about a girl named Baby

795
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,773
who discovers that she is in fact
becoming a woman?

796
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,520
Isn't it about lost innocence?

797
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,026
Yes, I guess so.

798
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,321
See, the thing is,
writing a movie is so hard,

799
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,364
it's like jumping into the sea.

800
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,657
And you need a life raft.

801
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,494
And that raft is the impulse
behind the movie.

802
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,163
It's the thing that made you want to
write the story in the first place.

803
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,037
You've got to figure that out
and then cling on for dear life.

804
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,743
So why did you write Paradise Misplaced?

805
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,047
- We don't want to talk about my stuff.
- ANDREA: Yeah, why did you tell that story,

806
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,340
- Mr Michaels?
- How did you come up with that?

807
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,884
- Yeah, what was your life raft?
- Did you have a near-death experience?

808
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,549
Oh...

809
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,220
Well, it was a...

810
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,844
I used to tell my son stories at night.

811
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,641
You have a son?

812
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,897
Yeah, yeah, Alex.

813
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,024
He's 18 now

814
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,397
and he is a freshman
at Stanford University.

815
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,236
Wow. So, he's really smart.

816
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,199
Well, his mother was quite clever.
Smart enough to divorce me anyway.

817
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,902
- (ALL CHUCKLE)
- But, while we were still together,

818
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,788
my dad died and...

819
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,414
Suddenly Alex, at age five,

820
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:29,039
became frightened of the dark
and obsessed with death.

821
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,585
So I invented a story
about heaven to comfort him.

822
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,510
He didn't really buy it, you know?

823
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,221
He had so many brilliant
and detailed questions

824
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,719
that I had to refine
my answers every night.

825
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:48,396
That turned into the story of two angels
who botch a mission to take a soul

826
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,773
to heaven and have to go
to hell to get her back.

827
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,400
Paradise Misplaced.

828
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,726
Yeah, yeah.

829
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,904
It was a fairy tale, you know,

830
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,944
designed to make a five-year-old
boy go to sleep.

831
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,914
And that's the thing, you know.
Just having that idea,

832
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,584
however big or small,
is an enormous help

833
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,754
when you're drifting to sea somewhere
in the middle of your second act.

834
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,506
I mean, let's say, for instance,

835
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,926
that I was going to write a sequel
to Paradise Misplaced.

836
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:19,969
Are you going to do that?

837
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,096
I ask the question purely academically,

838
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,549
but you know,
what could be the spine to that story?

839
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,360
Well, I always thought Paradise Misplaced
was about second chances

840
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,530
and how it's never too late to redeem
yourself and to start over again.

841
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,075
Interesting, Miss Carpenter,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,244
I'm sorry, I just had
an unrelated thought.

843
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,164
- Yeah, Billy?
- Maybe instead of going to Hell this time,

844
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,786
they go into space.

845
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,293
OK, yeah. I think I see
where you're going with that one.

846
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,836
It needs a love story.

847
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,379
It should be in 3-D.

848
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,381
One of the angels
from the original movie

849
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,342
could have been captured
and brought down to Hell

850
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,795
so two younger angels
have to try and get him back.

851
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,639
Jonah Hill. And Channing Tatum.
We know that works.

852
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,351
Good, good, good, good.

853
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,679
Yes. Well, I hope you're
learning something here.

854
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,309
KAREN: Hey. Hey!

855
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,270
That was an incredible story
you told about your son today.

856
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,696
Oh.

857
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,698
Yeah. I shouldn't have really
gotten caught up in all that.

858
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,991
No, it was really moving.

859
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,193
I was just surprised
you hadn't mentioned it before.

860
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,489
Hey, let's go someplace and talk.
Really talk.

861
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,832
There's this restaurant called Number 5.

862
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,794
You know, that would be lovely,
but I had not realised

863
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,088
that there's this school policy.

864
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,589
Discouraging teachers and students

865
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,008
from having "romantic and
extracurricular relationships".

866
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,177
- Yeah, exactly.
- But it happens all the time.

867
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,098
I've had relationships with three of
my professors and teaching assistants.

868
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,350
Wow. Three.

869
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,477
And I just think trying to tell adults

870
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,480
what they can or can't do
with their personal lives is ridiculous.

871
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,433
I agree with that, but in our case,

872
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,861
one of us is so much more adult
than the other.

873
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,030
I don't mean emotionally,
because obviously that would be you...

874
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,448
Age is just a number.

875
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,326
I care about who a person is.
And you're an amazing man.

876
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,328
- Well, fair enough...
- Listen to me.

877
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,905
Do you know Steven Spielberg?

878
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,207
Know him? No, not really. We've met.

879
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,459
If you bumped into him in the street,
would he recognise you?

880
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,671
Well, if I bumped into him really hard
and, you know, reintroduced myself

881
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,089
when he was lying on the sidewalk,
I suppose.

882
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,340
What about George Clooney?

883
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,718
We had a lunch.
I pitched him something he really hated.

884
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,513
Do you realise how amazing this is?
These people are the gods of our time.

885
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,473
Yeah, I'm not sure anyone
in the Screen Actors Guild

886
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,890
should really be called a god.

887
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,561
Every society back to
ancient times had gods.

888
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,479
I'm minoring in anthropology.

889
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,064
First it was the stars and the sun,

890
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,859
then the Greeks and Romans
anthropomorphised them.

891
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,444
Then, we had monotheism,

892
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:44,196
and in today's culture
our gods are celebrities.

893
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,023
And you know them personally.

894
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,908
I suppose that makes me
a kind of demi-god.

895
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,201
Quite a morale-booster.

896
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,913
Besides, what if you meet
your soulmate this way?

897
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,832
What if you meet the person
you're going to marry?

898
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,454
Is that something to be discouraged?

899
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,755
No, I suppose not. No.

900
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,089
Then let's go to dinner.

901
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,051
Unless, you just want it to be about sex.
And I'm fine with that.

902
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,136
Just say that you only
want it to be about sex.

903
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,805
I certainly don't want that.

904
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,931
I...

905
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,808
Let's talk about it at dinner.
That's a good idea.

906
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,100
Great.

907
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,520
(♪ JAZZ MUSIC ON SPEAKER)

908
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,572
Calm down. No one's going to see us

909
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,948
and who cares if they did.

910
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,785
Yup. You're absolutely right.
Silly of me to be worried.

911
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,613
So your son? What is he majoring in?

912
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,743
Well, you know...

913
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,833
I'm not absolutely certain.

914
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,794
Welcome to... Oh.

915
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:40,961
- Oh, Lord.
- HOLLY: Hi.

916
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,964
- Mr Michaels and Karen.
- Hello, Holly.

917
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,591
Wow, so you work here?

918
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,544
No, I just walk around with a pad
and I find out what people like to eat.

919
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,012
- I'd like the ahi tuna.
- HOLLY: OK.

920
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,556
Excellent choice.

921
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,258
Great. And a glass of Chardonnay.

922
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,803
OK. Just need to see an ID.

923
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:57,853
Seriously?

924
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,430
That's just restaurant policy.

925
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,494
Oh, I'm sorry. That doesn't look real.

926
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:14,829
Yes, it is.

927
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,288
I can take it to the manager.

928
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,749
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I order a Chardonnay

929
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,950
and we can share it.

930
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,749
OK. Are we going to get straws?
Am I three years old?

931
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,955
Well, we don't really know,
because your ID is fake.

932
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,249
Sorry.

933
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,885
I'm going to change my order, it's fine.

934
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,300
I'll have a beef enchilada
and a margarita

935
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,841
at Café Mexico with Judy and Chloe.

936
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,508
Karen.

937
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,719
Karen.

938
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,355
(WHISPERING)
Don't make a big thing about this.

939
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,859
She's being totally rude
and it'd be nice if you stood up for me.

940
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,107
Either you take me
seriously or you don't.

941
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,320
No, I do.

942
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,698
I just think it's probably her job
to ask that question

943
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,899
- and she...
- Good night.

944
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,871
Daughters.

945
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:07,048
It might have been real,
we just have to check.

946
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,254
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,764
So, the ahi tuna actually
sounded delicious.

948
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,892
And I will have a glass of Chardonnay.

949
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,093
Thank you.

950
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,265
Would you like to see ID?

951
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,728
HOLLY: Hey, I'm driving you home.

952
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,823
KEITH:
Wow, this is a full-service restaurant.

953
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,242
Well, you had two glasses
and you had two at the bar

954
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,952
and if you die, I don't get
to take your course

955
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,454
and it's going to screw up
my whole schedule.

956
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,623
What about my car?

957
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,291
It's a Hyundai.
It'll be there in the morning.

958
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,582
Oh.

959
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,470
The girls are doing a disco performance.
(CHUCKLES)

960
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,513
I'm helping. You know, I used to dance.

961
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,309
No, I know. You danced modern.
It's in your script.

962
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,478
Peggy goes all the way to the big city

963
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,647
to dance before coming back
and marrying Ted,

964
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,942
the hot, but quite thick
minor league baseball player.

965
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,820
I didn't write "big city".
I said "New York".

966
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,822
You think we're all rubes up here?

967
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,783
Very much so, yes, yes, yes.

968
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:19,286
That true, did you really dance
in an off-Broadway show?

969
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,455
Yes, until I blew my ankle out.

970
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,873
Oh.

971
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,667
Must have been tough, coming back
here after being in the big...

972
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,461
Manhattan.

973
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,413
Why? Hmm?

974
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,674
Binghamton rocks.

975
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,343
Oh, I know. I know.

976
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,091
How does it rock?

977
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,677
HOLLY: Gorgeous.

978
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:46,647
One of the oldest antique carousels
in the United States.

979
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,440
Rod Serling used it as the model

980
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,519
for one of the most famous episodes
of The Twilight Zone ever.

981
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,399
Do you know it?

982
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,781
KEITH: I was always too scared
to watch The Twilight Zone

983
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:56,991
because of that music.

984
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,325
You mean...

985
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,952
(♪ HOLLY HUMMING TWILIGHT ZONE THEME)

986
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,453
Yup, that's it. Yup.

987
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,330
(CONTINUES HUMMING)

988
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,083
You're very good.
You can stop now. Please.

989
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,035
Please, seriously, stop, stop.

990
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,339
It's the story of a middle-aged man
who's lost his way

991
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,717
and goes back in time
to the park he used to play in.

992
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,594
This park.

993
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,888
And, he rides the merry-go-round

994
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,098
and he sees his father
and his father tells him

995
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,850
that he has to move on with his life

996
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,021
because he's been looking behind him
and he has to try looking ahead.

997
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,273
KEITH: All right, well, thank you
for the history lesson.

998
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,191
CAROUSEL WORKER:
Folks, closing in a minute.

999
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,395
KEITH: And thanks for being
so understanding tonight about Karen.

1000
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,822
It's not what it seems.

1001
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,199
HOLLY:
Seems like you're sleeping with her.

1002
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,243
- Then it is what it seems.
- (CHUCKLES)

1003
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,037
I mean, I realise I shouldn't
be leading her on, but...

1004
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,371
- Oh! (CHUCKLES)
- I mean, it takes...

1005
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,206
You think it's about you?

1006
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,908
It's about her father.

1007
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,171
What do you mean, it's about her father?

1008
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,840
The whole subtext of her script
is about a young girl

1009
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,509
trying to get her distant,
powerful father's love.

1010
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,181
You're just a substitute for the attention
she never got from an older male figure.

1011
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,515
That's rather disturbing.

1012
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,392
What's disturbing is
what does it say about you?

1013
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,766
You trying to fill a spiritual vacancy
with alcohol and young women?

1014
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,435
Yes.

1015
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,564
Well.

1016
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,737
- Thank you very much.
- Mmm.

1017
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,277
No problem.

1018
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,125
- Good.
- Yes.

1019
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,430
That was very nice of you to show me
the sights of Binghamton.

1020
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,099
Oh, the sight. That was about it.

1021
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,685
Well it was surprisingly lovely and...

1022
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,604
You're very easy to talk to even though
you did do most of the talking.

1023
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,356
Thank you. I think.

1024
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,399
And you look very nice
in your waitress uniform.

1025
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,985
But, I've always had a yen for uniforms.

1026
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,946
I think Kim Jong-Eun looks pretty sexy.

1027
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,865
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I am flattered by the competition.

1028
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,994
(SOFTLY) Yeah.

1029
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,957
OK. Good night.

1030
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,500
Good night.

1031
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,645
KEITH: Character.

1032
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,939
Character is everything.

1033
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,608
Fortunately, not in life,
but in storytelling.

1034
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,486
Make sure that your
characters drive the plot

1035
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,188
and not the other way around.

1036
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,067
Yes, questions? Anyone else?

1037
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,245
Karen, yeah?

1038
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,165
I'm just wondering,
given that besides Paradise Misplaced

1039
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:54,126
all your other films were critical
and commercial failures,

1040
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,875
why should we take this
or any advice from you?

1041
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,047
(STUTTERING)
Well, you shouldn't. Because, um...

1042
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,643
When it comes to writing,
there are no rules, you know?

1043
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,354
(CHUCKLES) Except be true
to the story you're telling.

1044
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,690
Just make it your own unique voice.

1045
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,439
So thank you for pointing that out, Karen.
That's very helpful.

1046
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,208
(INAUDIBLE)

1047
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,888
KEITH: Well, I enjoyed your pages, Sara,

1048
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:52,434
but, why is it subtitled
when the film is in English?

1049
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,230
To demonstrate the vast gulf between
what we say and what we mean.

1050
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,815
No one's ever done that before.

1051
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,609
Yeah, I think Woody Allen
did it in Annie Hall.

1052
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,153
That was a comedy.

1053
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,947
I'm not interested in comedy.

1054
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,366
No, no, I do see that. Yes.

1055
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,910
- Thanks, Mr Michaels.
- Thank you, Rosa.

1056
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,746
- Thank you, Mr Michaels.
- Thank you, Andrea, Clem, Billy...

1057
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,957
Maya. At last, thank you.

1058
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:18,085
Andrea, this is vastly improved.

1059
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,879
Really? I'm going to cry.

1060
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,090
No, really, you've done a good job

1061
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:27,594
of foreshadowing by starting the script
with the Bat Mitzvah video,

1062
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,346
giving us a hint of the horror to come.

1063
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:34,052
But, I still think maybe you just need
to define the larger theme of your story.

1064
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,272
What about the idea that you really
have to do everything yourself?

1065
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,520
Because you can never trust caterers.

1066
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,695
Yeah. That might be a tad close
to The Hurt Locker.

1067
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,364
Did you think you could maybe
dig a little deeper?

1068
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,157
I don't think I go that deep.

1069
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,153
That's what everybody
keeps telling me anyways.

1070
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:58,167
Well, let's prove everybody wrong.

1071
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,370
(INAUDIBLE)

1072
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,760
OK, well here's my thought, Billy,

1073
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,762
and I know how much you love Star Wars,

1074
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,473
but I'm just not sure it's really going
to pass muster to just

1075
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,643
retell those stories
and change some names around.

1076
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,186
I didn't.

1077
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,640
Well, you have a small, wise,
greenish character called Zoda.

1078
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,067
- That's not the same.
- Yes,

1079
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,112
but I just think maybe it'd be good
to let go of your obsessions.

1080
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,313
Do you have other ideas?

1081
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,447
I was thinking about
trying to join a frat.

1082
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,866
Well, that would take care
of your social life, I suppose.

1083
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,205
Uh...

I want to discuss our relationship,
if you can call it that.

Well, exactly,
I am not sure that you can,

because if your script
is any kind of guide,

1135

it could be said that any interest
you have in me

is just a misplaced attempt
to earn the attention

to me from your pages.

And, can I tell you what I think

1143
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,034
is the most significant problem
with your otherwise very promising script?

Fine. OK, sure, tell me.

1145
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:16,258
All right. So your father character is rich,
narcissistic, selfish, womanising...

01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,467
Yeah, I know. Too unlikeable.

No, no, no, I loved him. He's fantastic.

You loved him? That's perverse.

Well, he's an incredibly
well-drawn character.

1150
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,644
The problem is with the daughter,
she's sort of paper-thin, you know?

she's a good student.

There's no flaws,

So? The father needs to be fixed.

1236
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,175
Stupid of me, yes.

1237
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,177
And, you know,
Jerry's not such a bad egg.

1238
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,678
Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

1239
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,050
Who's Jerry?

1240
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,389
Does Jack know about Jerry?

1241
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,719
No. Jack is Jerry.

1242
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,939
- Jack is Jerry.
- Jack is Jerry.

1243
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,108
Oh, so Jerry is a man you are seeing.

1244
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,735
Yes. And that's why the character
should work.

1245
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,780
Because I'm writing from real life.
I'm writing what I know.

1246
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,365
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

1247
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,950
Not at all, no, no. That's absurd.

1248
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,700
I mean, for a start, what if you're like me,
what if you don't know anything?

1249
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,873
But, you're writing your Matt Damon movie
about being a teacher now

1250
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,459
and you wrote about your son
and that worked out.

1251
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,708
Yeah, that's debatable seeing as we
haven't actually spoken in over a year.

1252
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,173
But Jack, or should I say Jerry...

1253
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,171
You haven't spoken
to your son in a year?

1254
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:13,555
Well it's not a big deal, it's just
that after his mother remarried,

1255
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,133
we sort of saw less and less
of each other, so...

1256
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,061
Cos when you spoke about him in class,
your whole face lit up.

1257
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,188
Yeah, well, I was very fond of him.

1258
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,935
And now you're not?

1259
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:32,365
There is no adulation
like Hollywood adulation, you know?

1260
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:36,619
People that you have only seen in magazines
tell you that they love you

1261
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,914
and they want to be your friend.
And it's magical.

1262
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:43,251
Until your next film is not as good
and the one after that even less so.

1263
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,088
And suddenly,
your confidence is shattered

1264
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:51,418
and your wife leaves you for the man
who directed your one hit.

1265
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,842
The guy who directed Paradise Misplaced?

1266
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,973
- Niles Kelling.
- Oh, God.

1267
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,600
He's big. Hit after hit.

1268
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,726
Yeah, thank you very much.

1269
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,645
And, as I was drinking a bit too much

1270
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,398
and dating actresses
young enough to believe

1271
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,859
that a writer could get them a job,

1272
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,778
I sort of stopped calling Alex.

1273
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,946
Because you think he feels about you
the way you feel about you?

1274
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,204
Yup, yup, yup.
And really, why wouldn't he?

1275
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:22,540
You know, cos he's with his mother
and stepfather

1276
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,542
flying to Hawaii on a private jet

1277
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:28,542
while Dad is being rejected
for a rewrite of Piranha 3D.

1278
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,757

I thought so, Pop.

1291

I've been living at a dead run
and I was tired.

1292

And one day I knew
I had to come back here.

1293
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,760
Had to come back
and get on the merry-go-round

1294

and eat cotton candy
and listen to a band concert.

1295
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,134
Had to stop and breathe.

1296
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,104
Maybe when you go back, Martin,

1297
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:29,729
you'll find that there are merry-go-rounds
and band concerts where you are.

1298
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,022

in the right place.

you have been carrying on "an inappropriate

It's very hard to know why any of you
would want to do this in the first place,

1387
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,889
because you will be rewritten,
discarded, fired, forgotten.

1388
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,849
That's if you're lucky enough
to work in the first place.

1389
01:14:54,949 --> 01:15:00,980
So don't be under any illusion that this
will bring you immortality. Or happiness.

1390
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,683
Perhaps it's better not to even try.

1391
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:12,233
(IMITATING YODA) Try not.
Do or do not. There is no "try".

1392
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,662
Thank you, Billy. Thank you.

1393
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,332
Excellent shirt, by the way.
I think that may be my favourite so far.

1394
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,550
HOLLY: So one Scotch, and one...

1395
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:34,801
Hi.

1396
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,851
- Hey.
- Hey. You here for dinner?

1397
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,396
- No. No, I had a Spiedie earlier.
- Sorry to hear that.

1398
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,484
Um, no. I just wanted
to tell you something

1399
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:49,570
and I didn't want you to hear it
in front of the whole class.

1400
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,155
Weldon knows about Karen.

1401
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,985
She's gonna put me in front of
the Ethics Committee, unless I leave.

1402
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:58,329
Whoa. Uh...

1403
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,539
- What are you going to do?
- I don't think I have a choice.

1404
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,085
There'd be a hearing, it would inevitably
go public and everyone in LA would know.

1405
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:07,380
- Not that they care, but then...
- And then your son would find out.

1406
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,714
Exactly. Yeah.

1407
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,800
Well, do you want to stay?

1408
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,128
- The issue is whether I can stay.
- Yes.

1409
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,471
- First, you gotta go to Weldon.
- And say what?

1410
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:19,058
I've already bought her every Jane Austen
gift short of a "Hello, Mr Darcy" thong.

1411
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,561
You tell her that you did an incredibly
stupid thing. Which it was.

1412
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,772
Yes, yes. I think we've already
covered that ground very well.

1413
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,900
And then you tell her that you didn't
know that it was against school rules

1414
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,821
and that she was over 21,
according to her (FAKE COUGHS) fake ID.

1415
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,197
Yes, fair point. Yes.

1416
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,991
And then you tell her how sorry you are.

1417
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:38,369
Do you think that's really going to work with
a woman who practically wears a bonnet?

1418
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,287
I think it's worth a shot.

1419
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:48,087
Here you are. I'll be right back
for your dinner order.

1420
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,635
I think I should just go quietly.

1421
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:55,927
Huh!

1422
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,473
OK. Whatever you want.

1423
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,268
I guess that it will give you more time
to work on your Matt Damon movie.

1424
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:06,689
Oh, Lord, no.
Look, there is no Matt Damon movie.

1425
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:10,735
- What? So, all that was just...
- It was a lie. It was a lie.

1426
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,862
Yeah. I'm sorry.
There's no movie at all.

1427
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:17,450
As a matter of fact, the only reason
I'm here is because I can't get a job.

1428
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,535
But you do have a job.

1429
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,121
You mean teaching? Well, yeah.
Number one, I'm no good at it,

1430
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,249
and number two,
I don't have it any more, so...

1431
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,960
But you don't know that
until you go to Weldon.

1432
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,880
Holly, I wish I shared your faith that
if you just push yourself hard enough,

1433
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,548
everything will work out.

1434
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:37,720
It's very American, like country music,
or, I don't know, obesity. But it's not true.

1435
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,264
You know, it won't make anyone talented,

1436
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,558
it won't get me a job,
and it won't make my son call me.

1437
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,353
I don't understand. Why are you reducing me
to some kind of optimism machine?

1438
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:49,398
You think I wake up in a motivational video?
This is what I believe.

1439
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,525
I believe what I believe.
This is what I'm teaching my girls.

1440
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,569
Oh, really, and how are you
teaching them that?

1441
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,363
By contemplating marrying someone
because he's steady and secure?

1442
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,824
I don't understand. So now,
you're giving me parenting advice?

1443
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,368
- If you like to dish it out...
- I thought you wanted to talk this through.

1444
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,496
I don't understand.
What is going on with you?

1445
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,869
- Miss? We're ready to order now.
- KEITH: I'm just saying...

1446
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:09,914
Be right there.

1447
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,581
Watch it!

1448
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:21,305
KEITH: Well, listen. You've got to
get me something. Anything. A rewrite...

1449
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:25,851
I'll work on reality TV
as a writer or a contestant.

1450
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,063
ELLEN: Keith, I'm really sorry.
It's hard times out here.

1451
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:30,523
- (SIREN WAILING)
- It's not just you, either. It's...

1452
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:34,478
Wait a minute. There's some kind of
riot going on. I'll call you back.

1453
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,487
MAN 1: Dude, not cool, man.

1454
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:37,696
WOMAN: Is the party over?

1455
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:41,617
- Mr Michaels.
- Sara, what's all the ruckus?

1456
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:46,038
I don't know. I was coming to the party
and I saw cops and paramedics...

1457
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,207
I wasn't going to drink.

1458
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,668
Oh, It's fine, Sara.
If anyone needs one, it's you.

1459
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,378
- PARAMEDIC: All right, people! Clear the way!
- Oh, my God!

1460
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,130
- MAN 2: Is he gonna be OK?
- SARA: It's Billy.

1461
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,549
Excuse me. What's going on?

1462
01:18:56,649 --> 01:19:00,094
PARAMEDIC: Some hazing thing,
made him drink a half a bottle of vodka.

1463
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:03,218
- He'll probably be OK.
- MAN 3: He should join a sorority.

1464
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,940
All right, there are easier ways to get out
of finishing your third act, you know.

1465
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,942
Mr Michaels.

1466
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,493
Hey.

1467
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:30,082
Those guys just kept saying
"One more, Obi-Wan, one more."

1468
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,627
They didn't want me in the frat.
I'm such an idiot.

1469
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:37,923
No, you are not an idiot, Billy.
You're, you know, you're weird.

1470
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,501
But half the successful people
in Hollywood are weird.

1471
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:45,764
Talking of which, I was thinking
about your screenplay, and I think

1472
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:50,060
if you love Star Wars, write Star Wars.

1473
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,436
But just give it a little twist, you know?
For example, bad version...

1474
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:59,737
College guy who's obsessed with Star Wars
meets a similarly-obsessed Star Wars girl.

1475
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,364
Uh... Did you ever see
a film called Marty?

1476
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,825
OK, I think you could
write a story like that.

1477
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,952
- In fact, I think that could be...
- WOMAN: Billy, honey?

1478
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,621
Mom, Dad.

1479
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:11,574
Hi. I'm Keith Michaels.
I'm a teacher. I teach Billy.

1480
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,127
- And I'll give you your privacy. Yeah?
- Thank you.

1481
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,506
- DAD: Billy...
- MOM: Are you OK?

1482
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,301
- Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.
- MOM: I'm so happy you're OK.

1483
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:25,054
DAD: You really had your mother worried,
I'll tell you that much.

1484
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,847
BILLY: Sorry about that.

1485
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,548
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

1486
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,714
Afternoon. Hello.

1487
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:12,351
So...

1488
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,224
Sara told us what you did for Billy.

1489
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,105
Oh, I didn't do anything.

1490
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,940
The guys at that frat are such jerks.

1491
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,314
We're all gonna go visit Billy
this afternoon, if you'd like to come.

1492
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:27,404
I would, Rosa. Um, but...
I actually have to leave town today.

1493
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,286
As it turns out, unfortunately...

1494
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:33,490
I am not gonna be able
to finish the rest of this semester.

1495
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,500
But...

1496
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,129
I've spoken to Dr Lerner, and Clara Foss,
the renowned poet, will be taking over.

1497
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,672
So you'll be in good hands.

1498
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,632
Well, what about our screenplays?

1499
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,628
I am sorry, not to be able to finish
your third acts with you.

1500
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:51,590
And I owe you an apology
for our last meeting. You know...

1501
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:56,808
What I was saying about
writing being meaningless, uh...

1502
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,889
(CHUCKLES)

1503
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,278
In a movie that I wrote
many years ago...

1504
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:08,782
An 11-year-old girl finds herself
an angel in Heaven, and she's...

1505
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,536
Understandably bereaved,
missing her family and her friends

1506
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,621
and all the life she'll never have.

1507
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:19,209
But an older angel tells her that 11 is
actually a wonderful age to be in Heaven.

1508
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:24,465
Because at 11, everything you
love and hate really stays true

1509
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:30,513
while mortal life is a long, losing struggle
not to compromise those feelings.

1510
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:37,269
I think that's a bit the case with writing.
It's our 11-year-old selves saying,

1511
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,272
"Yes, that's funny",
or "no, that's stupid".

1512
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,692
You know, Sara may come at it from
one direction, Andrea, from another.

1513
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,362
But it's real.

1514
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,405
And true.

1515
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,786
Anyway, I wanted to say thank you all.

1516
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,456
It's been an honour and a privilege.

1517
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,650
I can't wait to see
the Matt Damon movie.

1518
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,524
Thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Flo.

1519
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,864
I really enjoyed your class.

1520
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,032
Thank you, Rosa. Thanks.

1521
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,910
(QUIETLY) I've really enjoyed the class.

1522
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,998
- She enjoyed the class.
- That was nice. Thank you, Rachel.

1523
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:42,166
And thank you, Maya, for translating.

1524
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,912
You helped me find my voice.

1525
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,541
I'll never forgive you.

1526
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:53,170
Here's your rewrite. Read it in hell.

1527
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:59,351
Mr Michaels...
I don't know how to thank you.

1528
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,020
Thank you, Clem.

1529
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,348
You've made me quite jealous. (CHUCKLES)

1530
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,060
Brilliant. Brilliant.

1531
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:11,988
So...

1532
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,534
- Now, listen...
- Good luck.

1533
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,077
Write.

1534
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,079
No, I definitely will. Or email.

1535
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:21,873
I meant a script.
I need something to watch with my girls.

1536
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,329
Right.

1537
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,044
I loved the class.

1538
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,997
And you can teach, because I got better.

1539
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:32,593
- (MOBILE RINGING)
- Yeah. Look, just... Sorry. Hold on, one...

1540
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:34,340
I have a class.

1541
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,898
I meant to tell you never to call again
unless it was good news.

1542
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:49,401
Wish granted.
Paragon wants to buy Clem's script.

1543
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,695
I spoke to Jenny Glick
and Greg Nathan this morning.

1544
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,948
The same people who love me
and are huge, huge fans

1545
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,075
and rejected me from the sequel
to my own movie?

1546
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:00,454
I know. But they love this. And I told
them if they want it, you're producing.

1547
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,872
And they said?

1548
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,457
Well, they want David Shore
to executive produce,

1549
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:04,583
but they're going to give you a credit

1550
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,793
and enough money to get you back home.
Greg is...

1551
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:08,378
- Shh!
- (WHISPERS) I'm sorry.

1552
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,923
Greg and Jenny are going to be
at a premiere in Manhattan tonight,

1553
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,091
and they want to meet Clem. And you.

1554
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:14,968
Get back to LA as soon as you can

1555
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,762
so that we can ride this credit,

1556
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,885
- set up some meetings. Right? I'll...
- Shh!

1557
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,134
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

1558
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,353
Fantastic. (CHUCKLES)

1559
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:46,917
I hope you have a good trip.

1560
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,044
Thanks. And thanks again for everything.

1561
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,005
Well, hold on.
You're not getting away that easy.

1562
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,590
Get over here.

1563
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:54,675
Oh.

1564
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,172
Oh, God.

1565
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,519
GREG:
So, Clem, tell us how this happened.

1566
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:52,816
There was a screenwriting seminar,
so I submitted some pages.

1567
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,568
You had already written the whole thing?

1568
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:57,237
Well, I had a draft
and Mr Michaels asked to see it.

1569
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,364
He brought the script
to a whole other level.

1570
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:03,702
- I'm sure. We love Keith.
- Huge, huge, fans.

1571
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:06,121
So tell us a little bit about
how this idea came into being.

1572
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,373
I don't know where the ideas
come from, usually.

1573
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,209
And, I wanted to write something fresh,
something different that...

1574
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,128
- It is fresh. It is different.
- It's just a fresh voice.

1575
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,796
It's a fresh voice.
And if we can get a Fanning sister...

1576
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,798
- Do they have a young sister?
- Excuse me. Can I get the butter?

1577
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,800
CLEM: It started a few years ago now,
already, I think.

1578
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,968
- GREG: Nice.
- CLEM: Almost three years ago. Yeah.

1579
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,304
So I was watching the History Channel
and there's a special

1580
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:25,682
on the history of the world,
or modern civilisation...

1581
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:29,478
And I was watching it
and I just found it so interesting

1582
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:32,606
how, you know, the natural progression
of things, and how everything just seemed

1583
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,066
to link perfectly together.

1584
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,276
GREG: (ECHOING) Because we like
this story, we like the protagonist.

1585
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,361
A female protagonist?

1586
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,237
JENNY: (ECHOING) It's exactly what
we've both been looking...

1587
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,365
- GREG: It's exactly what we need.
- JENNY: It's what the world needs.

1588
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,867
JENNY: Edgy comedies with
a kick-ass-type woman.

1589
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,036
- JENNY: Huge, huge fans.
- GREG: We love Keith.

1590
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:48,163
Or into time, sure. Other time periods.

1591
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,748
- JENNY: Huge, huge fans.
- GREG: Technology.

1592
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:50,874
JENNY: It's really incredible...

1593
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,417
Sorry, guys, excuse me.

1594
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,995
Can I have a quick moment with Clem?

1595
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:59,792
- Little story conference?
- Kind of, yeah. Come on. Come here.

1596
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,588
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1597
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,184
You're doing brilliantly.

1598
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,938
So brilliantly that I am going to leave you
to finish the meeting on your own.

1599
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:16,024
What? No, my Imodium
hasn't even completely kicked in.

1600
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,902
Listen to me. You've probably
missed the last plane.

1601
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,404
So I'm gonna give you money for the bus.

1602
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:22,280
No, no, I'm staying
with my parents in the city.

1603
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,490
- OK, that's fine...
- Mr Michaels,

1604
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:24,783
I can't go back in there without you.

1605
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:27,786
Clem, listen to me.
Do not grow a tumour.

1606
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:32,332
They are going to make your movie,
and you'll be feted and rich,

1607
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,660
and surrounded by women.
Can you handle that?

1608
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,379
I don't want to be feted.
And the money would be fine.

1609
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:40,879
- But the only woman I really want is Rosa.
- Rosa from our class?

1610
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,927
Really? Good choice. She's gorgeous.

1611
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,179
Not of course that I notice
women of that age.

1612
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:49,015
- Mr Michaels, I don't feel comfortable.
- OK, listen to me.

A thousand years ago

1614
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:56,357
I was in your position. And you know,
just enjoy it. It's glorious fun.

1615

And remember, they need you
more than you need them.

1616

This is your ride. It's not mine, OK?

1617
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,497
- Hey, he's back.
- Hey. Thanks.

1618
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,249
- Sans glasses.
- Yeah.

1619

- GREG: You look mighty handsome.
- JENNY: Hmm.

1620
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:17,540
Thank you.

1621
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,339
GREG: So this is what we're
thinking about, we're discussing this...

1622
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,009
We don't want to get ahead of ourselves,
but, franchise.

1623
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:27,588
JENNY: Yeah. We're really excited about it.
There's actually so much that we can do...

(SIGHS) OK.

Listen, I did not expect
to see you again.

1636
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:00,522
No, well, I have decided to take my chances
at the hearing, if it's not too late.

May I ask why?

Yes. I'm not quite sure.

1640
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,780
Ah, well, I'm glad
you've thought it through.

1641
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,117
And I was wondering if you could get me
a meeting with Professor Weldon,

1642
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,286
cos I'd rather not just
show up at her door.

01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,238
- No, I think that would be dangerous.
- Yeah.

1644
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,374
Sure. I can arrange that.

1645
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,459
Thank you. Thank you.

I'm sorry for what happened

and do not make me go back in there.

I did almost immediately break it off

and I deeply regret the entire incident.

1670

You arrived on campus,

1671
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:25,246
became inebriated,

insulted members of the faculty.

You dismissed your class with the intention
of not having them return for a month.

And that class bears a suspicious

Not the men.

assembled for your own viewing pleasure

1680
01:33:56,589 --> 01:34:01,695
So unless my information is faulty,
this Ethics Hearing is a foregone conclusion.

1681
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:07,125
Professor Weldon,
you're entirely correct.

1682
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:11,129
I behaved unprofessionally
and I can present no good reason

1683
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,548
why you should extend me
the privilege of staying here.

1684
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:17,969
Except to say, that when I was
at the Binghamton Airport yesterday...

1685
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:22,057
I was pulled aside by a
charming geriatric TSA officer

1686
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:24,142
who needed to inspect my award.

1687
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:29,397
And she started telling me that her security
post was the perfect setting for a movie,

1688
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:34,652
but she couldn't write because, as she put it,
"Either you're born with it or you're not".

1689
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:38,072
You see, a few months ago,
I would have agreed with that.

1690
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:42,494
But suddenly, I found myself
explaining the three-act structure

1691
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:46,956
and the basics of outlining until she had
to go and pat down a suspicious man

1692
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:48,541
who kept readjusting his shorts.

1693
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,628
And I realised I was
trying to teach her.

1694
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:56,257
(CHUCKLES) Me, the person
who did nothing but mock teaching

1695
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:59,836
as an absurd profession
practised only by desperate failures.

1696
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:03,264
I mean, obviously not
at the university level.

1697
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:07,014
But it has, as a new friend
told me it might...

1698
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:10,647
Got its hooks into me.

1699
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:15,652
So, I ask for your leniency,
because I think that,

1700
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,529
you know, with a little effort,

1701
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:21,575
I could possibly be quite good at this job
and actually worthy of your esteem.

1702
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:26,371
And because these kids
have actually reminded me

1703
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:29,324
why I wanted to write
in the first place.

1704
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:33,628
But, mostly, because I can't bear
the thought of anyone else

1705
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,456
getting to help my class
with their third acts.

Mr Michaels, I am not popular.
My students don't like me.

1709
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,190
Oh...

1710
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:59,438
And it is because
they assume I am an Elinor.

1711
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,448
An Elinor?

1712
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,450
From Sense and Sensibility.

1713
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,578
Oh, yes, yes. That Elinor. Yes.

1714
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:10,707
Prudent, cautious, conservative.
And I do have that side of me.

1715
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,834
But there's another side as well.

1716
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:15,253
Well, that's nice. It's always nice
when people have so many sides.

1717
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:16,671
It's like a Rubik's Cube.

1718
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,293
I have a Marianne side.

1719
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,424
Oh.

1720
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,843
- Unpredictable, impetuous...
- Yes.

1721
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:23,678
...irrational sometimes.

1722
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:28,892
You have appealed to that side and I will
indulge it this one last time, because...

1723
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:32,141
As Miss Austen said...

1724
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:38,610
"Selfishness must always be forgiven, you
know, because there is no hope for a cure."

1725
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:41,946
- Did she say that? That's quite clever.
- Hmm.

Mansfield Park.

1727
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,868
The key to good teaching, Mr Michaels

1728
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:50,447
is the willingness
to always learn something new.

1729
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,662
I will remember that.

1730
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:56,286
I want you to see something.

1731
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:00,540
Open it.

1732
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,261
- Screenplay?
- Don't be idiotic. A memoir.

1733
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:06,304
Ah!

1734
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,807
Based on my experience
of a lifetime teaching literature.

1735
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,310
I'd like an unbiased honest appraisal.

1736
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,012
I'd be honoured.

1737
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:17,065
But if it were to become a movie,
Meryl Streep should play me.

1738
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:19,275
Yes, I will read it with that in mind.

1739

But don't take it.
That's my personal copy.

- I'll email you.

I did. How'd it go otherwise?

1749

Well they loved Clem,
and they're making the deal.

01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:54,352
Well, I've been thinking.

1754
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:57,480
Maybe I will write a screenplay
about a washed-up writer

1755
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,058
who goes to teach
at an out-of-the-way university.

That is a great idea for Matt Damon.

if I'd stayed away a few more hours

but now we'll never know.

1776
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:13,806
So the answer is yes, I'm hoping
that there will be something else.

1777
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,851

01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:23,746
And Alicia starts crying
because she realises

1831
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:26,040
that she doesn't care about the cake.

1832
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,626
She just wants her parents to be happy.

1833
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:32,129
And she insists on doing her Torah
and her Haftarah portions over again

1834
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,377
and it just gets so crazy.

1835
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:55,194
A-ha! "How dost thou, sweet lord?"

1836
01:42:55,294 --> 01:43:00,741
Keith! You're back!
May I introduce Joan from State Farm.

1837
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,661
Ah, yes. Hello Joan.
He's quite a catch, isn't he?

1838
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:07,491
He's low-risk, dependable,
limited-liability.

1839
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:10,585
"Thank Heaven, fasting,
for a good man's love."

1840
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:13,038
As You Like It. Act III, Scene V.

1841
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,003
It just gets me when he does that.

1842
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:22,513
"Ken's dead. He's dead now.

1843
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:26,434
"He'll be dead in two hours,
and then he'll be dead forever.

1844
01:43:27,076 --> 01:43:29,979
"TOM: Will you marry me?

1845
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:32,356
"MAURA: You're thick and stupid.

1846
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,693
"You can't see the darkness
that surrounds you.

1847
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:38,904
"TOM: You make me feel alive.

1848
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:41,232
"MAURA: That won't last."

1849
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:47,655
"CAROL: Daddy, I think you should know,
I'm sleeping with your business partner."

1850
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:54,629
The other day, she comes
and climbs up on my lap

1851
01:43:54,729 --> 01:44:00,051
with a book and she says, "Daddy, will you
read me this book in your scary voice?"

1852
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,876
(SNIFFLING)

1853
01:44:37,146 --> 01:44:38,418
Oh, Sara.

1854
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:44,212
OK. I admit I never watched it before.

1855
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:49,133
- But when Johnny lifts her at the end...
- No, I know, it's very moving.

1856
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:51,826
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

1857
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:54,305
Yeah, understood. Yeah, 100%.
