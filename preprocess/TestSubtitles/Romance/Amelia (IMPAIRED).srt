1
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,980
ENGINEER 1:
Engine 2 looks fine. How's number 1?

2
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,748
ENGINEER 2: Did a compression check.
Engine 1 looks fine.

3
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,613
WOMAN 1:
We love you, Amelia!

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
WOMAN 2:
Good luck, Amelia!

5
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,521
REPORTER: Miss Earhart, do you really
think you'll break the record this time?

6
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,789
NEWSCASTER: She will fly
the world's full circumference,

7
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,596
24,902 miles, to travel across
the South Atlantic,

8
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,862
crossing Africa, over India...

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,995
After this 'round-the-world flight,
Miss Earhart,

10
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,131
are you gonna give up long-distance flying?

11
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,266
Not while there's still life left in me.

12
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,208
(CHUCKLING) I fly for the fun of it.

13
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,339
WOMAN 1: Good luck!

14
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,816
REPORTER: All right, give us a big smile!

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,409
WOMAN 2: We love you, Amelia!

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,044
Thank you. That's enough.

17
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,272
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.

18
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,109
Mr. Putnam.

19
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,204
The headwinds were stronger
than they knew when they took off.

20
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,217
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them 9%.

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,155
9%.

22
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,932
AMELIA: When I saw that little plane,

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,600
it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.

24
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,813
I had to fly.

25
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,153
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.

26
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,132
Flying lets me move in 3 dimensions.

27
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,253
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?

28
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,793
SECRETARY: Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.

29
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,537
GEORGE: Send the papers over
this afternoon. Thank you, bye.

30
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,476
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr. Putnam?

31
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,601
Please, sit.

32
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,849
I'm told you want to fly
across the Atlantic Ocean.

33
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,182
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?

34
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,250
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?

35
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,818
Why does a man ride a horse?

36
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,861
Because he wants to, I guess.

37
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,905
3 women have died trying.

38
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,837
2 others have escaped with their lives.

39
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,104
If you do make it, you will be the first,

40
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,612
which is the real attraction
for both of us, I expect.

41
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,175
Always nice to know
what the real attraction is.

42
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:57,418
The plane was bought from
Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite,

43
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,256
who's asked to find an American.

44
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,523
Educated, well-spoken, a flier

45
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,424
and preferably physically attractive.

46
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,659
Why would that matter?

47
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,669
Because she wants
the world to pay attention.

48
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,165
And pretty girls command more attention.

49
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,036
Was that your advice?

50
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,706
There'll be a contract for the girl's
story with The New York Times.

51
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,377
Also a book
to be published under her name.

52
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,679
But all the money
from this will go to Mrs. Guest.

53
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,449
Except for the part that goes to you.

54
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,545
Well, this is America,

55
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,320
and therefore I am obligated to
make as much money as I can.

56
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,725
(LAUGHING)

57
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,665
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.

58
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,997
You said she wants a flier.

59
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,509
Don't get your hopes up.

60
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,906
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.

61
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,949
There will be a male co-pilot
who will also serve as navigator.

62
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,319
The woman will be purely a passenger.

63
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,425
Take Lindbergh. I published his book
3 months after his historic flight.

64
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,333
Must be wonderful to actually know him,
to be a friend of his.

65
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,302
Friend? Good God, no.

66
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,396
(SNORTS) Can't stand the man.

67
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,966
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious,
boring prude.

68
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,878
Was a bestseller though.

69
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,413
Why would anyone want to read
a book written by a passenger?

70
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,817
Because the hook is that they're gonna
make the woman commander.

71
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,183
The pilot will sign a contract

72
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,282
saying he's under
your direction and control.

73
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,621
It would be your flight.

74
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,627
My fraud, you mean.

75
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,066
A very distasteful word
in book publishing, Miss Earhart.

76
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,465
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.

77
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,266
My dream has always been
to fly across the Atlantic,

78
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,933
but the way you want me to do it is far
from the way I've envisioned it.

79
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,601
Let me be frank.

80
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,571
With your level of flight experience,
I wouldn't place you

81
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,673
anywhere near the group that would
normally be considered for this,

82
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,480
if a woman were to do any flying at all.

83
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,787
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,

84
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,855
I give the orders and you take them.

85
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,019
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.

86
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,825
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust

87
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,524
in your constellation.

88
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,625
Spoken like a gentleman.

89
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,760
Miss Earhart.

90
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,202
Mr. Putnam.

91
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,139
Of course,
a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.

92
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,432
What the hell are they?

93
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,636
Oryx!

94
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,882
Look how free they are!

95
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,513
No constraints, no schedules to keep.

96
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,680
For a gal who don't like schedules,

97
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,887
you sure got yourself hooked up
with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.

98
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,598
Boys, I'd like to introduce
your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.

99
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,272
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.

100
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,776
How do you do?

101
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,608
And Bill Stultz,

102
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,773
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.

103
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,215
How much fuel do you lose
because of these?

104
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,082
Costs us at least 400 gallons.

105
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,582
Well, then why have them?

106
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,856
GEORGE: The owner wants to protect her
plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.

107
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,897
But those are decisions I have to make,
not somebody else.

108
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,625
They're not making this trip, we are.

109
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,760
But she owns the plane,
and this is still America, Miss Earhart.

110
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,997
Ownership is the trump card.

111
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,539
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.

112
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:15,012
I wonder if it can keep us up there,
not that I've ever had enough to try.

113
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,845
Our job is to figure out
how to fly this beauty without gasoline.

114
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,646
Include the whole engine up here.

115
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,812
The name is Amelia Earhart.

116
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,396
TECHNICIAN: Careful up there, Slim.

117
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,273
GEORGE: They're leaving for Newfoundland.

118
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,537
Yes, they'll be taking off for there
tomorrow, weather permitting.

119
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,442
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.

120
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,444
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.

121
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,687
You know, in case.

122
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,494
I'm honored that you would
leave these with me.

123
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,590
Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault.

124
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,760
Pray I make it.

125
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,971
Not much of a prayer man.

126
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,236
Then at least tip your hat
and cross your fingers.

127
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,946
Well,

128
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,878
-see you.
-See you.

129
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,438
NEWSCASTER ON FILM: It's a short hop
from Boston to Newfoundland

130
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,405
for Amelia Earhart and crew.

131
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,069
Then on to Ireland,
and possibly the record books.

132
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,706
Earhart and top-notch ace
Bill Stultz have to get airborne,

133
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,718
quite a feat once their plane is fully
loaded for the Atlantic crossing.

134
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,444
Seems like we got a situation here,
a real problem.

135
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,915
When you figure it out,
Commander, let us know.

136
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,168
(MEN LAUGHING)

BILL: I don't even know
what the hell I'm saying anymore.

138
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,343
Here's to Little Miss Earhart,
who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!

139
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,881
(BANGING ON DOOR)

140
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,051
(SLEEPILY) What time is it?

141
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,387
It's time to fly.

142
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,195
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.

143
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,390
Where's the weather report?

144
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,090
It's not good enough.

145
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,192
Great.

146
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,501
Either we fly to Ireland
or you're going home today.

147
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,869
Well, it's not good enough.

148
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,375
It's fine. There's a tailwind all the way.

149
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,877
We'll off-load to 700 gallons,
which gets us off the water

150
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,038
and the wind will get us to Ireland.

151
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,309
You're dumping fuel? You're serious?

152
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,351
Just as serious as you're hung-over.

153
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,822
Slim, you go now. Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.

154
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,387
(STAMMERING)

155
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,018
Slim, go. I've got this.

156
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,681
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.

157
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,011
He's the most caring and generous

158
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,351

Oh, Miss Earhart,
you are such an inspiration.

ELINOR: I never get tired
of reading about you.

329
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,330
They're saying you get $500
a week on the lecture circuit.

330
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,168
-On a good week.
-On a bad week.

331
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,606
Depends on
whether you want the real or the sell.

Oh, I don't underestimate
the value of selling.

much help selling yourself.

Actually, Mr. Putnam,

337
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,460
I was hoping you could do to
me what you've done to her.

-You want a tip?
-I do.

341

If I listened to everyone
who said it was impossible,

342
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,033
I'd never be flying.

I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.

The distance between this world
and where I come from

Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.

387

I don't believe
that one can have a fulfilled life alone.

Only when it's shared.

00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,140
my father gave me a globe.

394

I would go to those places,

my feeling that I shatter

bird as far as it will take me.

798

799
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,319
It can't be done.

800
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,860
Well, I'm going to try.

801

809
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:14,481
Come on, G.P., tell me.

810
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,211
If you're serious about this
flying-around-the-world nonsense,

811
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,052
then it might be handy
to have a plane to fly in.

812
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,593
Except it would have to be
an Electra, and they cost...

813
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:29,755
$36,000, after a generous discount
from Lockheed.

814
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,332
It may as well be a billion.

815
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,924
Not to mention at least another $36,000

816
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,936
to have it modified and ready.

817
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,534
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?

818
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:43,904
No, actually, a university.

819
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,447
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create

820
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:51,418
an Amelia Earhart Fund for
Aeronautical Research at Purdue.

821
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:56,651
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000

822
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,626
for a suitable flying laboratory.

823

the donors, they have to be on board also.

828
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,184
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...

829
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:27,779
No, there will be no more horses,
no more hoops, for my Amelia.

830
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,718
Thank you, George.

831
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,596
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies,

832
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,165
you know her death will not
be a plus for aviation women,

833
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,733
or your next campaign.

834
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,631
What if she doesn't die?

835
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:44,900
What if she just circumnavigates
the globe and it's a plus for everyone?

836
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,942
The closest land west of Hawaii is
beyond the range of the Electra.

837
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,135
She'll refuel in the air.

838
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,906
She doesn't have the flying skills.

839
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,378
She's taking bigger risks.

840
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,312
Yes. I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.

01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,145
I understand the danger, fellas.

842
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,483
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?

843
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,256
This is Howland Island.

844
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,557
It's halfway
between Honolulu and New Guinea.

845
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,026
It has no elevation, no trees,

846
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,261
hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.

847
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,897
It would be
almost impossible to spot from the air.

848
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:22,569
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand
in a thousand miles of nowhere.

849
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:26,876
If you miss this island, you're out
of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.

850
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,917
But I'll have Fred Noonan,
the best celestial navigator around.

851
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,648
In fact, she's taking Fred
along for the whole trip.

more rudder instead of the throttle. I...
