- Hello, William.
- Hi.

00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:22,563
- Max has told me everything about you.
- Has he?

Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

- Some woodcock?
- No, thank you. I'm a fruitarian.

Ah.

931
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:47,364
What is a fruitarian, exactly?

932
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:51,124
We believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings,

933
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:53,404
so we think cooking is cruel.

934
00:59:53,484 --> 00:59:57,285
We only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush,

935
00:59:57,365 --> 00:59:59,485
that are, in fact, dead already.

936
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:05,285
Ah. Oh, right.

937
01:00:05,365 --> 01:00:07,245
Right.

938

So, um, these carrots?

- Have been murdered, yes.
- Murdered.

That's--

- I'm sorry about the lamb.
- [ Laughing ]

No. I thought it was...
really, you know, interesting.

945
01:00:31,806 --> 01:00:34,726
Interesting means inedible.

946
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:38,126
- Really inedible. Yes, you're right.
- [ Max, Bella Laughing ]

Well, maybe we'll meet again.

I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

956
01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:38,928
To find someone you actually... love,
who'll love you.

Look at me.

Apart from the American, I've only
loved two girls, both total disasters.

960
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,489
- That's not fair.
- One of them marries me,
then leaves me...

faster than you can say
"Indiana Jones".

And the other-- who seriously
ought to have known better--

01:01:57,889 --> 01:01:59,809
casually marries my best friend.

964
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:03,849
- She still loves you, though.
- In a depressingly asexual way.

- I never fancied you much, actually.

I don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

970

I shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa.

- Do you wanna stay?
- Yeah. Why not?

Very, very guilty.

Come in.

someone was filming me as well.

01:33:44,356 --> 01:33:46,876
and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around...

1384
01:33:46,956 --> 01:33:50,676
with at least ten other women
and still be big-bottomed.

1385
01:33:50,756 --> 01:33:53,156
I would think, looking at
something nice like that,

1386
01:33:53,236 --> 01:33:57,236
you and your...
bony little excuse for an arse...

1387
01:33:57,316 --> 01:33:59,156
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1388
01:33:59,236 --> 01:34:01,316
Now down to business.
The end of the scene.

1389
01:34:01,396 --> 01:34:04,436
Um, I ask you when you're
telling everyone, and you say--

1390
01:34:04,516 --> 01:34:08,516
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.

1391
01:34:08,596 --> 01:34:10,916
And then I-- Right. Okay.

1392
01:34:10,996 --> 01:34:14,677
Say, who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

1393
01:34:14,717 --> 01:34:16,597
No one.

1394
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:20,837
Just some guy from the past. I--

1395
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:24,677
it's a bit of an awkward situation.
I don't know what he's doing here.

1396
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:42,958
'Course.

1397
01:34:48,478 --> 01:34:51,478
Thanks. I've got to, um--

1398
01:34:51,518 --> 01:34:53,398
Any time.

1399
01:35:02,558 --> 01:35:05,878
[ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks?

1400
01:35:05,918 --> 01:35:07,958
On your first marks!

1401
01:35:19,599 --> 01:35:22,799
Uh, l-I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1402
01:35:22,879 --> 01:35:25,919
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

1403
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:28,279
Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself?

1404
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,679
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1405
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:35,239
Right. Okay.

1406
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:39,800
Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would l
have to pay it as much as I pay you?

1407
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,520
Hi.

1408
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,600
Hello.

1409
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,720
You disappeared.

1410
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,320
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

1411
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,120
I had to leave.
I didn't want to disturb.

1412
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:01,000
- How have you been?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

1413
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:05,000
When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

1414
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:08,001
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.

1415
01:36:08,081 --> 01:36:10,201
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.

1416
01:36:10,281 --> 01:36:13,601
It's-- it's all nonsense, believe me.

1417
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,481
I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

1418
01:36:16,561 --> 01:36:18,401
nonsense it all is.

1419
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:22,881
Well, um--

1420
01:36:22,921 --> 01:36:27,761
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... I'm leaving.

1421
01:36:29,801 --> 01:36:33,121
But, um--

1422
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:36,682
I brought this for you from home,

1423
01:36:36,762 --> 01:36:38,882
so I thought I'd give it to you.

1424
01:36:40,282 --> 01:36:43,082
Thank you.

1425
01:36:43,162 --> 01:36:45,002
Shall I--

1426
01:36:45,082 --> 01:36:47,562
Oh, no, don't open it now.
I'll be embarrassed.

1427
01:36:50,282 --> 01:36:53,562
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1428
01:36:53,602 --> 01:36:57,922
Actually, I had it in my apartment,
and I thought you'd--

1429
01:37:00,202 --> 01:37:02,883
But when it came to it,
I didn't know how to call,

1430
01:37:02,963 --> 01:37:05,923
having behaved so badly.

1431
01:37:06,003 --> 01:37:07,843
Twice.

1432
01:37:09,403 --> 01:37:13,403
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

1433
01:37:13,443 --> 01:37:17,603
Then you came and... I figured--

1434
01:37:21,123 --> 01:37:23,363
The thing is--

1435
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,283
The thing is--

1436
01:37:27,963 --> 01:37:30,723
What? What is the thing?

1437
01:37:31,924 --> 01:37:34,164
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

1438
01:37:34,244 --> 01:37:36,764
- Go away.
- Right.

1439
01:37:36,844 --> 01:37:38,724
Sorry.

1440
01:37:40,884 --> 01:37:43,204
You were saying?

1441
01:37:45,604 --> 01:37:48,924
Yes.

1442
01:37:49,004 --> 01:37:51,724
I have to go away today, but l...

1443
01:37:51,804 --> 01:37:54,964
wondered if I didn't...

1444
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:59,244
whether you might
let me see you a little,

1445
01:37:59,324 --> 01:38:02,085
or... a lot, maybe.

1446
01:38:05,205 --> 01:38:08,005
See if you could like me again.

1447
01:38:08,045 --> 01:38:10,405
But yesterday
that actor asked you who I was,

1448
01:38:10,445 --> 01:38:13,085
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

1449
01:38:14,405 --> 01:38:17,405
I heard.

1450
01:38:17,445 --> 01:38:20,525
You had a microphone.
I had headphones.

1451
01:38:20,605 --> 01:38:22,525
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

1452
01:38:22,565 --> 01:38:25,085
to the most indiscreet man
in England?

1453
01:38:26,445 --> 01:38:28,686
Uh, excuse me.

1454
01:38:28,766 --> 01:38:31,086
It's your mother on the phone.

1455
01:38:33,766 --> 01:38:35,806
Will you tell her
I'll ring her back?

1456
01:38:35,846 --> 01:38:38,846
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

1457
01:38:38,886 --> 01:38:40,806
and it's now been about 24 hours...

1458
01:38:40,846 --> 01:38:44,166
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and--

1459
01:38:44,206 --> 01:38:47,806
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

1460
01:38:49,926 --> 01:38:52,606
Martin, hold the fort a second.

1461
01:38:52,646 --> 01:38:54,926
Uh, yes. All right.

1462
01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:02,287
Um, could I just say--

1463
01:39:02,367 --> 01:39:07,207
[ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

1464
01:39:08,407 --> 01:39:10,967
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes.

1465
01:39:11,047 --> 01:39:13,967
[ Chuckles ]

1466
01:39:14,047 --> 01:39:17,767
Um, I've always wondered...

1467
01:39:17,847 --> 01:39:20,927
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

1468
01:39:20,967 --> 01:39:24,487
I can't say that I know Patrick
all that well.

1469
01:39:24,567 --> 01:39:26,728
He wasn't that friendly during filming?

1470
01:39:26,808 --> 01:39:32,008
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

1471
01:39:34,408 --> 01:39:36,648
Oh. Oh, right.

1472
01:39:36,728 --> 01:39:38,568
Sorry.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]

1473
01:39:40,168 --> 01:39:43,288
Always been a bit of an ass.
[ Chuckling ]

1474
01:39:43,368 --> 01:39:46,208
Um, anyway-- Um--

1475
01:39:46,248 --> 01:39:48,128
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1476
01:39:48,168 --> 01:39:50,528
I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

1477
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:54,049
And Demi's, of course.

1478
01:39:56,489 --> 01:39:58,609
Sorry.

1479
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:00,449
That's fine.

1480
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:04,169
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

1481
01:40:06,369 --> 01:40:09,409
Anna, look, um--

1482
01:40:09,449 --> 01:40:13,089
I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

1483
01:40:13,169 --> 01:40:16,889
not often in and out of love.

1484
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,009
But, uh--

1485
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:25,650
Can I just say no to your...

1486
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:29,890
kind request and, uh, leave it at that?

1487
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:36,330
Yes.

1488
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:39,810
Fine. Of course. I--

1489
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:41,850
Of course.

1490
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:46,410
I'll just be going, then.
It was nice to see you.

1491
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:49,290
The thing is,

1492
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:52,691
with you I'm in real... danger.

1493
01:40:52,771 --> 01:40:55,811
It seems like a... perfect situation,

1494
01:40:55,891 --> 01:40:59,211
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

1495
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:03,651
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not...

1496
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:06,411
recover, uh, if I was...

1497
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:10,371
once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

1498
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:15,411
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

1499
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:18,691
You'd go and I'd be, uh,

1500
01:41:18,771 --> 01:41:21,292
well, buggered, basically.

1501
01:41:22,732 --> 01:41:25,572
That really is a real no, isn't it?

1502
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:30,132
I live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.

1503
01:41:30,212 --> 01:41:32,052
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

1504
01:41:32,132 --> 01:41:35,692
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

1505
01:41:35,772 --> 01:41:37,612
Fine.

1506
01:41:39,412 --> 01:41:43,572
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

1507
01:41:47,132 --> 01:41:50,533
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know?

1508
01:41:54,173 --> 01:41:57,653
And don't forget I'm--

1509
01:41:57,733 --> 01:42:01,373
I'm also just a girl...

1510
01:42:01,453 --> 01:42:05,413
standing in front of a boy...

1511
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:07,973
asking him to love her.

1512
01:42:18,414 --> 01:42:20,254
Good-bye.

1513
01:42:41,694 --> 01:42:44,054
So what do you think?
Good move?

1514
01:42:44,094 --> 01:42:46,295
[ Honey ]
Yeah, good move.

1515
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:48,975
I mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

1516
01:42:49,015 --> 01:42:50,895
I saw her taking her trousers down,

1517
01:42:50,935 --> 01:42:53,695
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

1518
01:42:53,775 --> 01:42:56,495
Good decision, yeah.

1519
01:42:56,535 --> 01:42:58,895
All actresses are as mad as snakes.

1520
01:42:58,935 --> 01:43:01,895
- Tones, what do you reckon?
- Never met her, never want to.

1521
01:43:01,975 --> 01:43:05,535
- Brilliant. Max?
- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

1522
01:43:05,615 --> 01:43:08,215
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

1523
01:43:09,495 --> 01:43:11,895
[ Panting ]
I was called and I came. What's up?

1524
01:43:11,975 --> 01:43:14,056
William's just turned down Anna Scott.

1525
01:43:15,616 --> 01:43:18,416
You daft prick.

1526
01:43:18,456 --> 01:43:21,736
No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

1527
01:43:24,936 --> 01:43:28,536
That painting
isn't the original, is it?

1528
01:43:28,616 --> 01:43:31,096
Um, you know,
I think it might be, yeah.

1529
01:43:33,896 --> 01:43:36,176
But she said
she wanted to go out with you.

1530
01:43:38,616 --> 01:43:41,416
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice.

1531
01:43:42,937 --> 01:43:45,897
What?

1532
01:43:45,977 --> 01:43:48,017
Well, you know,

1533
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:52,057
anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it?

1534
01:43:57,617 --> 01:44:00,177
It was...

1535
01:44:00,257 --> 01:44:02,457
sort of... sweet, actually.

1536
01:44:02,497 --> 01:44:05,337
Um, I mean,
I know she's an actress and all that...

1537
01:44:05,377 --> 01:44:11,058
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

1538
