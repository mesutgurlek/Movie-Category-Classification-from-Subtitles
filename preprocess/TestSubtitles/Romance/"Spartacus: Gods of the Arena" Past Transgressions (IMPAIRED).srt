1
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,439
Spartacus:
There is but one path...

2
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:23,793
we kill them all.

3
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:26,796
(screaming)

4
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:28,339
(woman screaming)

5
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:30,508
(men grunting)

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,681
I am your dominus!

7
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:39,100
I will have your fucking hearts!

8
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:40,935
Quintus.

9
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,398
Lucretia.

10
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,111
What would you do

11
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:53,781
to hold your wife again,

12
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:58,161
to feel the warmth of her skin,

13
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:00,496
the taste of her lips?

14
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:03,791
How many men would you kill?

15
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,004
Quintus: I left the deed
in Barca's hands.

16
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:10,214
Now you're free.

17
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:13,134
Quintus: We are betrayed by
the Beast of fucking Carthage.

18
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:19,223
You are beneath me.

19
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,101
Lucretia:
He is a magistrate.

20
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:25,563
Solonius: One can never know
who is plotting violence, can one?

21
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,316
Quintus: Or when they may
commit the act.

22
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:34,489
Your wife... she moves ever closer
even as we speak.

23
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:38,159
My word is kept.
They're reunited.

24
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:46,042
Lucretia: You will become
the greatest lanista in the Republic.

25
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:51,255
Quintus: Under such a title
we will climb beyond our station,

26
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,716
beyond Capua,

27
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:57,929
perhaps to the very steps
of the Senate itself.

28
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:01,641
(crowd shouting)

29
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:15,947
The fights are particularly
entertaining today.

30
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,366
You'd enjoy them more
viewed from the pulvenus.

31
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,287
Fucking shit-eater.

32
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:25,623
Let Vettius preen like a woman.

33
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,252
You'll school him in the ways of men
when Gannicus takes to the sands.

34
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,254
Absent Tullius and the magistrate
to bear witness,

35
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,506
what's the fucking purpose?

36
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:35,800
One man in today's games,
one only,

37
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,844
and the seats needing to impress
stand empty

38
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,429
as Vettius' fucking head.

39
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:47,979
Get up!
(shouts)

40
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,898
Get up!

41
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,033
Solonius, what news?

42
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:04,036
Tullius and the magistrate were delayed
with pressing business,

43
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:05,204
but arrive shortly,

44
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:08,291
as long as this current match
continues.

45
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,671
No. Get up!

46
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,256
Capua!

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,801
Get up, get up, you fuck.

48
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:23,389
(people shouting)

49
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,149
Vettius begins the match
without proper introduction.

50
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:34,525
- Proper?
- Capua!

51
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:37,028
Quintus: Vettius and the word
are of distant relations.

52
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:39,488
I, for one, am grateful
to be spared his oratory.

53
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:42,283
The man's voice
causes skull to ache.

54
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:44,911
Arghh!

55
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:46,412
Gannicus takes position.

56
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:55,254
(crowd cheering)

57
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,228
Now there's a fucking gladiator!

58
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,462
Man:
Tear his fucking face off!

59
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:42,885
Man #2:
Fucking kill him!

60
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,262
Begin.

61
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:54,188
(Gannicus laughing)

62
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,235
(laughing)

63
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,004
Is your man
ever of a serious note?

64
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:21,382
He can strip naked and fight
with his cock, as long as he wins.

65
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,385
Gannicus, I love you!

66
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:28,723
(gladiator yelling)

67
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,979
(laughing)

68
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:36,522
(yelling)

69
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,240
What's he doing, Quintus?

70
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,095
Fucking kill him!

71
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,350
No. Wait for the magistrate.

72
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:55,851
Kill kill kill!

73
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:00,231
Gannicus, do not kill him!

74
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,235
Do not kill him yet!

75
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,012
Oh, now they arrive.

76
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,558
A victory regardless.

77
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:37,601
Won in dewy morn.

78
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,812
None of the important
matches happen

79
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,939
till after the midday sun
has passed.

80
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:45,359
Consider yourself fortunate
to have a man in the games at all.

81
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:48,737
Good Solonius stands
with empty hands.

82
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,286
Come then, let us see them
filled with drink.

83
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,788
Tell Doctore to see Gannicus
back to the ludus

84
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,958
and have him properly
rewarded for his showing.

85
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,835
Lucretia: Can we not stay
for the rest of the games?

86
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:04,795
Vettius' men command
the prominent matches.

87
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,006
He has more than enough eyes
to watch him stroke his cock.

88
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,175
I would not add ours
to the sight.

89
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:13,095
Gannicus:
Now you want me, Capua.

90
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:15,431
(Gannicus laughing)

91
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,100
Doctore.

92
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,939
Dominus orders Gannicus
returned to the ludus,

93
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,691
and seen to reward.

94
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,279
Perhaps one day
the pretty little bitch

95
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:32,072
will fight later
in the afternoon,

96
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,991
with the rest of the men.

97
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,870
You and your tiny cock
best pray that day never come.

98
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,498
(kisses)

99
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:42,166
(grunts, spits)

100
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,835
Save blood for the fucking
sands, Gannicus.

101
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:47,630
What seized fucking brain,

102
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,840
releasing your swords
in the arena?

103
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,844
I could have killed the man
absent an arm and both fucking legs.

104
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,930
Hubris...

105
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:57,806
a fine quality

106
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:01,101
often possessed by cunts
who perish from it.

107
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,187
(screaming)

108
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,231
Did you catch
the manner of his eye

109
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:07,107
as he gazed down
from the pulvenus?

110
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,610
Fucking Vettius...

111
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:11,445
barely free
of his mother's tit,

112
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:14,823
yet he carries himself above lanistas
of more deserving years.

113
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,034
Lucretia: Youth often imagines itself
swollen beyond worth.

114
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,245
Solonius: Time will cure him
of the condition,

115
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:21,163
as it does
all foolish young men.

116
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:23,290
Time is what he holds
in abundance.

117
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,626
The new arena will be finished
in but a handful of months.

118
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:27,628
If we are excluded
from the opening games...

119
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:30,130
Vettius is but shit
from a shit town.

120
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:32,508
How can Tullius
and the magistrate

121
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,010
favor a boy from Nola
over one of Capua's own sons?

122
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:36,428
Well, how do they do it now?

123
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:38,722
We must prove ourselves
in the more important bouts

124
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,183
in the old arena
and secure position.

125
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:43,727
To fight later in the day,
we must first distinguish ourselves

126
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:46,146
against Vettius' men.
Yet Vettius' men only fight...

127
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:47,523
Together:
Later in the day.

128
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,233
A vexing conundrum.

129
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,609
Lucretia?

130
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:53,362
- Gaia. Gaia.
- (laughing)

131
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,990
Will you come to Capua
without telling me?

132
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,200
I have only
this moment returned,

133
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,119
with intentions
of seeking you out.

134
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,787
Do you travel
with your husband?

135
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:05,207
He takes to road no more,

136
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,251
not in this life at least.

137
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:08,794
Apologies.

138
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:11,672
None required.
It was his time.

139
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:15,301
Are you occupied?

140
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,053
I'm fit to bursting
with stories of my adventures.

141
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:20,014
Quintus?

142
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,266
What man dares stand
between women and gossip?

143
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:25,352
You must tell me everything.
Secret no detail.

144
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,897
Removed from the ears of men,
my lips willingly part.

145
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:31,483
Gaia returns unencumbered

146
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,236
and in enticing form.

147
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:38,115
Huh, that woman is
a force of fucking nature,

148
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:41,201
one that has blown many
an unsuspecting man to his ruin.

149
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,995
You require someone
more refined

150
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:46,040
to grace arm
as our fortunes rise.

151
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:50,377
Have eyes ever beheld
such a marvel?

152
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:54,757
A sight to put the Circus Maximus
in Rome to bitter shame.

153
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,508
We will be the ones shamed

154
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:59,845
if grand ceremony passes
absent our gladiators.

155
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:02,765
We must force advantage
before opportunity slips from grasp.

156
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,600
No, we must be patient.

157
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:07,186
Your father would venture forth
with respect and caution.

158
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,313
Then a blessing
he is not present.

159
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:12,691
Perhaps we should send word
to him in Sicilia, petition advice?

160
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,818
I can already divine
the content of his reply,

161
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,905
which is why he never rose
above his humble station.

162
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:20,741
Fuck patience.

163
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,910
Look to Tullius for the way.

164
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,828
He seizes opportunity
by the balls

165
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:27,289
while lesser men
are left holding cock.

166
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,500
A simple merchant,

167
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:32,294
yet he gives honored counsel
to the magistrate

168
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:34,588
and all the rest of the noble
shit-eaters of Capua.

169
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:38,008
Truth told,
yet at excessive volume.

170
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:40,219
I would shout his praise
to the fucking heavens.

171
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,887
His hands shaped events

172
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:44,056
resulting in the erection
of the new arena.

173
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:46,141
He supplies slaves

174
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,894
from the farthest reaches of
the Republic to speed its completion.

175
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:51,271
Through the ambitions
of Tullius,

176
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,399
Capua is elevated...

177
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,985
a lesson to be studied
and reproduced in kind.

178
00:11:57,153 --> 00:12:01,323
Is that all?
A simple task then, Batiatus.

179
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,202
- Slave: Dominus.
- Between us,

180
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,663
we have the greatest
gladiators in Capua...

181
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:11,250
Barca, Acadeus, Gannicus...

182
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,669
men forged into something
beyond their worth,

183
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:16,839
beyond anything that smug
little piss Vettius

184
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,674
could ever hope to offer.

185
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,509
(men grunting)

186
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:24,972
Perhaps Tullius
should not have strayed

187
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,307
so far abroad
in acquiring his slaves.

188
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:28,475
Man: What's he doing?

189
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:31,186
Pick him up.

190
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,606
Crixus,

191
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,775
you know the rules...

192
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:39,403
no one breaks the line.

193
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:40,571
Quintus: Hold.

194
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,531
Is this one
of good Tullius's slaves?

195
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:43,949
It is.

196
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:45,868
- I would make purchase.
- Purchase?

197
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:49,037
- What's the man's worth?
- He is not for sale.

198
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:50,748
50 denarii.

199
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,375
- What are you doing?
- Seizing balls.

200
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:54,752
The man is barely worth 10.

201
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,421
Why would you pay
such a sum for a shit Gaul?

202
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:58,839
Shit?

203
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,716
Do you not see
the promise in his eyes,

204
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:03,260
the spark smoldering
in his breast?

205
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,637
I would give it tender,
to ignite in the arena.

206
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:09,349
50.

207
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,518
Add another five
to weight your own purse.

208
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:14,271
Lend me 20 denarii.

209
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,732
You pay too much for the man.

210
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,317
Quintus:
The man is nothing.

211
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:21,069
I pay to gain favor
with Tullius.

212
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,491
A waste of coin.

213
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:28,619
The shit fuck
will never be a gladiator.

214
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,372
Quintus: Even the lowest man
can rise beyond the heavens,

215
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,584
if tempted
with the proper reward.

216
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,315
(grunting)

217
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:10,804
(women laughing)

218
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:16,476
He was well satisfied?

219
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,186
Very well.

220
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,230
Dominus will be pleased.

221
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,274
Not as much as I am.

222
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:25,402
When are you not so,
especially with yourself?

223
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,112
It is a curse,

224
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,323
being blessed
with so much to offer.

225
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,159
And so few interested
in sharing it.

226
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,453
(laughs)

227
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,918
See yourselves well scrubbed.

228
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:43,045
I would not
have you smell of goat.

229
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,005
Goat?

230
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,590
A dead one.

231
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:50,552
(laughs)
The smell of victory, brother.

232
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,887
Well-earned.

233
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:53,555
The men all speak
of your triumph.

234
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:56,308
As they will of yours,
when you return to the arena.

235
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:59,186
The crowd will come
in great geysers,

236
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:02,230
drenching the gods
gathered to witness

237
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:04,900
Oenomaus once more
upon the sands.

238
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:07,903
I would have words
with my wife,

239
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:11,114
absent your cock,
which has escaped you.

240
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:15,369
It will be missed.

241
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,290
Has Dominus spoken
of my return?

242
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,084
I have not heard it.

243
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,294
More than a year has passed
since I faced Theokoles.

244
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,171
Perhaps Dominus
does not intend...

245
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,048
You were the only one
to ever stand

246
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:29,883
against the Shadow of Death
and live.

247
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:32,135
Batiatus would be a fool
to keep you from the arena.

248
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:34,221
Or I am the fool

249
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,181
for ever dreaming
of such a thing.

250
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:39,142
You are many things.
Foolish is not among them.

251
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,436
Batiatus waits
but for the perfect day

252
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:43,730
for his champion
to retake glory.

253
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:57,452
Is it true that his thing is
as large as a horse's?

254
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,912
Diona!

255
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,163
Are you not curious?

256
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,207
Is Gannicus really that big?

257
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,959
(laughing)

258
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,711
Where is Domina?

259
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:07,754
In the triclinium with her guest.

260
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:10,048
Diona, see the girls bathed.

261
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:11,591
Yes, Melitta.

262
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:18,181
It is exciting
speaking of such things, is it not?

263
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,143
I was of a similar age
not so long ago.

264
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,895
I know the giddy enticement
of the subject.

265
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:27,149
Yet you and Diona
should turn thought from it.

266
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:30,152
Soon enough your flowers
will be plucked.

267
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,446
Hastening the moment
will only result

268
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:34,781
in bruising of the petals.

269
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,950
Yes, Melitta.

270
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,495
And in regards to Gannicus,

271
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,789
I've seen bigger.

272
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,170
Well, you don't seem overly
distraught at his passing.

273
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,089
How would you present,

274
00:17:51,257 --> 00:17:54,092
after years enduring
withered flesh groping at you?

275
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,054
But when you left Capua
I thought you madly in love.

276
00:17:57,221 --> 00:18:00,348
I was... with his purse.

277
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:05,020
Sadly his fortunes went dry
towards the end.

278
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:09,316
And did you aid
in their evaporation?

279
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:11,318
What can I say?

280
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:13,779
I am the glorious sun...

281
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:17,532
returned to bless loving rays

282
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,202
upon favored friend.

283
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:23,288
(Lucretia gasps)
Gaia.

284
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:26,333
I have far too many baubles
brought from Rome,

285
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:30,128
along with other pleasures
to be shared.

286
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,308
It suits you.

287
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:46,394
It would dazzle Venus herself.

288
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,983
I fear I have nothing
so exquisite to give in return.

289
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:55,153
Your company
is all I ever desire.

290
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:59,366
And?

291
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:02,577
And I would not refuse the comforts
of a well-appointed villa

292
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,288
until I manage
other arrangements.

293
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:07,541
Involving a ripe purse?

294
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,709
(laughs)

295
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,711
I shall ask Quintus
when he returns.

296
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,672
Ask?

297
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,591
Women do not ask
their husbands for permission.

298
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,553
They maneuver them
to proper answer

299
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,013
before question
is ever put to tongue.

300
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,849
Oh, Gaia.

301
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:26,977
So many years have passed,
and yet nothing has changed.

302
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:32,023
Everything has changed,

303
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,359
and for the better,
by the judging of it.

304
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,113
When last we parted,

305
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:40,407
this house was but a tomb

306
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:44,286
haunted by the living specter
of your husband's father

307
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:47,372
and you,
forced to smile and cater,

308
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,542
bringing him his
honeyed wine every evening.

309
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,294
I thought the crusty
old bastard

310
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:54,212
would never succumb
to the afterlife.

311
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,464
He is not yet so far removed,

312
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:58,758
merely retired to Sicilia
for his health.

313
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:02,304
So he yet controls the ludus?

314
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:05,015
No. My husband does

315
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,058
as his proxy.

316
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,311
Was Gannicus
well-attended then?

317
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:11,313
He was, Domina.

318
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,814
Gannicus?

319
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:15,317
That Celt

320
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:19,321
with the ridiculously
charming smile?

321
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:21,364
He has risen to prominence
in the ludus

322
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,825
ever since Oenomaus was
injured against Theokoles...

323
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,329
In an amazing display
of bravery.

324
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:31,416
Gaia:
Gannicus, Oenomaus...

325
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:35,295
all the hard, rippling men
right beneath our feet.

326
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:38,381
One moistens at the thought.

327
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:41,218
Gaia. They are but slaves.

328
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:42,844
Please.

329
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:46,014
In all the years
you've called this ludus home,

330
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:48,683
you've never once considered
fucking one of them?

331
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:53,688
The very thought of that
turns my stomach.

332
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:56,942
I would never lay with any man
besides my husband,

333
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:00,070
let alone a filthy gladiator.

334
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:05,784
Man: Fucking Gaul.

335
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:09,246
Ashur: Another sacrifice
to the gods of the arena.

336
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:13,041
(speaks foreign language)

337
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,586
Dagan thinks you of a form,

338
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,672
giving odds in your favor.

339
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,632
Odds?

340
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,342
Do you know
where you are, friend?

341
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,303
The House of Batiatus,
trainer of gladiators.

342
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:29,182
Yes. You stand among
his latest recruits.

343
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,309
Bound by pain and blood,

344
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:33,770
together we toil
beneath the cruel sting

345
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:35,605
of Doctore's whip.

346
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,607
There were eight of us
when training began.

347
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,943
Now we're but three.

348
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:41,736
Four.

349
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:50,745
And how are we so blessed
by a swelling number, hmm?

350
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:54,874
By what means do you find yourself
among such storied company?

351
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,252
My own.

352
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,797
I was bound to Appius the slaver,

353
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:04,551
carrying stone toward purpose
at the new arena.

354
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:09,556
I saw Batiatus and knew him
by his words of gladiators.

355
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,810
So I gained his attention.

356
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:16,229
You willingly present ass
for fucking?

357
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:18,356
No.

358
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:20,734
No, young Indus.

359
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:23,361
Do you not see it in his eyes?

360
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:29,242
This is a man with dreams
of blood and glory.

361
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,286
I doubt he'll live to see the test.

362
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:32,871
Test?

363
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,581
Ashur: Our last trial.

364
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:37,083
We must all face
one of the seasoned men

365
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:39,836
and demonstrate to the dominus
what we have learned.

366
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:43,590
Live, and receive
the mark of the Brotherhood,

367
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:46,426
proving yourself
worthy of the arena.

368
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:49,471
I will stand upon its sands.

369
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:51,514
(speaking foreign language)

370
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:58,021
Oh, he longs to call you brother

371
00:22:58,189 --> 00:23:00,315
and join you as gladiator.

372
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,275
(laughs)

373
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:06,446
Tell him the feeling
is well shared.

374
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:11,201
Quintus:
Oh, Jupiter's cock.

375
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,953
50 denarii

376
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:16,206
for a fucking stone hauler.

377
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:18,249
Lucretia:
Coin well spent.

378
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:21,669
Was it?

379
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:23,922
Word surely has reached
Tullius's ear,

380
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,840
yet none of gratitude return.

381
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:28,635
50 denarii.

382
00:23:28,803 --> 00:23:30,470
Solonius was right.

383
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:32,722
I should temper patience
as my father would.

384
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,017
You're not your father,

385
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:38,561
nor would I have it so.

386
00:23:40,398 --> 00:23:43,316
Perhaps tomorrow you will find
yourself in the market,

387
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,235
where, you have
often mentioned,

388
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,362
Tullius frequents
upon a certain hour

389
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,489
overseeing his concerns.

390
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:51,616
A chance encounter
to gauge reaction?

391
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:54,327
Lucretia:
Certain to be favorable,

392
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,997
as I know your reply
to my request will be.

393
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,334
Give it voice
and see it considered.

394
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:05,046
I would have Gaia
remain with us,

395
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:06,506
just for a few days,

396
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:08,675
until she can manage
other arrangements.

397
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:10,301
The request does not surprise.

398
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:12,720
Is that a yes?

399
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:15,765
Ask for the moon and I would
wrest it from the heavens.

400
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:18,309
Gaia will be so pleased
at your answer.

401
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:23,314
Let her keep company
with her wine a moment longer.

402
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:29,946
Has a wife ever had
such a husband?

403
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:32,240
He but honors her

404
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:35,743
and the gods
for guiding her to his arms.

405
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:20,705
(men grunting)

406
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:36,888
(laughs)

407
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:39,557
Crixus, you lower your shield
when you thrust.

408
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:43,603
See it raised, or your fucking
brains on the sand.

409
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:45,355
Yes, Doctore.

410
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:48,608
A lucky blow.

411
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:51,903
A blow well-struck.
I will not make the same mistake.

412
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,244
Ha ha! Good.

413
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:01,037
Again.

414
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:09,671
Doctore.

415
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:12,257
I would work the palus
in the shade.

416
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:17,470
I would not let gaze linger.

417
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,889
Gannicus is a fucking fool,
yet one of deadly skill.

418
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:23,685
He's often rewarded
for his victories with wine and cunt.

419
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:25,436
Gain Dominus's favor,

420
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,564
and such delights
could be yours.

421
00:26:31,402 --> 00:26:34,320
Drink and women
are not my concern.

422
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:36,656
Ah, more for me then.

423
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:40,868
Fucking recruits...

424
00:26:41,036 --> 00:26:43,955
smaller and smaller each year.

425
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,960
Apologies.

426
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,596
Oenomaus,

427
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:02,807
you return to form.

428
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:05,184
Pair with Crixus
and bring him up to speed.

429
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:09,105
Dominus.

430
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:23,286
Gratitude for your instructions.

431
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:28,666
Lesson one...

432
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,169
never drop your fucking guard.

433
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,257
Do you lay eyes?

434
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,176
No. Perhaps Tullius
did not come today.

435
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:39,427
He always arrives,

436
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:41,346
and seldom departs
before noonday sun.

437
00:27:41,513 --> 00:27:44,015
Are you his shadow now,
adhered to each footstep?

438
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:46,309
I but study my subject,
as any proper student would

439
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:48,561
in the pursuit of knowledge.

440
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,605
Tullius' man.

441
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:53,983
I seek your master... good Tullius.
Would he be within?

442
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:56,402
Yeah.

443
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,237
I wish to express
my gratitude

444
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:00,490
for allowing me to purchase
his slave Crixus.

445
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:04,077
The Gaul shows great promise
towards the arena.

446
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:08,247
Perhaps you could pass
word of my presence.

447
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:15,254
You owe me a few of those,
if you recall.

448
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:18,466
A costly enterprise
for us both.

449
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:20,426
That one prays will turn profit.

450
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:22,887
(pigs squealing,
sheep bleating)

451
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:25,139
Good Batiatus.

452
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,141
The gods answer.

453
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:30,770
In mocking tone.

454
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:32,855
Tullius: I hoped for occasion
to give gratitude

455
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,899
for relieving me
of that troublesome Gaul.

456
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,275
Think nothing of it...

457
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,611
a gesture of respect
for a man deserving of it.

458
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:40,446
Received with all intentions.

459
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:42,824
Yet I fear you have overpaid.

460
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:46,285
A common mistake for those
with no head towards business.

461
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:51,207
50 denarii, minus the 10
of the Gaul's actual worth.

462
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,542
Well...

463
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,712
I do not ask for its return.
Fair bargain was struck.

464
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:58,005
Fair?
A clumsy maneuver

465
00:28:58,173 --> 00:28:59,841
to gain position
for your ill-trained men.

466
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:01,884
- Vettius.
- Ill-trained?

467
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:04,554
Any one of my men could
best yours fucking blindfolded,

468
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:06,222
you pissy little shit.

469
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,433
- Listen how the rooster crows.
- Let us calm ourselves.

470
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,560
You doubt my words?
Test them.

471
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:13,646
Request the match
in the next month's games.

472
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:16,566
Why delay?
Let us see it here in the morning,

473
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,818
the people to judge
who holds the better man.

474
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:21,279
In the market?
Surely the magistrate

475
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,448
would not approve
such disruption.

476
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:25,575
Good Tullius has his ear.

477
00:29:25,743 --> 00:29:27,577
The magistrate could be
swayed to allow it,

478
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:29,495
if that is what you wish.

479
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:32,623
It is, and long past due.

480
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,917
Tomorrow then.

481
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:38,629
A friendly rivalry
well-settled.

482
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,675
You press beyond advantage.

483
00:29:42,843 --> 00:29:46,345
No, I fucking press towards it.

484
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,265
You should have seen
young Vettius,

485
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,768
so easily goaded
into making challenge,

486
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:53,603
the fucking child.

487
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:56,522
All men are reduced in years
when faced with superior mind.

488
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,191
Superior in all accounting...

489
00:29:58,358 --> 00:29:59,859
a fact Tullius
and the rest of the city

490
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:01,444
will bear witness to
in the marketplace.

491
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:03,696
Sleep will come
with difficulty tonight.

492
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:06,199
It's been ages
since I've seen a decent match

493
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:08,868
or Tullius.
In the blush of youth,

494
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:11,204
he was forever attempting
to slip beneath my robes.

495
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:14,040
Ha! You should have
fucking let him.

496
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,083
Tullius has grown
to be a man of worth,

497
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:19,128
one to be emulated and admired.

498
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:21,714
And who will you choose
to impress him?

499
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:24,675
Vettius's foolishness
presents rare opportunity.

500
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:28,679
The question begs
careful consideration.

501
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,563
I have news to lift the heart.

502
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:39,690
Vettius has made challenge.

503
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:43,569
- The coward finds his cock.
- And I would see it shriveled.

504
00:30:43,737 --> 00:30:46,280
My best man is to meet his dog
in the marketplace come morning.

505
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:47,907
The market?

506
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:49,742
Eh, detail of no consequence.

507
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,577
My question to you is plain...

508
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:54,497
is our man prepared
for such a vital match?

509
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,042
Yes, Dominus.

510
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,753
I long to honor
this house once again.

511
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,466
I fear you have
mistaken intentions.

512
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:07,635
I speak of Gannicus.

513
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,766
Gannicus?

514
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:18,646
The question is better put
to Doctore.

515
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,233
Leave.

516
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:27,572
His counsel is always valued,

517
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:30,700
yet he is my father's man,

518
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:32,743
his judgment clouded

519
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,787
through a haze
of outdated traditions.

520
00:31:34,955 --> 00:31:37,790
I seek a more visceral
assessment.

521
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,084
You and I practically
grew up together in this ludus.

522
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:44,380
You have witnessed the rise
and fall of a dozen champions.

523
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:48,676
What now does your gut
tell you of Gannicus?

524
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:51,512
Is he worthy of the mantle?

525
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:55,641
I believe it so.

526
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,729
He must truly be,
for you to offer support

527
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:02,815
despite your own desires.

528
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:06,235
I would not give false tongue
to gain advantage.

529
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:10,156
There are few
that would stand with you so.

530
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:12,366
Your wife's weekly visit...
two nights hence?

531
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,201
Yes, Dominus.

532
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:16,078
I would see her to your bed
tonight as well

533
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:18,664
in gratitude
for honest thoughts.

534
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:21,083
Dominus.

535
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:29,383
Oenomaus: Do the gods
ever answer your prayers?

536
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:31,969
They often reveal
their leanings,

537
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:34,931
though not in words...
much like my husband.

538
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,686
Dominus summoned me
to ask of Gannicus.

539
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:42,980
Gannicus?

540
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,733
He has chosen him
as champion.

541
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:50,404
He is to face Vettius's man
in the marketplace tomorrow.

542
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:53,115
And this is why you sulk?

543
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:54,867
The streets are no place

544
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:57,828
for the mighty Oenomaus
to make his return.

545
00:32:57,996 --> 00:33:00,206
The arena will be home
to your triumphs

546
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:02,041
when the time comes.

547
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:05,211
And I will be there
to witness it.

548
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,836
I will dream of your touch.

549
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:50,631
As I dream of yours every night.

550
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:05,938
Gannicus: ? Blood rains down
from an angry sky ?

551
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:10,234
? My cock rages on,
my cock rages on ?

552
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:14,196
? Blood rains down
from an angry sky ?

553
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:18,075
? My cock rages on,
my cock rages on. ?

554
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:19,785
Gannicus.

555
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:23,122
Brother. Brother,
come drink, join me.

556
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,833
Lower voice.
If the guards were to hear you...

557
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,836
The guards have already passed
and were well plied with wine

558
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:31,338
to keep nose
from fucking business.

559
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,758
Tomorrow you fight
for the honor of this ludus.

560
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:35,509
Now is not the time for drink.

561
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:38,262
Every night is a time for drink,

562
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,891
for the morning sun
may greet you

563
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,018
with your last

564
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,645
fucking day.

565
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:49,065
(laughing)

566
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,528
Fall to your bed,

567
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:57,114
or risk steeper plummet
against Vettius's man.

568
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:59,909
Words of wisdom
well-received,

569
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:02,244
well... well-received.

570
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,916
Oenomaus.

571
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:12,129
It should be you tomorrow.

572
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:25,518
Where is good Vettius?

573
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:26,894
Is he among you?

574
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:28,687
Or did he come to his sense

575
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:31,440
and remain within the warm safety
of his bed?

576
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:33,651
Ah, there he stands,

577
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:35,736
fresh and young
as a newborn calf.

578
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:38,197
The fool at last shows himself.

579
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:39,740
Batiatus.

580
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:42,076
We had begun to fret
on your arrival,

581
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:45,287
although I see you arrive
with unexpected gift.

582
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:48,916
It has been too long, Gaia.

583
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:50,209
And grows longer still.

584
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:51,961
Apologies for my delay.

585
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:55,798
I had much difficulty
in the choosing of a man...

586
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:58,050
an imposing task,

587
00:35:58,218 --> 00:36:00,052
when each among my stable
stands a titan.

588
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,847
Perhaps young Vettius

589
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:05,182
should have taken more time
with the choosing of his own.

590
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,811
Words fall from your mouth
as shit from ass.

591
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:12,690
Let us not become mired
in base exchange.

592
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,026
We are gathered
this glorious day

593
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:18,988
to witness honorable contest

594
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:22,158
between respected rivals.

595
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:24,076
Clear space!

596
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:29,540
The years have favored Tullius.

597
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:31,584
And his purse.

598
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:34,920
A brawl in the streets?
Where is the honor in such a thing?

599
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:38,174
Fuck honor.
This is business.

600
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:41,343
Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus...

601
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:43,721
The event turns
larger than expected.

602
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:46,515
- Your mad schemes may yet bear fruit.
- For allowing such thrilling event...

603
00:36:46,683 --> 00:36:48,559
Enough for both of us
to feast upon.

604
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:51,228
...in the streets
of the great city of Capua!

605
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:57,109
Batiatus, present your man.

606
00:36:57,277 --> 00:37:00,487
In honor of the magistrate,

607
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,740
esteemed Tullius

608
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:05,034
and the good people of Capua,

609
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,953
I give you the fiercest Celt

610
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:10,956
ever to take up arms
in the arena,

611
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:14,043
slayer of beasts,

612
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:16,837
conqueror of giants.

613
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:19,340
Behold Gannicus,

614
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:22,176
Champion of
the House of Batiatus!

615
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:24,345
Arghh!

616
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:32,144
A fine choice.

617
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:35,064
Vettius, present your man.

618
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:37,900
I have no tongue
for overripe embellishment,

619
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:39,818
nor is it required.

620
00:37:39,986 --> 00:37:42,112
Otho, stand forth.

621
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:46,033
(roars)

622
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:51,121
Your day finally comes.

623
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:52,957
And yours ends.

624
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:56,961
Gratitude to Batiatus and Vettius.

625
00:37:57,128 --> 00:38:01,548
Now let us judge
who stands the better house.

626
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,223
Apologies, Magistrate.

627
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:13,018
There appears to be
something missing.

628
00:38:14,312 --> 00:38:16,647
Where is your man's blindfold?

629
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:18,524
(crowd muttering)

630
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,693
Blindfold? What the fuck?

631
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,114
That was your boast,
was it not...

632
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:31,078
that your gladiator could best
any of my men

633
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:33,205
absent sight?

634
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:40,587
You did voice such challenge.

635
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:43,424
A simple figure of speech,
not meant to be...

636
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:44,883
good Tullius...

637
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:47,094
If Batiatus does not wish
to honor terms,

638
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:51,640
he should remove himself
with tail between legs.

639
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,029
Doctore.

640
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:08,574
Come.

641
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:12,494
The task should not be
that difficult.

642
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:15,998
I need only direct my blades
towards the smell of shit.

643
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:20,586
Gannicus, ever the fool.

644
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:30,846
Are you going to
allow this, Quintus?

645
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:33,307
The choice has been
removed from my hands.

646
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,146
Begin.

647
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,315
(yelling)

648
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,296
Yes!

649
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:14,973
How thrilling.

650
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:17,017
I have never seen
such a thing.

651
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:18,268
For good reason.

652
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,300
A noble attempt.

653
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:52,636
To be remembered
only in its failing.

654
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:27,337
Get up!

655
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:34,136
Yes.

656
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,513
Get up.

657
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:47,524
Yes!

658
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,949
Fucking kill him!

659
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,704
Yes!

660
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:19,097
Have you ever
fucking seen the like?

661
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:25,062
Perhaps good Vettius should pit
a man less prone to death

662
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,272
against the mighty Gannicus.

663
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,149
An impressive display,
Batiatus,

664
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:30,692
one not soon forgotten.

665
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:34,613
Gannicus is truly a wonder.

666
00:42:34,781 --> 00:42:37,741
One deserving more prominent
position in the games.

667
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:39,993
You gaze upon
my very thoughts.

668
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,204
Commitments beckon.

669
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:44,540
Join me at Nestor's shop
after the market closes

670
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:46,917
and we shall discuss
your man at length.

671
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:07,312
Only mad Gannicus could
win contest fucking blindfolded.

672
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,856
Barca could do the same.

673
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:13,110
And I would kill you
for being a fool.

674
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:15,279
Oenomaus:
Auctus speaks truth.

675
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:19,700
Facing Vettius's man absent sight
was beyond foolish.

676
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:23,787
The gods must have taken pity
on your addled brain.

677
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:26,456
The gods had naught
to do with it.

678
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:30,210
Otho... he grunts like a stuck pig
before each attack.

679
00:43:30,378 --> 00:43:33,380
His squeals...
they gave away position.

680
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:34,840
(laughing)

681
00:43:35,008 --> 00:43:36,633
Your victory lifts the heart.

682
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:40,554
You will not be rid
of Gannicus so easily, brother.

683
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:46,476
Dominus... he rewards me
with all the wine that I can drink.

684
00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:49,187
And I would share it
with my brothers.

685
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:51,732
(cheering)

686
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:53,483
Those that bear the mark.

687
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:55,569
(men laughing)

688
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:58,947
One day.

689
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:04,911
Gannicus' victory
forges path to greater glory.

690
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,080
With Tullius's support,

691
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,791
we can finally gain
proper position in games.

692
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:12,502
Lucretia: Maybe a place in the opening
ceremony of the new arena.

693
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,005
After such a magnificent showing,
I have no doubt

694
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:17,716
Gannicus will be offered
a place in the primus.

695
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,426
Primus?

696
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,136
Yeah.

697
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:23,930
I favor the fucking sound
of that.

698
00:44:25,642 --> 00:44:27,100
Expect late return.

699
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:29,519
I would seek out
Solonius afterwards

700
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:32,606
to discuss extending advantage
to his house as well.

701
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,777
Send Tullius my regards

702
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:40,155
and gauge his response
in remembering me.

703
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:42,908
(laughs)
How could he fucking forget you?

704
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:50,999
It staggers mind...
the change in him.

705
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:52,626
Change?

706
00:44:52,794 --> 00:44:54,002
You know my meaning.

707
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,589
He always seemed
so demure and cowed.

708
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,508
And now he
positively burns.

709
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:02,344
He has always done so.

710
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:05,681
His light was merely muted
by the shadow of his father.

711
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:09,059
The man could turn day to night
with disapproving frown.

712
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:14,564
He never cared much for me

713
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:18,944
or, I suspect, anything
that smacked of enjoyment.

714
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,615
And what might this be?

715
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:25,659
More gifts from Rome.

716
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,496
The finest opium,

717
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:32,040
carried from Cyprus.

718
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:38,380
I have not partaken
in many years.

719
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:40,841
My husband...

720
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:43,218
Will be gone
most of the night.

721
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,476
Good Batiatus.

722
00:45:51,644 --> 00:45:54,813
Word of Gannicus's victory
has spread throughout the city.

723
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:58,150
His name, and yours,
fall from every mouth.

724
00:45:58,317 --> 00:46:01,778
May they always find
the taste pleasing.

725
00:46:01,946 --> 00:46:04,573
Everyone clamors
to see your man again,

726
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:06,658
with exception of poor Vettius.

727
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:08,452
He is fit for seizure
from the ordeal.

728
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:10,787
Unfortunate that he
could not provide

729
00:46:10,955 --> 00:46:12,998
a more worthy opponent.

730
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,250
His stock is well known
to be of inferior quality,

731
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:17,002
as is the boy himself.

732
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,920
The manner in which
he tends the ludus...

733
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:21,590
the child has no fucking
talent for it.

734
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:25,552
You surprise me, Batiatus.

735
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,471
Your disposition
towards business

736
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:30,307
is much more aggressive
than your father's.

737
00:46:30,475 --> 00:46:33,393
We are of diverging
temperament

738
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,395
and desires.

739
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:38,815
How does he fare in Sicilia?

740
00:46:38,983 --> 00:46:42,611
The clime is more agreeable
to various conditions

741
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:45,071
brought about
by the passing of the years.

742
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,450
How did the magistrate take
to Gannicus' display?

743
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:52,329
Ignited by it,
as was the crowd.

744
00:46:52,497 --> 00:46:56,082
He even broached subject
of retaining the man

745
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,667
for the opening games
of the new arena.

746
00:46:57,835 --> 00:47:02,589
Gannicus in the opening games?

747
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:04,591
If you could aid
in such a thing,

748
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:06,802
I would forever be
in your debt.

749
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:09,596
It merely requires a word
in the proper ear.

750
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:12,015
All that remains
is to agree upon a price.

751
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:14,726
Well, of course

752
00:47:14,894 --> 00:47:16,603
I would be happy
to see coin to your hand

753
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:18,772
in exchange for assistance.

754
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,775
What sum
did you have in mind?

755
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:24,653
(laughs)

756
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,738
You misunderstand, Batiatus.

757
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:28,740
I do not offer
to broker arrangement.

758
00:47:28,908 --> 00:47:31,409
I offer to purchase your man.

759
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:35,455
Purchase?

760
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:39,042
But why would you want a gladiator?
You're not a lanista.

761
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,628
Jupiter's cock, no.

762
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,755
Yet I have many
vested interests

763
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:45,841
in shipping,
goods and services,

764
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:47,884
this very shop

765
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:51,555
and young Vettius's ludus.

766
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:58,687
Vettius:
Look at the little fuck now,

767
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:00,188
about to shit himself.

768
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:01,898
Tullius:
Still your tongue.

769
00:48:02,066 --> 00:48:04,150
The grown-ups are talking.

770
00:48:06,988 --> 00:48:09,447
200 denarii...

771
00:48:09,615 --> 00:48:11,241
a generous offer

772
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:14,119
in respect of your father.

773
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,329
Apologies.

774
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:18,665
I would not part with the man.

775
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:24,546
I allow you

776
00:48:24,714 --> 00:48:26,798
to purchase
one of my slaves,

777
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:29,050
yet now you deny me
the same opportunity?

778
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:32,345
Gannicus is not for sale.

779
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:37,726
Everything is for sale, Batiatus.

780
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:39,936
The question is but price.

781
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:46,318
(yelling)

782
00:48:51,782 --> 00:48:54,743
(Gaia laughing)

783
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,767
(grunting)

784
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:58,139
I make fair offer

785
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:02,644
and you produce cock
to piss on me?

786
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:06,815
Do you know what that
feels like, Batiatus?

787
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,908
(chuckling)

788
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:29,754
Reconsider your answer

789
00:50:29,922 --> 00:50:32,924
or be excluded
from the games forever.

790
00:50:41,183 --> 00:50:44,936
(Tullius laughs)

791
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:57,449
(theme music playing)
