...just because he's nice
and done better than his predecessors...

...then your boss is the chief executive
of Fantasyland.

Let's take him out back
and beat the shit out of him.

302
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,076
- Morning, Mr. President. How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

303
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,871
My apologies for the interruption.
A.J. Suggested I come by and say hello.

304
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,333
You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade
by any chance, would you?

305
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,212
Mr. President, I'm, um...

306
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,006
I don't know what to say. I'm speechless.

307
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,801
All evidence to the contrary.

308
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,137
Mr. President, we haven't met.
I'm Susan Sloan.

309
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,266
I used to work with Congressman Myers.
I hope this incident won't jeopardize...

310
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,517
Sydney?

311
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,019
- Yes, sir.
- You have a second?

312
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,980
Uh, of course.

313
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:55,198
I thought maybe we might talk in private,
someplace less intimidating.

314
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,159
- Janie.
JANIE: Yes, sir.

315
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,580
This is Janie Basdin, my personal aide.
Show Miss Wade to the rec room, please.

316
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,165
This way.

317
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,917
I'll be with you in a second.

[CLOCK TICKING]

319
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,272
Sorry to keep you waiting.

320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,317
- Mr. President...
- Is it all right if I call you Sydney?

321
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,444
Of course. Mr. President...

322
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,112
Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

323
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,782
Uh, I've just been on the regular tour.
It didn't include...

324
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,742
I hear it's pretty good.

325
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,953
Mr. President, what you saw in there
was vanity run amuck.

326
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,040
I was showing off for a colleague
who doesn't think much of me.

327
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,586
It would be a real injustice to hold the GDC
accountable for my behavior today.

328
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:54,758
On top of which, I am monumentally sorry
for having insulted you like that.

329
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,428
Are you under the impression
I'm mad at you?

330
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,971
Well, I...

331
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,891
Seldom does a day go by
when I'm not burned in effigy.

332
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,978
Not by a professional political operative
standing 30 feet from the Oval Office.

333
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,855
Now, I'll grant you that.

334
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:13,151
When the city planners sat down to design
Washington, D.C., their intention was...

335
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,113
...to build a city that would intimidate
and humble foreign heads of state.

336
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,741
- It's true.
- I didn't know that.

337
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,329
The White House is the single greatest
home-court advantage in the modern world.

338
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,040
I learned that one the hard way.

339
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,167
Sydney, this bill is important to me.

340
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,295
Yes, sir. I'll convey your message.

341
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,839
But you don't believe me.

342
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,591
The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

343
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,511
It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
It's a long shot at 10.

344
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,722
How do you know that,
until you put the White House behind it?

345
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,432
Sydney, at 20 percent...

346
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,311
...we're 34 votes shy in the house.
It can't be done.

347
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,480
But I'll tell you what.

348
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,691
I'll make you a deal.

349
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,696
If you can get 24 votes,
I'll get you the last 10.

350
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,989
Twenty-four votes?

351
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,825
If you can swing 24 votes
by the State of the Union...

352
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,828
...I will promise you
full White House support.

353
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,038
Do I have your word on that, sir?

354
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,957
Absolutely.

355
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,793
Listen, um...

356
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,753
Are you hungry? I skipped breakfast.

357
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,633
You wanna have a doughnut,
coffee or something?

358
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,931
Sir, I'm a little intimidated
by my surroundings and yes...

359
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,726
...I have gotten off
to a rocky and stilted beginning...

360
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,562
...but don't let that diminish
the weight of my message.

361
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,982
The GDC has been at every president
for the last decade and a half...

362
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,984
...that global warming is a calamity...

363
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,904
...the effects of which will be second
only to nuclear war.

364
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,325
The best scientists have given you
every reason to take the GDC seriously...

365
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,118
...but I'm gonna give you one more:

366
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,246
If you don't live up to the deal
you made, come New Hampshire...

367
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,790
...we're gonna go shopping
for a new candidate.

368
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,542
You can't do that, Sydney.

369
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,921
With all due respect, Mr. President,
who's going to stop me?

370
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,549
Well, if you go through that door,
the United States Secret Service.

That's my private office.

I will not do it in a school.

- Well, why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

414
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,990
Wilson was widowed during his first term.
He met a woman, Edith Galt.

He dated her, courted her, married her.

to form the League of Nations.

How is that different
from what Wilson did?

425

The difference is he didn't have to be
president on television.

You said it yourself a million times:

until she receives confirmation...

...30 minutes beforehand.
- And they find this romantic?

1351
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:55,597
I say it with a great deal of charm.

1352

Look! There it is!
Carmen's House of Flowers.

- Coop, we gotta stop.
LEWIS: What?

- Here?
- Now?

That's not what men do.
I don't know men who do that.

1358

I'm gonna hop out at the flower shop.

- He's not hopping.

1360
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,490
No hopping, sir.

1361

- Stay in the car. I'll get the flowers.
SHEPHERD: It's not gonna be personal.

1362

LEWIS: Let them do a security sweep.
We don't know who's in there.

1363
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:25,168
The florist is planning an assassination
on the off-chance I might stop by?

1364
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,753
It's possible.

1365
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,256
WOMAN:
No, no.

1366
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,342
You're not hearing me.
Listen to what I'm saying.

1367
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:35,178
It was at the basketball game.

1368
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,429
Excuse me.

1369
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:39,141
No, girl, at the game.
Kiki wasn't even there.

1370

- Ha, ha. Ugh, hold on.

I will be right with you.

Does any of this ring a bell?

Same girl, she remembered me.

1376
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,412
RUMSON: I'm glad to see
that the president has a girlfriend.

1377
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,038
Never mind...

1378
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:07,294
...that she's the hired gun of an
ultra-liberal political action committee.

1379
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,505
Never mind...

1380
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,924
...that the president takes the 5th...

1381
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:17,512
...any time a reporter has the temerity
to ask him a question about a woman...

1382
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,849
...in a position
to exert enormous influence...

1383
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,561
...over a huge range of issues.

1384
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:29,608
Never mind that this woman's idea of how
to unwind at the end of a tough day...

1385
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,319
...is to get together with her ACLU pals...

1386
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,863
...and to set American flags on fire.

1387
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,493
No reaction from the White House.

1388
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,705
SHEPHERD: It doesn't need to be dignified
with a response.

1389
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,333
There's no upside. I'm leaving it alone.

What do Lewis and Robin think?

Brutus and Cassius, heh?

1392

They want me to get into
a character debate and mix it up.

Lewis and Robin are very smart.

SYDNEY: I didn't say that.

- I question it all the time.

Wait a minute.
Here comes my favorite part.

My name is Bob Rumson
and I'm running for president.

Glad he cleared that up because the crowd
was about to buy some Amway products.

SYDNEY:
What about yours?

1402
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:24,246
Ugh, we'll be back up in the 60s
once I get the votes for the crime bill.

Uh, I've got work
I was going to bring home. Why?

Well, negotiations are going pretty well.

at a friend's house.

votes in the Virginia State Legislature...

...while lobbying for
the Virginia Teachers Association.

- That's a heck of an accusation to make...
- I'm not saying...

1443
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,756
Let me be very clear.
I'm not making an accusation.

1444
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:43,051
I am saying, when you hear one thing,
you dismiss it.

It's important legislation that
for the first time has a legitimate chance.

1655

- She deserves every opportunity.

But you already know that,

Because it occurs to me that in 25 years
I've never seen your name on a ballot.

1789
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,885
Now, why is that?
Why are you always one step behind me?

1790
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,305
If I wasn't, you'd be
the most popular history professor...

1791
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:53,056
...at the University of Wisconsin.

1792
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,350
Fuck you!

1793
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,232
Have Lewis put the final draft...

1794
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,611
...of the State of the Union
on my desk in the morning.

1795
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,863
Yes, sir.

1796
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:19,583
If Mary hadn't died...

1797
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:24,129
...would we have won three years ago?

1798
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:27,758
Would we have won?

1799
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,513
If we had to go through a character debate
three years ago...

1800
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,598
...would we have won?

1801
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:37,184
I don't know.

1802
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:41,480
But I would have liked that campaign.

1803
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,399
If my friend, Andy Shepherd,
had shown up...

1804
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,110
...I would have liked that campaign
very much.

1805
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,281
Yeah.

1806
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:52,843
ROBIN: Because the president feels there
is no value in this kind of character debate.

1807
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,721
Will the president respond
to Senator Rumson's question...

1808
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,390
...about being a member
of the American Civil Liberties Union?

1809
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:01,977
Yes, he will. Good morning. It's all right.
Please keep your seats. Good morning.

1810

[REPORTERS MURMURING]

1811
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:13,572
For the last couple of months,
Senator Rumson has suggested...

1812
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:18,076
...that being president of this country
was to a certain extent about character.

1813
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:22,414
Although I have not been willing
to engage in his attacks on me...

1814
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:26,335
...I've been here three years
and three days...

1815
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,755
...and I can tell you without hesitation...

1816
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,591
...being president of this country...

1817
01:39:32,759 --> 01:39:36,094
...is entirely about character.

1818
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:38,013
For the record:

1819
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:41,933
Yes, I am a card-carrying member
of the ACLU.

1820
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,270
But the more important question is:
Why aren't you, Bob?

1821
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,397
Now, this is an organization...

1822
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:50,651
...whose sole purpose is to defend
the Bill of Rights.

1823
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,779
So it naturally begs the question:
Why would a senator...

1824
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:57,783
...his party's most powerful spokesman
and a candidate for president...

1825
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:01,119
...choose to reject
upholding the Constitution?

1826
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:05,123
Now, if you can answer that, folks,
then you're smarter than I am...

1827
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:09,211
...because I didn't understand it
until a few hours ago.

1828
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,964
America isn't easy.

1829
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:18,136
America is advanced citizenship.
You've gotta want it bad...

1830
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,514
...because it's gonna put up a fight.

1831
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,183
It's gonna say, "You want free speech?

1832
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,436
Let's see you acknowledge a man
whose words make your blood boil...

1833
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:30,107
...who's standing center stage,
advocating at the top of his lungs...

1834
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,944
...that which you would spend
a lifetime opposing at the top of yours.

1835
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:36,571
You want to claim this land
as the land of the free?

1836
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:40,117
Then the symbol of your country
cannot just be a flag.

1837
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:41,993
The symbol also has to be...

1838
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:47,124
...one of its citizens exercising his right
to burn that flag in protest.

1839
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:51,086
Now, show me that, defend that,
celebrate that in your classrooms.

1840
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:54,923
Then you can stand up
and sing about 'the land of the free."'

1841
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:59,052
I've known Bob Rumson for years and
I've been operating under the assumption...

1842
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,764
...that the reason Bob devotes
so much energy to shouting at the rain...

1843
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,100
...was that he simply didn't get it.

1844
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,520
Well, I was wrong.
Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it.

1845
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:11,106
Bob's problem is that he can't sell it.

1846
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:14,943
We have serious problems to solve...

1847
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,779
...and we need serious people
to solve them.

1848
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:21,450
And whatever your particular problem is,
I promise you...

1849
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:25,746
...Bob Rumson is not the least bit
interested in solving it.

1850
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:29,666
He is interested in two things
and two things only:

1851
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:33,211
Making you afraid of it,
and telling you who's to blame for it.

1852
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:36,089
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is how you win elections.

1853
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:39,801
You gather a group of middle-aged,
middle-income voters...

1854
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:43,013
...who remember with longing
an easier time. You talk to them...

1855
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:46,349
...about family and American values
and character.

1856
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:50,729
Then you wave an old photo of the
president's girlfriend, scream patriotism...

1857
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:53,982
...tell them she's to blame
for their lot in life...

1858
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,318
...and you go on television...

1859
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:58,862
...and you call her a whore.

1860
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:02,282
Sydney Ellen Wade
has done nothing to you, Bob.

1861
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,786
She has done nothing
but put herself through school...

1862
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:08,497
...represent the interest
of public-school teachers...

1863
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,249
...and lobby for the safety
of our natural resources.

1864
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,502
You want a character debate, Bob?

1865
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,170
You better stick with me...

1866
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:18,590
...because Sydney Ellen Wade
is way out of your league.

1867
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,975
I've loved two women in my life.

1868
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:31,728
I lost one to cancer...

1869
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:35,857
...and I lost the other
because I was so busy keeping my job...

1870
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,193
...I forgot to do my job.

1871
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,571
Well, that ends right now.

1872
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:43,532
Tomorrow morning...

1873
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:47,702
...the White House is sending
a bill to Congress for its consideration.

1874
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:50,413
It's White House Resolution 455...

1875
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,959
...an energy bill,
requiring a 20 percent reduction...

1876
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:57,546
...of the emission of fossil fuels
over the next 10 years.

1877
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,716
It is by far the most aggressive stride
ever taken...

1878
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,678
...in the fight to reverse
the effects of global warming.

1879
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:08,265
The other piece of legislation
is the crime bill.

1880
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:12,561
As of today, it no longer exists.

1881
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,354
I'm throwing it out.

1882
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:18,441
I'm throwing it out and writing a law
that makes sense.

1883
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:20,902
You can't address crime prevention...

1884
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,780
...without getting rid of assault weapons
and handguns.

1885
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:27,117
I consider them a threat
to national security and I will go...

1886
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:29,160
...door-to-door if I have to...

1887
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:33,373
...but I'll convince Americans that I'm right
and I'm gonna get the guns.

1888

We've got serious problems
and we need serious people.

than a burning flag and a membership card.

If you want to talk about character
and American values, fine.

01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:43,438
...and his State of the Union address.

1937
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:46,524
You've served on the staffs
of several past administrations.

1938
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:50,904
What kind of last-minute activity
is the president engaged in right now?

1939
01:46:56,911 --> 01:47:00,080
There's something I've wanted to give you
since our first date.

1940
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,875
I've tried to do it a number of times,
but somehow I've always managed...

1941
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:05,877
...to trip over my job...

1942
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,171
...but here...

1943
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:09,631
...these are for you.

1946
01:47:18,182 --> 01:47:20,475
Ahem, Mr. President?

1947
01:47:20,643 --> 01:47:22,143
Well, I've gotta go.

1948
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:24,312
Uh, should I stay here?

1949
01:47:25,731 --> 01:47:27,315
Walk with me.

SYDNEY:
How'd you finally do it?

1951
01:47:34,532 --> 01:47:35,824
Do what?

1952
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:39,619
Manage to give a woman flowers
and be president at the same time?

1953
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:43,123
Well, it turns out I've got a rose garden.

- Heh.
