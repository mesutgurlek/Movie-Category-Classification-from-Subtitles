Yeah.

Well. It's a new

for the monastery in Tibet.

gave me his keys.

for the new models.

409
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:22,298
Once you have
your basic set.

410
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,960

a question of variation.

411
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:28,801
You hop in any car you want
and just drive off?

412
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:31,306
Not any car.
I like to keep a variety.

413
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,310
I'm always looking
for the new experience.

414

Maybe.

415
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,648
Nevertheless. I think
you're upsetting people.

416
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:42,048
I don't know
if that's right.

417
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,314
Well. If some people
get upset

418
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,152
because they feel they have
a hold on some things.

419
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:49,454

attached to things.

Now. With that
in mind.

423
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,061
I'm not against
collecting stuff.

424
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:01,935
I've collected quite
a lot of stuff in my time.

425
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,436
Yeah. This is all memorabilia.
but it's incidental.

426
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:10,446
not integral.
if you know what I mean.

427
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:11,947
Oh... the birds.

428
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:12,947
Wow.

Ah. Me. Free as a bird.

At one time I broke into pet shops
to liberate the canaries.

433
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,335
but I decided that was an idea
way before its time.

still dearly loves a cage.

I have to go.

oat straw tea. Have you?

have to come back and visit.

00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,815
Of course. I can always
fall back on my Home Ec.

490
00:28:58,882 --> 00:29:00,247
Now that's good planning.

491
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:01,511
Yes.

492
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:04,748
Tell me. Are you a regular
with this computer club?

493
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,619
Oh. Heavens. No! I don't have
to worry about dates.

494
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:09,124
Oh.

495
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:12,753
But some of the other girls
in my sorority

496
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,763
decided somebody
ought to try it.

497
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:17,732
so we drew straws.
and I lost.

498
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:21,202
Oh... but l... I'm looking
forward to meeting Harold.

499
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,762
Well. I think
I should mention. Candy.

500
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,502
Harold does have his
little eccentric moments.

501
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:28,009
That's all right.

502
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:31,514
I have a brother
who's a real cutup. Too.

503
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:34,243
Oh. I will never
forget the time

504
00:29:34,317 --> 00:29:37,480
we had this old television set
with no parts in it.

505
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:39,988
Tommy stuck his head
behind it

506
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:42,491
and started giving
a whole newscast

507
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,254
before the entire family.

508
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:46,261
Must have been
very funny.

509
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:48,160
[Explosion]

510
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:50,222
Aah! Harold!

511
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,232
Oh!

512
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:54,236
Oh. Yes. Dear.
Here is Harold now.

513
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,737
Harold.
this is Candy.

514
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:59,640
Candy's just been telling
such a funny little story about...

515
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:00,641
Oh!

516
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,972
Walter
Cronkite.

517
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,012
Oh!

518
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:08,662
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

519
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:17,268
# I used to walk alone #

520
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,577
# Every step
seemed the same #

521
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,144
# This world
was not my home #

522
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:28,156
# So there was nothing
much to the game #

523
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,554
# Look up and
see the clouds #

524
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,964
# Look down and
see the cold fog #

525
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,999
# Until you came
into my life. Girl #

526
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:45,063
# I saw nothing.
nothing more ##

527
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:51,545
Oh.

528
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:54,674
- Excuse me.
- Mmm?

529
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,809
I beg your pardon.

530
00:30:57,887 --> 00:30:59,514
Well. What do you want?

531
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:02,456
I'm sorry.
I was looking for Maude.

532
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:03,457
Harold?

533
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:10,890
Maude.

534
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,536
How about
some ginger pie?

535
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:17,038
Fine. Thank you.

536
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:18,630
I'll heat some up.

537
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,879
My. Harold. I'm glad
to see you again.

538
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:27,245
Do you often
model for Glaucus?

539
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:30,217
Oh. Heavens. No.
I don't have the time.

540
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:32,379
But I like
to keep in practice.

541
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:36,221
And poor Glaucus occasionally
needs his memory refreshed

542
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:39,227
as to the contours
of the female form.

543
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:41,695
Do you disapprove?

544
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,789
Me? No. Of course not.

545
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:47,830
Really?

546
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:49,838
Do you think
it's wrong?

547
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:01,615
No.

548
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:04,346
Oh! Heavens.
I'm glad you said that.

549
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,014
I want to show you
my painting.

550
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,355
This is
The Rape of Rome.

551
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:14,021
Over in the corner
is Leda and the Swan...

552
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,860
a self-portrait.

553
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:19,129
And over here
is my favorite.

554
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:23,371
It's titled...

555
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:27,773
Rainbow With Egg Underneath
and an Elephant.

556
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:29,175
Do you like it?

557
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:30,177
Oh. Yeah.

558
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:31,679
Very much.

559
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:34,182
I then became
infatuated with these...

560
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,182
my odorifics.

561
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,879
Give the nose a treat.
I thought...

562
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,388
Have a kind of a...
a olfactory banquet.

563
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,890
So I began first
on the easiest...

564
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,483
roast beef. Old books.

565
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,529
mown grass... and
Mexican farmyard.

566
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:49,724
Oh. Here's one you'll like.

567
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,393
Snowfall
on 42nd Street.

568
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:53,901
I'll put it on.

569
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:59,236
Now. You hold on
to this.

570
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:00,673
I'll pump it up.

571
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,346
OK. Now.
hold it up there.

572
00:33:05,414 --> 00:33:07,541
Now. What
do you smell?

573
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:14,355
Subway?

574
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:15,549
Ha ha.

575
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,162
Perfume.

576
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:27,527
[Cough Cough]

577
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:29,036
[Cough]

578
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:30,037
Cigarettes.

579
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:31,437
[Both Laughing]

580
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:40,047
Snow.

581
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,048
Snow.

582
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:44,778
Oh. It goes
on and on.

583
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,288
It's just great.

584
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:52,316
But then I decided
to switch to the tactile.

585
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:55,062
Uh...

586
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:56,564
what do you think?

587
00:33:56,632 --> 00:33:58,065
I like this...

588
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:59,567
Oh. No. No. No.

589
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,297
Really get close
and reach in and feel.

590
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:03,303
[Teakettle Whistles]

591
00:34:03,372 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh... there's
my kettle.

592
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:07,667
Uh... well...

593
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:09,335
stroke...

594
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:11,175

596
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,145
explore.

597
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,882
Unh...

598
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,051
Mmm.

599
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,392
Here we are.

600
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,827
Oat straw tea
and ginger pie.

601
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:06,000
Excuse the mismatched
saucers.

602
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,837
This is definitely
a new experience for me.

603
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:12,841
Oh. Wonderful.
Try something new each day.

604
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:15,343
After all. We're given life
to find it out.

605
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:16,844
It doesn't last
forever.

606
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:19,313
You look
as if you could.

607
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,344
Did I tell you
I'll be 80 on Saturday?

608
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:24,852
You don't look 80.

609
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:27,355
That's the influence
of the right food.

610
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:29,857
the right exercises.
and the right breathing.

611
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:32,690
Greet the dawn with
the breath of fire.

612
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,194
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

613
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,765
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

614
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,872
Huh! Huh! Hu...

615
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,874
Oh...

616
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,375
well. There's
no question.

617
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,001
My body's giving out.

618
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:50,545
I'm well into autumn.

619
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:53,047
It's all going
to be over after Saturday.

620
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:54,548
Tell me about yourself.

621
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:58,144
What do you do when
you aren't visiting funerals?

622
00:36:06,595 --> 00:36:10,725
Yes. There is definitely
a certain attraction.

623
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:28,344
I ask you. Though. Harold.
is it enough?

624
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,352
What do you mean?

625
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:33,353
Oh. Well...

626
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:37,718
Mmm...

627
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:42,727
I like to watch
things grow.

628
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:53,533
They grow and bloom

629
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,169
and fade and die

630
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,179
and change
into something else.

631
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,112
Ah. Life.

632
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:08,223
I should like to change
into a sunflower most of all.

633
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,224
They're so tall and simple.

634
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:13,227
What flower
would you like to be?

635
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:16,365
I don't know.

636
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:18,832
One of these. Maybe.

637
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,835
Why do you say that?

638
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:24,004
Because they're all alike.

639
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,337
Oh. But they're not.

640
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:27,842
Look. See...

641
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,346
some are smaller.
some are fatter...

642
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,349
some grow to the left.
some to the right.

643
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,851
Some even have
lost some petals.

644
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:40,355
All kinds of
observable differences.

645
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:42,118
You see. Harold.

646
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:45,524
I feel that much
of the world's sorrow

647
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:48,085
comes from people
who are this...

648
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:54,426
yet allow themselves
to be treated as that.

649
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,832
# Well. I think it's fine #

650
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:03,310
# Buildin' jumbo planes #

651
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,811
# Or takin' a ride #

652
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:10,443
# On a cosmic train #

653
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:14,215

Isn't it darling?

818
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:40,253
I had them take away
that monstrous thing of yours

819
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:42,414
and send this one
'round instead.

820
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,288
It's so much more appropriate
for you. Don't you think?

821
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:49,262
Oh. One thing more.
Harold.

822
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,764

a very nice. Quiet girl.

isn't it?

How long you been
driving. Lady?

830
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:58,198
About. Uh. 45 minutes.
wouldn't you say. Harold?

831
00:48:58,266 --> 00:49:00,200
We were hoping
to start sooner.

832

to find a truck.

Is this your truck?

834
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:07,506
Uh. Oh. No.
I just took it.

835

Yes. See. I have
to plant my tree.

Well.
it's not mine. Really.

to get it into soil

Let me get this
straight. Lady.

All right. Then. We'll be off.

And the smell.

856

It's the earth.

857
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:19,373
The earth is my body.

I was in there
cleaning it up.

a little experimenting.

913

leaping up.

was over.

was giving a party.

this funny feeling.

Yes.

982
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:35,860
Oh. Here's Harold now.

983
00:59:35,936 --> 00:59:37,801
Don't get up. Dear.

984
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:46,712
Edith has been talking
about her job.

985
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,213
I'm a file clerk.

986
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:49,714
Henderson
Feed and Grain.

987
00:59:49,783 --> 00:59:50,715
Harrison.

988
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:52,217
Harrison
Feed and Grain.

989
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:53,877
It's at Hamilton
and 4th.

990
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:56,149
I'm in charge
of the invoices.

991
00:59:57,324 --> 00:59:59,952
I type the schedule
for the trucking fleet.

992
01:00:00,026 --> 01:00:03,052
She supplies the whole southwest
with chicken feed.

993
01:00:03,129 --> 01:00:05,723
Well. Not exactly
the whole southwest.

994
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:07,892
although we do
a large business.

995
01:00:07,968 --> 01:00:10,232
Barley was very big
last week...

996
01:00:10,303 --> 01:00:11,895
1.500...

997
01:00:11,972 --> 01:00:12,904
bushels.

998
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:36,225
In view of your
recent actions.

999
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:39,356
I find you have left me
with no recourse

1000
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:42,333
but to listen to the solution
proposed by your uncle.

1001
01:00:42,402 --> 01:00:45,496
Consequently. I have
instructed him forthwith

1002
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:47,665
to induct you
into the service.

1003
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:49,504
and. For your own good.

1004
01:00:49,576 --> 01:00:54,104
to take up active duty
with the United States Army.

1005
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:59,015
And I hope they have
more luck with you than I.

1006
01:01:00,353 --> 01:01:03,789
Maude. They're
going to draft me.

1007
01:01:03,857 --> 01:01:05,757
Well. Don't go.

1008
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:07,759
They'll put me in jail.

1009
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:10,853
Well. Historically.
you'd be in very good company.

1010
01:01:16,403 --> 01:01:18,030
Maude. Can you help me?

1011
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:21,840
With your skill
and my experience.

1012
01:01:21,908 --> 01:01:24,433
I think we can
come up with something.

1013
01:01:25,612 --> 01:01:28,513
Harold. Iook at me
like your father in this.

1014
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,482
I know you have no desire
to join the army.

1015
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:33,985
but once you're in.
you'll love it.

1016
01:01:34,054 --> 01:01:35,316
It's a great life.

1017
01:01:35,388 --> 01:01:36,480
Look at me...

1018
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:39,821
chauffeur. Respect.
money in the bank.

1019
01:01:39,893 --> 01:01:44,353
Oh. It has its drawbacks
like anything else. I suppose.

1020
01:01:44,431 --> 01:01:46,695
But the army
takes care of you.

1021
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:49,997
and you've got
a buddy for life.

1022
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,368
[Whistling]

1023
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:54,202
Good idea.
coming out here. Harold.

1024
01:01:54,274 --> 01:01:55,536
It's a lovely spot.

1025
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:56,870
Thank you. Uncle.

1026
01:01:56,943 --> 01:01:58,205
Call me sir. Harold.

1027
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:01,042
It's the first thing
you learn in the army...

1028
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:02,877
an officer
deserves your respect.

1029
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:04,824
Yes. Sir.

1030
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:08,725
Now let's examine
the facts on it.

1031
01:02:08,795 --> 01:02:11,389
I say this country's
been too harsh

1032
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:14,058
in its outright
condemnation of war.

1033
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:16,897
You can point to the many
material advantages

1034
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,905
brought about by a crisis
in conflict policy.

1035
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:24,069
Why. Hell. World War II
gave us the ballpoint pen.

1036
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:27,010
During wartime. The national
suicide rate goes down.

1037
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,342
Is that a fact?

1038
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:31,850
Why in hell did we
give up on the Germans?

1039
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,852
Because the damn politicians
in Washington

1040
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,854
chalked them up
on our side.

1041
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:39,187
The wars ever since have
been a national disgrace.

1042
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:40,520
Hell. Iook at history.

1043
01:02:40,593 --> 01:02:43,027
The two best wars
this country ever fought

1044
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:44,358
were against the jerries.

1045
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,524
Get the krauts across
the fence where they belong.

1046
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,160
Let's get back to the kind
of enemy worth killing

1047
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:53,034
and the kind of war
this country can support.

1048
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:56,542
Wow. That's pretty
strong stuff. Sir.

1049
01:02:56,609 --> 01:03:00,545
Well. I've always been a man
that speaks his piece.

1050
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:02,046
Always hurt me.

1051
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:06,176
I'm not liked in Washington.
I know that.

1052
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:09,346
But I do have friends
in high places.

1053
01:03:11,424 --> 01:03:12,789
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

1054
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:14,884
They kept falling. Shock!

1055
01:03:14,961 --> 01:03:17,987
Joe falls back.
a neat hole in his head.

1056
01:03:18,064 --> 01:03:19,292
Tat-tat-tat-tat!

1057
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:22,300
Only one thing kept
going through my mind...

1058
01:03:22,368 --> 01:03:24,393
Kill! Kill!

1059
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,906
For Joe and Mac
and the rest of the guys!

1060
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,066
Kill!

1061
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,702
And then there was
a blinding flash!

1062
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:38,077
And I woke up
on a stretcher.

1063
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:44,590
"Did we hold?"
I asked the medic.

1064
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:47,215
"Yes. Sir!" he said.

1065
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:55,697
And I slipped
into unconsciousness.

1066
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:58,236
Boy.

1067
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:01,705
Wow. That's
a terrific story. Sir.

1068
01:04:02,942 --> 01:04:04,910
Well...

1069
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:07,844
you'll have stories like that
to tell of your own someday.

1070
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,347
Do you think so. Sir?

1071
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:10,643
Sure. You will.

1072
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:14,152
Gee. I never dreamed
it could be that exciting.

1073
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,984
It's the most exciting thing
in the world. Harold.

1074
01:04:17,056 --> 01:04:20,548
To pit your own life
against another.

1075
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:21,615
Yes.

1076
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:23,491
To kill.

1077
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:26,430
The taste of blood
in your mouth.

1078
01:04:26,499 --> 01:04:28,433
The moment of truth.

1079
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:31,334
Another man's life
in your sight!

1080
01:04:31,404 --> 01:04:32,336
Yes!

1081
01:04:32,405 --> 01:04:34,498
Will they really
teach me to shoot?

1082
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:37,008
Sure. They will.
a variety of weapons.

1083
01:04:37,076 --> 01:04:38,338
To use a bayonet?

1084
01:04:38,411 --> 01:04:39,400
Yes!

1085
01:04:39,479 --> 01:04:41,242
How about
hand-to-hand combat?

1086
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:42,246
Yes.

1087
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:43,907
To strangle someone.
choke him.

1088
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:46,918
squeeze out his life
in your own bare hands!

1089
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:48,920
I think you're
getting carried away.

1090
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:52,424
- How about to slit his throat?
- I don't know about that.

1091
01:04:52,492 --> 01:04:53,754
How about souvenirs?

1092
01:04:53,826 --> 01:04:54,758
Souvenirs?

1093
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,089
Of your kill.

1094
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:59,325
Eyes. Ears. Nose.
scalp. Privates?

1095
01:04:59,398 --> 01:05:00,626
Harold!

1096
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,635
What would be the chance
of getting one of these?

1097
01:05:03,703 --> 01:05:06,069
Boy. To think
I could make my own!

1098
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:07,697
Harold.
that's disgusting!

1099
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:09,206
It certainly is!

1100
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:10,708
Madam. Who are you?

1101
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:13,210
I am petitioning
for peace.

1102
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,213
- Parasite!
- Harold!

1103
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:17,215
I came out here
to speak.

1104
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:19,376
Commie bastard!
Get out of here!

1105
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:21,386
Don't talk to me
like that.

1106
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:22,716
you foul-mouthed
degenerate!

1107
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:24,722
Traitor! Benedict Arnold!
Remember Nathan Hale!

1108
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,052
Harold.
calm down.

1109
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,057
Commie pig!

1110
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:29,287
Don't you advance
on me.

1111
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:31,296
You'll all end up
like this!

1112
01:05:31,364 --> 01:05:32,296
Ooh!

1113
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:33,627
Just like this!

1114
01:05:33,699 --> 01:05:35,132
Harold!

1115
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:38,136
Give me that!
I'll throw that in the sewer.

1116
01:05:38,204 --> 01:05:39,136
Madam. Please.

1117
01:05:39,205 --> 01:05:40,467
She took my head.

1118
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,802
Now calm down.
Harold.

1119
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:43,136
She took my head!

1120
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:44,141
Harold!

1121
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,144
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her!

1122
01:05:46,212 --> 01:05:47,144
Harold! Harold!

1123
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:48,305
Aah!

1124
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:49,973
Madam.
give back the head!

1125
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:51,311
Let's
have no trouble!

1126
01:05:51,384 --> 01:05:52,476
Harold!

1127
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:53,814
I'll kill you!

1128
01:05:53,886 --> 01:05:54,818
Madam!

1129
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:55,979
I'll kill you!

1130
01:05:56,055 --> 01:05:57,522
Harold! Damn you!

1131
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,921
Let's have no trouble!

1132
01:05:58,991 --> 01:05:59,980
Aah!

1133
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,321
You took my head!

1134
01:06:01,394 --> 01:06:02,361
You pig!

1135
01:06:02,428 --> 01:06:03,690
I'll kill you!

1136
01:06:03,763 --> 01:06:05,094
Help!

1137
01:06:05,164 --> 01:06:06,096
Harold!

1138
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:07,325
I'll kill you!

1139
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,765
I'll kill you!

1140
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,597
Let go. Uncle!
Let go!

1141
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,602

A gift.

1306
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:16,791
Ahh...

1307
01:18:18,937 --> 01:18:21,531
"Harold
loves Maude."

1308
01:18:26,778 --> 01:18:30,043
And Maude
loves Harold.

1309
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:35,552
This is
the nicest present

1310
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,453
that I've received
in years.

1311
01:18:44,796 --> 01:18:45,728
[Splash]

1312
01:18:48,633 --> 01:18:52,569
So I'll always know
where it is.

1313
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:15,993
# I think
I see the light #

1314
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:18,035
# Comin' to me #

1315
01:19:18,102 --> 01:19:20,696
# Comin' through me #

1316
01:19:20,772 --> 01:19:23,605
# Givin' me
a second sight #

1317
01:19:26,244 --> 01:19:29,338
# So shine.
shine. Shine #

1318
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:32,542
# Shine. Shine. Shine #

1319
01:19:32,617 --> 01:19:35,279
# Shine. Shine. Shine #

1320
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,083
# Shine. Shine. Shine #

1321
01:19:38,156 --> 01:19:40,852
# Shine. Shine. Shine #

1322
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:45,419
# Shine. Shine. Shine ##

1323
01:19:50,835 --> 01:19:52,928
Oh. Could I speak
with Fay. Please?

1324
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,272
Fay?

1325
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:58,605
Darling. I know
Rene will be furious.

1326
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:01,941
but... if he knew what
I had to put up with

1327
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:03,605
in the last few days.

1328
01:20:03,681 --> 01:20:04,943
- Mother.
- Not now. Dear.

1329
01:20:05,016 --> 01:20:06,711
So could you
take me Monday?

1330
01:20:06,784 --> 01:20:08,547
I'd like
to talk to you.

1331
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,554
I'm on the phone. Dear.

1332
01:20:10,622 --> 01:20:12,385
I'm getting married.

1333
01:20:12,457 --> 01:20:14,254
What did you say?

1334
01:20:15,793 --> 01:20:17,761
I'm getting married.

1335
01:20:19,797 --> 01:20:21,389
Hold the line. Fay.

1336
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:26,330
To whom?

1337
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:35,912
I suppose you think
this is very funny. Harold.

1338
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,572
A sunflower.

1339
01:20:43,988 --> 01:20:47,219
You can't be serious.

1340
01:21:10,848 --> 01:21:14,215
Your mother spoke to me
about your marriage plan.

1341
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:15,718
and although normally

1342
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,721
I have nothing
against marriage.

1343
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:21,225
I don't think
this is quite. Uh...

1344
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:22,520
normal.

1345
01:21:22,594 --> 01:21:24,221
A very common neurosis.

1346
01:21:24,295 --> 01:21:26,889
particularly
in this society.

1347
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,058
whereby the male child

1348
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:32,728
subconsciously wishes
to sleep with his mother.

1349
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:35,568
Of course.
what puzzles me. Harold.

1350
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,041
is that you want to sleep
with your grandmother.

1351
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,908
I would be remiss
in my duty

1352
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,744
if I did not tell you

1353
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,909
that the idea of...

1354
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,080
intercourse...

1355
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,255
the fact
of your firm young...

1356
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,262
body...

1357
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,931
commingling...

1358
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:08,698
with the...

1359
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:10,707
withered flesh...

1360
01:22:11,776 --> 01:22:15,542
sagging... breasts...

1361
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:19,716
and... flabby...

1362
01:22:21,953 --> 01:22:23,045
bu...

1363
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:27,382
buttocks...

1364
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,224
makes me want...

1365
01:22:33,798 --> 01:22:36,289
to vomit.

1366
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:38,163
Mmm.

1367
01:22:47,478 --> 01:22:50,743
Oh. Harold...

1368
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:53,909
it's... dazzling.

1369
01:22:57,822 --> 01:23:00,757
[Humming
The Blue Danube Waltz]

1370
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:27,376
You've thought
of everything.

1371
01:23:27,452 --> 01:23:30,046
And champagne.
[Sigh]

1372
01:23:30,121 --> 01:23:32,055
It's all right.
It's organic.

1373
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,858
- Oh. Harold.
- Wait.

1374
01:23:39,797 --> 01:23:40,889
For you.

1375
01:23:46,137 --> 01:23:47,399
And. Uh...

1376
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:50,899
after dinner...

1377
01:23:58,816 --> 01:24:01,182
one more little
surprise...

1378
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:06,788
that. I hope.
will make you very happy.

1379
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:09,122
Oh. Harold...

1380
01:24:09,193 --> 01:24:11,525
I am happy.

1381
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:21,661
I couldn't imagine
a lovelier farewell.

1382
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:26,734
Farewell?

1383
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:29,644
Yes. It's
my 80th birthday.

1384
01:24:32,216 --> 01:24:34,309
Well. You're not
going anywhere...

1385
01:24:36,721 --> 01:24:37,653
are you?

1386
01:24:37,722 --> 01:24:39,314
Yes. Dear.

1387
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,518
I took the tablets
an hour ago.

1388
01:24:42,593 --> 01:24:45,027
I'll be gone
by midnight.

1389
01:25:01,345 --> 01:25:03,279
- What?
- [Siren]

1390
01:25:08,352 --> 01:25:12,311
What a fuss this is...
So unnecessary.

1391
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:15,325
Don't die. Maude.
for Christ's sake.

1392
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:17,088
Oh. Harold.

1393
01:25:17,161 --> 01:25:21,723
Oh. Don't upset
yourself so.

1394
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,424
I love you.

1395
01:25:24,502 --> 01:25:25,935
I love you.

1396
01:25:28,172 --> 01:25:30,606
Oh. Harold...

1397
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:33,940
that's wonderful.

1398
01:25:35,179 --> 01:25:38,580
Go and love some more.

1399
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:41,279
No.

1400
01:25:43,187 --> 01:25:45,121
Never.

1401
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:47,316
Never.

1402
