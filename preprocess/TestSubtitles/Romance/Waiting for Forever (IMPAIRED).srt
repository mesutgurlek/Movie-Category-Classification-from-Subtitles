00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,862
Oh!

319
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,453
You're looking good. [Chuckles]

320
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,288
You didn't have to come home.

321
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,292
- I really wanted to come home.
- Hmm.

322
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,049
You know, I don't know why. I just can't
imagine any lack of entertainment...

323
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,882
out there in the entertainment
capital of the world.

324
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,932
Unless you find dying entertaining.

325
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,727
Oh, Dad. You're not dying. Stop that.

326
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,222
- Yeah, well, I know I'm not.
- [Sighs]

327
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,399
Well, then why do you say such things,
hmm?

328
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,817
Oh, you know, for laughs. Just-

329
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,020
I thought that was your game
these days- comedy.

330
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,855
[Sighs]

331
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,861
[Chuckles]

332
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,783
[Exhales]

333
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,155
I should probably go put my stuff away.

334
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,207
Yeah. You don't want to have
too much fun all at once.

335
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,451
Okay.

336
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,330
[Sighs]

337
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,755
- Our baby.
- Would you stop with the-

338
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,890
[Sighs]

339
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,221
I'm gonna be frank with you.

340
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,773
This is such an easy to operate oven
that I let my son operate it.

341
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,146
- Joe, this is fantastic!
- This is a three-year-old-

342
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,694
I'm so proud of you.
I mean, it's been long enough.

343
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,137
Hold on to this for a second.
My wife needs me right now.

344
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,191
I keep my family in the store.
I'll be right back.

345
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,614
- I'll be right with you.
- I'm really proud of you.

346
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,616
What is it?

347
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,620
He said he's gonna knock on Emma's door
and tell her everything.

348
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,747
[Chuckles] That-a-boy.

349
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,745
- When?
- Soon.

350
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,838
- How soon?
- Soon.

351
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,212
Soon. Okay. But how soon, Will?

352
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,043
Today or tomorrow.

353
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,010
- Listen, Will.
- [Gabe Roars Playfully]

354
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,093
- Let's listen to Daddy.
- I want you to look at me in the eyes,

355
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,054
and I want you to give me
your word of honor...

356
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,639
that today, or tomorrow,

357
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,943
you're gonna go to Emma's house
and you're gonna knock on her door...

358
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,444
and you are finally gonna get
this asinine bull honky over with.

359
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,025
Okay?

360
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,992
Gabe-

361
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,914
[Grunts]

362
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,287
I'm gonna tell Emma everything.

363
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,168
Okay? I'm gonna tell her
that I love her. Yeah?

364
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,002
That I've always loved her.
That in my dreams...

365
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,052
I breathe her in-

366
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,678
I inhale her,
and I feel her right here.

367
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,516
Here. Here. In the blood in my heart.

368
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,558
Here. Blood.

369
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,386
[Will] Heart. Heart.

370
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,642
Okay. Hold on. Just wait a second, Will.

371
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,688
What?

372
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,019
In the blood in your heart?
That's insane.

373
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,107
In his blood. It's very nice.
You know, what's wrong with you?

374
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,907
Let him go on.

375
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,328
I'm sorry, sir, but I am just not
used to being ignored. Now-

376
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,408
I'm really sorry. Uh, actually,
let me ask you a question.

377
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,335
I see you've got your lovely husband
here, and he's being very patient.

378
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,040
What would you say if he
came to you one day, and...

379
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,718
he told you that in his dreams
he sucks you into his lungs,

380
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,841
and at that point
you go into his bloodstream?

381
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,799
And you're actually- physically
you are inside of his blood,

382
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:14,354
inside of his heart-
the chambers and valves and such.

383
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,146
How would that make you feel?

384
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,359
Oh!

385
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,358
Well, now.

386
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,946
- Isn't that tub nice?
- Mmm.

387
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,249
It's supposed to be just for
your father, but I love it.

388
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,120
- Do you love it?
- I do.

389
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,673
Oh, thank you.

390
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,300
[Emma] Hmm.

391
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,803
- It's so weird.
- What, honey? What's weird?

392
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,893
I don't know.

393
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,693
I was little. Suddenly I'm not little.
[Chuckles]

394
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,863
I mean, that tree house-
it seems like a dream.

395
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,776
I remember Daddy making it.

396
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,781
I was the nail girl.

397
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,247
Now look at it.

398
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,831
Look at me. [Chuckles] Look at us.

399
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,039
Poof. It's just so weird.

400
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,921
[Sighs]

401
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,301
Was I a nice little girl?

402
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,937
Oh, for heaven sakes,
why would you even ask me that?

403
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:46,567
You were the most wonderful,
clever, bright,

404
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,945
happy, happy,
happy little girl that ever was.

405
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,495
And you haven't changed a bit.

406
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,286
[Miranda Groans]

407
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,619
Are those bugs getting to you?
Because they're certainly getting to me.

408
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,963
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

409
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:13,339
[Gasping]

410
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,439
[Train Passing]

411
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,858
[Train Passing]

412
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,413
At least I know where to find you.

413
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,169
Susan's making dinner.
Kids want to see you. Get in.

414
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,430
[Gasping]

415
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,508
What's wrong with you?

416
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,845
I don't know.

417
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,388
You don't know?

418
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,686
- Nothing. It's okay. I'm fine.
- Mm-hmm.

419
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,703
I just gotta make sure
that you're real children.

420
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,228
It's very important with juggling. 

421
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,454
Not- Not little goblins
or anything like that.

422
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,331
The child here is not real.
It's an alien.

423
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,580
- [Giggling]
- [Laughing]

424
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,711
All right. Okay.

425
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,544
Really. I'm gonna- Whoa. Whoa.

426
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,378
- Higher!
- Okay.

427
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,550
- Yay!
- [Giggling]

428
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,722
- [Sizzling]
- Food!

429
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,520
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

430
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,893
- Oh! Oh!
- [Splash]

431
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,021
[Both Laughing]

432
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,941
[Girl] He gets paid 40 bucks.
Isn't that right, Uncle Will?

433
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,904
We're gonna have to get Q-tips,
because I said "ducks."

434
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,228
- I get paid in little fuzzy baby ducks.
- Ducks?

435
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,375
- [Quacking]
- Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:05,785
Is that really true, Willie?

437
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,087
- Do you really make $40 a day?
- Uh, on a good day.

438
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,710
Wow. See?

439
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,468
- [Boy Chuckling]
- Yeah?

440
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,297
How much you paying in tax
on that $40 that you're making?

441
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,133
Come on. You've gotta be kidding.
Really, Jim?

442
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,264
What? I'm just curious. Does he pay tax
on the money that he makes?

443
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,097
What's wrong with that? Should I?

444
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,183
You don't need to pay any income tax.
Okay?

445
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,314
Want some dessert?

446
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,021
Maybe you'd like a cup of coffee
or tea or something like that?

447
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,157
- Yeah.
- That's the solution...

448
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,108
to the problem, Will.
You just don't worry about it.

449
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,495
Problem? What problem? I mean,

450
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:42,117
where's the problem?
He- He doesn't have a problem.

451
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,664
He doesn't have a problem.
He doesn't have a home.

452
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,038
Hey, guys. Eat your salad.
Please. Thank you.

453
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,082
He doesn't have a job. I have a home.

454
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,960
No. A room in some
fleabag motel is not a home.

455
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,839
Doesn't have any clothes.
Doesn't have a car.

456
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,591
- I had a car.
- You had a car?

457
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:03,051
Yeah, but I hated it, 'cause I always
had to put it somewhere.

458
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:07,764
Yeah. Life is tough,
having to put that car somewhere.

459
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,438
Aren't pajamas clothes?

460
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,644
[Chuckles]

461
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,650
Can I tell you something right now?

462
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,404
There's nothing like 'em.
Just-Just feel 'em. Feel 'em. Yeah.

463
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,235
- They're soft.
- [Girl] It's so soft.

464
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,367
They're cheap. And your legs-

465
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,495
Your legs-
They're just as free as a bird.

466
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,077
Just comes out of nowhere.

467
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,830
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, Uncle Will!

468
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,462
Kids. Go inside. Go.

469
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,792
[Girl] Aw.

470
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,844
Go play. Come on.
Give us a couple minutes.

471
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,718
Come to me.

472
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,516
- No?

473
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,904
You remember that TV show?

474
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,902
What TV show?

475
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,985
You remember. It was that,
um- that news show,

476
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,036
where you said that guy was Will.

477
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:12,086
Anyway, Willie, so listen.
There was this news program, okay?

478
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,005
And there was this guy who had this cat.

479
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,834
Now, all day long,
he had to check the refrigerator...

480
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,294
to make sure that he didn't
put the cat inside of there.

481
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,297
- The refrigerator?
- That's right, Will. The refrigerator.

482
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,474
- And the cat?
- That's right, Will. The cat.

483
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,142
He was nuts.

484
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,140
[Susan] Hey. You know what?

485
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,267
He wasn't nuts. He had a disorder.

486
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,269
Yes, Will. A disorder called F'ing nuts.

487
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,272
Now, as soon as this lunatic closed
the door, he had to open it again...

488
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,069
to make sure that the cat wasn't inside.

489
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,944
All day long, right? He was doing this.
He was opening, closing, opening, closing.

490
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,945
And he talked about it-

491
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,244
Talked about it very clearly.

492
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,583
Like it was a very reasonable
thing for him to do.

493
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,911
Because who knows?

494
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,668
Maybe the cat could have
gotten in there, right?

495
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,749
Before he saw it.
Before he closed the door.

496
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,506
And so Susan leans over to me,
and she says,

497
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,929
"That guy"-

498
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,007
She says, "That's your brother."

499
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,218
Hmm? She says, "That's Will with Emma.

500
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,474
He can't help it."

501
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,807
And you know what, Willie?

502
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,272
She's right.

503
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,072
She's right.

504
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,619
Okay? You talk like following
this woman around everywhere...

505
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,868
is something that makes sense,
but it doesn't.

506
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,788
Okay? It doesn't make sense. It's called
stalking, and it's against the law.

507
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,427
And I want you to stop telling my kids

508
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:37,871
that life is nothing
but a bowl of cherries...

509
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,706
and that everything is just peachy,
okay?

510
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:42,042
What life is, what isn't-
that's my area. All right?

511
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,020
I'll handle that topic with my kids,
if that's all right with you.

512
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,278
Our mother said "peachy."

513
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,159
I remember it. She used to say,

514
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,164
"If this isn't peachy,
I don't know what is."

515
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,874
Jimbo says "peachy."

516
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,521
Willie, how did this whole thing start?

517
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,608
I don't know.

518
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,278
For a while, uh,

519
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,451
after the train,

520
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,826
I'd come back here in the summer,
and I'd see her.

521
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,533
And then I- I stopped coming back.

522
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,461
Um- But we'd write.

523
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,504
Then that stopped.

524
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:07,218
So, when she went off
to college in Oregon,

525
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,137
I just-

526
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,348
I just went to Oregon.

527
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:17,226
And when you follow Emma, how-
how often do you actually see her?

528
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,265
It doesn't matter.

529
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,899
It's just being around
where she might be.

530
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,111
That's plenty.

531
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,487
I, uh-

532
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,072
Here.

533
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:44,086
I think it would be best for everybody
if I just went back to Joey's.

534

[Father] I don't know whether I'm dying
or I'm not dying.

535
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,673
I just- I don't understand why you
find the topic of death objectionable.

536
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,175
- I don't find it objectionable.
- Yes, you do.

537
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,181
I can see it in your face you do.

538

He's joking. Can't you tell he's joking?

539

[Sighs] You know, before you leave,

540
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,395
do you think you could
take your mother aside

541
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:04,901
and explain the concept of punch lines?

542
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:09,527
See, jokes have punch lines. Me
talking about being dead- no punch line.

543
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,906
- Me dead- big punch line.
- [Laughs] You're too much.

over two years.

And she's traveled
3,000 miles to see you,

and you make a comment like that.

No. That's- I don't know why. Why?

566
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,342
Because I was joking, Miranda.
That was a joke. Just a little joke.

00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,070
[Chuckles]

630
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,861
I forgive you.

631
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,411
Oh, is this when I'm supposed to say
I forgive you too?

632
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,663
Forgive me for what, Emma?

633
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,329
[Miranda] Oh!

634
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,960
No! Richard!

635
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,791
- [Richard] What just happened?
- Richard!

636
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,002
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom.
I'll clean it up later.

637
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,712
[Richard] Miranda.

638
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,346
- What the heck's going on?
- I'm sorry.

639
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,972
What?

640
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,512
Uh, uh-

641
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,518
- [Knocking]
- Oh. Excuse me.

642
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,100
- Yeah.
- Oh, I wonder who that could be.

643
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,405
Yeah. What?

644
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:42,232
- [Richard] Who's there?
- Are you selling something?

645
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:43,497
- Miranda.
- No.

646
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,241
I'm sorry. We're having
a very busy moment here.

647
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,910
- C-Come back another time.
- Uh-

648
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,451
[Miranda Sighs Deeply]

649
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,830
Why don't-
Why don't you come into the kitchen.

650
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,378
- I'm sorry.
- Come into the kitchen.

651
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,251
[Out Of Breath]

652
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,832
[Miranda] Uh-

653
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:06,717
Well, why- Why don't-
Why don't you sit, Aaron.

654
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,048
Right.

655
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,385
Can I, uh- Can I get you something?

656
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,140
No. Thank you.

657
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,014
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

658
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,934
Ah.

659
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,945
I'm just gonna clean up a little bit,
if you'll excuse me.

660
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,522
I'll be right-

661
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,333
[Out Of Breath]

662
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,625
[Sighs]

663
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,171
He told her he forgave her.

664
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,173
- For what?
- I don't know.

665
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,596
- Oh, for crying-
- Richard. Richard.

666
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,192
Forgive her for what?

667
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,692
- Mr. Twist.
- Forgive her for what?

668
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,369
I really think it's best
if it comes from Emma, sir.

669
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,249
[Groans]

670
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,040
Forgive her for what?

671
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,962
She cheated on me...

672
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,836
with a friend of mine.

673
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,297
Well, let's not share this
with her mother, okay?

674
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,552
- Okay.
- [Chuckles]

675
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,185
- Okay.
- [Chuckles]

676
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,901
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

677
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,738
[Chuckles]

678
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,280
[Hinges Creak]

679
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,448
[Miranda] Sweetheart,
I brought you some nice soup.

680
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,330
And Aaron called.

681
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,879
He-He wants me to tell you
that he's staying at the Colonial.

682
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,174
Okay? So that's where he is.

683
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:52,345
All right. Well, now you just rest.

684
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,549
I'll, uh- I'll leave
your soup by the door.

685
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,849
Sweetheart.

686
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,474
- I'm going out.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

687
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,727
- Did you have your soup?
- Yeah. Thank you.

688
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,528
Oh, good for you.
And so good to see you up.

689
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,527
Take- Take the Volvo if you want.

690
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,529
[Emma] No, I'm walking.
I just want to walk.

691
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,362
Oh. Okay. Well, have fun.

692
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,538
Um, yeah. Enjoy yourself.

693
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,458
"Enjoy yourself"? "Enjoy yourself"?

694
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,411
- [Laughing]
- Yes. Yes. "Enjoy yourself."

695
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,712
I mean, she could use some enjoyment.

696
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,415
Why is that not a good thing to say?

697
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,002
Enjoyment? What do you think? She's
gonna take a walk to the lollipop store?

698
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,053
Lollipop store? What lollipop store?

699
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,008
I don't even know what you're
talking about, lollipop store.

700
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,287
Well, that's refreshing.

701
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,266
Usually you have no idea that you
don't know what I'm talking about.

702
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,063
[Chuckles]

703
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,148
It could be me, Richard.

704
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,196
It could be me.
But couldn't it also be you?

705
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,524
I mean, the way you speak to me-

706
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,361
Honey, sweetheart, please.

707
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,573
You tell me what you mean
by the lollipop store.

708
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:06,002
And then I will try to respond.
I want to respond. I do.

709
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,293
I really want to talk
about our daughter.

710
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,249
I want to talk about Emma,
our little girl,

711
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,051
because I-

712
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,596
I think that it's killing- killing me.

713
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,596
I think that it's killing me
to see her like this.

714
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:26,265
Do you have any idea how unattractive
the expression on your face is right now?

715
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,269
I hate you.

716
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,358
Good.

717
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,314
You are so horrible to me.

718
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,321
Oh, that-a-girl. Now you're talkin'.

719
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,152
Huh? Now you're talkin'.

720
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,112
I wish you were dead. I do.

721
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,617
Oh. Miranda. Remember this.

722
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,456
- I want you to die.
- Oh!

723
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,284
I want you to die, 'cause I hate you!

724
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,377
- Okay!
- I do! I hate you!

725
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,375
Listen to this.
Hang on to this. Hang on.

726
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,549
- I hate you! I hate you!

- Remember this!

00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,925
No! I hate you! I hate you.

729
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,302
Keep it up. Keep it up. You're strong.

730
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,268
- I hate you!
- That's strong. Hold on. Hold on.

731
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,387
- [Sobbing]
- Hold on. Hold on.

732
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,722
Don't lose it. Okay.

733
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,395
- All right. Shh.
- [Sobbing]

734
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,942
Okay. No, no, no.
Come on, come on, come on.

735
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,066
Oh, no, no, no.

736
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,235
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

737
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,658
It's okay. It's okay.

738
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,368
You need to be strong when I'm gone.

739
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,415
[Sobbing]

740
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,208
You're my girl.

741
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,629
You're my girl. You're my strong girl.

742
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,886
Do you have any idea...

743
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,715
how beautiful the expression
on your face is right now?

744
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,549
[Chuckles]

745
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,894
It's okay.

[Erratic Breathing]

747
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,347
Emma?

748
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,019
- Yeah?
- It's-

749
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,231
It's Will.

750
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,018
Willie?

751
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,065
Oh, my goodness. Hi.

00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,991
Wow! Hey.

Will Donner.

756
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,455
Um- How-

757
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:55,380
I- I was- I was just walking,
and I just saw you.

758
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,128
This is really something. How are you?

759
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,131
- I know. I- I'm good. I'm really good.
- How are- How are you?

760
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,304
I'm fine. Doing fine.

761
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,928
I-

762
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,052
- Weird. I don't know.
- I know. I know.

763
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,513
Gosh. Look at you. Whiskers.

764
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,973
Look at you. Breasts.

765

[Laughing]

766
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,273
Yeah.

767
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,776
So, what? Do you-
you live here now? Did you move here?

768
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,773
- I'm here. I'm always here.
- Yeah?

769
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,491
- Yeah.
- Well, what?

770
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,695
Did you just move back, or-

771
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,325
No.

772
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,290
- You're just visiting?
- Yeah.

773
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,119
Yeah. I'm just visiting.

774
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,000
What's it been? Like years and years.

775
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,173
It's been forever.

776
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,626
It was the end of summer.
I was visiting Joey, remember?

777
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,303
It was all muggy and hot out,
and then we went swimming,

778
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,130
but you hsd to go to your dance lesson.

779
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,090
- Really?
- Yeah.

780
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,552
Joey-
I haven't thought about him in so long.

781
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,058
Hey. Emma.

00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,765
- Yeah?
- Uh-

783
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,351
Do you want to go sit somewhere?

784
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,687
Oh, Willie, I can't.

785
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,487
I'm meeting somebody.

786
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:06,193
I'm really happy to see you though.
You look really great.

787
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,118
Thanks.

when we used to write to each other
after Mom and Dad died.

I used to tell you about
my new friends and my new life.
