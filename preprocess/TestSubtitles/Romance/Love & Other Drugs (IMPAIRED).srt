313
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,719
I'm laying myself bare here.

314
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,726
I'm revealing my true vulnerability.
And now you're stonewalling me.

315
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,551
Is that fair?

316
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,365
- That's not fair.
- You stay out of this.

317
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,026
Look at you angels of mercy! How do
the docs get any work done around here?

318
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,433
Fine. What do you want?

319
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,962
I just want you to let me leave my samples
where he'll see them.

320
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,304
'Cause otherwise, you're gonna
throw them away after I leave.

321
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,914
Gail. No sushi, no salads.

322
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,522
Who let you back here?

323

- Cindy! Can you deal with this, please?

325
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,504
How about a pen?
Do you want a pen? (GROANS)

(SIGHING)

- Okay, Prince Charming, time's up.
- Oh! Okay.

328
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,489
Wow! That is a long handle!

329
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,154
- Would you like a pen?
- Thanks.

I got something for you today.

00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,255
Wait, I think... Yup.
There's another one for you, too!

(CHUCKLING)

337
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,198
The thing about these pens is that
they have tiny little point tips on them,

338
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,669
and then I end up pressing too hard, and...

339
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,400
Hello, gorgeous.

340
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,506

Hey, Lisa!

344
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:14,561
Okay, this may have worked for you
in the past, but let me lay it out.

345
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,500
I became a rep for one reason, doctors.

346
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,404
To meet doctors, fraternize with doctors,
breed with doctors.

347
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,979
So next time you see me in the field,
don't ask for a handout.

(WHISPERS) It's just awkward.

I want Chicago, Randall. And right now,
you're not making it happen!

350
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,155
You're 20% below your quota for Z,
you're 45% below your quota for Zoloft!

351
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,327
You want me off your ass, you punk?

352
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,260
There's your answer.

353
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,933
He's got toddlers taking Prozac.
He's got dogs taking Prozac.

354
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,903
He'd have rocks taking Prozac
if they paid cash.

355
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,565
And by the way, you want
one doctor to start writing Zoloft?

356
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,699
It's the guy standing next to him.

357
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,543
JAMIE: Knight?
BRUCE: Knight.

358

Hannigan's butt buddy.

But I swear, he starts writing it,
the rest of the docs will follow.

360
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,206
And Windy City, here we come.

361
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,552
- Dr. Knight.
- Hey, I'm very late.

362
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,784
- One thousand dollars.
- Excuse me?

363
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,692
- It's a check for $1,000.
- For what?

364
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,285
For a special Pfizer preceptorship.

365
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,389
For me to shadow you, learn your practice,
and better serve the needs of doctors.

Are you bribing me?

No, Doctor, no.

Is this a joke?

If you think $1,000 is a joke.

(EXHALES)

373

That's 33% fewer phone calls at 4:00 a.m...

I'd write a lot more of your scrip
if I were a regularly paid consultant.

Well, you know,
we can talk to them about that.

376

They spend $5 billion a year
on marketing, right?

Mmm-hmm.

378
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,588
Instead of flying me to Cancún
and making me sit through

- Mrs. Putney's on the phone. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

Her daughter has to sing on Friday.
They're doing Bye Bye Birdie,

384
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,471
and she's playing Kim, and she wondered
if you could call in an antibiotic?

00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,669
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay, thanks.

- Hi.

All right, look, if a patient asks,
you're an intern, okay?

391
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,484
Yeah. Can I take notes?

392
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,220
- Sure. Why not?
- All right.

393

Hey. I'm Dr. Knight.

- Maggie Murdock.
- Hi.

- So your file says, "Kind of an emergency."
- Yeah.

and they took my Parkinson's meds.

But my symptoms are pretty good today,
so it's "kind of an emergency."

Yeah, Trey's a great guy.

400
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,776
Oh. Well, I wouldn't say that.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

402
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,515
So, monotherapy?

403
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,492
Yep. Sinemet CR, 50 milligrams,
two times a day,

404
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,792
plus Domperidone to cut the nausea,
10 milligrams, three times a day.

405
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,630
Artane for the tremor, two milligrams,
a whole tablet, three times a day.

406
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,328
And Prozac, so that I'm not too bummed

407
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,167
about having
a major degenerative disorder at 26.

408
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,139
Forty milligrams, once, in the morning.

409
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,040
Zoloft has fewer side effects.

410
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,838
I'm sorry, who are you?

411
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,639
Jamie Randall.

412
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,273
Oh.

413
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,471
Hi.

414
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,874
Intern.

415
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,413
So, early-onset Parkinson's.
That's pretty rare.

416
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,359
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First they thought it was
essential tremor, then Wilson's disease,

417
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:35,696
then Huntington's.
Then, they tested for MAS, PSP, syphilis.

418
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,003
I was very glad for a negative on that one.

419
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,904
I didn't really relish the thought
of feeling like a 19th century slut.

420
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,801
Let's see. Then, there was
brain tumor week, which was very scary.

421
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,779
And then six months
chasing obscure dystonias,

422
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,442
but, no, it just turned out to be
good, old-fashioned Parkinson's.

423
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,315
Right. And... Don't you have a neurologist?

424
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,953
We broke up.

425
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,346
(CHUCKLES)

426
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,453
And do you have insurance?

427
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,620
Do I have insurance.

428
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,222
Okay.

429
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,363
Well, sure. Why not?

430
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,165
- Great.
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

431
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,227
Nope. Oh!

432
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,362
Um...

433
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,904
Actually, yeah.

434
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:22,003
I have a weird blotch on my breast.

435
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,310
I don't know,
I'm trying not to freak out about it.

436
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,908
- Well, let's have a look.
- Great.

437
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,015
Here you go. Do you see that?

438
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,987
- That's a spider bite.
- Is it?

Sure.

444
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,898
You're welcome.

445
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,573
- You're a drug rep?
- (GROANING) Wait...

446
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,582
You let me take my shirt off,
you fucking creep!

447
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,679
Wait, wait, wait. I'm hurt.

448
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,777
- Your buckle just hit my eye.
- No, it didn't.

449
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,446
- I'm hurt. I'm hurt.
- Oh, my God.

450
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,013
Who said I was a drug rep?

451
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,683
Excuse me, look at your bag!

452
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,627
I don't think
you're going to the fucking airport.

453
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,755
Okay, look, just apologize, okay?
Just apologize.

454
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,855
Would you do that just once?

455
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,992
I would actually like to hear someone from
the medical community actually apologize!

456
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,469
Okay. Okay, I apologize.

457
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:25,477
I apologize on behalf of all the arrogant,
faceless, cut-off, asshole doctors out there

458
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,674
who've treated you like a non-person
while peeking at your breasts.

459
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,215
(SCOFFS)

460
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,309
So what's your name?

461
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,810
You're good.

462
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,720
Strong eye contact. Implied intimacy.
You'll make your quotas.

463
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,122
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee then.

464
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,790
Whoa! What was that for?

465
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,994

788
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,324
It's Trey Hannigan, isn't it?

789
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,629
- Trey Hannigan? It was Trey Hannigan.
- Yeah, well...

790
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,536
Uh...

791
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,400
Are you in love with him?

792
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,636
No, I'm not in love with Trey Hannigan.

793
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,807
I was never in love with Trey Hannigan.

794
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,213
He was... Said he was in love with me.

795
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,956
Which was, you know, a problem.

796
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,389
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

797
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,600
- Can we just...
- Right, yeah.

798
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,136
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

799
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,502
- Please.
- Okay.

800
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,512
You get a special thank you
for bringing food.

801
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,007
I do?

802
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,010
Yes, you do.

803
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,507
Mmm.

804
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,514
- You know what?
- What?

805
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,613
What?

806
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,455
I got to pee.

807
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,052
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

808
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,394
(TOILET FLUSHING)

809
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,369
(EXHALING)

810
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,883
Just give me a second, okay?

811
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,042
Okay.

812
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,301
Mmm.

813
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,970
(WHISPERING) Focus, focus, focus.

814
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,737
Should I keep going?

815
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,747
- This never happens.
- I'm aware.

816
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,575
I'm serious. It doesn't.

817
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:33,120
No, no, no. Don't worry about it.
It's me. I'm a jinx.

818
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,819
That's really helpful.

819
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,689
You know what? Why don't you
talk about all the other guys

820
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,627
that you slept with that couldn't get it up,
'cause then it would really like...

821
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,187
Shh! Shh! Shh!

822
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,424
Just calm down.

823
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,828
Just give me a minute.

824
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,263
Don't worry about it.

825
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,502
I am worried about it!

826
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,941
(SNICKERING)

827
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,878
Jesus! Can you just please...
Just show me a little kindness?

828
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,209
Please.

829
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:05,481
Oh, you lying sack of shit!
You do have latent humanity.

830
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:10,154
- Do you know what's going on here?
- (SIGHING) I just want to have sex.

831
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,226
Well, your body's telling you otherwise.

832
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,299
What is that supposed to mean?

833
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,066
Sit up.

834
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,367
- I don't want to sit up.
- Come on. Sit up. Sit up. Sit up. Come on.

835
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,500
All right. Now talk to me.

836
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,639
I don't want to talk.

837
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,910
What else are we going to do?
You've taken sex off the table.

838
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,109
Oh!

839
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,880
Come on. Come on.
Tell me how your day was.

840
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,052
- My day?
- Mmm-hmm.

841
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,653
JAMIE: So I sneak up to my room and
I white out the "D" so it looks like a "B,"

842
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,956
which I did flawlessly. It was undetectable.

843
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,854
And I go down to his study
and I hand him the paper.

844
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,958
And he gives me the face.

845
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,402
And I'm like, "What?"

846
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,228
Mmm-hmm.

847
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,797
And then, from behind his back,
he pulls out the goddamn carbon copy

848
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,867
- that the school sent home.
- Oh, no!

849
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,476
- Yeah.
- Wow.

850
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,208
Genius. Genius.

851
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,179
- You're so competitive.
- No!

852
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,590
Yeah! Yes, you are. Oh, my God, I tell you

853
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,148
I'm involved with Trey Hannigan
and you can't get it up.

854
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,093
I could give a shit about Trey Hannigan.

855
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,863
All you care about is beating him!

856
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,024
- Bullshit!
- You know, it's so prehistoric.

857
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,462
All men care about is performance,

858
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,163
but they have an appendage
that doesn't work

859
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,637
if they're worried about performance.

860
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,199
Mmm. Well, you're an expert, so...

861
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,445
Okay. If I'm an expert,
then why is your company spending

862
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,643
billions making a drug
so that guys can get it up?

863
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,708
Oh, I wish.

864
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,716
It's true. I read it.
Pfizer's making a fuck drug.

865
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,786
Where'd you read that?

866
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,553
I don't know. Ask your guys.

867
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,686
I don't know where I read it.
I'm a drug slut. I read everything.

868
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,495
- What drug?
- I don't know,

869
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,895
but it's hard to believe, isn't it?

870
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,234
It's hard to believe.

871
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,194
- It's gonna be pretty huge, though.
- Oh!

872
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,798
When I think of the size of the problem

873
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,375
and that it's growing larger, really...

874
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,311
- Really.
- I can't even imagine!

875
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,610
You know what I think...

876
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,048
To have found a solution
to the stiffest, hardest...

877
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,107
Wow.

878
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,677
- Pfizer must be swelling with pride.
- I'm gonna stop you.

879
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,380
No tickling! Stop!

880
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,652
Stop! No tickling! No, please! (SHRIEKS)

881
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,388
Don't tickle me just
because you have a limp sense of humor!

882
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,451
Oh!

883
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,367
Hello.

884
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,279
Keep talking.

885
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,939
No more talking.

886
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,563
Who are all these old people?

887
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,100
Uh... Just some people I work with.

888
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,038
Wow. These are beautiful.

889
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,574
It looks like a photograph.

890
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,410
When did you do this?

891
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,568
Uh...

892
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,580
Back when I could hold a brush.
(CHUCKLES)

893
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,316
Here's your breakfast.

894
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,919
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well...

895
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,193
I'll call you.

896
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,493
- Don't.
- I will.

897
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,057
I'm not kidding.

898
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,208
I can't do this.

899
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,338
I told you.

900
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,219
Okay, then.

901
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,418
See you.

902
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,699
BRUCE: Your problem is
you don't know how to close!

903
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,136
You gotta tell the docs what they need.

904
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,433
Somebody says no,
that's when the fun starts.

905
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,496
That means you are in.

906
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,906
- My numbers are up.
- Your Zithromax is up. Big deal.

907
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,968
We're not going to Chicago on Zithromax.

908
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,309
Depressed people, Randall,
they're depressed every day.

909
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,370
You gotta move Zoloft.

910
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,043
- I want you to focus on Zoloft.
- Zoloft.

911
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,679
Counseling? Here's some counseling.
Stop being a fucking bitch.

912
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,484
Wait, did I use "you" language?

913
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,615
Trial separation.

914
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,558
I'm so sorry. I need to own my feelings.

915
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,652
Fucking pepperoni.

916
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,718
Let me rephrase that.

917
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,857
I feel that you should stop
being a fucking bitch!

918
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,334
So, I hear we're coming out
with a new sex drug.

919
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,730
- What are you talking about?
- Is it true?

920
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,640
- Where did you hear that?
- Heard it around.

921
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,701
Sildenafil citrate. It's a PDE-5 inhibitor.

922
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,270
They lucked into it during trials
for blood pressure medication.

923
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,476
Guys had massive boners the whole time.
Where did you hear that?

924
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,144
- (CHUCKLING) What's it called?
- Viagra.

925
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,983
- I want it.
- Everybody wants it.

926
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,044
I could sell the shit out of it.

927
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,648
Can you see if there's some Tums
in there for me in the glove compartment?

928
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,090
- Bruce.
- Tums me, buddy.

929
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,354
Bruce.

930
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,862
Bruce. I want that account.

931
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:15,897
Why would I give it to you?

932
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,662
Who can sell a dick drug better than me?

933
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,770
Ten years, Jamie,
ten excruciating years of marriage.

934
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,466
It's like the lost decade.

935
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,440
Oh, my God!

936
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,807
I don't even know
how to hit on women anymore.

937
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:28,902
What do you do? What's your game?

938
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,310
You need an IBS.
Do you know what that is?

939
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,404
Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

940
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,470
An Initial Benefit Statement.

941
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,779
Tell them who you are, why you're there
and what you can do for them.

942
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,841
All right? And just be yourself, Josh.

943
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,511
- You'll be fine.
- Thank you very much.

944
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,722
Oh! Look who just walked in.

945
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,721
Now's your chance, "Closer."

946
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:43,817
Show me what you got.

947
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:47,953
(WHISPERS) Show me.

948
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,823
Hey! Pfizer, how's your fist?

949
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:51,890
How's your jaw?

950
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,065
Randall, you know Stan Knight, right?

951
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,663
Stan, this is a bright young man
from Pfizer.

952
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:58,935
Yes, we've met.

953
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,169
- Yeah. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

954
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,008
New study on Zoloft,
25% fewer side effects than Prozac.

955
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,911
So, I'm feeling good.

956
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,813
You'd do better selling him
if you got him laid.

957
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,215
Can you get me laid?

958
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,915
Stan's one of the more respected
diagnosticians in town,

959
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,581
but his real calling is pussy-hound.

960
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,716
Yes, and I think your real calling is pimp.

961
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,387
Now, you're banging Maggie Murdock,
aren't you?

962
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,086
You are.

963
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,221
You are.

964
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,858
Oh, God, those tits are unbelievable!

965
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,401
- So not fair!
- All right.

966
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,961
No, no. You don't see that a lot
in the neurologically damned.

967
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,234
What do you mean, "damned"?
You don't die from Parkinson's.

968
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,105
Well, it's not much of a life, now is it?

969
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,768
What do you mean? Interferon, L-dopa...

970
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,403
It slowed the progress
in the majority of cases.

971
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,777
Listen, Dr. Drug Rep.

972

She's a sick girl.

973
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,150
Oh. Is that what you told your wife?

974
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,481
That's none of your fucking business.

975
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,214
Maggie has all sorts of needs,

976
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,154
and I don't think a pussy like you
is up for the job.

977
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,282
Right, and a married man is?

978
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,950
- Whoa, whoa!
- You really want me to hit you again?

979
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,329
Chill out, man! Chill.
Wait! Don't get aggressive.

980
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,024
Don't get aggressive. Hey!

981
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,157
Whoa! Baby, okay. It's okay.

982
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,724
Inter-fucking-feron, really?

983
00:48:58,802 --> 00:48:59,996
- You know what?
- Hey.

984
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,059
Easy, easy.

985
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,765
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.

986
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,434
- No, no, no. I'm going home.
- Good. Say hi to your wife.

987
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,602
I'm keeping my eyes on you, buddy.

988
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,975
That freaked me out. (EXHALING)

989

(LAUGHS)

990
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,976
He actually, physically hit you, didn't he?

991
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,213
Yeah, he did, and I was afraid
he was going to do it again.

992
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,312
He might have to up his meds,
that young man.

993
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,983
Or maybe he needs to change to
a drug that's proven more effective

994
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,890
in controlling aggressive behavior.

995
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:29,729
Zoloft produced 13% fewer outbursts
in a controlled study of adult males.

996
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,796
And I think it's...

- No.

What are you doing? Are you calling her?

1008
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,074
Hey, did she go down on you?

1009

Did you call me?

1013
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,612
No. I did not call you.

1014
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,612
I think you did.

1015
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,753
And what would I have said
if I had called you?

1016
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:26,687
That you want to see me?

1017
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,355
Well, that would be nice,
except I didn't call you.

1018
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,451
Do you want to see me?

1019

I'm hanging up now.

1020

No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

Shut up.

1027

Do you have a brain tumor?
Were you molested by a Care Bear?

1028
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,126
Were you abducted by aliens?

1029
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,222
You hate women.

1030
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,767
Why else would you
screw so many of them?

1031

It's time for you to overdose.

Oh! Oh!

1033

Oh, she rejected you!

that's ever happened.

I can't talk right now, all right?

00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,314

Yes. Yes, Canada.

- Okay. Let's go.

We waited two weeks...

01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,940
It feels like a frozen Popsicle.

1730
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,708
Shit. I didn't know that could even happen.

1731
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:33,645
It's very rare, but it happens.

1732
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,342
- Do you think they'll have to amputate?
- Shut the fuck up, Josh, and drive!

1733
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:37,406
Bad joke.

1736
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:43,681
- So fucking...
- Sorry.

1737
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,355
You know, for whatever it's worth,

1738
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:48,054
this has truly been
the best night of my life.

1739
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:49,153
That's wonderful.

1740
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,891
No, seriously. I'm not even kidding.

1741
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,429
And I have you to thank for it.

1742
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,526
I mean, I never thought I would have
an experience like this ever in my life.

1743
01:32:55,770 --> 01:33:00,070
And this is the incredible thing.
This is why I'm so happy right now.

1744
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:05,336
Because I fucked that girl.
Oh, my shit, I fucked that girl!

1745
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,402
And I'm thinking to myself,

1746
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,143
"Oh, my God, this is empty!
I feel absolutely nothing at all!"

1747
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:12,118
- That's great, Josh.
- Yeah.

1748
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,950
All those years I was so jealous of you
for having empty sex,

1749
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,887
and now I was the one
having the empty sex,

1750
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,893
and I realized in that moment
that if I hadn't experienced it,

1751
01:33:20,227 --> 01:33:24,493
I wouldn't have known
how much I didn't want it. You know?

1752
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:29,366
And now I can go back home to Farrah
and feel really good about myself

1753
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:33,669
for the first time in my entire life.

1754
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,273
And it's all because of you, Jamie.

1755
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:37,374
It's all because of my big brother Jamie,

1756
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,811
with the enormous cock
that won't go down!

- Hi.
- Hi.

1762
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,128
- Can I help you?
- I'm having a drug reaction.

1763
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:02,666
What kind of drug reaction?

1764
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,407

you've wanted. That's incredible, man.

I wanted you to think
I wanted to go to Chicago,

01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,785
so you'd want to go to Chicago.

1886
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:35,452
(HONKING)

1887
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:38,719
To where the puzzles and pagans lay

1888
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,459
Maggie!

1889
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:45,163
- (CONTINUES HONKING)
- Hey! Mag!

1890
01:41:49,236 --> 01:41:50,225
(INAUDIBLE) Jamie?

1891
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:51,626
(INAUDIBLE) Pull over.

1892
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:53,703
(INAUDIBLE) No, I can't "pull over"!

1893
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,702
(INAUDIBLE) Just for a second! Pull over!

1894
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:02,348
(ENUNCIATING) I need to talk

1895
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:03,673
(INAUDIBLE) to you.

1896
01:42:04,551 --> 01:42:07,748
(INAUDIBLE) I don't want to talk to you.

1897
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:14,283
When I wake up
someone will sweep up my lazy bones

1898
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:22,292
And we will rise in the cool of the evening

1899
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,901
Wait, wait. Okay.

1900
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,505
Open the door. (GROANS) Okay.

1901
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,575
(PANTING)

1902
01:42:36,683 --> 01:42:37,843
Sorry.

1903
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:42,449
- I need you.
- Please go away.

1904
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,814
I drove a really long way to say that.

1905
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:46,052
What? Am I supposed to be impressed?

1906
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:47,717
(WHISPERS) I don't know. Yes.

1907
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:52,732
Look, can you just get off the bus
so we can talk for a second?

1908
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:55,662
- Just for a second.
- We're on a schedule.

1909
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:57,964
Five minutes. Please.

1910
01:42:59,106 --> 01:43:01,597
You guys don't mind
if we take five minutes, do you?

1911
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:03,199
He's handsome.

1912
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:05,609
- Five minutes.
- He is.

1913
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,340
Five minutes, then I'll let you go.

1914
01:43:07,548 --> 01:43:08,845
(SIGHS)

1915
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:19,885
I'm full of shit, okay?

1916
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:26,088
No, I'm knowingly full of shit.

1917
01:43:29,136 --> 01:43:30,467
Because...

1918
01:43:31,638 --> 01:43:33,003
Because...

1919
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:36,602
I have...

1920
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:41,945
I have never cared about anybody,
or anything, in my entire life.

1921
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:44,850
And the thing is,
everybody just kind of accepted that.

1922
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:46,943
Like, "That's just Jamie!"

1923
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:51,814
And then you...

1924
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,393
Jesus.

1925
01:43:57,097 --> 01:43:58,257
You.

1926
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:04,027
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

1927
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:05,264
You.

1928
01:44:09,943 --> 01:44:11,205
You didn't see me that way.

1929
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:16,842
I have never known anyone

1930
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:22,511
who actually believed that I was enough.

1931
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:26,322
Until I met you.

1932
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:36,734
And then you made me believe it, too.

1933
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:42,675
So, unfortunately,

1934
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,034
I need you.

1935
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,541
And you need me.

1936
01:44:50,484 --> 01:44:51,644
No, I don't.

1937
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:54,076
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

1938
01:44:54,154 --> 01:44:55,178
Yes, you do.

1939
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:56,749
Stop it. Stop saying that.

1940
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:59,582
- You need someone to take care of you.
- No, I don't.

1941
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,452
Everybody does.

1942
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:11,762
(SOBBING) I'm going to need you
more than you need me.

1943
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:16,405
- That's okay.
- No, it's not!

1944
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:19,038
It isn't fair.

1945
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:23,378
I have places to go.

1946
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:25,607
You'll go there.

1947
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:29,145
I just may have to carry you.

1948
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:39,130
I can't ask you to do that.

1949
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:42,261
You didn't.

1950
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:50,001
Hey,

1951
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,840
let's just say in some

1952
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:58,248
alternate universe,
there's a couple that's just like us, okay?

1953
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:01,719
Only she's healthy and he's perfect.

1954
01:46:02,456 --> 01:46:06,449
And their world is about how much money
that they're gonna spend on vacation,

1955
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:08,790
or who's in a bad mood that day,

1956
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:11,490
or whether they feel guilty
about having a cleaning lady.

1957
01:46:11,565 --> 01:46:12,793
(LAUGHS)

1958
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:16,128
I don't want to be those people.

1959
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,261
I want us.

1960
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:23,469
You.

1961
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:26,872
This.

1962
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:46,393
JAMIE: I used to worry a lot about
who I'd be when I grew up.

1963
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:51,994
You know,
like how much money I'd make or...

1964
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:55,074
Someday I'd become some big deal.

1965
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,945
Sometimes the thing you most want
doesn't happen.

1966
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:06,913
And sometimes the thing
you never expect to happen, does.

1967
01:47:08,155 --> 01:47:11,989
Like giving up my job in Chicago
and everything,

1968
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:16,520
and deciding to stay
and apply to med school.

1969
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:19,521
I don't know.

1970
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:22,094
You meet thousands of people,

1971
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:25,435
and none of them really touch you.

1972
01:47:27,707 --> 01:47:30,198
And then you meet one person,

1973
01:47:31,211 --> 01:47:34,874
and your life is changed forever.

1974
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,643
(FIDELITY PLAYING)

1975
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:41,712
Suppose I never ever saw you

1976
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:46,387
Suppose we never ever called

1977
01:47:48,528 --> 01:47:52,294
Suppose I kept on singing love songs

1978
01:47:52,365 --> 01:47:56,961
Just to break my own fall

1979
01:47:57,037 --> 01:48:01,303
Just to break my fall

1980
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:07,110
Just to break my fall

1981
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:12,043
Just to break my fall

1982
01:48:12,953 --> 01:48:17,447
Break my fall
Break my fall

1983
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:22,659
All my friends say
that of course it's gonna get better

1984
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:23,889
Gonna get better

1985
01:48:23,964 --> 01:48:30,460
Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better!

1986
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:33,836
I never love nobody fully

1987
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:39,245
Always one foot on the ground

1988
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:45,374
And by protecting my heart truly

1989
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:50,048
I got lost in the sounds

1990
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:55,288
I hear in my mind all of these voices

1991
01:48:55,362 --> 01:49:00,493
I hear in my mind all of these words

1992
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:05,664
I hear in my mind all of this music

1993
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:10,472
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

1994
01:49:10,777 --> 01:49:15,680
I hear in my mind all of these voices

1995
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:20,914
I hear in my mind all of these words

1996
01:49:20,987 --> 01:49:26,357
I hear in my mind all of this music

1997
01:49:26,426 --> 01:49:30,624
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

1998
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:35,731
It breaks my heart

1999
01:49:36,603 --> 01:49:40,937
When it breaks my heart

2000
01:49:41,975 --> 01:49:46,036
When it breaks my heart

2001
01:49:47,013 --> 01:49:49,413
When it breaks my heart

2002
01:49:49,482 --> 01:49:51,973
Breaks my heart

2003
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:54,179
When it breaks my heart

2004
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,113
When it breaks my heart

2005
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:59,818
When it breaks my heart

2006
01:49:59,893 --> 01:50:02,453
When it breaks my heart
