Why don't you go to
one of those alumni events?

stingy with the pills.

No, I was just wondering why.

And then you have an
awesome yawn after that, so...

00:54:29,249 --> 00:54:33,217
I know it's tough to be single
around this time of year, so...

1274
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:37,420
Why do people always say that? The
holidays is he best time to be single.

1275
00:54:37,422 --> 00:54:39,822
Parties every night,
free-flowing booze.

1276
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:42,491
Mmm-hmm. Santa's beard
tickling your inner thigh.

1277
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:43,959
What? Night.

1278
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,593
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, take your jacket...

1279
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:47,161
Here, you want me
to get your...

1280
00:54:47,163 --> 00:54:48,428
Thanks for having us.

1281
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,164
Yeah, sure. I know it's
been tough for you.

1282
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,598
For me? Yeah.

1283
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,333
No, I'm good.

1284
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:58,969
It's really cool of your girlfriend
to be okay with me coming tonight.

1285
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:01,204
Yeah. Yeah, I know,
she's really mature.

1286
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:04,407
And, um, also, I told
her you're my cousin.

1287
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,575
Hi, baby. Hey. Hi.

1288
00:55:06,577 --> 00:55:09,177
Oh, you must be Alice.

1289
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:11,145
Hi! Hi.

KEN: Oh, Meg! (GASPS)

1293
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:20,183
Hi. Hey.

1294
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:21,450
Hi, what are you doing here?

1295
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:22,551
I brought you hot chocolate.

1296
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:23,585
For what?

1297
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,154
For drinking.

1298
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,122
Oh, I have to be back
at work in eight minutes.

1299
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,056
Perfect.

1300
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,490
Oh, thank you. Sure.

1301
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,692
That was nice. Hi.

1302
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,060
It's good to see you.
You look good.

1303
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:34,628
Oh, oh, there's
bourbon in there.

1304
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,062
Also, was that
a real-life spit take?

1305
00:55:36,064 --> 00:55:38,097
Mmm. I've never seen
one in real life.

1306
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:39,898
I just sort of thought
it would be like...

1307
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:42,299
(SPITTING)

1308
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:43,500
Wow. You know?

1309
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:45,235
(GIGGLES) Yeah.

1310
00:55:45,237 --> 00:55:46,436
That was good, yeah.

1311
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:47,904
I can't drink alcohol right now

1312
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:50,706
because I'm
about to deliver a baby.

1313
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:52,641
It's so cool you're a doctor.

1314
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:54,542
It's so cool that you're...

1315
00:55:54,544 --> 00:55:56,143
A receptionist.

1316
00:55:56,145 --> 00:56:00,447
Oh, okay. So, what's the male
version of a receptionist?

1317
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:02,248
Receptionist. Oh.

1318
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,316
Oh, I just love the
thrill of it, you know?

1319
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:06,751
Like, "Hello? Hold, please. "Hello?
I'll see if she's available."

1320
00:56:06,753 --> 00:56:08,619
But I'm thinking about
quitting. I don't know.

1321
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:11,221
It's starting to feel like the
restaurant I worked at. (JINGLING)

1322
00:56:11,223 --> 00:56:16,159
Oh. Oh, shit. Christmas trees.

1323
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:17,460
Come on, we'll get one.

1324
00:56:17,462 --> 00:56:20,095
Okay. I mean, I don't
get Christmas trees, but...

1325
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:23,364
Oh, are you Jewish? No, I just
don't get Christmas trees.

1326
00:56:23,366 --> 00:56:24,965
Oh, so, you're a monster.

1327
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:28,334
No, I'm just never home, and
I would definitely kill it.

1328
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:29,668
No.

1329
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,069
And then those needles
fall into the rug

1330
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:33,471
and stab your feet
when you walk on them.

1331
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,738
Okay.

1332
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,140
All right.
Look at this guy, right?

1333
00:56:37,142 --> 00:56:39,108
That's the John McClane
of Christmas trees.

1334
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,976
Like, you cannot kill this guy.

1335
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:42,777
We load him up with
a bunch of water,

1336
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:45,713
stuff one of those self-pouring
cat bottles on the side,

1337
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:47,347
you're good to go for,
like, three weeks.

1338
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:49,015
I'm telling you, you're gonna
be begging this guy to die.

1339
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:50,616
Yeah. Then, in three weeks

1340
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:52,584
we throw this guy
out on the street,

1341
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:54,252
and get ready
for Valentine's Day.

1342
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:55,853
"We" get ready
for Valentine's Day?

1343
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:58,121
Yeah, hearts, candy, you name it.
Oh.

1344
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,823
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's not...

1345
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:03,392
Listen, in three
weeks from now,

1346
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:06,895
I think the novelty of this
whole thing will have worn off

1347
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:11,633
and I think, the reality will set in,
which is that I work all the time

1348
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:13,301
and I probably would
never see you,

1349
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:16,637
and I'd probably have to
cancel all of our dates.

1350
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,239
And, when I did
finally see you,

1351
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,574
I would probably just
fall asleep on your face.

1352
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:23,042
Oh... Yeah, and then,

1353
00:57:23,044 --> 00:57:24,710
.you would go off,
and meet some girl at the gym.

1354
00:57:24,712 --> 00:57:27,646
Because you obviously have a lot
of time to spend at the gym

1355
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:29,214
and so would she, and

1356
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,848
I don't even know why we're
having this conversation.

1357
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,649
I mean, you are
obviously not a real thing

1358
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:35,785
and I feel like we're wasting
air even talking about it.

1359
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:38,154
And I have hip problems,
real hip problems,

1360
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:40,055
and not from doing fun things,

1361
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:42,791
like having sex,
but from gravity.

1362
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,492
And what we had was great.

1363
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:48,562
Thank you for
helping me out with that.

1364
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:49,863
That was fun.

1365
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:52,799
But you will find
a girl your own age

1366
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:54,133
and then you can do fun things

1367
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:55,968
like look for trees
and whatever.

1368
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,404
But that's not what's happening
here, between you and me, so...

1369
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:00,571
Just so you know.

1370
00:58:00,573 --> 00:58:02,472
I have to get back to work now.

1371

1373
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:07,842
Fine, we won't get
a Christmas tree!

1379
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:35,830
Yeah.

1382
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,900
Do you want to go see
the Rockefeller tree?

1383
00:58:41,902 --> 00:58:43,368
Right now? Yeah.

1384
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,437
No, Buzz-Cut and Dimples
are visiting from Italy,

1385
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,972
and they want to know all about
American Christmas traditions

1386
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:51,174
like us sitting on their faces.

1387
00:58:51,176 --> 00:58:53,643
No. No.
Come on, it's Christmas!

1388
00:58:53,645 --> 00:58:55,911
I'm not gonna do that tonight.

1389
00:58:55,913 --> 00:58:58,079
Why? Their dicks probably
look like cannolis.

1390

I'll call you tomorrow.

Hey.

00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:50,456
I feel like I know you.

1397
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,391
God, I wish I had one of
your business cards,

1398
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:53,892
so I could
remember who you are.

Yeah, you're the, um,
fancy married guy,

with the kid and the buildings.

1402
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:02,699
Uh, I'm not married.

1403
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:04,467
Um, I do have a daughter.

1404
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:06,135
Oh.

1405
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:07,603
And I'm fancy. Yeah.

1406
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,372
You're wearing a scarf on
the outside of your jacket.

1407
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,507
Which...
That serves zero purpose.

Um...

1410

Uh, this is super
random, but do you

1411
01:00:19,414 --> 01:00:22,614
want to go see
the Rockefeller tree with me?

1412
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,282
No? That's a big "no."

1413
01:00:25,284 --> 01:00:26,850
No, no.

1414
01:00:26,852 --> 01:00:28,318
I know it's probably like so
crowded with so many tourists,

1415
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,986
I don't know why
I even want to do that.

1416
01:00:29,988 --> 01:00:33,222
I just... I was just thinking,
I want to show you something.

1417
01:00:34,525 --> 01:00:35,624
Okay.

1418
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:40,294
(WHISPERS) All right.
This door.

1419
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,063
Aye.

1420
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:45,397
You know what?
I am just realizing now

1421
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:47,065
that I've gone with
a complete stranger,

1422
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:51,368
to an abandoned location
covered in plastic.

1423
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:54,704
So, if you're
gonna Dexter me...

1424
01:00:54,706 --> 01:00:56,472
You know what? Honestly?

1425
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,507
Dying would not be the worst
thing in the world, right now.

1426
01:00:58,509 --> 01:01:00,475
What is happening?
All right. Close your eyes.

1427

on this road trip together.

And I would be driving,
and then I'd get tired

to let you drive.

01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:26,118
I don't want you
to be my best man.

1902
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,086
We still love you,
you're family.

1903
01:24:28,088 --> 01:24:29,887
You'll definitely be
invited to the wedding.

1904
01:24:29,889 --> 01:24:31,021
Okay.

1905
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:32,922
But, probably not.
So, don't be offended.

1906
01:24:32,924 --> 01:24:34,690
I'm glad we had this talk, man.

1907
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,593
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
ALL: Whoo!

1908
01:24:41,064 --> 01:24:42,129
Whoo!

1909
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,598
DAVID: <i>Uh...</i>

1910
01:24:46,467 --> 01:24:48,467
You trying to hide from me?

1911
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:50,936
Are you hiding from me? Hi.
Huh? Hi.

1912
01:24:50,938 --> 01:24:53,338
I didn't see you,
right over there.

1913
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,605
It's a good hiding spot.

1914
01:24:55,274 --> 01:24:57,440
Uh, listen.

1915
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:58,874
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

1916
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:01,009
Look, David, I'm sorry, I...

1917
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:02,443
I can't do this.

1918
01:25:02,445 --> 01:25:05,446
You made it so clear to me,
that you didn't want to, so...

1919
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:06,980
That's not why
I came here at all.

1920
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:10,249
I just came here
to apologize to you

1921
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:12,050
for being such an asshole.

1922
01:25:12,052 --> 01:25:13,151
Oh.

1923
01:25:13,153 --> 01:25:14,318
Yeah.

1924
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,119
(BOTH CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)

1925
01:25:16,121 --> 01:25:17,653
Well, you were right
about Phoebe.

1926
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:19,454
Oh, good. Did you talk to her?

1927
01:25:19,456 --> 01:25:22,323
Well, um, you know,
I'm working on it.

1928
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,392
But, uh, are you okay?

1929
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:26,926
(CHORTLES)

1930
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:30,595
I'm working on it.

1931
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:36,966
Happy Birthday.

1932
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,308
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

1933
01:25:51,481 --> 01:25:53,581
See? I told you
this would be fun.

1934
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:56,016
Although, I thought one of them
was, like, gonna punch each other

1935
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:57,584
and that hasn't happened yet.

1936
01:25:57,586 --> 01:26:00,153
Robin, this isn't a joke.
This is my life.

1937
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,755
But you know what? I guess you
wouldn't actually understand that,

1938
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,723
because you've
never really cared

1939
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:06,157
about anybody enough
to ever get hurt.

1940
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,759
So, this type of thing
doesn't affect you.

1941
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:11,294
Okay. I'm sorry I invited them,

1942
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,495
but who gives a shit about me?

1943
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,129
I do, because you're my friend!

1944
01:26:14,131 --> 01:26:16,798
Am I? Because
as far as I can tell,

1945
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,100
you only ever want to hang out
with me when you get dumped

1946
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:20,868
and you need someone
to cheer you up.

1947
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,202
Well, you only ever
hang out with me

1948
01:26:22,204 --> 01:26:24,404
when you need me
to be your little sidekick.

1949
01:26:24,406 --> 01:26:28,174
The reason why I don't hang around with
you when you're in a relationship,

1950
01:26:28,176 --> 01:26:33,245
is because you just turn into this
lame-ass shell of a human being.

1951
01:26:33,247 --> 01:26:34,512
Nice.

1952
01:26:34,514 --> 01:26:35,446
Yeah, do you want
some real advice?

1953
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:36,680
Yeah, what?

1954
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:38,882
You're not gonna
find the right guy

1955
01:26:38,884 --> 01:26:41,351
by bumming free drinks
and slutting it up.

1956
01:26:41,353 --> 01:26:42,952
Where is this coming from?

1957
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:44,920
This whole time, you've
been the one that's like,

1958
01:26:44,922 --> 01:26:47,856
"Oh, yeah, parties
and dicks and shots.

1959
01:26:47,858 --> 01:26:50,124
"Let's put shots
all over our bodies."

1960
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:51,725
"More sparkles, bitch!"

1961
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:53,927
It's about me
being sick of you just

1962
01:26:53,929 --> 01:26:56,262
meeting guys and
falling into their dick-sand.

1963
01:26:56,264 --> 01:26:57,396
Falling into their what?

1964
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,197
Their dick-sand.

1965
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,866
It's like, every time
a guy just looks at you,

1966
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:03,801
you just forget
who you are, and,

1967
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:06,203
like... (MOCKINGLY) "Oh!"

1968
01:27:06,205 --> 01:27:08,805
You get sucked
into their world.

1969
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,640
At least when I do
decide I want a boyfriend,

1970
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,209
I'm gonna find someone who
likes me for who I really am,

1971
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:16,612
because I know
who the fuck that is.

1972
01:27:28,524 --> 01:27:30,023
(EXHALES)

1973
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:01,486
Hey.

1974
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:02,887
Oh, my God.

1975
01:28:03,456 --> 01:28:05,155
Happy Birthday.

1976
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:06,489
(SCOFFS)

1977
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,724
It's your birthday!

1978
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,893
And I drank some of your gift.

1979
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:22,101
You okay?

1980
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,439
No. No.

1981
01:28:35,314 --> 01:28:37,914
God, you look pretty
when you're pissed.

1982
01:28:46,123 --> 01:28:48,256
I missed these. (CHUCKLES)

1983
01:28:51,153 --> 01:28:53,394
What are we doing?
We're about to have sex.

1984
01:28:53,396 --> 01:28:54,477
What?

1985
01:28:55,022 --> 01:28:57,062
God. What?

1986
01:28:57,064 --> 01:29:00,398
So, ever since I saw you,
I feel like we fucked up.

1987
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,899
I shouldn't have let you go.

1988
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:06,469
Because Michelle
and I are still together,

1989
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,204
and we're actually engaged

1990
01:29:08,206 --> 01:29:10,339
and I feel like we're fucking up.
What? What?

1991
01:29:10,341 --> 01:29:14,142
We're getting married, but I don't
know if I want to do it yet.

1992
01:29:14,144 --> 01:29:15,176
Oh, my God.

1993
01:29:15,178 --> 01:29:17,878
Wait! I'm just telling...
Oh, my God.

1994
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,379
Oh, my God.
Come here, come here.

1995
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:21,447
You just let me make out
with somebody else's fiance.

1996
01:29:21,449 --> 01:29:24,082
No, it's not cheating, since
we've already been together.

1997
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:25,950
What are you doing?
Wait, just...

1998
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:27,484
You told me you missed me!

1999
01:29:27,486 --> 01:29:29,752
I... That's the whole point,
I miss you all the time.

2000
01:29:29,754 --> 01:29:35,423
I saw you and you were so beautiful,
and you are so beautiful.

2001
01:29:35,425 --> 01:29:37,224
And I just need closure.

2002
01:29:37,226 --> 01:29:38,592
I think we need...
Is that what this...

2003
01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:40,226
This is closure for you? Yeah.

2004

<i>Just one last screw
for old times' sake,</i>

2005
01:29:42,196 --> 01:29:45,030
before you go and settle
down with somebody else?

2006
01:29:45,032 --> 01:29:46,431
(SIGHS) That's not...

2007
01:29:47,567 --> 01:29:50,301
I'm sorry, all right?

2008
01:29:50,303 --> 01:29:51,535
Uh, Alice.

2009
01:29:51,537 --> 01:29:52,669
No, you know, what?

2010
01:29:52,671 --> 01:29:55,271
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

2011
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:58,073
I spent so much time
wanting you back

2012
01:29:58,075 --> 01:30:00,408
that, when I thought
that you wanted me back,

2013
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:03,978
it's like I lost
my mind for a second.

2014
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,913
Oh, my God. This is it!
This is the dick-sand.

2015
01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:07,681
I'm falling into your
dick-sand right now.

2016
01:30:07,683 --> 01:30:08,948
What?

2017
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:09,982
It's like quicksand,
but with dicks.

2018
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:11,416
I don't have dick-sand.

2019
01:30:11,418 --> 01:30:14,018
I'm so obsessed with
the idea of being in love,

2020
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:18,455
that I just, it's like...
I completely lose myself.

2021
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:22,225
Like, I forget what I want
and I just disappear.

I'm like the horse
in <i>The Neverending Story.</i>

I don't think it's coming out
like it's inside your head.

01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:30,897
Josh. I want to be alone.

2025

I know that
I've said that a lot.

2026
01:30:34,435 --> 01:30:36,435
But, for the first time
in my life,

2027
01:30:36,437 --> 01:30:40,405
I really, really,
truly mean it.
