Another planet.

What the hell?
Damn it, Jeb, I told you.

490
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:28,113
You never said nothing about
keeping the kid away from her.

491
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:31,033
Jamie, that is not Melanie!
She's never coming back.

492
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,618
It's still her body
that we've hurt.

493
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:33,785
Get out of here now, Jamie,

494
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:34,953
or so help me, I'll...
Jared.

495
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:40,918
I'll look after Jamie.

496

497

JARED: I don't trust it.

498
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:51,720
Could be another Seeker.

499
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,055
She...
It

500
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:56,934
is the furthest
thing from a Seeker
I've ever seen.

501
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,936
I mean, she jumped
between you and Kyle.
They don't do that.

502

It was trying to find a way
to stay alive and escape.

503
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,815
What, by giving
Kyle the go-ahead
to kill her? It?

504
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:04,942
That's a good plan.

gotten into everybody?

It is the enemy.
Don't forget it.

You don't feel bad at all.
I mean, I half killed her.

It doesn't matter.
It's not human.

509

I fell through the roof.

No one's found it on

552

Everyone here thinks
you're going to betray
us to the Seekers.

553
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,289
Makes sense.

554
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:14,209
Why else
would you be here?

555
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:18,046
What I can't wrap
my head around is
what kind of a plan was that?

556
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,590
Walking into the desert
with no backup

557
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,426
and no way
to get yourself back?

558
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,344
So if,
like you say, you weren't
coming here for the Seekers,

559
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,305
why were you doing it?

560
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:29,433
Then I started thinking,
when they put one of you
in our heads,

561
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:33,103
do we still exist?
Trapped in there?

562
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:36,940
If our memories are
still alive, are we?

563
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,610
You gotta believe
some people wouldn't
go down without a fight.

564
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,111
Hell, I know
I wouldn't go quiet.

565
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,864
And I've never seen
fight like in Mel.

566
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:47,868
What she'd fight for,
more than anything,
is the people that she loves.

567
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,623
I wonder

568
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:57,544
if a love like that might
play on someone's mind.

570
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:05,219
It might get
somebody to do something
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

Sure he did.

Oh, come on.
We all know what happened.

846
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,481
He tried to kill her.

And for some unknown reason,
she saved his sorry ass.

848

If it's true,
Kyle, you're out.

849

Did he try to kill you?

It's not saying he did.

Don't you even
look at her wrong.

I haven't shot anyone

JARED: No.

We lost a lot
on that last run.

861

There are a couple
of things that I need.

Take Kyle with you.

863

Come on, Kyle.

864
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:42,798
And, you,

keep away from her.

866
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,456
You want to take a walk?

867
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:22,212
Didn't Jared tell you
to stay away from me?

868

Yeah.

Let me guess.

881
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:22,564
You're of two minds
about it.

882
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:25,609
Is this about Jared?

883

<i>Yes, it's about Jared.</i>

884
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,987
Melanie is in love with him.

885
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,072
And you?

886
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:32,199
<i>Tell him. Tell him!</i>

887
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,286
This body loves him.

888
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,165
Since it is now my body,

889
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:43,794
so do I.

890
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,133
But I also have
feelings of my own.

891

<i>No, you don't.</i>

<i>What about Jared?</i>

896
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,321
This is very complicated.

897
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,744
Is there any way Melanie
can give us some privacy?

898
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,914
Look the other way
a moment?

899
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:21,957
Step into the other room?

<i>You wish.</i>

I don't think that's
possible right now.

it's not really me you like.

Okay.

You're angry when
I kiss a man you do love

and angry when
I kiss a man you don't.

01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:14,763
I trusted you.

972
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:25,732
There's something else.

973
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:32,281
Melanie? Are you there?

974
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:36,785
Melanie, where are you?
Jamie is hurt.
I need you. Talk to me.

975
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:40,289
Melanie, please come back.
I can't do this without you.

976
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:55,387
Wanda.

977
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,308
I want you to know about

978
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:01,310
Doc and everything.

979
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:02,811
Don't worry about that now.

980
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:05,814
We have to get you better.

981
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:10,319
You sound like Melanie.

982
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:16,158
Did Melanie
say that just then?

983
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:22,206
Yes.

984
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:29,838
IAN: Wanda.
I need you to kiss me.

985
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:33,801
What about Melanie?
Don't worry about Melanie.

986
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:43,727
No. Kiss me like
you want to get slapped.

987
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:56,156
What?
Was she stopping you?

988
01:25:56,156 --> 01:26:00,369
No. That's the problem.
We're alone. She's gone.

989
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:03,247
Ever since I told
her to get out of
my head, she's...

990
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:04,915
I'm afraid I've lost her.

991
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:07,543
She got so angry
before when you kissed me.

992
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:09,461
I thought she'd come back.

993
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:16,218
Then I guess you'll have to
make her really angry.

994
01:26:21,306 --> 01:26:22,641
(CLUCKING)

995
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:34,403
Kiss her.

996
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:39,241
I lost Melanie.

997
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:43,871
I don't know
if she's still there.

998
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:46,915
You need to bring her back.
She hates me kissing you.

999
01:26:54,923 --> 01:26:56,383
Okay.

1000
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:23,243
JARED: Melanie, come back.

1001
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:25,954
I will not lose you.

1002
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:32,961
<i>MELANIE:  Jared.</i>

1003
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,630
Melanie?

1004
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,799
<i>Oh. Stop!(GRUNTS)</i>

1005
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:40,803
Melanie, you bit me!

1006
01:27:40,803 --> 01:27:42,262
<i>Wanda, what the hell?</i>

1007
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:43,639
Melanie,
I'm so glad you're back.

1008
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:44,723
<i>Did I leave?</i>

1009
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:46,433
For three days.

1010
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,268
You don't know
what I've been through
to find you.

1011
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:49,978
<i>Yeah, you look like
you were suffering.</i>

1012
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:52,314
We have to help Jamie.
He's hurt.

1013
01:27:53,524 --> 01:27:54,942
Come on.

1014
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:56,693
JARED: Stop.

1015
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:57,820
Stop.

1016
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,321
Where are you going?

1017
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:01,281
It's infected.
It's got into
Jamie's bloodstream.

1018
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:03,283
He needs medicine.

1019
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,035
There's no medicine out there.
You souls have
destroyed it all.

1020
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:06,870
He doesn't need
your medicine.

1021
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:08,997
It's too late for that.
He needs ours.

1022
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:10,707
You have to take
me out of the cave.

1023
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,293
You'll have to trust me.

1024
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,860
Cut me.
I need a wound
like Jamie's.

1025
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:39,778
I can't do that.

1026
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:40,696
I'll be healed in minutes.

1027
01:28:46,702 --> 01:28:48,662
<i>MELANIE:  Take it from him.
Do it yourself.</i>

1028
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:59,047
They'll be
suspicious of this scar.
I can cover it with a cut.

1029
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:02,885
It's gonna be okay.

1030
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,064
Excuse me.

1031
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,817
Goodness.
We have an emergency.

1032
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:20,903
<i>You can do this, Wanda.</i>

1033
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:23,113
I'm Healer Skye.

1034
01:29:23,906 --> 01:29:25,407
What happened?

1035
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:27,034
<i>Tell her you tripped.</i>

1036
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:28,410
<i>Tell her you tripped!</i>

1037
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,661
I tripped.

1038
01:29:31,788 --> 01:29:33,665
<i>With a knife in your hand.</i>

1039
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:35,751
With a knife in my hand,
cut myself.

1040
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:38,462
You poor thing.

1041
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:40,631
Let's fix you up.

1042
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:58,899
Heal.

1043
01:30:01,485 --> 01:30:02,820
Seal.

1044
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:15,582
If it is no trouble,
could I please
have some water?

1045
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:17,125
Of course.

1046
01:30:20,504 --> 01:30:21,922
<i>Hurry! Take it!</i>

1047
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,607
What do you think?

1048
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:42,109
Perfect.

1049
01:30:43,443 --> 01:30:44,486
Thank you.

1050
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:46,655
Goodbye.

1051
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:57,082
<i>What are you doing?
We have to go.</i>

1052
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:26,028
JARED: Is he alive?

1053
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:27,613
Barely.

1054
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:28,697
DOC: What is all that?

1055
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:30,157
Medicine.

1056
01:31:30,157 --> 01:31:32,201
Wait! No. No.
We don't know
what that'll do.

1057
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:33,785
She knows what she's doing.

1058
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:35,662
We all know
what will happen
if we do nothing.

1059
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:36,538
He'll die.

1060
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:38,248
JARED: Doc.

1061
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:40,083
It's okay.

1062
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:41,543
WANDERER: Please.

1063
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:49,218
Do it.

1064
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,223
Doc, do it.

1065
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:09,822
That's it.

1066
01:32:13,575 --> 01:32:15,244
<i>MELANIE:  Come on, Jamie.
Open your eyes.</i>

1067
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,038
<i>Please.</i>

1068
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,252
Jamie.
Hey, buddy.

1069
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:32,261
You're getting good, Doc.
(ALL LAUGHING)

1070
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:54,950
<i>I've walked out of
plenty of stores
without paying.</i>

1071
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:57,327
<i>First time anyone's
been happy about it.</i>

1072
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,835
I liked it better
when we were stealing.

1073
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:06,587
You spoil everything,
Wanda.

1074
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:27,024
WANDERER: No, Wes!

1075
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:43,165
Hello, Wanderer.

1076
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:48,879
Seeker.

1077
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:14,655
Why did you waste
the medicine on me?

1078
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:17,908
Aren't you
going to kill me?

1079
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:23,997
Can I speak
to her alone?

1080
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:25,707
<i>MELANIE:  Does that include me?</i>

1081
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:28,877
<i>I guess it does.</i>

1082
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:30,838
We'll be outside,
Wanda.

1083
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:35,175
You just say the word.

1084
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:42,224
SEEKER: Huh!

1085
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:44,143
Wanda?

1086
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:45,894
Surely,
you go by "Melanie" now.

1087
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,274
Did you ask to kill me
yourself, Melanie?

1088
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,193
What are you
waiting for?

1089
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:55,904
I'm not here
to kill you.

1090
01:34:56,446 --> 01:34:57,739
Oh.

1091
01:35:02,202 --> 01:35:04,246
You're my interrogator.

1092
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:13,922
I do want to
know something.

1093
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:19,178
Why?

1094
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:22,222
Why couldn't you
just let me go?

1095
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:24,266
Because I was right.

1096
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:30,105
I know the threat
a weak soul like
you represents.

1097
01:35:30,105 --> 01:35:33,775
Unlike you,
I am doing my duty.
I am fighting for us.

1098
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:35,861
We cannot live with them
like the other worlds.

1099
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:39,072
You, more than anyone,
know that.

1100
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:42,993
Did you come alone?

1101
01:35:44,453 --> 01:35:46,788
Other Seekers will
come looking for me,

1102
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:49,166
just like I came
looking for you.

1103
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,293
No one else is
coming to find you.

1104
01:35:52,795 --> 01:35:56,173
You die,
and the danger
dies with you.

1105
01:35:57,132 --> 01:35:59,009
The people here
will be safe.

1106
01:36:01,929 --> 01:36:03,847
So you are
going to kill me.

1107
01:36:13,816 --> 01:36:17,194
<i>Wanda, what is this?
What are you thinking?</i>

1108
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:20,322
<i>Don't put up
walls against me.
Talk to me.</i>

1109
01:36:51,854 --> 01:36:53,230
Wanda?

1110
01:36:56,817 --> 01:36:58,527
I never got the chance
to say how truly...

1111
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:00,362
There's a way
to make up for it.

1112
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:05,409
what you have been
ending so many lives
trying to do.

1113
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:08,453
I can take a soul
from a body.

1114
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:10,080
<i>MELANIE:  You can do what?</i>

1115
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:13,375
<i>What are you saying, Wanda?</i>

1116
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:15,544
I will only
give you this knowledge

1117
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:18,464
on the condition
you do as I ask

1118
01:37:18,464 --> 01:37:20,883
and promise that no harm
will come to any soul.

1119
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,552
I can promise you that.

1120
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:26,889
There's one other thing
you must promise.

1121
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:29,892
And you must promise
to keep it a secret.

1122
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,900
You have to let me die.

1123
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,067
<i>No! No! No!</i>

1124
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,862
I can't do that, Wanda.

1125
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:45,491
I... I can't.

1126
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:47,618
It's the only way
I can give you
what you want.

1127
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,244
<i>Wanda.</i>

1128
01:37:50,078 --> 01:37:51,205
<i>No.</i>

1129
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:05,260
She's out.

1130
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:08,096
JEB: So you don't want us
to kill the Seeker.

1131
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:11,892
She killed Wes.
Who knows how many others?

1132
01:38:11,892 --> 01:38:13,602
She wouldn't blink
about butchering us.

1133
01:38:13,602 --> 01:38:15,312
There's been
too much killing.

1134
01:38:16,605 --> 01:38:18,607
Not death. Exile.

1135
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:22,569
You want us to forgive her.

1136
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:25,280
And let them go,
just like that?

1137
01:38:26,406 --> 01:38:27,616
Yes.

1138
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:44,383
We souls can leave
the same way we arrived.

1139
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,636
I will send her away.

1140
01:38:47,636 --> 01:38:50,139
By the time
she reaches
another planet,

1141
01:38:50,139 --> 01:38:53,183
your grandchildren
will have died of old age.

1142
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:24,506
You have always tried
to extract it by force.

1143
01:39:26,258 --> 01:39:29,261
The secret is,
you do not remove it,

1144
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:31,346
it removes itself.

1145
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:35,434
You coax it out.

1146
01:39:37,269 --> 01:39:41,356
You have always
seen it as the enemy.
It can feel the hate.

1147
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:46,528
It can only be
captured by kindness.

1148
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:50,032
Love.

1149
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,424
Ian, help me.

01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:13,115

My name is Lacey.

1154
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,704
I've been
screaming inside for years.

1155
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:21,248
Nobody could hear me.

1156
01:41:21,248 --> 01:41:23,792
You're the reason
why she wouldn't
leave me alone.

1157
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:27,171
Yes, she wasn't
just after humans.

1158
01:41:27,171 --> 01:41:29,339
She was hoping to find
a way to fight the hosts.

1159
01:41:31,133 --> 01:41:32,426
Like me.

1160
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:35,137

1161
01:41:36,472 --> 01:41:38,474
Who fight back.

1162
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:08,170
Have a safe trip.

1163

01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:29,608

01:42:35,364 --> 01:42:37,241
I miss many things.

Don't you miss Melanie?

Don't you want

<i>MELANIE:  You know he's right.</i>

1173
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,258
Not the way
she needs to be.

1174
01:43:00,681 --> 01:43:02,391
I think it's time
to move on.

1175
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:03,851
Leave us?

1176
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:09,481
Yes.

1177
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:11,650
But you can always
come back, right?

1178
01:43:26,874 --> 01:43:30,252
I asked you here
so no one would shout.

1179
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:32,588
<i>I wish I could
shout loud enough
for them to hear.</i>

1180

As soon as I knew
what to do with the Seeker,

1181
01:43:39,261 --> 01:43:43,474
I knew there was
a way for all of you
to get your loved ones back.

1182
01:43:43,474 --> 01:43:44,892
Without hurting the souls.

1183
01:43:48,604 --> 01:43:50,272
But, of course,

1184
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:55,819
I knew I had to give
Melanie back to herself.

1185
01:43:56,904 --> 01:43:58,447
And leave.

1186
01:43:58,447 --> 01:44:00,532
That can't happen, Wanda.
We need you.

1187

a soul from a body,

you can survive without me.

1192

And what does Mel say?

1193
01:44:16,965 --> 01:44:18,675
She's always
wanted her life back.

1194

you'll think about it.

1200

Don't say it like

you the most.

I miss the future
I might have had with you.

1208
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:41,884
You're willing
to sacrifice that?

1209
01:45:41,884 --> 01:45:44,428
Sometimes we have
to make sacrifices.

1210
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:48,348
No, I can't let you go.
I won't.
Let me talk to Melanie.

She's not there right now.

1212
01:45:50,726 --> 01:45:54,688
She stepped
into the other room,
so I can kiss you.

1213

I really can't
talk you out of it?

No. It's time.

01:54:29,912 --> 01:54:31,246
I'm their friend.

1289
01:54:33,874 --> 01:54:35,209
They're human.

1290
01:54:43,008 --> 01:54:44,927
Human as you.

1291
01:54:46,637 --> 01:54:47,554
(CHUCKLES)

1292
01:54:49,223 --> 01:54:51,058
We thought we were
the last survivors.

1293
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:52,559
So did we.

1294
01:54:54,436 --> 01:54:56,605
Till we found
three other groups.

1295
01:54:57,272 --> 01:54:58,941
Now four.

1296
01:55:01,068 --> 01:55:03,487
Thought I was the only one
who switched sides.

1297
01:55:03,487 --> 01:55:05,906
I guess you never know where
you're gonna find your home.
