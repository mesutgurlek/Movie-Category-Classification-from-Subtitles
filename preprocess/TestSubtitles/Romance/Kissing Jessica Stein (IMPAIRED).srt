Emily Dickinson is too trite.
It has to be just so.

296
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,765
Well, I do have
a little history to draw from.

297
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:13,809
But even ifl didn't,
you've known Charles here...

298
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:16,478
for about an hour,
and in that time...

299
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,438
you've insulted and dismissed
a panoply of men...

300
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,273
based on factors as reductive
as a linguistic misstep,

301
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:25,276
a different view from yours
on going Dutch, a kind reaction
toyour legendary lateness,

302
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,778
and a genuine interest
in yoga.

303
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,406
You know, I think
it was Anais Nin who said,

304
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,574
"We don't see things
as they are.

305
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,576
We see things
as we are."

306

[ Chuckles ]
Generally, I'm not much ofa Nin fan,

307
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:43,372
but I do feel that bit
sums you up to a "T",Stein.

308
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:45,707
So I don't think the problem's
with these poor men--

309
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,667
these freaks and morons,
as you put it.

310
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,919
I think the problem
is with you.

311
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:27,113
Jessica?.

312
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,072
Uh,Jessica?.
I--

313
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:32,075
- Hi. I was just looking foryou.
- Hi.

00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:34,368
- Helen. Hi.
- Right. Hi.

315
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:36,786
- Good to meet you.
- I'm sorry I'm so late.

316
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,955
- I'm always late.
- Don't worry about it. Come sit.

317
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:40,956
I hopeyou didn't
wait long.

318
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:42,958
No. Well, I was just starting
to get worried...

319
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:48,712
- that maybeyou weren't
gonna show at all.
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:52,131
Um-- [ Exhales ]
Helen, right?.

321
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,883
Um, you know, gosh. I should've
said this on the phone...

322
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,843
and I didn't, and...

323
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:59,303
I'm sorrythat I didn't,
but...

324
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:04,432
you should really know that...
this isn't me.

325
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:06,100
- It isn't?.
- Not at all.

326
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:08,101

- Shit!
- Which part ofrit isn'tyou?

330
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:27,574
Oh. Uh, all of it.

331
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,283
So why did you--

332
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,451
Um, yeah, you know what?.
The truth is,

333
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,870
I've ben trying to be a little less
me lately, and that's why this.

334
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:35,830
But, really,
I'm still me, see?.

335
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,248
I see.
Well, look.

336
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:41,209
We don't have to do a whole big--
We could just get a drink.

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,127
- Yeah, I don't think so. Taxi!
- Oh, come on.

338
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,254
You don't wanna go
to your dinner so frazzled.

Right. Right.

would really help to,you know--

Look, um,
you seem really nice.

- Let me help you.

I missed myyoga class this morning,
and I'm not my usual centered self.

D.oyou do--
D.oyou doyoga regularly?

- Is that something--
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Every day, actually.

351
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,327
I find it keeps me
really strong and energized...

352
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,287
and, uh,
usually graceful.

- Haveyou never tried it?.
- Oh, no, no, no.

355

I don't think I could sit still
and breathe for long.

-I'd panic.
-So what doyou like to do for exercise?.

Oh, um,
I like basic exercise.

I like to run orwalk.
Just keep moving, you know?.

as I'm moving, I'm safe.

- Oh, bummer.
- I think that's been my big thing.

00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:48,802
Not smart or not funny,
or not smart and not funny.

but funny in
a totally unappealing way.

You know?. Just like funny/stupid,
or funny/dopey,

but not funny/witty or funny/ironic
or funny/goofy, you know?.

Or-Or they seem smart, and then
you realize that they aren't at all.

384
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:08,233
And that's funny,
but funny/tragic.

385
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:10,192
Um--

386
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,320
So anyway,
ifyou're then lucky enough...

387
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,323
to find someone who's the good kind
of smart and the good kind offunny,

- Yes, a little. Is that--
That's awful, right?.
- No.

392
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,248
Ugly doesn't do it froryou.
That's okay.

393
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,958
- Me, I'm kind of into ugly.
- What?

00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,168
As long as it's

Define.

I assumed that you had--

413

Oh, I have... also.

414
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,674
- Oh.
- Yeah, I, um--

415
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:41,175
I just find a lot
of different things sexy.

Oh. I don't.

417

the tab?.

- What?
- Yeah, it's, um, 8:1 0.
Don'tyou have a--

419

- Oh, uh, no.
- You don't?

420
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,729
- No. I lied.
- But I thought--

421
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,982
I know a great Indian place.

422
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,361
- Helen? Can I askyou a question?
- Yeah?

423

- Sure.
- What color lipstick areyou wearing?

424

Well, it's three different kinds.
I blend.

- Really?.
- Yeah.

- Real ly?. Wow.
- Would you like to know the--

427
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:21,246
- Would you feel comfortable?.
Is that something--
- No, of course.

428
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:24,916
I'd love to share.
I start with Mac Viva Glam III,

429
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:26,876
- Uh-huh. Right.
- which is a great base,

430
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,753
- and then I add
Prescriptive's Poodle on top.
- I love Prescriptive's.

431
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:32,880
- Isn't it the best?.
The moisture and the spray.
- It has the best texture.

432
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:38,009
And then I finish with Philosophy
Supernatural Nude, which is more ofa--

433
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,677
- Ofa glossy kind ofthing?.
- Exactly. For the shine.

434
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:43,137
Right. Right.
Wow.

435
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,681
- That's it.
- Wow.

436
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:49,183
Well, it looks, um,
just beautiful on you.

437
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,727
Oh, thankyou.
Hey, you should try ityourself.

438
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,937
It would look gorgeous
on your complexion.

439
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:56,439
Oh, thankyou.
But, um--

440
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,734
Yeah, the blending thing is a little
labor-intensive for me, you know?.

441
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:04,028
I'm kind oflooking
for that one.

442
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,321
Well,you'll neverfindit.

443

I call Roland when I'm hungry,

483
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,913
Selfish?. They are dealing
with their stuff and the energy
they put out to the universe.

484
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:15,666
That's a lot more valuable

Areyou saying that
my life has no value?.

487
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:24,380
No! I am saying that maybe
underneath all the neurosis,

488
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:27,799
you have a profound capacity
for happiness thatyou're
not allowing to exist.

you can gauge how
you're gonna react to something.

493
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:40,100
And I can pretty much assureyou
that I will never be made happy...

spiritual enlightenment.

I think she was a little upset.

over the weekend?.
- I left her three messages.

She didn't return any of my calls.
I think she's devastated.

1165
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,674
- Stop. Shh! You're hysterical!
- No, I'm not.

1166
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:37,593
Breathe.

1167
01:03:41,304 --> 01:03:43,305
What's she like?.

1168
01:03:43,347 --> 01:03:45,515
- She's great.
- Mmm.

1169
01:03:45,515 --> 01:03:50,602
She's, uh,
kind and witty and...

01:03:50,644 --> 01:03:55,564
quirkyandnurturing
andinvolvedandall that crap.

1171
01:03:55,606 --> 01:03:58,942
But she's a girl, you know?.
She's-She's thin.

1172
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:03,779
She has thin arms and she's soft
and attentive and it's all wrong.

1173
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,155
- How's the sex?.
- It's good.

1174
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:10,033
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1175
01:04:10,075 --> 01:04:14,620
- D.oes she makeyou laugh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, a lot. We laugh a lot.

1176
01:04:14,662 --> 01:04:18,289
- Is she as smart as you?.
- Yeah, definitely.

1177
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:21,458
- She getsyou?
- She does.

1178
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,294
She really does.
I mean,

1179
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:29,172
I think the thing is
we just really click.

1180
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:31,841
- You know?.
- Mmm.

1181
01:04:31,882 --> 01:04:35,302
Sounds likeyou definitely
need to put a stop to this.

1182
01:04:48,228 --> 01:04:50,354
Am I wearing this?.
This is so bad.

1183
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:52,397
For Rachel.
You are wearing this, my love.

1184
01:04:52,439 --> 01:04:54,399
- All right. You look beautiful.
- I look beautiful?.

1185
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:56,400
Yeah, you totally
look beautiful.

1186
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,861
- I look like a heifer
in her fifth month.
- Oh, God.

1187
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:01,446
- You wanna eat?.
- Yes, I'm starving.
Let's get out ofhere.

1188
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:04,406
Good. I made a reservation just next
door. And I left a message for Helen.

1189
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:07,408
- What?.
- There she is.

1190
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:11,245
- What?.
- I left a message for Helen
in case she wants to join us.

1191
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:13,288
- Hi, dear. How areyou?.
- Hi.

1192
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:16,415
- What's all this?.
- [ Chuckling]

1193
01:05:16,457 --> 01:05:18,959
- Veryfrunny.
- No, really, what's going on?.

1194
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,586
These are our dresses,
sweetheart.

1195
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:26,673
For the wedding.
For Daniel's wedding.

1196
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,091
Didn't I tell you?.
My brother's getting married.

1197
01:05:30,884 --> 01:05:33,970
- No, you didn't.
- You didn't tell her?

1198
01:05:34,011 --> 01:05:37,347
- Oh, no, I did. I was sure that I had.
- When?

1199
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:39,932
- When did I tellyou?
- No, when is he getting married?.

1200
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:44,561
Next weekend.
Didn't you get the invitation?.

1201
01:05:47,688 --> 01:05:50,315
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.Jessie.

1202
01:05:50,356 --> 01:05:52,608
- I'm sorry.
-Jessie, what did I say?. What happened?.

1203
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:54,610
Nothing, nothing at all.
It's, uh--

1204
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:57,445
- Her brother diedat his wedding--
- He died?.

1205
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,863
Yeah. I'm off.
I'll explain later, okay?.

1206
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:03,491
Her brother died
at a wedding?.

1207
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:07,202
- Please wait.
- Your brother's getting married
and you didn't tell me?.

1208
01:06:07,244 --> 01:06:09,245
I was sure I told you.
I thought I told you.

1209
01:06:09,245 --> 01:06:12,748
Stop saying you told me.
You're a terrible liar.
It's one ofyour best qualities.

1210
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,875
- All right, please don't do this.
- Look. I am so tired ofthis.

1211
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,377
I am so tired ofbeing
left out ofhalf ofyour life.

1212
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:20,337
- We're in a rela--
- Shh.

1213
01:06:20,337 --> 01:06:23,422
We're in a relationship
whetheryou like it or-- Wait a minute.

1214
01:06:23,464 --> 01:06:25,799
-Why am I whispering?. This is the point.
-Okay, listen.

1215
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:30,094
We have been through this. I have never,
ever considered anything like this.

1216
01:06:30,136 --> 01:06:33,805
But here we are. It's happening, and
it's good, and I'm not ashamed ofrit.

1217
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:36,015
And ifyou are,
then we have a problem.

1218
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:40,101
She hates that dress.

1219
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:43,479
Let's not get crazy, you know.
It is good. It's great.

1220
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,482
But I-I'm just not ready to
deal with the complexities of--

1221
01:06:48,524 --> 01:06:51,776
- God, you can't even say it.
- Saywhat?.

1222
01:06:51,818 --> 01:06:54,445
I have never, ever imagined
doing anything like this.

1223
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:57,697
Well, you are doing something like this.
This didn't just happen toyou.

1224
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:00,116
It did. I mean, it feels
like it did, you know?.

1225
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:03,368
- I'm sorry. I can'tjust--
- I can't be with you
and be intimate with you...

1226
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,328
and share wonderful
things with you,

1227
01:07:05,328 --> 01:07:07,746
and then get shut out of
the most basic things in your life.

1228
01:07:07,788 --> 01:07:10,040
What is so terrible
about having privacy in this--

1229
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,250
in taking our time
to see ifit makes sense?.

1230
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:16,294
Because when you don't acknowledge
who I am to people that matter toyou,

1231
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:18,963
- it makes me feel like
you're ashamed of me.
- I'm not ashamed ofyou.

1232
01:07:18,963 --> 01:07:21,256
- Well, that's how it feels.
- God, what doyou want from me?.

1233
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:24,133
I wantyou to take me
toyour brother's wedding.

1234
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,969
I can't.

1235
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:31,931
I'm sorry.
I just... can't.

1236
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:38,269
Fine. I can't either.

1237

Hey, it's Jess. Leave me a message.

Hannah Claire Levine.

1240

Eight pounds, six ounces.
I'm sorry we didn't call sooner.

1241
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:08,916
It was 3:00 a.m.
and it went sort ofrfrast, thank God.

1242
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:14,378
Because it's the worst pain
one will ever know. You can't imagine.

1243
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,797
I'm in room 325 at Sinai.

- Oh, my God. Can you believe?

Come by soon. Where are you?

not just in spite of my faults,
but because of them somehow.

- I love you, Rachel.
- [ All Laughing, Chattering ]

- Helen, hey.
- Oh,Josh. Hi, uh--

1252

- God, you know, I'm flattered,
but it's really not a good time.
- They're forJessica.

Oh, sorry.

Well, I heard the opening was tonight
and wanted to wish herwell. That's all.

1255
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:38,690
That's sweet,
but she's not here.

1256
01:09:40,024 --> 01:09:43,735
- You're kidding. Why not?.
- Oh, she's got a lot going on.

Uh, no,you won't.

That's a pretty powerful piece.

1265
01:10:10,964 --> 01:10:16,926
Yeah. It's amazing that
someone like Jessica takes
such risks in herwork, huh?.

She certainly doesn't anywhere else.

It's just sometimes I think
I'm gonna be alone forever.

But sometimes I worry foryou.

1277
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:52,496
I worry for me too.

1278

Sweetheart.

1279
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:10,634
I will never forget...

1280
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:12,594
when you were
in the fifth grade...

1281
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:16,430
and you were so excited when
you got the lead in the play.

1282
01:12:16,472 --> 01:12:18,348
Do you remember that?.

1283
01:12:18,348 --> 01:12:22,893
- Really Rosie.
- Really Rosie, yeah. I remember.

1284
01:12:22,935 --> 01:12:26,062
And you came home after
the first day of rehearsal...

1285
01:12:26,104 --> 01:12:29,106
and you turned to me
and you said, "Mommy,

1286
01:12:29,148 --> 01:12:31,525
I'm not gonna do it.
I quit."

1287
01:12:31,566 --> 01:12:33,484
Just like that.

1288
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:39,113
I turned toyou and I said,
"Jessie.Jessie, my love, why??"

1289
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:42,366
And you said,
"Because my costar isn't good enough."

1290
01:12:42,408 --> 01:12:44,367
"And if my costar
isn't good enough,

1291
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:46,369
"then the play
won't be good enough.

1292
01:12:46,369 --> 01:12:52,206
And I don't wanna be part of any play
that isn't good enough."

1293
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:54,875
And I thought to myself...

1294
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:59,086
"Oy.

1295
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:04,465
"This child will suffer.

1296
01:13:04,507 --> 01:13:07,342
How this child will suffer."'

1297
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:11,929
And then they gave it to
the mieskeit with the glasses.

1298
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,889
- Tess Greenblatt.
- Right.

01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,933
- God, she was terrible.
- Right. And you would have been great.

1300
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:21,061
And you didn't get to do it.
You had to sit there and
watch terrible Tess do it...

1301
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:23,729
with that guyyou thought
wasn't good enough,

1302
01:13:23,771 --> 01:13:27,440
- who was actually
quite excellent, wasn't he?.
- He was. He was very good.

1303
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:30,359
And you know?.

1304
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:35,947
I always think thatyou would have been
so much happier doing that play,

1305
01:13:35,988 --> 01:13:38,323
even ifit was just okay.

1306
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:41,367
Even ifit was great,

1307
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:43,661
just not the best ever.

1308
01:13:45,037 --> 01:13:47,038
And maybe,

1309
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:52,625

the reason that I was so sad
when you got so happy...

and I was happier
when you got so sad...

1429
01:21:19,327 --> 01:21:21,412
was not because
I didn't want you to be happy.
