00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,151
Listen to her how I and roar.

3
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,160
Metal under tension...

4
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:04,893
beggin' you to touch and go.

5
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:11,672
Highway to the danger zone.

6
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:17,572
Ride into the danger zone.

7
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,550
Headin' into twilight...

8
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:26,053
spreadin' out her wings tonight.

9
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,548
She's got you
jumpin' off the deck...

10
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,253
shovin' into overdrive.

11
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:38,799
Highway to the danger zone.

12
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:45,439
I'II take you
right into the danger zone.

13
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:06,425
Highway to the danger zone.

14
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,521
Gonna take you
right into the danger zone.

15
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,032
Good morning, Scott.

16
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,033
Morning, Willis.

17
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,557
How are you?

18
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,531
Ghost Rider, this is strike.

19
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,064
We have unknown aircraft.

20
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,576
Inbound, Mustang.

21
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,511
You're vector zero-nine-zero
for bogey.

22
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:35,423
Who's up there?

23
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:38,426
Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and Goose.

24
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,087
Great.

25
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,756
Maverick and Goose.

26
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:52,102
Talk to me, Goose.

27
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,574
Roger. I got him.

28
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,372
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.

29
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,605
Nine hundred knots closure.

30
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,476
Cougar, you hear that?

31
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,311
Roger.

32
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,509
Merlin, you got him?

33
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,780
Roger. I've got radar contact.

34
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,946
I'II get a visual.
Cougar, you hook them.

35
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:09,424
Roger. And I'II clean them
and fry them. Ha ha.

36
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,892
Mustang.
Mustang, this is Ghost Rider.

37
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,901
Two-zero-three.
I've got him inbound.

38
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:23,894
Bogey heading two-seven-zero
at 10 miles.

39
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,406
Nine hundred knots closure.

40
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:28,376
Ghost Rider,
take angels 10-Ieft-three-zero.

41
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,401
Are we supposed to have
visitors today?

42
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:31,435
Negative, sir.

43
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,354
Merlin, see if he's alone.

44
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,583
Roger.

45
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,749
Goose, you see a trailer?

46
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:46,693
Negative, Merlin.

47
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,958
Looks like he's a single.

48
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:51,022
I'm going head-to-head with him.

49
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,330
Take it easy, Maverick.
I don't like this shit.

50
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:55,928
I'm breaking high right
to see if he's really alone.

51
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,221
We've got
1,000 knots closure, Mav.

52
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,624
He's coming right at us.

53
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,525
OK, buddy, what's on your mind?

54
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:25,359
Holy shit, there's two of them !

55
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,096
Whoo! MIG-28s!
No one's been this close before.

56
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,434
What are they doing here?
What's the position?

57
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,497
Two hundred fifty miles out.

58
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,509
Two hundred fifty miles?
Clear them out.

59
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,578
Cougar, you've got MIG-1.

60
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,104
I'm going after MIG-2.

61
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,175
I lost him in the sun.

62
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,743
Shit, what's he doing?

63
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,448
You got him, Merlin?

64
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,154
He's coming around,
right on our tail.

65
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,952
God damn it!
This bogey's all over me.

66
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,096
-What's their range now?
-Two hundred miles, sir.

67
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:04,503
If they break 150 miles,
launch the alert-five aircraft.

68
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,529
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

69
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,434
Air speed 300. Get him, Mav!

70
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,412
I'm going for missile lock.

71
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,572
Let's scare this guy
out of here.

72
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,074
Come on, lockup, baby.

73
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,053
Lockup, baby.

74
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:20,213
Lockup.

75
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,722
I got him locked.

76
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:22,746
Bingo!

77
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:28,858
We got him, Mav.

78
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,421
He's bugging out and going home.

79
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:33,263
Mustang, this is Maverick.
MIG-2 is headed home.

80
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,000
What's their position?

81
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,973
One hundred eighty miles,
bearing zero-one-zero, sir.

82
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,407
[Beep]

83
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:43,877
Cougar,
He's got missile lock on us!

84
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,174
Get away from this guy!

85
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,340
What is this shit?
He's engaging me.

86
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,418
Damn it, Mustang,
this is Ghost Rider.

87
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:54,422
This bogey's all over me.
He's got missile lock on me.

88
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:55,821
Permission to fire?

89
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,984
Don't fire until fired upon.

90
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:01,785
Goose, there they are below us.

91
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,889
The MIG's in perfect
firing position.

92
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,399
He's right on Cougar's tail.

93
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,265
No way, Goose.
He'd have fired already.

94
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:08,826
He's trying to piss us off.

95
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,566
Maverick, get down here
and get this asshole off me.

96
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:15,837
Easy, Cougar.

97
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,868
Bring him back. Hard right.

98
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,403
Help me engage.

99
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,947
I'm on my way.

100
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,195
Can't shoot this son of a bitch.
Let's try having some fun.

101
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,937
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

102
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,341
Greetings.

103
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:58,942
Watch the birdie.

104
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,954
Jeez, I crack myself up.

105
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:13,231
This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.

106
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,594
Cougar...

107
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:16,694
your tail is clear.

108
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,596
MIG-1 has bugged out.

109
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:18,028
MIG-1 has bugged out.

110
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,123
[Breathing erratically]

111
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,631
Cougar, this is Maverick.

112
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:32,507
We've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

113
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,707
I'm getting a little low
on fuel, so we're heading home.

114
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:40,542
We'll see you on deck.

115
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:52,228
We're running Low on gas.
We've gotta get out of here.

116
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,659
[Beeping]

117
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,064
Cougar.

118
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,371
We're on vapor, Cougar.

119
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,066
Let's do it.

120
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,899
Cougar! Come on, Cougar!

121
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,885
MERLIN: Take it back
to the ship, man.

122
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,048
Come on, Cougar.

123
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,216
Get him on deck
as soon as possible.

124
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:21,953
He's gotta be Low on fuel.

125
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:26,053
Cougar, we've got to land
this thing.

126
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:29,533
We are way Low on gas,
you understand me?

127
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,433
You all right, man?

128
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,207
CONTROL: Maverick, you're at
3/4 of a mile. Call the ball.

129
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,009
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

130
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:45,975
MERLIN: Cougar, let's Land!

131
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:48,110
Goose, Cougar's in trouble.

132
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:50,087
Come on, Mav,
we're gettin' Low on gas.

133
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:51,782
Let's Land this sucker.

134
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,514
MERLIN: Cougar!

135
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,267
God damn it, Maverick.

136
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,201
We got no fuel for this.

137
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,568
We're going after Cougar.

138
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:11,142
You tell him to land that plane.
That's an order.

139
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,043
CONTROL: Ghost Rider,
you are instructed to land.

140
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,410
Land immediately.

141
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:23,183
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

142
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,883
Mav, we've got a little problem
up here.

143
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:27,448
That MIG really screwed him up.

144
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,619
I don't think
he can make it back.

145
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,728
You're OK, Cougar.

146
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,733
Just stay on my wing.

147
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,860
I'II take you all the way in.

148
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:39,233
Just stay with me.

149
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:56,944
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

150
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,757
You're a Little Low.

151
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,487
You're a Little Low, Coug.

152
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,461
Come on, buddy. Pull up.

153
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,220
MAVERICK: Pull up, Cougar.

154
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:09,893
That's it.

155
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,231
Almost there.

We're too Low, Cougar.

161
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,716
Pull up!

162
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,248
Some more power!

00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,751

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,078
Cougar,
you should be in sick bay.

167
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,410
What's on your mind?

168
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:57,642
My wife and kid, sir.

169
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,943
Almost orphaned him today,
without ever seeing him.

170
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,818
I don't know what happened
up there...

171
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,483
but I was so scared.

172
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,355
Come on, we've seen this before.

173
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,382
No, sir.

174
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,424
I'm holding on too tight.

175
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:15,228
I've lost the edge.

176

I'm sorry, sir.

Maverick, Goose, come in here.

What the hell's going on?

182
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,782
I don't know.

183
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,918
Oh, shit.

184
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:50,257
Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.

185
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:55,229
What you should have done
was Land your plane!

186
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:57,241
You don't own that plane...

187
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,936
the taxpayers do!

188
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:02,105
Son, your ego is writing checks
your body can't cash.

189
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,705
You've been busted...

190
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:07,184
you lost your qualifications
as section leader three times...

191
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,709
put in hack twice by me...

192
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:12,018
with a history
of high-speed passes...

193
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,388
over five air control towers...

194
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:15,916
and one admiral's daughter!

196
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:19,825
And you, asshole...

197
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:21,729
you're Lucky to be here.

198
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:22,960
Thank you, sir.

199
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,468
And Let's not bullshit,
Maverick.

200
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,970
Your family name
isn't the best in the Navy.

201
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:29,974
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the rest.

202
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,407
Now, what is it with you?

203
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:35,004
Just want to serve my country,
be the best pilot in the Navy.

204
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,741
Don't screw around with me,
Maverick.

205
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,806
You're a hell of
an instinctive pilot.

206
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,044
Maybe too good.

207
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,211
I'd like to bust you,
but I can't.

208
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:43,811
I got another problem here.

209
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:47,985
I got to send somebody
from this squadron to Miramar.

210
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,755
I've got to do something here.

211
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,762
I still can't believe it.

212
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,764
I got to give you
your dream shot.

213
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:56,062
I'm gonna send you up
against the best.

214
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,934
You two characters
are going to Top Gun.

215
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,473
For five weeks...

216
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,100
you will fly against the best
fighter pilots in the world.

217
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:07,771
You were number two.
Cougar was number one.

218
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,110
Cougar lost it,
turned in his wings.

219
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:11,945
You guys are number one.

220
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:15,419
But you remember one thing--

221
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,717
you screw up just this much...

222
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:20,724
you'll be flying a cargo plane
full of rubber dog shit...

223
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,191
out of Hong Kong.

224
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,251
Yes, sir!

225
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,096
That is all.

226
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,533
You can tell me about the MIG
some other time.

227
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,558
Gentlemen!

228
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:35,061
Good Luck, gentlemen.

229
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,573
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

230

SONG: Out along the edge...

231
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,297
is always where I burn to be.

232
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:52,736
The further on the edge,
the hotter the intensity.

233
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:59,410
Highway to the danger zone.

234
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:05,651
Gonna take you
right into the danger zone.

Highway to the danger zone.

00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:18,796
Right into the danger zone...

237
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,866
During Korea,
the Navy kill ratio was 12 to 1.

238
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,344
We shot down 12 of their jets
for every one of ours.

239
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,177
During Vietnam,
that ratio fell to 3 to 1.

240
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:29,877
Our pilots had become dependent
upon missiles.

241
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,476
They had lost some
of their dogfighting skills.

242
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,648
Now, Top Gun was created
to teach ACM--

243
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,179
Air Combat Maneuvering.

244
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,020
Dogfighting.

245
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,618
This gives me a hard-on.

246
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,562
By Vietnam's end,
that ratio was back to 12 to 1.

247
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:43,621
Don't tease me.

249
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,666
I'd like to take this
opportunity to introduce you...

250
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,533
to our commanding officer
at Top Gun.

251
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,801
The first man awarded
the Top Gun trophy.

252
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,206
You will not find
a finer fighter pilot...

253
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,709
anywhere in the world.

You are the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

We'll make you better.

260
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,926
You'll fly at Least
two combat missions a day...

and evaluations
of your performance.

263
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,464
In each combat sequence...

264
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,165
you're gonna meet
a different challenge.

265
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:27,300
Every encounter is going
to be much more difficult.

266
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:29,606
We're gonna teach you
to fly the F-14...

267
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,134
right to the edge
of the envelope...

268

faster than
you've ever flown before...

269
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,639
and more dangerous.

270
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,911
Now, we don't make policy here,
gentlemen.

271
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,178
Elected officials,
civilians do that.

272
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:44,215
We are the instruments
of that policy.

273
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,695
And although we're not at war...

274
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:50,197
we must always act
as though we are at war.

who's the best.

they're up here on this plaque.

280

The best driver and his R.I.O.
from each class is on it.

281
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,341
And they have the option...

00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,475
to return here
to be Top Gun instructors.

Yes, sir.

That's arrogant, considering
the company you're in.

That's what I meant.

328
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:22,115
I thought so.

329
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,481
Say, you need any help?

330
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:26,015
With what?

331
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,885
You figured it out yet?

332
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:30,517
What's that?

333
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,493
Who's the best pilot.

334
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,928
No. I can figure that out
on my own.

335
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,727
I heard that about you.

336
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,757
You like to work alone.

337
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,931
Mav, you must have soloed
under a Lucky star.

338
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,098
First the MIG...

339
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,267
and then you guys slide
into Cougar's spot.

340
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:48,901
We didn't slide
into Cougar's spot.

341
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,069
It was ours, OK?

342
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,944
Some pilots wait their career
to see a MIG up close.

343
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:55,415
I guess you guys
are Lucky and famous, huh?

344
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,645
ICEMAN:
No. You mean notorious.

345
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:58,948
I'II see you Later.

346
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:00,921
You can count on it.

347
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,788
They were abused children.

348
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,857
We're gonna have a good time.

349
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:07,884
Always.

350
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,157
Always.

351
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:14,292
GOOSE: OK, I guess
it's my turn, isn't it?

352
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:16,702
AII right. The bet is $20.

353
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:17,705
$20.

354
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:20,003
You have to have
carnal knowledge...

355
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,565
of a Lady this time...

356
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,201
on the premises.

357
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:24,871
On the premises.

358
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,775
GOOSE:
Come on, Mav. A bet's a bet.

359
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,011
I don't know.

360
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:32,713
It just doesn't seem fair...
for you, I mean.

361
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,085
But, uh...

362
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,224
she's lost that Loving feeling.

363
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:39,852
-She's Lost--no, she hasn't.
-Yes, she has.

364
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,020
She has not lost that lov--

365
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,053
-Goose, she's lost it.
-Mav, come on.

366
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,261
I hate it when she does that.
Shit.

367
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:53,005
Excuse me, miss.

368
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,602
Hey, hey. Don't worry.
I'II take care of this.

369
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:59,238
[Singing]
You never close your eyes...

370
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,444
anymore when I kiss your Lips.

371
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:06,344
There's no tenderness...

372
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:11,223
Like before in your fingertips.

373
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:14,717
You're trying hard
not to show it...

374
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:16,697
CROWD SINGING: Baby...

375
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:22,363
but, baby, believe me,
I know it.

376
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:26,864
You've Lost that loving' feeling.

377
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:31,345
Whoa, that Loving' feeling.

378
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:34,644
You've Lost that Loving' feeling.

379
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:38,709
Now it's gone, gone, gone.

380
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:40,550
Whoa-oh-oh.

381
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:44,991
Ba dum, ba dum,
ba dum, bum, bum.

382
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,755
Sit down.

383
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,092
Thank you.

384
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,129
Baby, baby...

385
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,000
I'II get down on my knees
for you.

386
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,406
I Love that song.

387
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,704
I've never seen that approach.

388
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,671
How long have you two
had this act?

389
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,542
Oh, I don't know. Since...

390
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,706
Puberty?

391
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:07,874
Right. Puberty.

392
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,282
I'm Charlotte Blackwood.

393
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:11,546
I'm Maverick.

394
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,575
Maverick?

395
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,214
Did your mother not like you
or something?

396
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:17,383
No. It's my call sign.

397
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,017
You're a pilot.

398
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,891
That's right. A naval aviator.

399
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,487
Oh.

400
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,226
Actually, we've only done this,
uh, twice.

401
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,563
Oh, how did you do?

402
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,469
Crashed and burned
on the first one.

403
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:30,698
It wasn't pretty.

404
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:32,866
And the second?

405
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:35,205
I don't know.
I'II tell you tomorrow...

406
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:37,234
but it's Looking good so far.

407
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,747
Well, uh...Maverick...

408
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:43,114
my friend's just arrived...

409
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,119
so it's been
great talking to you.

410
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:46,245
Perry. Hi.

411
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,584
Hi. Here you go.

412
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:50,614
I'II be with you
in just a second, OK?

413
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:56,253
Listen, can I ask you
a personal question?

414
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:57,628
That depends.

415
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,394
Are you a good pilot?

416
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:04,967
I can hold my own.

417
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:05,995
Great.

418
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,671
Then I won't have to worry about
you making a Living as a singer.

419
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:14,537
Hi.

420
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,948
-Here's your drink.
-Thanks.

421
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:20,352
I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!

422
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:24,151
That's great, Mav. Real slick.

423
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,737
It was a Long cruise,
was it, sailor?

424
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:52,242
It was too long.

425
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:53,505
What'd you want to do...

426
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,036
just drop down on the tile
and go for it?

427
00:24:56,881 --> 00:25:00,977
No. Actually,
I had this counter in mind.

428
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,182
Great. That would be very,
very comfortable. Yeah.

429
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:05,712
It could be.

430
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:10,623
Actually,
I came in here to save you...

431
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:15,190
from making a big mistake
with that older guy.

432
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:16,393
Really?

433
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:21,135
So I could make a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

434
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:24,969
Maybe.

435
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:29,112
I've got to be at work
early in the morning.

436
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:31,206
Then what are you doing here?

437
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:34,074
Your friend was magnificent.

438
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,418
Naw.

439
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,222
JESTER: You'll also be trained
and evaluated...

440
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:47,197
by a few civilian specialists.

441
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:48,426
The civilians are here...

442
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,492
because they are our best source
of information on enemy planes.

443
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:54,505
One of the most qualified
is our T.A.G.R.E.P.--

444
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,904
call sign, Charlie.

445
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,101
She has a Ph.D.
in astrophysics...

446
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,044
and she's also
a civilian contractor...

447
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:02,877
so you don't salute her,
but you better Listen to her...

448
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,348
because the Pentagon Listens
to her about your proficiency.

449
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:06,680
It's all yours, Charlie.

450
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:07,707
Thank you.

451
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:12,955
Hello. We will be dealing
with F-5s and A-4s...

452
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:15,118
as our MIG simulators.

453
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,218
Now, then,
as most of you know...

454
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:20,493
the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust to weight ratio...

455
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:22,692
that the MIG-28 has...

456
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:26,693
and it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots Like a MIG-28.

457
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:30,401
However, the MIG-28
does have a problem...

458
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,568
with its inverted flight tanks.

459
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,704
It won't do
a negative ''G'' pushover.

460
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:37,715
The Latest intelligence
tells us...

461
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:40,718
that the most it will do
is one negative--

462
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:43,118
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

463
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:45,588
Is there something wrong?

464
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:48,217
Yes, ma'am. The data on
the MIG is inaccurate.

465
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:51,257
How's that, Lieutenant?

466
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:54,231
I just happened
to see a MIG-28.

467
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:55,493
We! We.

468
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:56,761
Sorry, Goose.

469
00:26:56,801 --> 00:27:00,760
We happened to see a MIG-28
do a four ''G'' negative dive.

470
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,106
Where did you see this?

471
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:06,235
That's classified.

472
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:07,244
It's what?

473
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,269
MAVERICK: It's classified.

474
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:12,006
I could I tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

475
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,019
Lieutenant,
I have top-secret clearance.

476
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,954
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

477
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,687
It doesn't seem so in this case,
now, does it?

478
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,195
So, Lieutenant...

479
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,925
where exactly were you?

480
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,432
Well, we--

481
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,661
Thank you.

482
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:33,364
Started up on him when
he pulled through the clouds...

483
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:34,871
and then I moved above him.

484
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:36,771
If you were directly
above him...

485
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,139
how could you see him?

486
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:40,701
Because I was inverted.

487
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,212
Bullshit.

488
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,305
GOOSE: No, he was, man.

489
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:47,079
It was a really great move.
He was inverted.

490
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:49,712
You were in a four ''G''...

491
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:52,552
inverted dive with a MIG-28?

492
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,217
Yes, ma'am.

493
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,725
At what range?

494
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,625
Um, about two meters.

495
00:27:57,662 --> 00:27:59,994
It was actually
about one and a half.

496
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:02,898
I've got a great Polaroid of it,
and he's right there.

497
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:04,162
MAVERICK:
It was a nice picture.

498
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:05,396
Uh, Lieutenant.

499
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:10,163
What were you doing there?

500
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,675
Communicating.

501
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,176
Communicating.

502
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,475
Keeping up foreign relations.

503
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:16,741
That was it.

504
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:18,146
Giving him the bird.

505
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:21,344
You know, the finger.

506
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,149
Yes, I know the finger, Goose.

507
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:25,212
I'm Sorry.
I hate when it does that.

508
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:28,018
Excuse me.

509
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,786
So you're the one?

510
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:32,489
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,829
AII right, gentlemen,
we have a hop to take.

512
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,700
The hard-deck on this hop
is 10,000 feet.

513
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,704
There'll be no engagement
below that.

514
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:42,330
Move it!

515
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:48,667
Lieutenant.

516
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:52,049
GOOSE: OK, well,
don't be late again.

517
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,380
You look great, honey.

518
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:55,818
MAVERICK: Thanks, dear.
See you in preflight.

519
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,321
Lieutenant,
why didn't you tell me...

520
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:00,324
that you were a famous
MIG insulter?

521
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:01,950
Would it have made
any difference?

522
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,428
Not in the ladies' room, no.

523
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:05,622
What would have?

524
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,093
I'm an instructor
at this school.

525
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,930
I see 20 new hotshots
every 8 weeks.

526
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:12,959
Now, I'm sure
you can figure that out.

527
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:14,631
Look, Lieutenant...

528
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,302
I'd just really like to hear
about the MIG sometime.

529
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:21,470
You've got security clearance.

530
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,803
You can read about it.

531
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,880
Maverick.

532
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:34,214
I'm curious.

533
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:38,627
Who was covering Cougar...

534
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:41,689
while you were showboating
with this MIG?

535
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:44,360
Cougar was doing just fine.

536
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:45,869
Uh-huh.

537
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:47,962
JESTER: Gentlemen,
this is your first hop.

538
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,496
The jets you are flying against
are smaller, faster...

539
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,913
and more maneuverable...

540
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:53,172
just like the enemy MIGs.

541
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:55,614
The clock is ticking,
and we're now keeping score.

542
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:58,584
I lost him, Goose!

543
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:01,712
Show me what you got, kid.

544
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,048
I lost him !

545
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:05,149
I'm looking!

546
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:10,192
Got him ! He's on our tail!
Coming hard!

547
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,256
Yeah, I got him. Here we go.

548
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:26,710
Talk to me, Goose.

549
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:28,874
He's still back there,
closing in on us.

550
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,178
He's closing fast.

551
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:32,311
You can run, kid,
but you can't hide.

552
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,487
Jester, let's see if I can
give you a run for your money.

553
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,199
Watch the mountains!

554
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,403
He's still back there.

555
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:02,245
Come on, Mav,
do some of that pilot shit.

556
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:03,375
Yeah, I got him.

557
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:14,583
Bring it right.

558
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,230
I've had about enough
of this shit.

559
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:22,134
I'II hit the brakes.
He'll fly past.

560
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:23,568
OK, you're mine.

561
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:27,096
Whoo!

562
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:33,236
Jesus Christ!

563
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,216
Whoo!

564
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,775
Let's see what
you got now, Jester!

565
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:40,719
OK, man, let's turn and burn!

566
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,898
He's going vertical. So am I.

567
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:03,502
We're going ballistic!
Go get him !

568
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:13,916
He's going
for the hard-deck.

569
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:16,219
Let's nail him first, Mav!

570
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,952
MAVERICK:
No way, Jester. You're mine.

571
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:35,798
I got you now!

572
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:39,177
Whoo!

573
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:41,875
Jester's dead, whoo-hoo!

574
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,384
Jester's dead, yee-haw!

575
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:48,583
Get your butts
above the hard-deck...

576
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,318
and return
to base immediately.

577
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:55,119
Yes, sir.

578
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:04,098
Tower, this is Ghost Rider
requesting a flyby.

579
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:07,433
Negative, Ghost Rider.
The pattern is full.

580
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,568
No, Mav,
this is not a good idea.

581
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,068
Sorry, Goose,
but it's time to buzz the tower.

582
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,457
[Sonic boom]

583
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,790
Goddamn son of a bitch!

584
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,726
GOOSE: Yee-haw!

585
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:33,427
Ha ha! Great balls of fire!

586
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,078
Yee-haw! Jester's dead!

587
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,450
You won? That's bullshit.

588
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:40,613
Didn't everybody?

589
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,987
Hell, no, man.
We got our butts kicked.

590
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:43,991
30 seconds.

591
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:46,220
We went like this.
He went like that.

592
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,229
I said to Hollywood,
''Where'd he go?''

593
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:51,255
Hollywood said,
''Where'd who go?''

594
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,961
He's laughing at us
right on the radio.

595
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,596
It's me laughing, dickhead.
We won!

596
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:57,832
AII right!

597
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,102
They won, too, man.

598
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,034
ICEMAN:
That's not what I heard.

599
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:04,409
GOOSE: We did. We got Jester.

600
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:06,778
SLINGER: Below the hard-deck
does not count.

601
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:09,648
Hard-deck, my ass.
We nailed that son of a bitch.

602
00:34:09,684 --> 00:34:11,345
ICEMAN:
You guys really are cowboys.

603
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:12,717
MAVERICK:
What's your problem, Kazansky?

604
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:16,190
You're everyone's problem.

605
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:19,455
That's because every time you go
up in the air, you're unsafe.

606
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:21,485
I don't like you
because you're dangerous.

607
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,292
That's right...

608
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:25,697
Ice...man.

609
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,565
I am dangerous.

610
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:33,698
Maverick, you and Goose get your
butts out of that flight gear...

611
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:35,607
and up to Viper's office now.

612
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,714
Remember, boys.

613
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:43,115
No points for second place.

614
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:45,214
You're a lot brighter
than you look.

615
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:46,720
You shut up, OK?

616
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,518
Don't worry, Goose.

617
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,421
Two of your
snot-nosed jockeys...

618
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,052
did a flyby on my tower
at over 400 knots!

619
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:55,221
I want somebody's butt!
I want it now!

620
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:57,231
I've had it!

621
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:00,496
God damn it! That's twice!

622
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:02,264
I want some butts!

623
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,170
Well, that'll just about cover
the flybys.

624
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,698
Follow me.

625
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:15,206
Gentlemen...

626
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,709
you had a hell of a first day.

627
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:25,153
The hard-deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.

628
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:27,151
You knew it, you broke it.

629
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,929
You followed
Commander Heatherly below...

630
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,626
after he lost sight of you
and called ''no joy.''

631
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,896
Why?

632
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,529
Sir!

633
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,302
I had Commander Heatherly
in my sights.

634
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:42,434
He saw me move in for the kill.

635
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,935
He then proceeded
below the hard-deck.

636
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,438
We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.

637
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:50,781
I had the shot....

638
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,650
there was no danger,
so I took it.

639
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,956
You took it...

640
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,254
and broke a major rule
of engagement!

641
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,924
Then you broke another one
with that circus stunt flyby.

642
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,296
Lieutenant Mitchell...

643
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:11,203
Top Gun rules exist for your
safety and that of your team.

644
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,605
They are not flexible,
nor am I.

645
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,510
Either obey them,
or you are history.

646
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:17,841
Is that clear?

647
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,980
Yes, sir!

648
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:30,990
Dismissed.

649
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,097
I really enjoyed that, Mav.
Thanks a lot.

650
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,192
Holy shit!

651
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:43,227
Ahh.

652
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:47,473
Maybe I could learn
how to be a truck driver.

653
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:50,342
You have the number
of that driving school on TV?

654
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:51,845
Truck Master, I think it is.

655
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,211
I might need that.

656
00:36:53,248 --> 00:36:56,217
His fitness report says it all.

657
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,718
He's a wild card.

658
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:01,244
Flies by the seat of his pants.
Completely unpredictable.

659
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,751
He got you, didn't he?

660
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,785
Yeah.

661
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:08,261
Maverick.

662
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:11,831
I flew with his old man.

663
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:17,404
Tell me one thing.

664
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:20,407
If you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

665
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:21,430
JESTER: I don't know.

666
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:23,603
I just don't know.

667
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,758
Still awake?

668
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,692
Yeah.

669
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,495
What's up?

670
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,761
Can't sleep.

671
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:49,937
When I first realized
we were going to Top Gun...

672
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:52,337
all I could think about
was getting that trophy.

673
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,834
I gotta be
straight with you, Mav.

674
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,012
Right now,
I just hope we graduate.

675
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,547
I've got a family
to think about.

676
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,849
I can't afford to blow this.

677
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,183
I guess that flyby
wasn't such a big hit, huh?

678
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:19,462
Look, man,
I know it's tough for you.

679
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,127
They wouldn't let you
in the academy...

680
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,830
'cause you're
Duke Mitchell's kid.

681
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,668
You have to live
with that reputation.

682
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,971
But it's like every time
we go up there...

683
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,874
it's like you're flying
against a ghost.

684
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:34,204
Makes me nervous.

685
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,514
You're the only family I've got.

686
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:44,389
I'm not going to let you down,
I promise.

687
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:55,396
Get out of here.

688
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:15,519
A rolling reversal would work
well in that situation.

689
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:18,892
If I reversed on a hard cross...

690
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,985
I could immediately
go to guns on them.

691
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:23,827
At that speed, it's too fast.

692
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:26,299
It's a little bit
too aggressive.

693
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,928
Too aggressive?

694
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,902
Yeah, I guess
when I see something...

695
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,464
I go right after it.

696
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,673
You didn't tell me
who you were the other night.

697
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:40,681
You didn't give me a chance,
did you?

698
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,478
You deserved it.

699
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:44,678
I know.

700
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,678
But, uh, you were tempted...

701
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:52,124
to ask me out for dinner.

702
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,185
-No.
-No?

703
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:57,026
No. I don't date students.

704
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:09,166
I can see
it's dangerous for you...

705
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,337
but if the government
trusts me...

706
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:14,715
maybe you could.

707
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:24,254
It takes a lot more
than just fancy flying.

708
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:40,605
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

709
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,269
Slider...

710
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,273
you stink.

711
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:01,391
Let's go!

712
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:02,922
OK, Ice, yeah!

713
00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:06,299
KENNY LOGGINS SINGING:
I'd say it was the right time...

714
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:08,395
to walk away.

715
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,538
When dreaming
takes you nowhere...

716
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,908
it's time to play.

717
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:19,215
Bodies working overtime.

718
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:20,580
Money don't matter.

719
00:41:20,617 --> 00:41:22,710
The clock keeps ticking.

720
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:25,187
Someone's on your mind.

721
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:31,187
Funny,
but it's always the same.

722
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:35,358
Playin',
playin' with the boys.

723
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:41,564
Stayin',
playin' with them boys.

724
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,505
After chasing sunsets...

725
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:50,741
one of life's simple joys...

726
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,248
is the boys.

727
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:53,840
I don't want to be the moth...

728
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:55,784
around your fire.

729
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,316
I don't want to be obsessed
by my desire.

730
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:08,357
You play too rough.

731
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:12,732
Playin',
playin' with the boys.

732
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:17,032
I'II be stayin'...

733
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:20,532
playin' with the boys.

734
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:22,704
WOLFMAN: We won! We won!

735
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:25,715
GOOSE: Come on, Mav.
Just one more game.

736
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:27,580
That evens it.
We can take them.

737
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:30,109
I've got some things
I gotta take care of.

738
00:42:30,154 --> 00:42:33,715
Just one more game.
Please? For me?

739
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:36,851
-Sorry.
-You're sorry? Come on.

740
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:38,156
WOLFMAN:
Mother Goose, you pussy!

741
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:12,217
Damn it.

742
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,332
CHARLIE: Lieutenant.

743
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:31,714
MAVERICK: Uh...

744
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:33,716
CHARLIE: What, no singing?

745
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,151
Look, I'm...I'm, um...

746
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,745
No apologies.

747
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,220
If you don't mind...

748
00:43:48,265 --> 00:43:50,495
I'm gonna just take
a quick shower...

749
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:52,092
while you're
finishing up here.

750
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:56,736
Yeah. I do mind.

751
00:43:56,773 --> 00:43:58,434
I'm hungry.

752
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:05,179
And then...
I thought about it.

753
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:06,682
I thought...

754
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:10,414
''You know, Charlie,
he's a smart guy.

755
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:14,015
''Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?''

756
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:16,586
Well?

757
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:19,418
It's the MIG.

758
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,530
The MIG.

759
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,367
You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MIG-28.

760
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:33,299
I'm trying for
this big promotion at work...

761
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:35,573
and if I get it,
I won't be here much longer.

762
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:39,781
Seems to me
you've got it all figured out.

763
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:41,408
Yeah.

764
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,116
Except you did forget the wine.

765
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:47,316
Oh.

766
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:49,748
Sorry.

767
00:44:51,595 --> 00:44:53,222
You always get what you want?

768
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:55,231
No, not always.

769
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:57,165
Yeah, maybe.

770
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,259
Then relax about the MIG.

771
00:45:12,616 --> 00:45:14,846
OTIS REDDING ON STEREO:
Sittin' in the mornin' sun...

772
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:16,512
MAVERICK: This music.

773
00:45:16,553 --> 00:45:18,521
I'II be sittin'
when the evenin'...

774
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:20,045
CHARLIE: An old friend?

775
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:24,193
My folks loved it.

776
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:26,252
I haven't heard this in years.

777
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:31,191
My mother used to call down
from her room...

778
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:33,702
and have me play this
over and over again.

779
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:36,228
I got so sick of it.

780
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:39,708
But not her.

781
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:42,211
She'd just sit up there alone...

782
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:43,735
just listening for hours.

783
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:46,572
Just listening.

784
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:50,743
She died shortly after him.

785
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:54,250
What happened to your father?

786
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:03,162
I guess I kind of figured
with your security clearance...

787
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,725
you'd know more about him
than I do.

788
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,338
Well, I didn't get that far.

789
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:10,533
Oh.

790
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:14,533
Well, it's a big mystery.

791
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:20,608
He disappeared in an F-4
November 5, 1965.

792
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,213
The stink of it was...
he screwed up.

793
00:46:28,558 --> 00:46:30,924
No way.

794
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:33,054
My old man was
a great fighter pilot.

795
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:40,559
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

796
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,971
Somebody must know.

797
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:47,841
Yeah, somebody knows everything.

798
00:46:47,878 --> 00:46:50,847
Is that why you're always
second-best up there?

799
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:54,840
You are direct, aren't you?

800
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:05,518
I'm sorry I was late.

801
00:47:07,697 --> 00:47:10,461
I'm sorry for being direct.

802
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,967
No apologies.

803
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:16,762
This is going to be complicated.

804
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:30,342
Where are you going?

805
00:47:31,455 --> 00:47:33,855
I'm going to take a shower.

806
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:41,386
Thank you.
I enjoyed being here.

807
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:48,928
[Motorcycle starts]

808
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:22,937
It looks like you need
another shower.

809
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,368
Right.

810
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:34,540
I'm going to be honest with you.

811
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:38,651
Your MIG sighting is
really important to my work...

812
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:40,713
but, um...

813
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:48,356
I don't normally invite students
to my house.

814
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:50,798
You're, uh...

815
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,233
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

816
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:05,674
-Morning.
-Sir.

817
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:30,695
I'm glad we got that straight.

818
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:51,622
I told her
how tough it is here--

819
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:54,528
my ass dragging
like an old tired dog.

820
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:57,465
I told her that you didn't
even have a woman here.

821
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,967
You know what she said?

822
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:01,994
''He probably doesn't have one.
He's got eight.''

823
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,940
BOY: Daddy!

824
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:22,824
CAROLE: So, you're in love
with one of your instructors.

825
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,326
MAVERICK: Is that right?

826
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:27,330
-I didn't tell her that.
-Yes, you did.

827
00:50:27,364 --> 00:50:30,822
I can't believe you said that!
That was a secret.

828
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:38,807
VIPER: The bogey has
good position right here.

829
00:50:38,842 --> 00:50:40,057
AII right, freeze frame.

830
00:50:40,057 --> 00:50:40,489
AII right, freeze frame.

831
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:42,424
Moment of choice.

832
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,427
The F-14 is defensive.

833
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,952
He has a chance to bug out
right here.

834
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:50,728
Better to retire
and save your aircraft...

835
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:52,894
than push a bad position.

836
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:54,995
Charlie, jump in here anytime.

837
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:58,007
You stay in that diamond
another three seconds...

838
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:01,135
the bogey's gonna blow you
out of the sky.

839
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:04,170
You take a hard right,
select zone five...

840
00:51:04,214 --> 00:51:06,682
you can extend an escape.

841
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:08,776
You made a bad choice.

842
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:11,581
Charlie.

843
00:51:14,057 --> 00:51:16,787
Aircraft one
performs a split ''S''?

844
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,295
That's the last thing
you should do.

845
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:22,696
The MIG's right on your tail.
Freeze there, please.

846
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:25,133
The MIG has you
in his gun sight.

847
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:27,500
What were you thinking
at this point?

848
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:29,334
MAVERICK:
You don't have time to think.

849
00:51:29,373 --> 00:51:32,809
If you think, you're dead.

850
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:36,335
That's a big gamble with
a $30 million plane, Lieutenant.

851
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:45,714
Unfortunately,
the gamble worked.

852
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:47,690
The MIG never got a clean shot.

853
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:51,827
Maverick makes an aggressive
vertical move here.

854
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,159
Comes over the top...

855
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:56,165
and he defeats the bandit
with a missile shot.

856
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,894
The encounter was a victory...

857
00:51:57,934 --> 00:52:01,802
but I think that we've shown it
as an example of what not to do.

858
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:04,465
Next.

859
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,200
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

860
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:16,550
Now, this is a perfect example
of a textbook maneuver.

861
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:30,392
Lieutenant.

862
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,232
Maverick.

863
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:40,002
Lieutenant!

864
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:42,871
Lieutenant!

865
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:45,381
My review
of your flight performance...

866
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,213
was right on,
in my professional opinion--

867
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,310
I can't hear you.

868
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,109
MAVERICK: Jesus Christ!
And you think I'm reckless!

869
00:53:14,144 --> 00:53:15,839
When I fly,
I'II have you know...

870
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:18,177
that my crew
and my plane come first!

871
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:20,342
CHARLIE: I'm going to finish
my sentence, Lieutenant!

872
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:23,011
My review of your flight
performance was right on!

873
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:24,179
Is that right?

874
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:26,621
That is right.
But I held something back.

875
00:53:26,656 --> 00:53:28,624
I see real genius
in your flying...

876
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:30,592
but I can't say that in there.

877
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:33,926
I was afraid that everyone
would see right through me.

878
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:37,957
And I just don't want anyone
to know I've fallen for you.

879
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:07,924
BERLIN PERFORMING:
Watchin' every motion...

880
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:11,764
in this foolish lovers' game.

881
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:17,900
Haunted by the notion...

882
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:22,901
somewhere there's a love
in flames.

883
00:54:25,749 --> 00:54:27,910
Turning and returning...

884
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:33,548
to some secret place inside.

885
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:38,227
Watching in slow motion...

886
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:42,664
as you turn my way...

887
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,428
and say...

888
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:48,426
''Take my breath away...''

889
00:54:52,509 --> 00:54:54,568
''my love.''

890
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:58,547
''Take my breath away...''

891
00:55:02,352 --> 00:55:04,547
''my love.''

892
00:55:04,588 --> 00:55:11,118
''Take my breath away,
my love.''

893
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:25,902
-Hey, Maverick.
-Yeah.

894
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,909
-You hear about Ice?
-What's that?

895
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:30,410
He won another one.

896
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:32,970
-Really?
-Yeah.

897
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:35,039
MAVERICK: I feel the need.

898
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,677
BOTH: The need for speed.

899
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:43,891
JESTER:
Gentlemen, this is hop 19.

900
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,893
Multiple aircraft,
multiple bogeys.

901
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,895
Your training is half over.

902
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,762
The competition for the Top Gun
trophy remains tight.

903
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:52,390
First place--Iceman.

904
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:56,233
Second place--Maverick.
Just two points behind.

905
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:57,568
There they are.

906
00:55:57,605 --> 00:56:00,005
Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.
I don't think they see us yet.

907
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,009
OK, I see them.

908
00:56:02,043 --> 00:56:05,274
Two A-4s, left, 10 o'clock.
Continue left turn.

909
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:16,652
Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature's 110 degrees.

910
00:56:16,691 --> 00:56:18,283
Holy shit! It's Viper!

911
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:20,294
Viper's up here. Great!

912
00:56:20,328 --> 00:56:22,125
Oh, shit.

913
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:23,790
Great. He's probably saying...

914
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:25,662
''Holy shit,
it's Maverick and Goose.''

915
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,292
Yeah, sure he's saying that.

916
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:32,764
I've got my eye
on the northern bogey.

917
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,604
Roger. I got the southern guy.

918
00:56:37,178 --> 00:56:38,702
Hollywood, you lead.
I'II cover you.

919
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:53,155
Break now, Jester.

920
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,394
Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's stay on Jester.

921
00:57:00,435 --> 00:57:01,561
Roger. I'm on him.

922
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,741
Goose, find Viper.
He's out there somewhere.

923
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:11,643
Stay with Hollywood, Mav.
We're covering his wing.

924
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:14,847
Goose! There's Viper.

925
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:16,281
Three o'clock low.

926
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:18,342
Stay with Hollywood.
We're his cover.

927
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:19,876
Don't you leave me, Maverick.

928
00:57:19,921 --> 00:57:23,880
Hollywood, you're looking good.
I'm going after Viper.

929
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:28,989
Goddamn you, Maverick!

930
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,554
Mav, don't leave him.

931
00:57:30,598 --> 00:57:33,396
Goose, Hollywood's OK.
I want Viper.

932
00:57:36,938 --> 00:57:38,872
Stand by. Viper's coming down.

933
00:57:45,947 --> 00:57:47,414
Holy shit, we're head-to-head.

934
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,678
I can't believe
we're doing this.

935
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:05,123
Whoo! Rock and roll!

936
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,157
Here's our chance!
It's a big one, Goose!

937
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,901
Come on, goddamn it!

938
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,137
Come on, Mav, keep coming!

939
00:58:20,815 --> 00:58:22,715
OK, Sidewinder missile selected.

940
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,843
Come on, baby. Come on.

941
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:27,821
Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.

942
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,788
Jesus, this guy's good!

943
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:36,888
Goose! Where's he going?

944
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:38,398
Come on! Come on!

945
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:39,923
Keep coming, keep coming!

946
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,094
Come on, baby.

947
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:52,312
Damn, this kid's good.

948
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,609
He's too close
for missiles, Goose.

949
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,140
I'm switching to guns.

950
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:00,982
Come on! Come on!

951
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:06,450
Stick with it.
Stick with it.

952
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,493
Hold it! Goose, check our tail!

953
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,091
Shit! There's Jester!

954
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:16,831
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

955
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:17,997
Shit!

956
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,803
Defense Department
regrets to inform you...

957
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:23,333
that your sons are dead
because they were stupid.

958
00:59:23,377 --> 00:59:26,540
Great balls of fire!

959
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:28,606
OK, knock it off, gentlemen.

960
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:30,776
Let's go home.
Viper has the lead.

961
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:39,243
30 seconds, Wolfman,
I'm coming in.

962
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:40,510
Shut up!

963
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,347
Butt nose.

964
00:59:42,385 --> 00:59:44,751
JESTER: That was some of
the best flying I've ever seen.

965
00:59:44,787 --> 00:59:47,187
Right up to the part
where you got killed.

966
00:59:47,223 --> 00:59:49,691
You never,
never leave your wingman.

967
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,293
Maverick...

968
01:00:00,403 --> 01:00:03,372
it's not your flying.
It's your attitude.

969
01:00:03,406 --> 01:00:06,000
The enemy's dangerous...

970
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:09,205
but right now,
you're worse than the enemy.

971
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:12,112
You're dangerous and foolish.

972
01:00:12,148 --> 01:00:16,084
You may not like your wingmen,
they may not like you...

973
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,746
but whose side are you on?

974
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:30,560
GOOSE: At least Viper
got Iceman before he got us.

975
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,431
We still got a shot at it.

976
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:37,028
MAVERICK: That was stupid.
I know better than that.

977
01:00:37,073 --> 01:00:39,564
That will never happen again.

978
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:43,844
I know.

979
01:00:49,352 --> 01:00:50,717
I know.

980
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:31,955
[Singing] You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

981
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:34,861
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

982
01:01:34,897 --> 01:01:36,524
You break my wiII.

983
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:37,794
Oh, what a thrill.

984
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:40,893
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

985
01:01:40,937 --> 01:01:45,203
CAROLE: Would you go fetch him?
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

986
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:48,210
MAVERICK: Hell, no.
Well, there was the time--

987
01:01:48,244 --> 01:01:51,873
-Admiral's daughter.
-What?!

988
01:01:51,914 --> 01:01:54,314
He told me all about the time...

989
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:56,318
you went ballistic
with Penny Benjamin.

990
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,254
MAVERICK:
Did he? Well, that's great.

991
01:01:59,288 --> 01:02:01,984
CAROLE: He tells me
about all of them, Maverick.

992
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:06,085
How my Iittle angel, Goose,
goes home early for church...

993
01:02:06,128 --> 01:02:08,995
and you, you always go home
with the hot women.

994
01:02:09,031 --> 01:02:10,362
MAVERICK:
AII right, thank you, Carole.

995
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:13,459
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

996
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,768
Whoo! Whoo hoo!

997
01:02:17,807 --> 01:02:19,172
Ow!

998
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:22,336
BOTH: You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

999
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:25,347
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

1000
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,712
You broke my will.

1001
01:02:26,749 --> 01:02:28,114
Oh, what a thrill.

1002
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,176
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

1003
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,656
CAROLE: I'd love to be able to
warn you off about Maverick...

1004
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,318
but I just love him to death.

1005
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,659
I've known Pete
for a lot of years now...

1006
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:43,688
and I'm telling you
one thing's for certain...

1007
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:47,999
there are hearts breaking open
all over the world tonight.

1008
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:49,061
Why?

1009
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:53,667
Because unless you are a fool,
that boy is off the market.

1010
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:58,237
in love with you.

1011
01:02:59,348 --> 01:03:01,839
Hey, Goose, you big stud!

1012
01:03:01,884 --> 01:03:03,010
That's me, honey.

1013
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:05,179
Take me to bed
or lose me forever!

1014
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:06,950
Show me the way home.

1015
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:11,082
Come on.
Sing with the family.

1016
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:13,587
A-ha!

1017
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:14,994
A-ha!

1018
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:17,727
[Singing] You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

1019
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:20,759
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

1020
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:22,236
You broke my will.

1021
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:23,795
Oh, what a thrill.

1022
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,774
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

1023
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:27,969
Yee-haw!

1024
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:28,999
Ow!

1025
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:45,126
Maverick...

1026
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:48,490
you big stud.

1027
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,591
Take me to bed
or lose me forever.

1028
01:04:05,373 --> 01:04:07,603
JESTER: OK, gentlemen,
this is hop 31.

1029
01:04:07,642 --> 01:04:09,132
Two weeks to graduation.

1030
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:11,270
Top Gun trophy's
still up for grabs...

1031
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:12,610
so every point counts.

1032
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:32,359
KENNY LOGGINS SINGING:
Revvin' up your engine.

1033
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,994
Listen to her howl and roar.

1034
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:38,429
Metal under tension...

1035
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:41,203
beggin' you to touch and go.

1036
01:04:43,211 --> 01:04:47,807
Highway to the danger zone.

1037
01:04:49,317 --> 01:04:55,847
Ride into the danger zone.

1038
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,188
It's bottom of the ninth.
The score is tied.

1039
01:04:58,226 --> 01:04:59,693
It's time for the big one.

1040
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,195
You up for this one, Maverick?

1041
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:03,697
Just a walk in the park,
Kazansky.

1042
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:10,194
Contact.
Multiple bogeys. 1-6-5.

1043
01:05:10,238 --> 01:05:12,570
Two miles. Looks like
they're going away from us.

1044
01:05:12,607 --> 01:05:14,040
Ho, I see them.

1045
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:15,667
Tallyho.
Right, two o'clock. I'm in.

1046
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,734
I'm in.

1047
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:38,996
That son of a bitch
cut me off.

1048
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:49,666
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.

1049
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:51,406
Ice, take the shot.

1050
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,346
Ice, get the hell out of there.

1051
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:54,678
I can't get the angle.

1052
01:05:54,716 --> 01:05:57,378
I'm too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

1053
01:05:57,419 --> 01:05:59,046
Ice, fire or clear.

1054
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,460
Look at this.

1055
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:09,190
Jesus Christ, I could take
the shot right here!

1056
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,323
I need another 20 seconds,
then I've got him.

1057
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:18,768
I'm moving in.
I've got the shot.

1058
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:20,331
Mav, let's get in there.

1059
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,364
Come on, Mav.

1060
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:25,005
Maverick's getting impatient.
Come on, take the shot.

1061
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,673
Ten more seconds,
then I've got him.

1062
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,542
Ice, get out of there.
Let's do it, Mav.

1063
01:06:31,586 --> 01:06:33,451
Ice, come off high right.
I'm in.

1064
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:34,614
Five more seconds.

1065
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:36,749
Come off high right, Ice.
I'm in.

1066
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,122
I'm off him. Shit!

1067
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:43,292
We're in his jetwash.

1068
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:44,389
Holy shit!

1069
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:50,269
GOOSE: This is not good.
We got a flame out back.

1070
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:51,738
Engine one is out.

1071
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:53,331
Engine two is out.

1072
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:55,604
Goose, I'm losing control,
I'm losing control!

1073
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:58,168
I can't control it.
It won't recover. Shit!

1074
01:07:00,615 --> 01:07:02,480
It's coupling up.
We're out of control.

1075
01:07:02,517 --> 01:07:04,644
This is not good.

1076
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:06,517
ICEMAN: Mayday! Mayday!
Mav's in trouble.

1077
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:08,715
He's in a flat spin,
heading out to sea.

1078
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:14,560
Altitude 8,000! 7,000!

1079
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:17,788
Six. We're at six, Mav.

1080
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:18,821
Aah!

1081
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:21,925
I'm pinned forward, Goose.

1082
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,528
I can't reach
the ejection handle.

1083
01:07:25,306 --> 01:07:27,274
Goose, you have to punch us out.

1084
01:07:27,308 --> 01:07:29,367
I can't reach
the ejection handle.

1085
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,502
Eject!

1086
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:31,512
I'm trying.

1087
01:07:31,546 --> 01:07:33,173
Eject! Eject! Eject!

1088
01:07:33,214 --> 01:07:34,909
Watch the canopy.

1089
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,027
Goose! Goose!

1090
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:55,092
Oh, no.

1091
01:07:55,136 --> 01:07:56,228
Oh.

1092
01:07:58,139 --> 01:07:59,265
Oh, God.

1093
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:01,241
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1094
01:08:01,276 --> 01:08:02,300
Oh.

1095
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:17,216
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1096
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:50,619
DIVER: Sir, let go of him.

1097
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:52,285
You got to let him go, sir.

1098
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,121
VIPER: How you doing?

1099
01:09:37,162 --> 01:09:38,720
MAVERICK: I'm all right.

1100
01:09:41,566 --> 01:09:43,033
VIPER: Goose is dead.

1101
01:09:43,068 --> 01:09:44,626
I know.

1102
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:52,200
VIPER: You fly jets long enough
something like this happens.

1103
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:56,802
He was my R.I.O.
My responsibility.

1104
01:09:59,818 --> 01:10:02,946
My squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft.

1105
01:10:02,987 --> 01:10:04,511
Ten men.

1106
01:10:04,556 --> 01:10:07,992
First one dies, you die, too.

1107
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,223
But there will be others.

1108
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:14,164
You can count on it.

1109
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:18,666
You got to let him go.

1110
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:23,273
You got to let him go.

1111
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:42,722
MAVERICK:
I think maybe it was my fault.

1112
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:46,686
I don't know.

1113
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:51,259
I don't know
what the hell went wrong.

1114
01:10:53,204 --> 01:10:55,468
I'd like to help.

1115
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,369
I know it's difficult.

1116
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:05,379
God, I want him back.

1117
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:15,083
I'II be here if you need me, OK?

1118
01:13:08,106 --> 01:13:10,768
God, he loved flying with you,
Maverick.

1119
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:32,929
He'd have flown anyway...
without you.

1120
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:38,762
He'd have hated it,
but he would have done it.

1121
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,590
INQUIRY COMMANDER: We find that
the F-14 flat spin...

1122
01:14:01,626 --> 01:14:04,595
was induced
by the disruption of airflow...

1123
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:06,096
into the starboard engine.

1124
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:10,760
This disruption
stalled the engine...

1125
01:14:10,802 --> 01:14:13,600
which produced
enough yaw rate...

1126
01:14:13,638 --> 01:14:18,098
to induce a spin
which was unrecoverable.

1127
01:14:18,142 --> 01:14:19,609
There was no way...

1128
01:14:19,644 --> 01:14:21,111
Lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid...

1129
01:14:21,145 --> 01:14:23,841
the jetwash
which produced the engine stall.

1130
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:27,544
Therefore, the board finds
Lieutenant Pete Mitchell...

1131
01:14:27,585 --> 01:14:29,883
was not at fault
in the accident of 29 July.

1132
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:32,185
Lieutenant Mitchell's record
is cleared of this incident.

1133
01:14:32,223 --> 01:14:36,159
Lieutenant Mitchell is restored
to flight status without delay.

1134
01:14:38,062 --> 01:14:39,689
These proceedings are closed.

1135
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,867
Get him up flying soon.

1136
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:19,828
JESTER: Come on, kid.
Get in there. Engage.

1137
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:21,736
SUNDOWN: You got a bogey
at two o'cIock low.

1138
01:15:21,773 --> 01:15:23,741
You got the angle.
Piece of cake.

1139
01:15:27,979 --> 01:15:30,072
JESTER: Take the shot, kid.

1140
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:33,009
SUNDOWN:
You can engage any time.

1141
01:15:43,861 --> 01:15:46,386
Hey, where the hell
are you going?

1142
01:15:46,431 --> 01:15:48,831
Uh, it's not good.
It doesn't look good.

1143
01:15:48,866 --> 01:15:52,063
It doesn't get to look
any better than that.

1144
01:16:04,682 --> 01:16:07,242
SUNDOWN: Hey, man,
we couId have had him.

1145
01:16:07,285 --> 01:16:09,344
Hey, we could have had him, man!

1146
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:14,186
I will fire when I am
goddamn good and ready!

1147
01:16:14,225 --> 01:16:15,692
You got that?

1148
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:36,612
JESTER: He can't get back
in the saddle. Won't engage.

1149
01:16:36,647 --> 01:16:38,945
VIPER:
It's only been a few days.

1150
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,475
JESTER: You know,
he just might not make it back.

1151
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,157
Keep sending him up.

1152
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,545
Mitchell...

1153
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,685
I'm sorry about Goose.

1154
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,554
Everybody liked him.

1155
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:24,062
I'm sorry.

1156
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:45,590
Hi, it's Wolfman.

1157
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:50,259
Yeah, Maverick just quit.

1158
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,515
Excuse me.

1159
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,527
May I?

1160
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:20,995
Please.

1161
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,538
CHARLIE:
I'II have what he's having.

1162
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:34,406
Hemlock, is it?

1163
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:36,742
MAVERICK: Ice water.

1164
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:44,075
CHARLIE: You weren't going
to say good-bye?

1165
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:49,546
I heard you got that job
in Washington.

1166
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,059
Congratulations.

1167
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,583
Thanks.

1168
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,589
But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying good-bye.

1169
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:03,528
It's good to see you.

1170
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,529
CHARLIE: Thanks.

1171
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:09,033
Where you going?

1172
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,379
You don't even have a ticket,
do you?

1173
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:19,013
I've seen all the evidence.
It's not your responsibility.

1174
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,716
It's not your fault.

1175
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:25,550
You're one of the best pilots
in the Navy.

1176
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:30,054
What you do up there,
it's dangerous.

1177
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,724
But you've got to go on.

1178
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,828
You don't understand.

1179
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:40,042
When I first met you...

1180
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:42,567
you were larger than life.

1181
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,040
Look at you.

1182
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:51,076
You're not going to be happy
unless you're going mach two...

1183
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,145
with your hair on fire.
You know that.

1184
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:56,215
Naw, it's over. It's just over.

1185
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,850
CHARLIE:
To be the best of the best...

1186
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,226
means you make mistakes,
and then you go on.

1187
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,730
It's just like the rest of us.

1188
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,256
MAVERICK:
You don't think I know that?

1189
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,093
I'm here to help.

1190
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,072
Look, thank you.

1191
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:18,376
But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.

1192
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,610
So I'm too late.

1193
01:20:28,124 --> 01:20:29,614
You've already left.

1194
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:34,221
You didn't learn
a damn thing, did you?

1195
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,787
Except to quit.

1196
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:43,128
You've got that maneuver down
real well.

1197
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:53,172
So long, Pete Mitchell.

1198
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,594
[Rings doorbell]

1199
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,405
MRS. METCALF:
Well, hi, Maverick. Come on in.

1200
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:24,242
-How you doing?
-Good.

1201
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,908
-You sure you're feeling OK?
-Fine. Great.

1202
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:30,749
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thank you.

1203
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:34,244
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.

1204
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,780
OK. Thank you.

1205
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:56,703
I flew with your old man.

1206
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,805
VF-51, the Oriskany.

1207
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:05,577
You're a lot like he was,
only better...

1208
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,080
and worse.

1209
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:14,085
He was a natural heroic
son of a bitch, that one.

1210
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,492
So, he did do it right.

1211
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,464
Yeah, he did it right.

1212
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,076
VIPER: Is that why you fly
the way you do...

1213
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,611
trying to prove something?

1214
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,116
Yeah, your old man did it right.

1215
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:49,598
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

1216
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,657
It could end my career.

1217
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,362
We were in the worst dogfight
I ever dreamed of.

1218
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:57,964
There were bogeys like fireflies
all over the sky.

1219
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,702
His F-4 was hit,
and he was wounded...

1220
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:02,870
but he could have made it back.

1221
01:23:02,912 --> 01:23:04,072
He stayed in it.

1222
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:06,138
Saved three planes
before he bought it.

1223
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:10,976
MAVERICK: How come I never
heard that before?

1224
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,682
That's not something the State
Department tells dependents...

1225
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:17,249
when the battle occurred
over the wrong line on some map.

1226
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,228
MAVERICK: So you were there?

1227
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:22,093
VIPER: I was there.

1228
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,656
What's on your mind?

1229
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,262
My options, sir.

1230
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:30,765
Simple.

1231
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,069
First, you've acquired enough
points to show up tomorrow...

1232
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,737
and graduate
with your Top Gun class...

1233
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,679
or you could quit.

1234
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,080
There'd be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.

1235
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,915
It would've shook me up.

1236
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:46,649
So you think I should quit?

1237
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,281
I didn't say that.

1238
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:53,584
The simple fact is you
feel responsible for Goose...

1239
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:55,392
and you have
a confidence problem.

1240
01:23:56,999 --> 01:24:00,400
I'm not going to sit here
and bIow sunshine up your ass.

1241
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:05,135
A good pilot is compelled
to evaluate what's happened...

1242
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,005
so he can apply
what he's learned.

1243
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:11,546
Up there, we got to push it.

1244
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,047
That's our job.

1245
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:17,548
It's your option, Lieutenant...

1246
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:19,247
all yours.

1247
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:33,626
Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday, sir...

1248
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:35,364
but thank you very much
for your time.

1249
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,464
VIPER: No problem. Good luck.

1250
01:25:23,052 --> 01:25:25,020
[Applause]

1251
01:25:27,423 --> 01:25:28,685
Gentlemen...

1252
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,055
Where's Maverick?

1253
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:33,327
I don't know where he is.

1254
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:37,055
You know what
he's planning to do?

1255
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,893
Got to be hard on the guy,
though, you know.

1256
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,096
Good luck.

1257
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,048
Hi, Mav.

1258
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,698
Congratulations.

1259
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:16,136
Thank you.

1260
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:19,539
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Mav.

1261
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:20,735
Sir.

1262
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:26,241
Gentlemen,
I hate to break up the party...

1263
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,272
before it really
gets out of hand...

1264
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:29,978
but there's work to be done.

1265
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:32,886
Some of you have to depart
immediately.

1266
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,321
We have a crisis situation.

1267
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:37,723
-Ice, Slider!
-Yo.

1268
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,352
-Hollywood, Wolfman!
-Yes, sir.

1269
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,795
Maverick!

1270
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,093
Sir.

1271
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:51,403
Maverick, you'll get your R.I.O.
when you get to your ship.

1272
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,399
And if you don't...
give me a call.

1273
01:26:55,444 --> 01:26:57,036
I'II fly with you.

1274
01:26:58,781 --> 01:26:59,941
Sir.

1275
01:27:09,614 --> 01:27:11,582
AIR BOSS JOHNSON:
Gentlemen, this is bull's eye.

1276
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,140
The communications ship,
S.S. Layton...

1277
01:27:13,185 --> 01:27:17,451
has become disabled and wandered
into foreign territory.

1278
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:20,322
A rescue operation
is to begin within the hour.

1279
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:23,293
Your mission is to give
air support to that rescue.

1280
01:27:24,029 --> 01:27:26,623
There are MIGs in the area,
and tensions are high.

1281
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:30,499
If you witness a hostile act,
you will return fire.

1282
01:27:30,535 --> 01:27:33,993
Those MIGs carry
the Exocet antiship missile.

1283
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:36,337
They can fire them
from 100 miles away.

1284
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:38,308
Gentlemen,
this is the real thing.

1285
01:27:38,343 --> 01:27:41,335
This is what
you've been trained for.

1286
01:27:41,379 --> 01:27:43,506
You are America's best.

1287
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:45,175
Make us proud.

1288
01:27:45,217 --> 01:27:46,343
-Ice.
-Yes, sir.

1289
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:47,510
-Hollywood.
-Yes, sir.

1290
01:27:47,552 --> 01:27:48,814
Sector 2.

1291
01:27:48,853 --> 01:27:51,321
Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on ready five.

1292
01:27:52,724 --> 01:27:54,055
Yes, sir.

1293
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,686
Rise!

1294
01:27:58,496 --> 01:27:59,963
Excuse me, sir.

1295
01:27:59,998 --> 01:28:01,465
This is not personal...

1296
01:28:01,499 --> 01:28:04,559
but with regard to Maverick,
is he the best--

1297
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:08,004
JOHNSON: I know what you're
thinking. Just get on it.

1298
01:29:24,482 --> 01:29:26,780
ICEMAN: Mustang, can you
give me a mode four check?

1299
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:30,310
Voodoo-one, you got a pair
of bogeys, 12 o'cIock, 15 miles.

1300
01:29:30,355 --> 01:29:32,516
Voodoo-one, zero-nine-zero.

1301
01:29:32,557 --> 01:29:34,616
Radar contact 15 miles.

1302
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:36,354
They're doing 500 knots.

1303
01:29:36,394 --> 01:29:37,656
Roger. That's your bogey.

1304
01:29:41,066 --> 01:29:42,533
SLIDER:
Got 'em dead ahead. 15 miles.

1305
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:43,966
Air speed is 600 knots.

1306
01:29:47,472 --> 01:29:48,700
SLIDER:
Bogeys just hit 650.

1307
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,674
Let's take a wider split.

1308
01:29:52,911 --> 01:29:55,846
They're at 15,000 feet.
Dead ahead, 10 miles.

1309
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,006
Air speed is still increasing.

1310
01:29:57,048 --> 01:29:58,538
800 knots.

1311
01:29:58,583 --> 01:29:59,982
Dead ahead now. Eight miles.

1312
01:30:00,018 --> 01:30:01,451
Dead ahead now. Eight miles.

1313
01:30:01,486 --> 01:30:02,680
'Wood, you got 'em?

1314
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:03,983
Not yet. I can't see 'em.

1315
01:30:04,022 --> 01:30:06,013
They must be close.
I'm getting a hard-on.

1316
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:15,461
'Wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify 'em.

1317
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:16,967
HOLLYWOOD:
Roger. You got the lead.

1318
01:30:17,001 --> 01:30:19,265
I'm on your left side,
a little low.

1319
01:30:20,572 --> 01:30:22,540
Maverick's up and ready
in alert five.

1320
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:23,734
Good, good.

1321
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:28,779
SLIDER: Hollywood,
my bogey's still locked up.

1322
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:30,781
He's drifting to the left.

1323
01:30:30,815 --> 01:30:33,340
Still maneuvering on course
zero-nine-zero.

1324
01:30:33,385 --> 01:30:35,785
ICEMAN: OK, 'Wood,
let's bring it to the right...

1325
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,845
and we'll get
a better angle on him.

1326
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:48,666
SLIDER:
Ice, we got a problem here.

1327
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,190
We've got four aircraft
on radar.

1328
01:30:50,235 --> 01:30:52,829
Not one pair, two pair.
Repeat, four bogeys!

1329
01:30:52,871 --> 01:30:54,702
'Wood, we got four bogeys.

1330
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:58,468
Make that five!

1331
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:59,477
There's five, sir.

1332
01:30:59,511 --> 01:31:00,569
That's five?

1333
01:31:00,612 --> 01:31:01,601
Yes, sir.

1334
01:31:03,515 --> 01:31:04,743
Oh, shit!

1335
01:31:04,783 --> 01:31:06,808
He's got a radar lock on us.

1336
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,984
Get out of there, Hollywood,
God damn it!

1337
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:20,796
Break left!

1338
01:31:20,832 --> 01:31:22,800
I'm hit! We're coming apart!

1339
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:24,096
I can't control it!

1340
01:31:24,135 --> 01:31:26,365
We're going down!

1341
01:31:26,404 --> 01:31:27,871
'Wood's been hit!

1342
01:31:27,906 --> 01:31:29,032
Shit!

1343
01:31:29,073 --> 01:31:31,041
Voodoo-one, Wood's been hit!

1344
01:31:31,075 --> 01:31:32,542
We've lost Hollywood.

1345
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:34,442
We've lost our wingman.

1346
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:36,606
Launch Maverick on alert five.

1347
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:39,116
Get a bearing
on Hollywood and Wolfman...

1348
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:41,641
and launch the rescue helicopter
immediately.

1349
01:32:07,345 --> 01:32:08,437
Maverick's airborne.

1350
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,811
MERLIN:
Iceman, what's your position?

1351
01:32:09,848 --> 01:32:12,180
ICEMAN:
Zero-nine-zero at 180 miles.

1352
01:32:12,217 --> 01:32:14,310
On the left!

1353
01:32:14,352 --> 01:32:16,411
Three MIGs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side!

1354
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:20,050
ICEMAN:
I'm going after them.

1355
01:32:20,091 --> 01:32:21,285
I'm breaking around
to the left.

1356
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:26,887
SLIDER: Four on our tail.
That makes six of them.

1357
01:32:26,931 --> 01:32:28,398
Lead MIG is coming
into gun range.

1358
01:32:33,538 --> 01:32:35,028
He's firing. Break right!

1359
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:38,903
Mustang,
we are totally defensive!

1360
01:32:38,943 --> 01:32:39,932
Launch the alert fighters!

1361
01:32:39,978 --> 01:32:41,104
Where are they?

1362
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:43,841
One hundred sixty miles
and closing in fast, sir.

1363
01:32:43,882 --> 01:32:45,577
Ready Willard and Simkin
off 'Cats Three and Four.

1364
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,750
Maverick's supersonic.
I'II be there in 30 seconds.

1365
01:32:50,788 --> 01:32:52,915
ICEMAN: Haul your ass!
I'm engaged with five!

1366
01:32:52,957 --> 01:32:54,322
I'm in deep shit!

1367
01:32:56,961 --> 01:32:58,258
What about Willard and Simkin?

1368
01:32:58,296 --> 01:32:59,731
Both catapults are broken.

1369
01:32:59,731 --> 01:33:01,528
We can't launch
any aircraft yet, sir.

1370
01:33:01,566 --> 01:33:03,500
-How long?
-It'll take 10 minutes.

1371
01:33:03,535 --> 01:33:04,661
Bullshit, 10 minutes.

1372
01:33:04,702 --> 01:33:06,761
This thing will be over
in 2 minutes.

1373
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:10,466
MIG, 12 o'clock high!

1374
01:33:10,508 --> 01:33:11,805
MIG, 12 o'clock high!

1375
01:33:11,843 --> 01:33:13,401
Watch your back!

1376
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:20,239
Break right!

1377
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,016
ICEMAN:
Shit, that was close.

1378
01:33:24,055 --> 01:33:25,579
Maverick, how about some help?

1379
01:33:25,623 --> 01:33:27,784
Come on, kid. Hang in there.

1380
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:31,385
Jesus Christ!

1381
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:35,724
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, damn it!

1382
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:39,297
He's on our tail!

1383
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,666
Watch out!

1384
01:33:46,911 --> 01:33:49,004
Shit, we just flew
right through his jetwash!

1385
01:33:51,449 --> 01:33:53,178
Get control, get control!

1386
01:34:00,692 --> 01:34:02,819
MERLIN:
Good recovery, Mav.

1387
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,259
OK, let's get in there.

1388
01:34:04,295 --> 01:34:06,627
Come on, we got to help Ice.

1389
01:34:06,664 --> 01:34:08,632
Let's get back in the game,
Maverick!

1390
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:09,792
MAVERICK: It's no good.

1391
01:34:09,834 --> 01:34:11,529
MERLIN:
Get in there, Maverick!

1392
01:34:14,339 --> 01:34:16,330
God damn it!
Maverick's disengaging.

1393
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:17,739
I knew it! Shit!

1394
01:34:17,775 --> 01:34:19,572
God damn it, Maverick!

1395
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,739
MERLIN:
Maverick, you can't leave him !

1396
01:34:24,782 --> 01:34:26,079
Maverick, what are you doing?

1397
01:34:26,117 --> 01:34:28,608
MAVERICK: Talk to me, Goose.

1398
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:29,950
MERLIN: Ice is in trouble!

1399
01:34:29,988 --> 01:34:31,615
MAVERICK: Talk to me, Goose.

1400
01:34:31,656 --> 01:34:33,146
MERLIN: He won't last alone!

1401
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:35,125
Get in the fight,
for God's sake!

1402
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:36,126
Maverick!

1403
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,354
Maverick!

1404
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:41,258
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

1405
01:34:47,538 --> 01:34:48,835
I can't shake them !

1406
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:50,841
Ice, I've got your MIG
dead ahead.

1407
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:52,240
I've got him dead ahead.

1408
01:34:53,645 --> 01:34:55,340
Good tone. I've got good tone.

1409
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:58,213
I got tone! Firing!

1410
01:35:07,825 --> 01:35:09,725
Where? Where are they?

1411
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:11,424
One hundred fifty five miles.

1412
01:35:11,557 --> 01:35:13,684
Two MIGs dead ahead.
Closure 800 miles an hour!

1413
01:35:13,726 --> 01:35:14,693
I see 'em.

1414
01:35:14,727 --> 01:35:16,718
I'm gonna take 'em
down the left side.

1415
01:35:18,364 --> 01:35:19,592
MERLIN: Oh, my God!

1416
01:35:22,568 --> 01:35:25,560
Ice is right below us.
He's got a MIG on his tail.

1417
01:35:27,506 --> 01:35:29,098
He's firing! Break left!

1418
01:35:32,445 --> 01:35:33,571
He overshot!

1419
01:35:33,612 --> 01:35:34,601
He overshot!

1420
01:35:35,614 --> 01:35:37,411
I'm coming in, Ice.

1421
01:35:39,986 --> 01:35:41,248
Two MIGs dead ahead.

1422
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:45,857
I got him, Mav,
one MIG passing between us.

1423
01:35:48,995 --> 01:35:51,327
MIG on your left, three o'clock!

1424
01:35:51,364 --> 01:35:53,025
He's going to fire!

1425
01:36:00,706 --> 01:36:03,698
Maverick, check the guys
to the north!

1426
01:36:06,112 --> 01:36:07,602
Banking left, banking left!

1427
01:36:10,082 --> 01:36:11,481
There he is!

1428
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:12,506
Get him, Ice. Get him !

1429
01:36:12,551 --> 01:36:13,916
OK, you guys, I'm coming in.

1430
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:22,686
Maverick, got a MIG on our tail!
We gotta get out!

1431
01:36:22,728 --> 01:36:23,888
I can't leave Ice.

1432
01:36:23,929 --> 01:36:26,591
He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!

1433
01:36:26,632 --> 01:36:28,793
I'm not leaving my wingman.

1434
01:36:31,470 --> 01:36:32,937
I'm on his tail.

1435
01:36:32,972 --> 01:36:35,497
I'm going for it. I'm going
for the shot right now.

1436
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:37,566
Roger, engage!

1437
01:36:39,612 --> 01:36:42,103
I've got radar lock.

1438
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:43,615
I'm taking a shot!

1439
01:36:43,649 --> 01:36:44,809
Fire!

1440
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:51,014
-Bingo!
-Wash that sucker!

1441
01:36:51,057 --> 01:36:52,524
Ice, MIG to your right!

1442
01:36:52,558 --> 01:36:53,718
He's firing!

1443
01:36:55,628 --> 01:36:57,118
I'm hit, I'm hit!

1444
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:00,730
We're hit in the right engine!

1445
01:37:00,766 --> 01:37:01,926
I'm shutting it down!

1446
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:08,138
Coming in, Ice.

1447
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:15,236
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm maneuvering for a shot.

1448
01:37:15,281 --> 01:37:18,478
ICEMAN: Stay with him, Mav!
Take the shot! Nail him !

1449

Ice, I can't get a tone.

1450
01:37:20,486 --> 01:37:22,454
Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail!

1451
01:37:27,126 --> 01:37:28,593
Maverick, we're hit again!

1452
01:37:28,627 --> 01:37:30,788
It's OK.
Both engines are functioning.

break hard right.

ICEMAN: Don't let him go.
Keep on him, Mav!

1461
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:51,639
I got him.

You're slowing down!

I'm bringing him in closer.

This is it, Maverick!

I'm gonna hit the brakes.
He'll fly right by.

1476

He'll get a lock!

1477

Now!

1478
01:38:53,078 --> 01:38:54,545
I got a good lock.

Something I should know about?

to be on the front page...

you want to go?
