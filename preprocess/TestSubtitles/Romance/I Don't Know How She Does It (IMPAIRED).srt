1
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,514
Kate Reddy?
I've known her six years.

2
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,313
Smartest girl I know.

3
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,388
And a heart of gold, too.

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,458
All us working mothers feel
like we're spinning 50 plates

5
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,084
in they air at once, but Kate,
you can give her ten more plates,

6
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,390
all the size of manhole covers,
and she just keeps going.

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,125
Big report due the
next day at work, done.

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,259
Sew some extra fairy wings
on for Emily's recital, she's doing it.

9
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,431
Last minute in-laws show up, she can
do it without mixing vodka and Xanax.

10
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,804
It's amazing.
I'm telling you, she's amazing.

11
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,439
For all of us moms, there comes a time
when you almost don't pull it off,

12
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:56,078
and, um, for Kate, that was
those three months last winter.

13
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,658
And all that trouble started
with the bake sale.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,625
[chuckling] Did she tell you
about the bake sale?

15
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,524
[Kate] Oh, my God,
the kindergarten bake sale.

16
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,461
[phone beeps]

17
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,124
I had just flown home to
Boston from a business trip.

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,763
But then I got the reminder
from Emily's school about the bake sale.

19
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,010
I promised Emily that I'd
make something homemade

20
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,578
and I was prepared to
stay up all night to do it.

21
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:24,274
But the deli was
out of baking supplies.

22
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:31,219
This pie was going to be homemade
if it was the last thing I did.

23
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,156
Why did I care?
Well, first of all,

24
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:40,232
the other mothers are like a tiny army
of mini Martha Stewarts.

25
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,561
Their contributions would look perfect.

26
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,727
Their daughters would feel proud.

27
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,601
I just wanted Em
to feel the same way.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,267
I'm trying to prevent the newsflash,
20 years from now.

29
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,848
Friends trace the start of Emily Reddy's
mental problems to a school bake sale

30
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,849
where her mother, a shadowy
presence in her life,

31
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,453
humiliated her
in front of her classmates.

32
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,851
[Kate] I was not
gonna let Emily down.

33
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,795
[moaning] Spread out,
spread out, spread out...

34
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,363
Bigger, bigger, bigger...

35
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,332
[Kate] You don't understand.
I still remember the looks I got

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,501
in 1974, when my mother
sent me to the school bake sale

37
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,307
with two cans
of sliced peaches.

38
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,253
You made a pie.

39
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,862
- Hi!
- Hi, welcome home.

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,058
Thanks. I... I thought maybe
the powdered sugar would help.

41
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,863
[chuckles] No. No,
we're way past help on this.

42
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,599
Come to bed. Listen,
we got Chips Ahoy here.

43
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,402
We can throw these in her backpack.
She'll be good to go.

44
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,737
Are you kidding me?

45
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,539
Do you have any idea what those
dietetically correct mothers

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,309
would do if I brought cookies with
high fructose corn syrup and salt?

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,850
Oh, my God, that sounds really good.
Can I have like a little...?

48
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,476
Mm...

49
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,849
- Mm! Yeah.
- Hm? See?

50
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,620
- You worry too much.
- Well, you know, I just...

51
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,356
I just want Emily to feel proud
of what she brings to the bake sale.

52
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,557
I don't want her to feel different
from the other kids because her mother

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,930
has to travel for work, you know?
I just...

54
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,869
- I want her to know I tried.
- All right, I take it back.

55
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,997
Those are nice things
to want for her.

56
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,603
- [man] Hey, how was Phoenix?
- Oh, it was fine.

57
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,341
You know, airport, taxi, meeting,

58
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,044
hotel, meeting, taxi, airport.

59
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,351
You must, be, uh... exhausted.

60
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,860
Oh! Well... a little.

61
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,627
But not completely.

62
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,098
[# Betty Everett: "Shoop Shoop"]

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,101
# Does he love me?
I wanna know

64
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,830
[Kate] I'm not one
of those wives who doesn't

65
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,600
wanna have sex
with her husband.

66
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,141
I still think he's
the cutest guy I know.

67
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,577
His adorable little frown lines,
his seaweed-colored eyes,

68
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,775
the way he smells after a shower.

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,079
There 's just one problem.

70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,380
# It's in his kiss # #

71
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:21,153
- [music stops]
- [snoring]

72
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,917
[laughs]

73
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,548
[Kate] A recent study showed that
64 percent of women with young children

74
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,651
don't sleep through the night.

75
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,913
Researchers were at a loss
to explain why.

76
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,215
They could have asked me.

77
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,984
At night, I, like women
all around the world, do the list:

78
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,625
Emily's birthday party theme.
Pirates or pop stars?

79
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,198
Things to buy: paper towels,
toothpaste, pork chops.

80
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,199
Buy a present
for Jedda 's birthday party.

81
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,327
Find out Jedda: boy or girl?

82
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,961
Call the guy about the thing.
Make a playdate for Emily

83
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,505
with that kid that doesn't bite.

84
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,165
Refill washer fluid in car.
Wait a minute.

85
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,640
Shouldn't that be
on Richard's list?

86
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,745
Who am I kidding?
Richard doesn't have a list.

87
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,744
Wax something, anything.

88
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,815
- [hair ripping]
- Call Richard's mother and say hi.

89
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,747
- [phone rings]
- Or just email hi.

90
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,182
- [computer dings]
- Wash Ben's teddy bear.

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,015
Renew birth control pills.
Twinkies...

92
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,782
...Ambien while I'm at it.
Finish year-end fiscal summary.

93
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,051
Hamster. Oh, no,
start year-end fiscal summary.

94
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,923
...new ways to say no.
Kegels? [gasps]

95
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,051
Bagels!

96
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,703
[laughs, screeches]

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,671
[Kate] When I come home
after a trip,

98
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,742
Ben doesn't hold
my absence against me.

99
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,004
- Hey, baby.
- He's too little for grudges.

100
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,808
- Little buddy, hi! Boo!
- Boo! [laughs]

101
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,447
[Kate] I love being a mother of
a two-year-old boy.

102
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,144
It's like being a movie star

103
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,118
- in a world without critics.
- Hi, Em.

104
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,987
[Kate] Unfortunately, my daughter
isn't quite as forgiving.

105
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,322
If I'm gone for too long,
she rewards me

106
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,726
with a game of snubs and punishments.

107
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,026
- I want Daddy to take me to school.
- [buzzer sounds]

108
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,691
- Paula gives me a bath.
- [buzzer sounds]

109
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,929
- I don't like hugs.
- [buzzer sounds]

110
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,733
[crowd] Aw!

111
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,544
Any working mother who says
she doesn't bribe her kids

112
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,739
can add "liar" to her resume.

113
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,141
Who wants to watch cartoons?!

114
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,416
[shouting] I got your
happy ending right here!

115
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,651
- [gasping] You swine!
- [laughing]

116
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,422
- [TV continues, indistinct]
- Good morning.

117
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,361
Hey, we gotta call Beachwood Carpets
and get an estimate on those stairs.

118
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,024
Oh, you say the nicest things.

119
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,194
Something's different about you.
You're...

120
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,929
Not in a shirt with barf on it?

121
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,539
Your big meeting, it's today, right?

122
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,039
I'm getting the gig. Definitely.

123
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,303
Get a sitter.
Tonight, we are celebrating!

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,503
- Done.
- I mean it.

125
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,204
Who cares if I'm up against huge firms

126
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,612
with portfolios filled with
museum wings and hotel lobbies?

127
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,776
I have a fantastic bathroom in Back Bay

128
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,889
and a mind-blowing basement
renovation in New Hampshire.

129
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,083
- Not to mention a shirt without barf.
- Mm. I better get it.

130
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,990
I picked the worst time to go on my own.
It's like the economy was waiting for me

131
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,029
to start my own business and then tank.

132
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,724
- Richard.
- No, Kate, I am bankrolling this firm

133
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,300
with change from our sock drawer.

134
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,199
Well, that's gonna change.
It has to, because you're too talented

135
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,329
- for it not to.
- [sighs] I hope so.

136
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,635
The pay isn't much,
but in the long run,

137
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,074
- it'll be great for both of us.
- You're gonna get it.

138
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,679
- Am I gonna get it?
- You are gonna get it.

139
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,644
- I'm gonna get it! OK.
- [laughs]

140
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,806
- I gotta go.
- No, no, wait, wait!

141
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,110
Can you just wait one second

142
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,152
- while I take a really quick shower?
- Where the hell is Paula?

143
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,881
She's been late every day this week.
Honestly, I'm gonna talk to her.

144
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,854
Oh, no, Richard,
please don't talk to her! Please.

145
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,653
If we don't keep her happy,
she'll leave.

146
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,323
Would that be the worst
thing in the world?

147
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,193
Uh, frankly, at this point,
it would be easier if you left.

148
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,998
You know what I mean.

149
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,864
- [children laughing]
- [door opens]

150
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,938
- She's here! She's here.
- [Paula] Good morning.

151
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,166
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Kate] Men and women

152
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,572
Iook at childcare very differently.

153
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,976
- The surf was beautiful today.
- [Kate] Richard sees an outflow of cash

154
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,206
we badly need at the moment,

155
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,375
and I see a person who knows
which blankie Ben likes.

156
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,824
It's a good job. I love the kids,
and Kate is a great boss.

157
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,758
What does Kate do for a living?
I have no idea.

158
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,162
Works in a bank?
Is she... is she like a teller?

159
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,196
[Emily] Come on, Mom,
we're gonna be late.

160
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,860
Hey, Paula, can you put
this in a container for me?

161
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,267
Sure.

162
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,638
- You... made a pie?
- Yep.

163
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,379
[school bell rings]

164
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,109
[Kate] OK, can I just say that I work
for a high-powered investment firm,

165
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,310
yet nothing scares me more

166
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,251
than being caught by my
daughter's kindergarten teacher

167
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,290
when we're late for circle time.

168
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,484
Does Mama love you
a little or a lot?

169
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,855
- A little.
- [gasps]

170
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,964
- [laughs] A lot.
- A lot! Oh!

171
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,589
Have a good day, OK?
I love you. Goodbye. Go.

172
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,225
Go, go, go, go, go, go. [sighs]

173
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,395
[teacher] Late again,
Mrs. Reddy?

174
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,066
Yeah, sorry.

175
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,006
We'll do better tomorrow.

176
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,442
Perhaps.

177
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,980
- Good morning.
- You baked a pie, really?

178
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,448
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

179
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,054
It's from the deli
around the corner.

180
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,850
And you distressed it? Nice!

181
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,255
Did you have to throw away the
package before the nanny saw it?

182
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,587
Well, duh.

183
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,288
[Kate] This is my friend Allison.
Oh, wait, you've already met her, right.

184
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,592
She's a single mom, and I can always

185
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,860
count on Allison,
especially for things like

186
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,199
making something much worse
than I did for the bake sale.

187
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,466
That is unset Jell-O, folks.

188
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,542
Kate and I bonded immediately.

189
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,667
A working mother needs solidarity.

190
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,679
And we know where we rank
in likeability.

191
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,444
Just below felon
and just above shoplifter.

192
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,348
[laughing]

193
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,422
God, it's so sad. Women used to
make the pies and fake the orgasms.

194
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,819
Now we fake the pies.

195
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,926
That's a big improvement
as far as I'm concerned.

196
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,995
Thank you. I was up all night.

197
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,028
Oh, shit!

198
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,256
There they are.

199
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,832
[Kate] There they were.

200
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,595
The most terrifying creatures
in captivity.

201
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,534
The Momsters.

202
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,697
On the right, Wendy Best,

203
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,968
room parent,
field trip chaperone,

204
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,101
parent association
vice president,

205
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:50,272
also chief poobah in charge
of terrifying working mothers

206
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,782
with her domestic prowess.

207
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,512
And Janine LoPietro.

208
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,021
She does Pilates, yoga,

209
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,455
spinning and krav maga.

210
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,528
Fitter than a Navy SEAL,
tougher, too.

211
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,427
There you are, Kate.
I haven't seen you in ages.

212
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,590
Honey, you look great.

213
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,134
Well, I am just so jealous
of you girls.

214
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,795
You get to wear high heels
and look nice all day.

215
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,770
We just frump around at the park.

216
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,637
Kate, I don't know how you do it.

217
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,746
Wendy and l,
we always say that. Cookie?

218
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,509
- Oh... sure, thank you. Yummy.
- [laughs] Yeah.

219
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,448
- Allison, please.
- No, thank you.

220
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,386
- Bye.
- OK.

221
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,427
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

222
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,551
Bye.

223
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,664
- Brush your hair.
- Did you see what she was wearing?

224
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,534
You know, for me,
when I decided to have kids,

225
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,971
I wanted to be the one
to raise them.

226
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,601
But women make different choices
in their lives.

227
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,842
And, uh, I don't judge.
I try not to... judge.

228
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,177
- Bye. I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

229
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,117
- [barking]
- Oh, hello.

230
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,745
- [barks]
- You should go home.

231
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,654
Oh, oh! No,
don't go in the street!

232
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,192
- Don't go in the street!
- [barks]

233
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,795
[Kate] So now, of course,
I'm late.

234
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,160
And I am gonna have to race
to the office

235
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,926
to get there before my boss,
Clark.

236
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,160
- Oh, hi, Clark.
- Oh, good morning.

237
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,100
- How are you? Here, please.
- I'm well.

238
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,763
- Allow me. Ladies first.
- Thank you.

239
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,637
Say, are you running a little late this
morning? I've just come from a meeting.

240
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,870
[bell dings]

241
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,212
I have two choices here.

242
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,181
The man's excuse:
bad traffic, downed power line,

243
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,014
faulty carburetor. Or...

244
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,483
- Mammogram.
- Oh.

245
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,991
Well, then, I think I'll
just take the stairs.

246
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,060
Good cardio.

247
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,822
[elevator dings]

248
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,431
Hey, morning, Jill.

249
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,673
- Meeting.
- Yeah, just a second.

250
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,444
Oh... Ugh! [laughs]

251
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,846
Is that a Rice Krispie?

252
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,489
- Oh.
- I hope.

253
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,153
Oh, it's just dried
pancake batter.

254
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,163
- Oh. Mm. Big relief.
- [bell dings]

255
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,790
[Kate] Momo is a brilliant
junior research analyst.

256
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,665
She has the work ethic
of a robot, and the warmth.

257
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,104
But I don't care because
she devotes all that energy to her job.

258
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,835
Kate Reddy? Well, she's
the best fund manager we have.

259
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,469
She's great at her job,
works really, really hard.

260
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,309
People think she's weird, though.

261
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,350
She checks on her kids every day.

262
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,954
[scoffs] Even during lunch,
when she should be working.

263
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,716
OK, can we go
to the meeting now?

264
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,588
Well, I guess. We don't have time
to do anything about your roots.

265
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,761
So I heard Clark has gotten
some feedback from New York

266
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,627
- on our fund proposal.
- Come on.

267
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,962
New York never lets us run
with anything big.

268
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,333
They treat the Boston office
like a sad stepchild.

269
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,565
- Look, you're always tired...
- Morning.

270
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,505
-...and insufficiently groomed.
- Welcome back.

271
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,668
Once you smelled
like paste all day.

272
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,871
But you write the best reports
on the floor.

273
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,003
I doubt they even read them.

274
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,741
And I certainly doubt
they picked one from here,

275
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,352
but mark my words, if they did,
it will be Bunce's.

276
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,547
Don't ask me how, but that
guy just keeps failing up.

277
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,856
Oh, speak of the devil.

278
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,718
- Kate!
- [bell dings]

279
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,194
[Kate] There's Chris Bunce.
He's our DOA:

280
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,199
Designated Office Asshole.
Bunce loves that I have kids.

281
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,963
Keeps me from getting an edge
on the competition,

282
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,164
the one men get when they take clients
out for drinks and dinners

283
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,832
and golf games. You know
what I'm talking about.

284
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,103
The schmooze.

285
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,406
There you are.
Everything OK this morning?

286
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,071
I was looking for you
and I couldn't find you.

287
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,706
- Nothing with the kids, I hope.
- Oh, I had a...

288
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,944
- Don't ask.
- [laughs] Anyway,

289
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,022
I was just saying to Clark,
Kate is amazing, isn't she?

290
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,623
I mean, I don't know
how she does it.

291
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,248
- All those children...
- I have two.

292
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,951
- It's so impressive.
- You have four.

293
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,926
Yeah, but two of mine are twins.

294
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,433
[groans] Bunce.

295
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,697
How the hell is equality
between the sexes supposed to work?

296
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,036
They can give you good jobs,
maternity leave,

297
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,702
but until you program a man to notice
when you're out of toilet paper,

298
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,939
the project is doomed.

299
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,140
I resent when people say
there's a double standard.

300
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,718
Men also have a lot to juggle.

301
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,343
Take our shoes.

302
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,616
Do women's shoes need to be
shiny all the time? No.

303
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,022
You never see a woman
getting her shoes shined.

304
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,128
Women's shoes
can be flat and dull.

305
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,254
Not men's.
That's a double standard.

306
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,264
Bunce had a great series
of meetings this week

307
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,564
with the institutional investors from
Oakland about their retirement fund.

308
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,504
Yes, meetings went great. Even got in
a little culture while they were here.

309
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,836
- Took them to a dance show.
- [rock music plays]

310
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,740
Hey! Whoo!

311
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,575
Interpretive.
Interpretive dance show.

312
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,149
Nice work, Bunce.
Moving on to new business.

313
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,447
Jack Abelhammer in our New York office
has sparked to a proposal

314
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,680
from this office, and he'd
like to meet the author.

315
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,520
Kick the tires, see if it's an
idea worth bringing to Harcourt.

316
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,960
Bunce, I know how long
you've waited for this chance.

317
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,860
Keep waiting.
Congratulations, Kate.

318
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,939
You'll be heading to New York tonight.
You've got a 9am with Abelhammer.

319
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,373
Really?

320
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,943
Guess someone finally
read one of your proposals.

321
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,706
[Kate] Wow!

322
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,372
[Bunce] Congrats to the B team.

323
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,074
OK.

324
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,248
If this works out,
this could be a big step up.

325
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,985
A lot of travel,
a lot of one-on-one with Abelhammer.

326
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,755
It's gonna be great.
Plus, gives your kids a chance

327
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,989
to spend all that extra quality time
they've been hoping for...

328
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,033
...with your nanny.
And your husband will be thrilled.

329
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,635
Congratulations.

330
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,767
[Momo] You know she's married,
right?

331
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,468
Well, in her marriage,
she has to call her husband

332
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,047
every time she has to work late
or go across the country

333
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,910
or she can't pick up her kids
from school.

334
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,244
It's like she's on parole.

335
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,319
And that is why I'm not
getting married

336
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,647
or having children.

337
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,380
I did have a fish once.

338
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,491
But then he kept looking at me
with these eyes,

339
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,252
Iike, "Feed me."

340
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,294
So I flushed him.

341
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,556
His name was Derek.

342
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,063
Derek Chan.

343
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,768
[computer beeps]

344
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,098
[Allison] Hey, let's blow
off work early, go to a bar,

345
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,707
pretend we're single.
And rested.

346
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,366
Either one. Maybe both.

347
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,773
[computer dings]

348
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,641
[man] Just confirming
our meeting tomorrow.

349
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,341
9am. Looking forward
to meeting you.

350
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,950
Jack Abelhammer.

351
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,721
[Kate] Would love to get
blotto, sadly can't.

352
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,054
Have to go to New York
and blow somebody.

353
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,986
[computer beeps]

354
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,598
Dear Jack, looking forward
to meeting you, too.

355
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,169
Kate Reddy.

356
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,430
[computer beeps]

357
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,201
[Kate] Richard, this thing
is a long shot, I promise you.

358
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:04,805
I have to pitch to him, and he'd
have to pick me over everyone else.

359
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,909
And... the chances of those two things
happening are very slim.

360
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,784
Oh, well, if it comes down
to your ability to pitch

361
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,052
and the quality of your idea,
honey, of course you're getting this.

362
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,355
Good luck at your meeting, honey.
And please don't worry about me.

363
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:22,456
It's such a short trip. No one will even
notice I'm gone again. I promise.

364
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,933
No! You just got back.

365
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,561
Honey, I know,
but it's just... It's one night.

366
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,004
And I will have this with me.
You call me any time.

367
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,131
Whatever, Mom.

368
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,637
[Ben babbling]

369
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,943
At least you don't hate me.

370
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,280
[cooing]

371
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,696
Um... did...

372
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,390
Did you take Ben
to get a hair cut?

373
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,660
Yeah, his bangs
were in his eyes,

374
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,269
so I took him to that
place on the corner.

375
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,329
Oh.

376
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,635
Oh... he looks...

377
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,204
I mean, it's adorable.
Thank you. I just...

378
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,211
It was...
That was his first hair cut.

379
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,509
- So...
- Yeah, I wanted to call.

380
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,675
I just didn't want to disturb you at
work. I didn't wanna bother you.

381
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,017
Oh, no! Paula, no, it's...
No, you're never bothering me.

382
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,615
Nothing is more important to me than the
kids. I'm always happy to hear about

383
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,821
- any little or big thing. Honestly.
- Got it.

384
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,727
Great, thanks.

385
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,396
- I love you.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

386
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,562
Bye-bye, bunny.

387
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,297
- I love you. Paula, you'll call me?
- Yes.

388
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,203
For anything?
I don't care the reason.

389
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,833
- Bye.
- Come on.

390
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,879
Bye. Bye-bye.

391
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,048
Bye-bye!

392
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,551
- [sobbing]
- [Kate] The books say

393
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,990
children get over separation
anxiety by two years.

394
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,925
- [woman speaking indistinctly]
- Good evening.

395
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,395
- [woman] That was weird. [laughs]
- [sobbing]

396
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,557
[Kate] No age limit
is given for mothers.

397
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,262
He'll never have his
first hair cut again. Never.

398
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,564
[pop music plays]

399
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,941
They didn't have purple tights
in your size, Em,

400
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,074
but I'll keep looking.
I promise. OK?

401
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,880
OK, honey.

402
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,853
- [horn honking]
- Do you want a brush?

403
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,480
What, I'm a little itchy.
Is that a crime?

404
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,058
- [ring tone sounds]
- Oh. Hello?

405
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,626
Today's playdate's
in the park, right?

406
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,695
You just have to confirm
that with Owen's nanny?

407
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,821
Yeah, I have the number.
Can you hold on?

408
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,797
Just hold on, OK?

409
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,663
No, I think I have the number.
Can you hold on a second?

410
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,566
I think I have the number.

411
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,936
OK. Hold on.
Can you hold that for a second?

412
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,669
Can you...?

413
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,369
Sorry.

414
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,139
Do you mind?

415
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,806
[toy] Hello, baby. Bye-bye.

416
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,817
- [Momo] Why is this wet?
- That doesn't belong there.

417
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,548
Sorry, it's kind of precious.

418
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,089
[Momo] Something
smells like raw meat.

419
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,590
I wondered where that was.

420
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,453
A-ha! Yeah! Yep.

421
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,929
Yep, yep, yep. Got it, got it.
Got the number.

422
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,727
Wait, are you...
are you still there?

423
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,861
Go ahead, say it.

424
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,440
- Say what?
- Oh, just get it out.

425
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,973
No, it's just...

426
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,733
I don't know how you do it.

427
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,345
Well, you will, one day.

428
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,142
[laughs] No, no, no.
I am not having kids.

429
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,944
Really? Why not?

430
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,416
- Well, for one thing...
- Can you just hold this for a second?

431
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:32,011
Momo, I promise you
that being a mother

432
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,852
is one of the most rewarding

433
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,961
and enriching experiences
a person can have.

434
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,791
It's probably just my stress
eczema flaring up again.

435
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,829
- I'm sorry.
- [elevator dings]

436
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,201
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

437
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,601
- He'll be right with you.
- Great, thanks.

438

- [cell phone rings]
- Oh, sorry. My kids love that music.

439
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,711
Hey, Allison, I'm just
stepping into a meeting.

440
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,178
- Can I call you back maybe?
- [Allison] Sure.

441
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,510
But why did you send me an email

442
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,242
saying that you were
looking forward to meeting me?

443
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,512
- What?
- Last night, when I asked you

444
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,747
if you wanted to get a drink,
I just reread your response

445
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,859
- and it doesn't make any sense. So...
- No.

446
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,157
No, no, no. I didn't send you that
email. I sent you a different one...

447
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,857
Oh, my God! Wait!

448
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,993
I... I didn't send you
an email about a b job?

449
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,265
Uh, no, honey.
I mean, not yesterday.

450
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,704
- Oh, my God!
- Kate Reddy?

451
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,939
Jack Abelhammer.

452
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,844
Momo Hahn.
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

453
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,651
- Shall we?
- Uh... yeah... Listen,

454
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:39,189
Jack, um... Jack, about the email
that I sent yesterday,

455
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,623
the, um... the, uh...
activity mentioned,

456
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,286
- that's not... I don't...
- Oh, yes, I saw that.

457
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,866
Are you still planning to start
the meeting with that action item?

458
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,992
Uh, sorry. There's...
There's been some, uh...

459
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,867
Some budget cutbacks lately.
So no.

460
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,200
[chuckles] Oh, disappointing.

461
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,399
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh, sorry.

462
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,908
I'm gonna silence this thing.
Yeah, here I am...

463
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,672
- I'm silencing it.
- [phone beeps]

464
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,941
[laughs] Sorry, again. Sorry.

465
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,579
Everything OK?

466
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,622
Yep! [laughs]

467
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,398
Oh, my God!

468
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,363
We received a lot of proposals,

469
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,061
but I was most intrigued
by your notion of an

470
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,502
individual investor
retirement fund.

471
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,665
In order to make that work,

472
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,142
you'd have to pick stocks
with a big dividend yield.

473
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,941
Well, of course, but you know
you also have to avoid the value traps.

474
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,209
I think you'll see that I've
targeted a few industries

475
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,342
where I really see
the dividends multiplying.

476
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,784
- [Jack] Mm. Yeah.
- [gasps]

477
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,086
[Jack] I see.

478
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,264
The rub is Harcourt
hates the retirement business.

479
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,167
So, what could we do to convince
him... What's a bouncy house?

480
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,466
- What?
- You have it written on your hand.

481
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,598
I haven't seen a girl write on her hand
since I was ten-years-old.

482
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,176
- Oh!
- [laughs]

483
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,803
A bouncy house is a
blow-up-y kind of tent thing.

484
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,940
You know, the kids get in and they jump
up and down. It's a bouncy house.

485
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,644
It's... It's my daughter's
birthday next week.

486
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,348
- Mm-hm.
- [scratching]

487
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,685
- How many children do you have?
- Uh, six.

488
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,794
- Two!
- Two. Two.

489
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,419
- She has two.
- It feels like six. [laughs]

490
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,158
[chuckles] Hm...

491
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,265
Look, the fund you're proposing
is very ambitious.

492
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,842
I mean, Harcourt, he'll wanna see
that this is a real business.

493
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,274
He only cares about profit ratios.

494
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,006
This is ambitious.
I know that. I know that.

495
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,209
But if it works, it works big.

496
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,049
I mean, think about it. A retirement
fund that makes it possible

497
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:55,489
for people to supplement their Social
Security so they can actually retire.

498
00:24:55,627 --> 00:25:00,064
That would mean so much to people in
this country who are scared to death

499
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,665
about their future.

500
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,394
Look, I got into investing
because I watched my father

501
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,061
gamble away every paycheck
he ever got.

502
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,368
I wish he put that money
into a fund like this.

503
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,943
It would have left
my mother with something,

504
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,241
instead of what she had,
which was two jobs, no savings

505
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,849
and a very angry loan shark
named Claude.

506
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,120
What is the matter with you?

507
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,314
I think you flicked something
in my mouth!

508
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,448
- I have lice!
- You have...?

509
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,651
Lice! Oh, my God!

510
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,591
I couldn't get out
of there fast enough.

511
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,164
I just kept picturing
little tiny bugs

512
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,200
repelling off my hair
into his inbox.

513
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,031
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh, my God. I'm going to vomit.

514
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,435
Oh, no!

515
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,839
Hold on, Richard. Hold on, hold on.
I'll be right with you.

516
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,911
Wait, don't put the phone
near your hair.

517
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,035
Hi, Richard.

518
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,704
- What's up?
- I got it.

519
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,841
[chuckles] No more basement
renovations for me.

520
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:57,944
Oh, my God! Oh, that's
the best news in the world!

521
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,920
Oh, honey! I'm so proud of you.

522
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,719
Well, come on home.
We gotta celebrate.

523
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,387
I will, I'll be home
before you know it. Bye.

524
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,095
Yay! Wow!

525
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,430
This could be a disaster.

526
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:17,531
[laughs] Of course
a lot of kids get lice.

527
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,802
The dirty ones.

528
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,879
The ones whose mothers don't have time
to wash their hair properly.

529
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,244
Kate. Or worse, have a
1 9-year-old wash 'em. Ugh!

530
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,149
Come on, lots of kids get lice
at school. It's not a big deal.

531
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,553
Yes, there were whispers
that Kate had lice.

532
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,684
And in the world of finance, we know
that you don't ignore the whispers.

533
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,490
So I had my office fumigated,

534
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,759
and then I went to the kitchen
and threw away Kate's coffee mug,

535
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,801
as well as anything in the refrigerator
with Kate's name on it.

536
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:50,272
And moving forward, I will not
get in an elevator or a taxi with Kate.

537
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,841
[girl crying]

538
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,176
[children screaming]

539
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,080
Oh! Ooh!

540
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,551
- Sorry, I'm...
- If you get this, you have to take it.

541
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,315
- It's huge.
- How can l?

542
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,654
Richard's really hoping I'm gonna work
less now that he's got this new project.

543
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,590
And I am barely... Ow!

544
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,095
...barely... Sorry.
I'm barely keeping up as it is.

545
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,758
Anyway, it's never gonna happen.
Abelhammer clearly thought I was insane.

546
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,631
I sent him an email about a...
[mouths words]

547
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,500
I had "bouncy house"
written across my hand,

548
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,107
and I was scratching like a dog.

549
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,436
- [cell phone rings]
- Hello?

550
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,841
Oh, hi, Clark.

551
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,378
Oh, I'm... I'm...

552
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,277
I'm at a... I'm at a breakfast.

553
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,646
Is everything...?

554
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,813
OK.

555
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,421
Yep, I'll be there.

556
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,920
OK. Ow!

557
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,615
OK, bye-bye. Bye.

558
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,628
Abelhammer wants to talk to me.

559
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,787
OK, the call is up.

560
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,263
You're just waiting
on Mr. Abelhammer.

561
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,800
OK, great. Thank you.

562
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,431
[sighs]

563
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,752
Oh, for crying out loud.

564
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,382
How the heck did that happen?

565
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,189
- [Jack clears throat]
- Oh, God! [laughs]

566
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,923
- How long have you been there?
- Long enough, but go ahead.

567
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,534
If there's anything else
you need to, uh... adjust.

568
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,603
No, no. I think I am...
I'm fully adjusted, though.

569
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,901
[laughs] Thank you.
Thank you.

570
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,941
[Jack] Thanks for coming
down here yesterday.

571
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,738
Of course. Of course,
you know...

572
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,073
So I like the proposal.

573
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,307
Got a lot of holes in it,
but I think we can fix them

574
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,111
and maybe make some money here.

575
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,719
However, we'd be
on a tight deadline.

576
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,617
Harcourt's looking
at other possibilities

577
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,656
and wants to make a decision
by the end of the year.

578
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,521
This is a massive undertaking.

579
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,390
- Y eah.
- This will mean a lot of travel,

580
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,191
Iong days, late nights,
and I just wanna make sure

581
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,630
it won't be too much for you,
considering what you're up against

582
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,030
with the six kids and the lice.

583
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,762
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

584
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,468
- How do you know...?
- Your text message was showing.

585
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,305
- I can read upside down.
- [laughs] Oh.

586
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,972
So... what do you think, Kate?

587
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,250
Can you swing it?

588
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,949
[Kate] This could be the best thing

589
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,987
that's ever happened for my career.

590
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,216
It's just the worst time
for it to happen.

591
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,292
[Bunce] Gives your kids a chance to
spend all that extra quality time

592
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,917
they've been hoping for...
with your nanny.

593
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,223
[Allison] You love your job more
than almost anybody I know.

594
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,764
[Bunce] A lot of travel,
a lot of one-on-one with Abelhammer.

595
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,733
[Kate] I knew exactly
what I needed to say.

596
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,394
Of course I can.

597
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,165
[elevator dings]

598
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,069
[Kate] Oh, can you hold
that elevator?!

599
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,143
Can you...? Oh! Thank you!
Can you scooch over a little?

600
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,803
Sorry, it's my daughter's
sixth birthday tomorrow,

601
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,916
and I was just afraid the bakery
and balloon place would close,

602
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,881
so I went at lunch.

603
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,510
Great. Can someone
push lobby for me?

604
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,714
Thank you.

605
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,290
All in?

606
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:56,858
[balloon pops]

607
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,519
Everyone knows the right way

608
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,994
to throw a birthday party.

609
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,031
You call Ernesto
at Playtime Events.

610
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,193
He handles everything.
The letter-pressed invitations,

611
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,099
the balloons, all perfect.

612
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,263
And if you slip him an extra 50,

613
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,342
he will even send your in-laws
the wrong address

614
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,707
so that they end up just driving
around the city all day,

615
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,404
and then they show up right
at the end of the party.

616
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,276
[doorbell rings]

617
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,881
- Hi, honey.
- [Richard] Mom, Dad, hi, come on in.

618
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,280
- Oh!
- [woman] Hi, Kate.

619
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,649
- [Richard] How's it going?
- Hi!

620
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,053
- Hi. Thank you for coming.
- Our pleasure.

621
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,592
Oh, that's very sweet.
Good to see you.

622
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,354
- Good to see you.
- That's lovely. Thanks.

623
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,487
So, um, can l
get you guys a drink?

624
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,123
- [Emily] Oh, no!
- [crashing]

625
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,670
Or some candy?

626
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,707
- Do you have any soda for the kids?
- No, no soda, Mom.

627
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,038
Too much sugar.

628
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,373
Yeah, and dried fruit is out.
It rots their teeth.

629
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,177
Last year, the nursery school
issued a fatwa on raisins.

630
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,810
- And yet you have a pinata.
- Well, you know, that's different.

631
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,721
That's, um... That's, uh...
culturally enriching.

632
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,918
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

633
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,426
[woman] Here's some water,
sweetie.

634
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,086
- [Emily] Thanks, Grandma.
- She thinks we're ridiculous.

635
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,495
'Cause we are, a little.

636
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,191
You OK?
You seem a little off today.

637
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,462
Me? Yeah.
I'm great, why?

638
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,367
- [doorbell rings]
- The, uh, savages have arrived.

639
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,874
I'll get the door.

640
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,842
Wait, Richard, Richard.
We need to talk.

641
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,277
- [doorbell rings]
- Now?

642
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,978
Uh, no, OK, later.

643
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,017
Of course, you're right.
Later.

644
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,245
- What is it, Kate?
- No, it's just... You know what?

645
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,415
It's just a thing. Honestly, it's no
big deal. We'll discuss it later.

646
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,086
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, go. Open the door.

647
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,062
I'm really sorry, but New York
liked my idea for the retirement fund.

648
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,167
- They want me to develop it further.
- [kids chatter outside]

649
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,464
Which means that I will be really busy
and traveling for the next two months.

650
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,333
[girl] Let me in!

651
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,005
Is that cake made
with organic flour?

652
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,041
- Yep.
- Thanks.

653
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,701
We got a diaper change!

654
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,143
Clothing change.

655
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,078
Oh, they need to be boiled.

656
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,808
Hey, we need to talk
about that thing later.

657
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,680
Yep, can't wait.

658
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,614
Are you guys having fun?

659
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,420
He really is incredible
with them, isn't he?

660
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,425
- Yeah.
- I know when our kids were little,

661
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,792
I don't think Lew
changed one diaper.

662
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,226
Men just didn't do
that kind of thing back then.

663
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,461
- Well, that's because...
- Yeah, we were terrible parents.

664
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,499
We didn't know what tofu was.

665
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,932
Oh, but that was a simpler time.

666
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,407
And everybody knew their place,
what they had to do.

667
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,604
Lew made the money,
I changed the diapers,

668
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,215
if we couldn't pay the bills,
that was Lew's fault.

669
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,808
The kids were crying,
that was me.

670
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,421
But boy, you all...

671
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,991
If something goes wrong,
it's everybody's fault.

672
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,491
I don't think that does
anyone any good.

673
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,961
Well, I think it's...
I think it's just a more complicated...

674
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,794
Well, it's as complicated
as you make it, dear.

675
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,631
You know, I was wondering,

676
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,601
if you had stayed home with Ben,

677
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,536
would he be talking now?

678
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,303
He's almost two
and not one real word.

679
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,874
Doesn't that bother you?

680
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,480
And the worst part is she's right, you
know? I mean, about Ben not talking.

681
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,556
By this age, Emily was reciting the
first chapter of Canterbury Tales

682
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,353
in Middle English,
and all Ben does is grunt.

683
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,689
Kate, that's fine.
We gotta talk about the fact...

684
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,493
Richard, Richard, I know.
I know it's lousy timing for both of us.

685
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,863
To get a big project at work
at the same time, I know that.

686
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,301
But we can make it work.
I know we can.

687
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,339
And I'm gonna do my very best
to make sure that

688
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,409
nothing falls through the cracks.

689
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,074
Look, Richard,

690
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,513
you have been working so hard
to get a big break at work. Me, too.

691
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,177
It's a great problem.
We can do this.

692
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,312
- We just have to do a little juggling.
- I know.

693
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,822
- But if we're...
- I promise I will make everything work.

694
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,654
- Don't worry.
- OK, but I'm just telling you...

695
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,625
I said don't worry!

696
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,923
You kind of yelled it,
which isn't as comforting, actually.

697
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,127
[sighs]

698
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,112
What's this?
What are you doing?

699
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,338
Hm?

700
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,383
We're about to make
a giant mess out of our lives

701
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,885
and you're gonna use sex to try and
pretend everything's better?

702
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,648
Is that the plan?

703
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,621
- Yes.
- I like it.

704
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,527
I mean, I really like it.

705
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,499
Quite frankly, using sex to make up
for the flaws in your relationship

706
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,036
is as low as you can go.

707
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,163
But sometimes you have to do it.

708
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,968
I actually do it all the time.

709
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,134
One hundred percent success rate.

710
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,875
[Kate] Richard was right to be worried.
It was gonna be very challenging.

711
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,917
Thank God I had Momo
to help me with the workload.

712
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,715
Kind, supportive, friendly...
she was none of those things.

713
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,756
But she worked her ass off.

714
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,722
- [jet engine roaring]
- I've been running...

715
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,987
[Kate] My job was to spend
two or three days a week

716
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,460
in New York with Jack.

717
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,326
He was impressive,
he was insightful,

718
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,230
he was smart,
he was a lot of things.

719
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,666
And none of them were Chris Bunce.

720
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,034
I think we should include an
insurance wrapper on the fund

721
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,074
- for the low-income retirees.
- Exactly.

722
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:20,651
- Jack, I just wanna say...
- If you're gonna thank me again,

723
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,152
- please don't.
- No.

724
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,585
I wasn't going to.

725
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,727
I wouldn't thank someone
for giving me a big break,

726
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,296
I mean, possibly the biggest
break of my career.

727
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,262
I mean, what kind of person
would that make me?

728
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,300
Fine. Precisely.

729
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,165
But thank you.

730
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,287
[murmuring indistinctly]

731
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,719
This is the one
we'd better get done.

732
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,917
Yep, all right.
All right, I gotta hit the ladies.

733
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,905
I'm sorry I won't be there to kiss you
good night, but I'll see you tomorrow.

734
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,101
OK?

735
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,542
OK.

736
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,272
# I love you

737
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,973
# A bushel and a peck

738
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,143
# A bushel and a peck
and a hug around the neck

739
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,084
# A hug around the neck

740
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,053
# And a barrel and a heap

741
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,820
# A barrel and a heap
and I'm talking in my sleep

742
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,828
# About you #

743
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,955
[jazz plays]

744
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,966
[indistinct chatter]

745
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,674
[Kate] For the high-yield set,
I thought we could do a time series

746
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,243
showing the higher yield
on the MSCl index...

747
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,608
- Bup, bup, bup! No more work.
- Sorry.

748
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,748
And can I have my martini back?

749
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,284
You keep on moving it away
from the edge of the table.

750
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
[laughs] I'm sorry.

751
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,913
Sorry, it's horrible. I'm surprised
I'm not cutting your steak for you.

752
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,391
- [laughs]
- It's force of habit, I guess.

753
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,793
- That's OK.
- Do you... do you have kids?

754
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,658
No.

755
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,794
Um... I did, um...

756
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,138
I was married, once.

757
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,437
She was a great girl.
Very special.

758
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,980
And then...

759
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,744
...two years into the marriage,
she got sick and...

760
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,883
Even though she put up
an incredible fight...

761
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,126
- I'm very sorry.
- It's OK.

762
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,661
I'm OK. You know,

763
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,893
something like that
happens in your life,

764
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,666
and it changes the way,
well, you... see everything.

765
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,471
So, since then, I try to keep
things as simple as possible.

766
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,739
I love my job,
I love my work.

767
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,611
It has its ups and downs, but at least
it doesn't break your heart.

768
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,515
So, what about you?
You like what you do?

769
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,689
- I love my job.
- Mm-hm.

770
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,313
They market doesn't know what sex I am,

771
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,052
it only knows
whether I'm right or wrong.

772
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,594
- I like the fairness of that.
- Mm-hm.

773
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,995
Although, sometimes I wish
I didn't love my job so much

774
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,830
- because then...
- Then you could be home with your kids.

775
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,629
You're allowed to miss your children.

776
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:33,301
Here's the thing.
I have two beautiful kids.

777
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,071
And I love them.

778
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,409
But life changes.
There's no question about that.

779
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,414
There's no spur
of the moment activities,

780
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,781
you're not meeting people
for dinner at the last minute,

781
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,411
or seeing a movie
whenever you want.

782
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,581
Or, you know, going bowling.

783
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,056
- Bowling?
- Yeah.

784
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,956
My sister and l
used to bowl all the time.

785
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,995
But now we're both mothers and...

786
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,859
So, you know,
where is the time?

787
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,292
Bowling.

788
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told
you all that about my children.

789
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,206
- Not professional.
- Uh-huh.

790
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,106
I'll tell you what.
From now on,

791
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,576
don't think of me
as Kate the working mom.

792
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,274
Think of me as Bill,

793
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,213
your trusted
financial analyst.

794
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,254
Well, the fact is studies show
women make better investors.

795
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,788
- Hm!
- But if you want,

796
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,414
I'll just forget you're a woman.
[whistles]

797
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,493
OK, oh...

798
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,058
Here you go.
All right.

799
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,495
Thanks. I mean, not thanks.

800
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,798
Well...

801
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,337
- Good night, Jack.
- Good night, Bill.

802
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,565
[chuckles]

803
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,277
Oh! Bye-bye! Bye-bye.

804
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,877
Bye-bye.

805
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,427
[Kate] From that moment on,
life got busier and busier.

806
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,794
And the funny thing is it really looked
like I was making everything work.

807
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,731
I read once that the key to juggling

808
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,739
is not catching, but throwing.

809
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,070
So I just kept throwing,

810
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,644
and throwing, and throwing.

811
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,509
It doesn't smell.

812
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,206
It's got no stains.

813
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,784
My God!
I have something to wear!

814

I have never seen Kate
work so hard,

820
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,433
but she's always been there
for Ben and Emily.

821
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,040
I mean, she spreads
some serious love on those kids.

822

# You're looking at the queen

825
00:40:55,886 --> 00:41:00,118
I drop my kids off
for school at 7:15,

826
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,055
so I'm here about,
what, 7:45? Eight-ish?

827
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,059
- That's about right.
- Yeah.

828
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,826
And then I leave around... two?

Why not?

833
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,407
I know you, Hildy,
I know what winning would mean.

834
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,102
- What would it mean?
- It would kill you.

835
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,771
- You can't sell me that.
- Who says I can't?

00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,042
- You're a newspaperman!
- That's why I'm quitting.

837
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,708

it was as if our lives
were on fast forward.

840
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,022
I just had to keep my eye on everything,
all at the same time.

- Look out! Coming through!

842

[Kate] See, the other
basic rule of juggling

843
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,991
- is that what goes up...
- [gasps]

844
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,463
...must come down.

- [toy] Bye-bye.

847

[Kate] At the same time, Jack and I had
this insane deadline looming,

848
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,742
so our emails went
from daily to hourly.

But I promise you,
I was careful to maintain

Hi, Daddy. Two, three.

Hey, you remember that Paula's
gotta leave today at five.

875
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,077
- So can you...
- Oh, no, I got that meeting at 4:00.

876
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,612
- Oh, shit.
- Then I got the dinner afterwards.

877
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,444
- Yeah, I forgot.
- So you think maybe you can...

878
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,279
Yeah, that's not a problem.
I'll do that.

879

- Oh. I love you, too. Bye.

- Where in the hell is Paula?
- Oh, I don't know. Don't...

00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,952
I'll take, um, I'll take
Ben to Allison's nanny,

882
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,391
and then I'll take Emily
to school, OK?

Can you come get your lunch box?

[Clark] Great series
of meetings this week.

The T note yields for the
third quarter look good.

888
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,105
All right, then.

889
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,709
Let's go make some money.

[Bunce] You know I do.
It'd be an honor if you let me buy.

892
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,882
[Clark] What'd you think
about that game last night?

893
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,542
- [continues indistinct]
- I'm gonna be in late tomorrow.

894
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,814
- Doctor's appointment.
- Oh, OK.

895
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,985
Because I'm pregnant.

896
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,456
- You're what?!
- I know, I know.

897
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,360
Some kind of systems failure
on the birth control.

898
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,623
Don't worry,
I'm dealing with it.

899
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,827
I'm not having kids,
remember?

900
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,564
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.

901
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,572
I know you look at me
and you see a mess,

902
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,909
a hurry, a giant un-tweezed eyebrow,
I am walking birth control.

903
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,914
I get it.

904
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,814
But it's not all that.

905
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:52,251
There is so much joy.

906
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,881
And if, for some reason,
you wanted to go through

907
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,860
the madness of having a baby,
I could help you.

908
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:03,524
I've been doing it for a while.
I could teach you some useful tricks

909
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,635
to help you manage
both work and home

910
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:10,206
so that neither side gets...
Oh, my God! What time is it?!

911
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,399
Oh, shit!

912
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,909
Shit! Shit, shit.

913
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:19,175
Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!

914
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:21,916
Shit.

915
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,815
Hey, Richard, it's me.

916
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,252
I am so, so, so sorry, honey.

917
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,517
I know you have a dinner,
and I am on my way

918
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,957
and then you can go.
I am on the stairs.

919
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,892
I'm approaching
a revolving door.

920
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,759
I am in the revolving door.

921
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,890
A woman just keeps the puzzle
of family life in her head.

922
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,627
She just does.

923
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,068
The inside of a working
woman's head is like...

924
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,697
...the control tower at O'Hare Airport.

925
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,810
- Richard, honey!
- [Ben babbling]

926
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:50,038
I'm here! I'm home!

927
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,444
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Hi, honey. Where's Daddy?

928
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,551
- He had to go to dinner.
- He's at dinner?

929
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,482
Then who are you here with?

930
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,249
[snoring]

931
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,493
I'm sorry,
I didn't know what to do.

932
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,096
- Yeah, I know that, but...
- So I called Wendy what's-her-name,

933
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,325
and I asked if her babysitter
could come over after work.

934
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,834
You called Wendy "l do
everything perfectly best"?

935
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,701
And then you left my kids
with somebody that I don't know?

936
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,172
Kate, you weren't here.
I left them with a sitter.

937
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,005
- Yes, who doesn't know them.
- It was OK!

938
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,206
Sometimes OK has to be good enough.
I mean, the kids are fine.

939
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,614
So, in this case, I would say
the old lady was the perfect babysitter.

940
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,652
Getting a backup sitter
is on my list.

941
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,949
Oh, Jesus, with these lists.
Really?

942
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,081
I mean, do Pilates,
bake lasagna,

943
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,921
you might as well
put down dock the space station.

944
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,690
Well, that's not very nice. You know,
I get a lot done from those lists.

945
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,630
I know, I'm sorry, honey.
Let's just... Iet's go to bed. OK?

946
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:48,499
Wait, Richard, wait.
I have to go to Cleveland tomorrow.

947
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,470
It's just for one night.

948
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,734
Jack and I have to meet
these potential brokers,

949
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,276
you know, to just get a sense of how
much they're willing to commit

950
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:59,212
before we put this
in front of Harcourt, and...

951
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,748
[sighs]

952
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,246
Come on. Let's go to bed.

953
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:12,125
I'm still...
I'm still in here.

954
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,492
[Bunce] Look, you have to travel
in this job. We're road warriors.

955
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,795
And if you are tethered to anything,

956
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,803
uh, then you are a bird that cannot fly.

957
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:25,238
And no one goes to a pet store
and says,

958
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,434
"l would like a bird that cannot fly."

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,058
Thank you.

963
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,499
They'll be some
persuading Harcourt to commit.

964
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,070
Thank you very much.

965

This is the sort of thing
that cracks my family up.

00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,913
Sorry.

969
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,622
So the brokers,
you feel good about them?

970
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,486
They love it. You know...

971
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:18,925
Should we go visit some of the
famous sights of Cleveland?

972

My mother always says,
"Oh, it must be so exciting

975
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,399
to see all those different cities,"
but we mostly just see

- Is he? I hadn't noticed.
- Oh, you hadn't noticed?

1072
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,671
- Is he... is he not hideous?
- No... [mumbles]

1073
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,580
- [Richard laughs]
- So he's happy.

1074
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:13,087
Which means that we can go to
your parents' for Thanksgiving.

1075
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,317
And then we can get the Christmas tree
on Friday like we've been talking about.

1076
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:20,054
And then I was thinking that maybe...

1077
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,926
-...we could get a sitter.
- Yeah.

1078
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,862
Yeah. Yeah, we can get a sitter,

1079
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,197
and then maybe we go
to the movies, you know?

1080
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,771
- Yeah. That'd be fun.
- Yeah.

1081
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,398
It's gonna be a great,
perfect, fun trip.

1082
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,307
OK, OK. I like it.

1083
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,483
I woke up in the middle of the night and
I realized we should adjust the charts

1084
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,086
so that dividends are grouped
by asset class.

1085
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,552
Great. We can go
over this tomorrow.

1086
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,180
No, you can just email
it to me. It's OK.

1087
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,156
I'm out of the office
till Monday.

1088
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,885
You are? But there is so much
that you said...

1089
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:55,555
It's Thanksgiving.
It's fine. We are OK.

1090
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,668
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Yes.

1091
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,896
And I really wanna
spend time with my family.

1092
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,831
- One more thing.
- Yeah?

1093
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,869
I'm having the baby.

1094
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,972
I'm sorry, what?

1095
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,447
I'm only disclosing that
because, as my superior,

1096
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,347
- I believe that you...
- Oh, my God, Momo!

1097
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,216
Momo, forget about all that.

1098
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,787
I'm uncomfortable now.

1099
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,259
I'm just so happy for you.

1100
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,954
I'm still uncomfortable.

1101
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,862
There's no way anyone
can explain it to you

1102
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,528
before you have a baby,
and once you do,

1103
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,902
you'll wonder why no one
ever told you how it felt.

1104
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,934
Please stop holding me.

1105
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,309
Happy Thanksgiving.

1106
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,175
Same to you.

1107
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,541
Being pregnant
doesn't feel awesome.

1108
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:50,948
It feels like a mistake.

1109
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,749
But lots of people
have babies as mistakes.

1110
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,185
Maybe... maybe my baby
will turn into Justin Bieber.

1111
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,818
He started as a mistake.

1112
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,487
Now he's a billionaire.

1113
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,230
- Good night.
- [man] Good night, Kate.

1114
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,563
There you are.
Heard you're taking off what?

1115
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:11,470
Five days? I love that carpe diem thing
you have going on.

1116
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,542
But, just so you know,
I'll be in town.

1117
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,770
Wife cooks dinner
for about 20 people.

1118
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,402
Makes three turkeys.

1119
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,913
So if you need me
to cover for you,

1120
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,813
- I'll be right here.
- [elevator dings]

1121
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,548
Three turkeys? Wow.

1122
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,212
That's... that's amazing.

1123
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,757
You know, why not give Abelhammer
my cell in case he needs anything.

1124
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:30,882
Happy Thanksgiving.

1125
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,656
This is what you need
to know about Bunce.

1126
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,962
He's one of those guys
who loves to come in at the end

1127
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:42,094
and take the credit after someone else
has done all the hard work.

1128
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:46,698
If I slip up even a little,
he is so ready to pounce.

1129
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,641
I make a great turkey, too,
by the way.

1130
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,215
It's delicious.

1131
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,013
Everyone says my breast
is very juicy.

1132
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,142
[elevator dings]

1133
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:01,254
- [Kate] Ah!
- Oh, my God.

1134
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,353
You like the mule
in Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

1135
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,429
OK, I got the changing pad
and the portable high chair,

1136
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,828
the porta-crib, bibs,

1137
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,457
Thomas the Tank Engine
cereal bowls.

1138
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,867
There's no reason to pack.

1139
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,835
Everyone knows that you buy
two of everything,

1140
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,840
you keep one set at the country house.
Boom. Done.

1141
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,776
I swear to God, Louis XlV
traveled lighter than we do.

1142
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,381
- You ready to have fun?
- [panting]

1143
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:30,179
Well, I like the spirit.
[chuckles]

1144
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,721
Just don't tell your mother about my new
project or that I'm on deadline, OK?

1145
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,757
What do you wanna do?
You wanna lie to her?

1146
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,053
Hm... Iet's see. Yes.

1147
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,424
Oh, OK. All right.

1148
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,088
- Here. Ah!
- That's not gonna wanna stay.

1149
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,293
- One, two, three...
- Whoo! [laughs]

1150
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,098
Don't worry about that.

1151
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,469
- That's ours, right?
- [laughs] Oh, no.

1152
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,868
- [# Bill Withers: "Lovely Day"]
- [Richard] Who knows the lyrics?

1153
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:58,379
- [Emily] You do, Daddy.
- [Richard] Come on. I love this part.

1154
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:02,007
# Bears heavy on my mind
Take it, Kate.

1155
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,518
[Kate laughs] OK.
# Then I look at you

1156
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,212
[Richard] Emily, come on!

1157
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,122
[Emily] # And the world's
all right with me

1158
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,955
[Richard] That's right.
Take it, Kate.

1159
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,529
[Kate] # Just one look at you

1160
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:15,824
[Richard] What are we gonna do?

1161
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,957
[all]
# And I know it's gonna be

1162
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,967
- [Richard] Here we go!
- [Kate] One, two...

1163
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,470
- [all] # A lovely day
- Oh!

1164
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,340
Look at this.
We're on a trip.

1165
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,039
We're all in one place.
Right?

1166
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,946
You're right.
You're right, this is great.

1167
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,609
- It's nice.
- Really.

1168
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,518
- [laughing]
- [cell phone buzzes]

1169
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,784
- You're buzzing.
- Oh.

1170
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,292
- Sorry.
- No, it's all right.

1171
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:49,023
I'm gonna silence this thing.

1172
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,293
And it's... quiet.

1173
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,733
- And I'm not gonna work.
- Sounds good. OK.

1174
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:55,735
I'm...

1175
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,703
I am not working.

1176
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:58,705
See?

1177
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,367
- Don't need it.
- Are you sure?

1178
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,443
- Yes!
- It's OK.

1179
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,637
If you need to take the call,
it's fine.

1180
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,340
- I don't need it.
- OK.

1181
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,347
- Oh!
- [all yelling]

1182
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,684
That's a mistake!
Big mistake! Who wants some?

1183
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,850
- Come over here!
- Ah!

1184
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,053
- Get him, get him!
- Ah!

1185
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,188
[all laughing, shouting]

1186
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,903
- Those look great.
- Thank you. [chuckles]

1187
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,479
Thanks for doing this.

1188
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,516
Those smell delicious, Kate.

1189
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,988
- So a bunch of snowmen are standing...
- Oh, no!

1190
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,650
A bunch of snowmen are standing
in front of the barbershop,

1191
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,557
- and one of them says...
- Who smells carrots.

1192
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,859
- Uh... Oh, come on!
- Same one as last year.

1193
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,093
- Thank you.
- You ruined my joke!

1194
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,227
- You ruined my joke!
-...30 years ago...

1195
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,737
- [laughing]
- That's my joke!

1196
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,569
- I don't get it.
- Because of their nose.

1197
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,974
- 'Cause their nose is a carrot.
- You know the pond is frozen.

1198
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,274
So if anybody wants
to go skating tomorrow...

1199
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,610
Well, I promised Em that we were gonna
build a snowman tomorrow, right?

1200
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,946
- Yeah.
- We can do it at the pond.

1201
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:20,852
[Richard] Oh, that was great,
Mom. What did you do this year?

1202
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,254
[mother] I ran out of canned
pumpkin, so I had to...

1203
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,054
- [phone rings]
- [Richard] You used cream?

1204
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,752
[mother] Yeah.
I used light cream,

1205
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,296
- but heavy cream's better.
- You OK?

1206
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,024
- Yeah, she's here.
- Yeah.

1207
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,226
Kate, it's for you.
It's someone named Nono.

1208
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,735
Oh, no, Momo.
I'm gonna take it in the other room.

1209
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,204
[father] Momo,
what does that mean?

1210
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:41,276
[indistinct chatter]

1211
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,242
- Are you OK?
- [Momo] What is the matter with you?

1212
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,778
- I left you 100 messages.
- OK.

1213
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,939
- Jack is trying to reach you.
- OK, I'll check my phone.

1214
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,744
[mother] Remember Barry Brentwood?

1215
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,409
- He was arrested.
- Mm.

1216
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:51,781
- [father] What?
- [mother] He's going to prison.

1217
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,388
- Really?
- Barry Brentwood?

1218
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,218
- [mother] Barry Brentwood.
- [Richard] What did he do?

1219
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,588
[mother] Oh, my God.
He got into something

1220
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,423
with a drug dealer, and they
hired him to kill somebody...

1221
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,162
[father] Oh, no.

1222
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,756
Who did he kill?

1223
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,426
[mother] I don't know!
I don't know. Somebody...

1224
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:11,267
Hi, Jack, sorry I missed your
calls. My cell reception is...

1225
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,898
Um, anyway, what's up?

1226
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,238
[Jack] Sorry, Kate.
Harcourt's schedule changed.

1227
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,041
- He can only hear the pitch tomorrow.
- Oh, shit.

1228
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,740
Well, um, when did that happen?

1229
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:24,114
[Jack] If you can't make it,
maybe Bunce can take over.

1230
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:28,485
So Harcourt has to go to Hong Kong
the day after tomorrow for a week.

1231
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,753
There's some emergency
with the Asian brokerage house.

1232
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:35,853
Which means that tomorrow
morning is our only shot

1233
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,489
to get this thing in front of him.

1234
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,499
But Jack said Bunce would do it.

1235
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,002
- Let him go.
- Come on, Richard.

1236
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,665
I can't let Bunce take this. You know
how hard I've been working on it.

1237
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:49,801
But I can't control
how and where we pitch it.

1238
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,882
It's not my fault. I have... I have
planned everything so this exact thing

1239
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,951
would not happen.

1240
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,945
But we were supposed
to make a snowman.

1241
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,388
Sweetie, I know. Listen.

1242
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,154
The very next time there's snow,

1243
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:09,492
we're gonna make a snowman.
I promise. OK?

1244
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,623
You already promised.

1245
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:15,898
[Ben babbling]

1246
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,872
Hey. Bye-bye, bunny.

1247
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,171
- Bye-bye, Mama.
- [gasps] Oh, my God!

1248
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:26,805
- [Ben laughs]
- You spoke!

1249
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,917
Ben!

1250
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,247
You said, "Bye-bye, Mama."

1251
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,378
- He spoke!
- "Bye-bye, Mama."

1252
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,423
Well, it'll come in handy.

1253
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,924
- Richard, I'm...
- You gotta go, Kate.

1254
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,630
And we'll talk about it
when you get back, OK?

1255
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,963
[car starts]

1256
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:52,835
Bye.

1257
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:05,254
Oh, we all heard
about Thanksgiving.

1258
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,880
Leaving right after dinner?
Seriously? Who does that?

1259
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,959
No, I prefer
to be with my family.

1260
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,621
You know, clean up while my husband
and his friends watch football

1261
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:18,598
and I chase after the kids because
they've had eight slices of pecan pie.

1262
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,637
Then I make 11 sandwiches of leftovers
for everybody for the next day.

1263
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:26,230
Listen to my mother-in-law yammer on
for the 15th time

1264
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,172
that my stuffing was too dry.

1265
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,245
Like I've never
heard that one before.

1266
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,813
[sighs]

1267
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,416
I just...

1268
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,846
It's family, and I love it.
I love it.

1269
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,251
[Momo] I'm feeling
much better, thanks.

1270
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,915
- Let's focus on the proposal.
- [Kate] OK.

1271
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,028
I was thinking we could
start with an overview

1272
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,097
of dividend payers
versus non-payers.

1273
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,790
[groaning]

1274
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,424
- [moaning]
- Whoa! Careful!

1275
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,561
Or you could... throw up
again a few more times.

1276
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:59,140
[toilet flushes]

1277
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,507
- Momo, you OK?
- [Momo] Yeah, I'm fine.

1278
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,909
[moans] This does not
feel like a miracle.

1279
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:09,006
Oh! Don't worry, morning sickness
only lasts about, um,

1280
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,084
nine months.

1281
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,944
[groans]

1282
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:15,319
Ooh, oh, yeah.
I've been there.

1283
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:22,323
- You OK?
- Don't I look OK? Let's walk.

1284
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,628
Oh, Momo! Momo, Momo! Momo!

1285
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,171
Oh, my God!

1286
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,002
It's official.
I'm disgusting.

1287
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,442
How did this happen?
Don't answer that.

1288
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,470
[Momo] I didn't get any
sleep last night.

1289
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,242
I think this baby's
on a treadmill.

1290
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,511
- [phone rings]
- [Kate] Thank you.

1291
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,888
- Hey. Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

1292
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,787
Thank you for your lovely note
and the room is beautiful.

1293
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,521
You know what? You knocked yourself out
getting this thing right.

1294
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,755
You deserve a nice room

1295
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,525
and if this thing has any chance at all
with Harcourt, it's gonna be because

1296
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,795
- of the way you pitch it.
- He's ready for you.

1297
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,097
Let's go. [clears throat]

1298
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,399
Remember, we're a great team, Bill.

1299
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,064
[chuckles]

1300
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,409
Good morning.

1301
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:10,978
We're here today

1302
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,411
to talk about possibility.

1303
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,677
The possibility of a
new financial product

1304
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:20,084
that could restore some of the faith
we've lost with our customer.

1305
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:24,182
We wanna show them that we understand,
that we wanna make money

1306
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,022
for them as well as for us.

1307
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,188
So I would like to start off
with a few charts

1308
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,824
showing you the dividend
base strategy we've devised.

1309
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:40,339
- Momo!
- [snorts]

1310
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,376
[computer dings]

1311
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,309
- Which will show you...
- [Kate] The PowerPoint presentation

1312
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,109
was going really well.

1313
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,277
No one could tell Momo and I
had been up all night rehearsing.

1314
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,217
Until...

1315
01:04:56,826 --> 01:05:00,660
OK, 300 presentations last year,
and I never messed up once.

1316
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,230
It's not my fault. The pregnancy
did something to my brain.

1317
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,096
I don't get it, OK? The baby
is nowhere near your brain.

1318
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,930
What else can it do to your brain?

1319
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,003
Mm!

1320
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,107
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I was so nervous.

1321
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,544
- I forgot the whole...
- Are you kidding? That was a home run.

1322
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:22,173
I didn't have to say a word.
He loved it. I could tell.

1323
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,616
- Really?
- Really! You lunatic!

1324
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,949
God, I love...

1325
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,784
I love the way you ran that.
It was brilliant.

1326
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,358
- Absolutely brilliant. There he is.
- Thank you.

1327
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,757
- Let me close this.
- OK, OK.

1328
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,157
OK.

1329
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:36,954
You OK?

1330
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,563
[Momo] Kate, I hope
I didn't blow this for us.

1331
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,573
[Kate] No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

1332
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,647
[sighs] Just like I thought.
He thinks you're terrific.

1333
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,951
Wants to know what we've been
doing hiding you in Boston.

1334
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,650
- Really?
- Yep. He's going to take me to lunch.

1335
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,194
He's got a lot of questions.
But they sound like the right questions.

1336
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,594
The ones that mean he's serious.

1337
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,196
So should l...?

1338
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,667
Should I go back? To Boston?

1339
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,398
Yeah, I guess. Uh, I'll
call you if I hear anything.

1340
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,564
- OK?
- OK.

1341
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,640
You know the first thing he said to me?

1342
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,678
- Where did I get this idea?
- Oh...

1343
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,880
I hope he told him he
got the idea from you.

1344
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,013
Well, I mean, you know, we really, he
and I really developed it together.

1345
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,593
It's changed a lot
since the version that I started with.

1346
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,526
It's not right.
You should be at the lunch.

1347
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,791
- Harcourt should know you.
- He will. He will.

1348
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:47,994
I mean, he does. I'm the one that really
pitched it in the meeting, not Jack.

1349
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,799
Yeah. But now Jack is going
to lunch with Harcourt,

1350
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,467
and you can just bet by dessert,
this whole thing will be Jack's idea.

1351
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,738
These guys don't get to the top
by giving credit to the junior team.

1352
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,012
What am I doing?

1353
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:04,310
You gotta come with me.

1354
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,221
You're where I got this idea.

1355
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,323
It's yours.

1356
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,049
We're a team.

1357
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,955
And teams stick together.

1358
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,728
Right, Momo?

1359
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,562
[Kate] So it's the 18th frame,

1360
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,601
or maybe the 28th frame,
I can't remember.

1361
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:21,998
- [Jack] Eighteenth.
- [Kate] Eighteenth frame.

1362
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:25,039
And, um, you know,
a lot of tension in the bowling alley.

1363
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:28,200
In fact, I think everybody
was completely silent.

1364
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,777
- And this gentleman...
- Except you.

1365
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:33,370
- [laughs]
- This elegant,

1366
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:37,213
wherever you're from,
gets up... [laughs]

1367
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:41,119
Gets up and he says,
"Max's Automotive is going down!"

1368
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,747
- Just like that.
- Just like that!

1369
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,656
- I came out of my shell.
- [laughs]

1370
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,787
I think with
a Bronx accent, right?

1371
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,593
- He fit right in.
- [laughs]

1372
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,099
[Harcourt] It was a pleasure
to meet you.

1373
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,566
- [Kate] Likewise.
- [Harcourt] Jack will tell you

1374
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:57,001
that I like to say no,
and I had my doubts coming in,

1375
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,130
but you made a very compelling case.

1376
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,039
- I am intrigued.
- Oh, my God. Well, thank you.

1377
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,146
Thank you, thank you.

1378
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,646
You're right,
she does like to say thank you.

1379
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,477
I'll be in touch.

1380
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:17,122
[laughing] That was miraculous.

1381
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,988
He never says anything positive.

1382
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,527
My God, you think he'll go for it?

1383
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,858
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I think we got a good shot at this.

1384
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,397
- Absolutely.
- Oh, my God!

1385
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,398
I can't believe it went so well!

1386
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,696
- Think you're gonna make your plane?
- Uh, I don't know.

1387
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,363
- I have to see what time it is.
- OK.

1388
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,975
Wow, will you look at that?
This thing finally quit.

1389
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,271
- Battery died?
- Yeah, I didn't charge it.

1390
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,312
OK, OK, hold on.
Use mine.

1391
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,506
That's odd, look at this.

1392
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,082
I got a bunch of missed calls.

1393
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,442
All from you.

1394
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,682
[Kate] Richard, honey, I'm on my way.

1395
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,223
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1396
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,997
[woman] But keep a close eye on him.

1397
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,432
If he experiences any dizziness
or nausea tonight,

1398
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,901
- call us immediately.
- Thank you so much.

1399
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:06,166
- Emily?
- Hi, bunny.

1400
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,469
- Hi, sweetie.
- Mommy.

1401
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,977
Oh, hi, baby.
What happened?

1402
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:16,483
Well, he tripped on that place in the
carpet and fell down the stairs.

1403
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,450
Oh! Sweetie...

1404
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,786
[alarm chirps]

1405
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,625
[Allison] A man announces he's going to
leave the office to be with a child,

1406
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:38,138
and he is hailed as a selfless,
doting, paternal role model.

1407
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:41,266
A woman announces that she's going to
leave the office to be with a child

1408
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,277
on its sick bed, and she is damned

1409
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,540
as disorganized, irresponsible,

1410
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,549
and showing insufficient commitment.

1411
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,518
[cloth tearing]

1412
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,124
[tearing]

1413
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:03,788
I know, it was
on the list, right?

1414
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,026
No. No, forget the list,
Richard. You live here.

1415
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,931
Haven't you tripped on that
thing a million times?

1416
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,630
At least I was here when it happened.
And I tried to call you.

1417
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:12,832
And text you. You didn't
pick up your phone for hours.

1418
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,966
I told you,
I forgot to charge my phone.

1419
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,840
So I was reduced to breaking into
your address book on your computer

1420
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,040
to get the number to your boyfriend.
That was a great feeling.

1421
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,378
- Oh, come on!
- Then he didn't answer either.

1422
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,987
Jack forget to charge his battery, too?
Doesn't sound like him.

1423
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,885
No, we were meeting Harcourt.
You knew that.

1424
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:33,927
It's not like we were naked on a beach
in Aruba sipping Mai Tais.

1425
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,826
Well, that's a weirdly vivid denial.

1426
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:38,798
You're right. I failed.
I messed up.

1427
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,868
I wasn't here
when Ben needed me.

1428
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:44,200
What difference does it make? Even when
you're here, you're not here, Kate.

1429
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,399
We never sit down.

1430
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,409
We never relax,
we don't laugh or goof off.

1431
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,446
I don't want to discuss
how often we're not having sex.

1432
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,582
Well, you know what?
I honestly...

1433
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,709
Honestly, I don't understand

1434
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,411
- what you want from me.
- You don't know what I want?

1435
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,853
I want just a few minutes
where we're not in a panic.

1436
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,084
Where we talk about something
other than logistics.

1437
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:08,686
Where you pretend to laugh at my
old jokes that you've heard before.

1438
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:11,197
Where we have five minutes,
just five,

1439
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,962
of calm, quiet conversation.

1440
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,096
Just five minutes of being together.

1441
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,105
That's all.

1442
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,443
[Kate] My list.

1443
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:33,487
Number one:
get my life together.

1444
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,785
Number two:
stop making lists.

1445
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:44,457
- [Emily] Where's Daddy?
- He had to go to work early.

1446
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:50,003
Hey, Em, you know that I didn't
want to leave Thanksgiving, OK?

1447
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,334
- I wanted to stay...
- Yes, you missed it.

1448
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,339
Just like you missed Jamaica Day.

1449
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,773
And Evie's birthday party.

1450
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:58,175
Because you have
to talk on the phone

1451
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,340
and take an airplane to New York.
I tell everyone that.

1452
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,475
And maybe someday
we can make a snowman together.

1453
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,952
- But probably not.
- No.

1454
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:10,115
No, we will, Em.
I promise. OK?

1455
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,353
The very next time it snows.

1456
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,991
I love you.

1457
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,013
At work, when you act
like one of the boys,

1458
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,557
they call you
abrasive and difficult.

1459
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,058
So you act like a woman,

1460
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,425
and they say you're
emotional and difficult.

1461
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:52,728
So difficult is really just the word
for anything that isn't a man.

1462
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,439
[door opens]

1463
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,976
I wanted to let you know

1464
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,876
I'm hearing some merger rumors
out of Atlanta on that PharmaCom stock.

1465
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,915
Yeah, I heard that.

1466
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,117
Gotta get somebody
down there tonight.

1467
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,749
No, yeah, OK.

1468
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:22,019
- [phone rings]
- Hello?

1469
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:24,798
Well...

1470
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,367
You're... you're where?

1471
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,270
[chuckles]

1472
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,705
This is a very nice surprise.

1473
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,335
What are you doing here?

1474
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,641
Well, it's just not fair

1475
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,149
that you have to keep
coming to New York all the time.

1476
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,719
- Oh.
- We'll have to do something about that.

1477
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,982
- Especially now.
- Why now?

1478
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,785
The fund's gonna need a name.

1479
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:53,355
Wait... We did it?

1480
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,690
Harcourt's only funding
a pilot program,

1481
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,766
but he rarely does this
unless he's absolutely...

1482
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,426
- Yes, we did it!
- Oh! We did it!

1483
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,299
Kate, l...
I just wanna say...

1484
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,772
- Wow!
- Uh, I also came up here

1485
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,604
to say...

1486
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,678
You and l...

1487
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,873
...we're a team,
a really great team.

1488
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,712
And, uh,
I've been thinking lately.

1489
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,812
Kate, none of this is me.

1490
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,117
Checking my emails
every ten seconds

1491
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,726
to see if there's
something from you.

1492
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:29,126
Wanting to tell you all the funny little
things I hear and see during the day.

1493
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:33,633
I know, given our... your
circumstances, this is crazy,

1494
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,761
but I had to tell you, because...

1495
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:42,566
...if there's any part of you
that feels the same...

1496
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,909
I told you my story,
keep it simple.

1497
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,383
However, you make
complicated look appealing.

1498
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,354
And l, for the first time
in a long time, feel ready to...

1499
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,188
I... Jack, I am so happy
you feel that way.

1500
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:04,460
And now you're gonna find someone
who will mean as much to you

1501
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,897
as Richard does to me.

1502
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,465
I have made a terrible
mess of things,

1503
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:15,043
and I hope I still have
a place with him,

1504
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,372
because that's where I belong.
And it's...

1505
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,145
It's snowing.

1506
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,013
Yeah.

1507
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,552
Oh, my God!
I have to go!

1508
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,555
I'm sorry, l... I'll call you later.
There's something...

1509
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,784
There's something
that I have to do.

1510
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,432
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you!

1511
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,370
I need to talk to him now.

1512
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,608
[woman] He's in a meeting,
dear, and I don't...

1513
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:56,877
...gentlemen, l...

1514
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,855
Hey, how are you?
Hey, Mitch, Jon.

1515
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,356
Yeah. Um, Clark?

1516
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:09,123
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that
I'm gonna go to Atlanta on Monday.

1517
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,563
- So... take care, then.
- No.

1518
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:13,963
No, you're going this weekend.

1519
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,127
Client's expecting you.

1520
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,467
Can we talk
about this in private?

1521
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,438
We can talk about it on Monday,

1522
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,443
when you come back from
your Atlanta trip this weekend.

1523
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:28,480
- OK. So, my view on...
- Yeah.

1524
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:32,075
See, the problem is that...

1525
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,314
...I'm...

1526
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,822
...unavailable.

1527
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,426
Because?

1528
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,729
Because...

1529
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:45,230
[sighs]...I have
to make a snowman.

1530
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,065
[Kate] Reasons it's OK if I don't work

1531
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,468
at Edwin Morgan Forster anymore:

1532
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:53,572
Number one:

1533
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,074
Because I have two lives,

1534
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,201
and I don't have time
to enjoy either one of them.

1535
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,610
- Merry Christmas!
- [Emily] It's snowing.

1536
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,215
Mommy's coming home early, right?

1537
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,442
No, honey. She's...

1538
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:05,917
- She's gotta work. We'll see her later.
- No, she is.

1539
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,885
- Taxi! Taxi!
- [horn honking]

1540
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,354
[Kate] Number two:

1541
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:12,255
Because trying to be a man
is a waste of a woman.

1542
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,418
She's coming.

1543
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,257
She said the next time it snows,

1544
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:16,989
we'll make a snowman together.

1545
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,965
She'll be there.
She promised. Twice.

1546
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:21,995
[Kate] Number three:

1547
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:26,073
Because my kids will be grown up
in a flash, and I will have missed it.

1548
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:29,871
Honey, Mommy loves you very much.
But she's gotta work, OK?

1549
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,412
Really? You sure?

1550
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,823
You wanna go play?

1551
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:46,985
Come on, Ben.

1552
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,494
[Kate] Number four:

1553
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,827
Because somehow, some way,

1554
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:55,562
someday, things have to change.

1555
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,767
Richard, l...

1556
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:01,300
I know things
have to be different.

1557
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:07,340
I know if I didn't have this job,
things would be better in so many ways.

1558
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:11,475
But... me without that job isn't me.

1559
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,155
And me without you and Ben and Emily

1560
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:19,056
is... it's nothing.

1561
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:24,223
So... I went in to see Clark today.

1562
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,927
Look, I've given everything
I have to this job.

1563
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,630
And I love it. I do.

1564
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:34,765
But I can't dump my family
at a moment's notice anymore.

1565
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,711
I won't do it. If what I have
to give is not enough for you...

1566
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,175
...then fire me.

1567
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,445
But I won't quit.

1568
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,419
I will not...

1569
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:52,192
I cannot give up.

1570
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,562
Then get out.

1571
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,231
You can go on Monday.

1572
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,332
Now... Ieave,

1573
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,967
before I reconsider.

1574
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,979
- Really?
- Leave.

1575
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:16,380
Thank you! Thank you!

1576
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,444
- [scoffs]
- Bunce.

1577
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,112
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1578
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,781
You land a major fund
with Jack Abelhammer,

1579
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,916
we'll talk about
relaxing your schedule, too.

1580
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,691
So from now on, if somebody's
gonna be disappointed,

1581
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:37,566
it's gonna be Clark or Jack or Bunce.

1582
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:41,164
And if that's not OK with my bosses,
then I will get a new job.

1583
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,176
You know, there will always
be another deal to be made.

1584
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,746
But there will only
be one first haircut.

1585
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,510
- OK.
- Also, from now on...

1586
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:52,381
- Yeah.
-...I will carry that store-bought pie

1587
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:55,684
and I will wave it around bravely.
Uh... that's right!

1588
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:58,156
I bought that freaking pie!
Yep!

1589
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,023
- What's wrong with her?
- Richard, Richard, look.

1590
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,563
I know I drive you crazy.

1591
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:07,099
But I love you...

1592
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,634
...an amazing amount.

1593
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,032
And I am so sorry about everything.

1594
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,612
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1595
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,908
'Cause I have something to say, too.

1596
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:24,109
Something to... read, actually.

1597
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,544
A list?

1598
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:33,251
Uh... yeah.

1599
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:36,364
"Change the carpet on the stairs."

1600
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,901
I did that. Oh, I got a leotard
for Emily's ballet recital.

1601
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,664
Ben's speech therapy
starts Thursday.

1602
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,869
It's all set.

1603
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:49,306
- I got an Ab Roller.
- [laughs]

1604
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:53,141
I'll never use it. But maybe just
looking at it will tone me up.

1605
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,812
"Me and Kate."

1606
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,443
Yeah.

1607
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,180
That's number one.

1608
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,481
Oh, Richard.

1609
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,523
It'll still be a mess, you know.

1610
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:11,257
I mean, that's the only thing
I'm sure of. It will still be a mess.

1611
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,424
Yeah, it will.
It'll be our mess. Right?

1612
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,901
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Let's go find them.

1613
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:26,275
- [children laughing]
- Where are they? Oh!

1614
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,882
Hey! Hi!

1615
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,951
Let's make a snowman!

1616
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:32,678
[Kate] In these circumstances,

1617
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,755
an ending that wrapped
things up neatly

1618
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,949
might be out of the question.

1619
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,787
Kate got her own fund.

1620
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:42,090
And we're all very happy for her.

1621
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:48,059
I think, of everyone, I'm the
least very happy for her.

1622
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:51,703
But I'm still very happy for her.

1623
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,470
- Oh, Momo, he is so beautiful.
- Yeah.

1624
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:01,980
It's all so...

1625
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,542
...hard to compute.

1626
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,288
The second they gave him to me,
it was just like...

1627
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,558
...just like...

1628
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,161
[sniffles] Why didn't
you tell me any of this?

1629
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,660
- It's rude not to share.
- [laughs]

1630
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,824
It's not funny.

1631
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:22,198
You know, we expand
into global funds,

1632
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,601
we could get our percentages up
two or three percent.

1633
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,639
God, you would sound so much
more compelling saying that

1634
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,868
if you didn't have mustard
on the side of your face.

1635
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,443
Ah...

1636
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,273
- Here? Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

1637
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,905
Are you 100 percent sure you don't
wanna run off to Aruba with me?

1638
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,278
- Yeah, 200 percent.
- Oh...

1639
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:38,613
But my friend Allison loves Aruba.

1640
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,688
She's smart, she's beautiful,
she's available.

1641
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:43,051
You would love her.

1642
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,421
Hey, how's it going getting that
meeting with Victor Chau?

1643
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,018
He'll be in New York on Saturday.
He said he can meet in the morning.

1644
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,997
Oh, I can't, I've got another
appointment on Saturday.

1645
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,795
[all] One, two, three!

1646
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:57,905
- [all shouting]
- [# Nat King Cole: "L-O-V-E"]

1647
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:01,065
# L is for the way you look at me

1648
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,277
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

1649
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,812
- Can I have that?
- Steps back, eyes the ball...

1650
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:09,781
Boom! I got back
from Berlin on Tuesday.

1651
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,910
Kate had to go straight
to San Francisco.

1652
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,385
I'm actually going
to New York next week.

1653
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,149
Man, that sounds like
a hectic schedule.

1654
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,815
It is.

1655
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:19,790
Listen, um,
I can't remember,

1656
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:21,657
what does...
what does Kate do again?

1657
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:25,095
Something complicated
with money, right?

1658
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,793
Oh, no, no. It's, uh,
pretty simple, actually.

1659
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,563
She's, uh...

1660
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,401
She's a juggler.

1661
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,877
# Please don't break it
Love

1662
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,473
# Was made for me and you

1663
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,032
- [computer beeps]
- [female voice] You've got an e-card.

1664
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,759
Oh!

1665
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:05,573
[man] Greetings
from Jack and Allison in Aruba.

1666
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,642
Dear Kate, she's a great girl.

1667
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:10,369
Thank you.

1668
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:13,072
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

1669
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:15,444
[laughs]

1670
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,517
- [computer dings]
- Maybe he's Irish,

1671
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,677
maybe he's Scottish,
but whatever is going on

1672
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,152
underneath that kilt,

1673
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:24,281
Iet me just say they don't call
him Abelhammer for nothing.

1674
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:27,020
[laughs]
