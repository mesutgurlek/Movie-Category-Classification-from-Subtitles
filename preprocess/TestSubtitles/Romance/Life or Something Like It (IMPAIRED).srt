"If I'd known this,

He worked for 5 years

You turn the camera on,
you point it at the news.

138

What is the big deal?

139
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,656
Lanie, would you do me
a favor just one time?

Do what I say.

141

Lanie: So I'll ask
a few questions.

142
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,818
Just relax,
and I'll be back in 5.

143
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,479
Ready? OK.

144
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,114
OK, I've got 2 kids
for interviews,

145
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,455
and the manager said we could
have 30 seconds of show footage.

Oh, hey, Pete.
How are you?

147
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,254
You know, it's really
good to see you again.

148
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:26,628
I've missed you.
You know, Lanie,

149
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,631
thanks a lot for asking.

150

It's nice to see you, too.

151
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,835
Under the circumstances,
I think it would be best

152
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:32,837
if we kept things on
a purely professional level.

153

Defiine "the circumstances."

154

We don't have to like it.

156

You know,
it wouldn't kill you,

157
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,078
to have some fun.

158
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:42,079
I have fun.

159
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,172
No, no, no.
You see, it's not fun

160
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,307
if you have to pencil it in.

161
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,715
Oh, I can't be spontaneous?
You don't know me.

Yes, well, I am the one
telling the story.

Have you ever heard
the expression,

a picture is worth
a thousand words?

He turned my piece

It was about a comedy club.

00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:07,811
I don't really believe
all this stuff,

330
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,116
but I'm up for
this really big job,

331
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,918
a job I've been dreaming
of my whole life,

332
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,324
and I was just wondering,
you know,

333
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,330
what do you--
what do you see?

334
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:20,956
Am I going to get it?

335
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:25,303
No.

336
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,430
All right, Lanie,
we got speed.

337
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:38,748
Tonight at 8:00,
the Seahawks and Broncos.

338
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:41,047
Who's going to win?
One man knows.

339
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,916
Let's see if he's telling.

340
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:46,515
Prophet Jack,
noted street savant,

341
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:47,888
and a little local flavor

342
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,450
in a town that could
use a little more.

343
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,690
Jack, what's with the crate?

344
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:56,200
I come from
a long line of prophets.

345
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,292
Anchorites.

346
00:14:57,369 --> 00:15:00,236
My pedestal elevates me closer

347
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,636
to the voice of God,

348
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:04,699
allowing me to heal
the huddled masses

349
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,937
with my visions.

350
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,412
Why is it always
the huddled masses?

351
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:10,971
Do we huddle?

352
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,710
Well, I'll tell you who does.

353
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,046
The Seattle Seahawks.

354
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,381
Nice segue.

355
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:17,354
Jack, tonight the Hawks
are on a special

356
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,287
Thursday-night edition
of football,

357
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:21,257
and they're playing
the 3-0 Broncos.

358
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:24,159
Tell us,Jack,
is it fiinally Denver's year,

359
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:25,560
or are the Hawks
going to open up

360
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,394
a big old can
of butt whupping?

361
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:33,131
The Seahawks will win, 19-13.

362
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,435
Yeah? Well, don't be
joking now,Jack.

363
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:37,873
You'll break our little hearts.

364
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:41,470
Prophets don't joke.

365
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:45,949
OK. Any other hot tips?

366
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:48,645
Tomorrow morning,
it's going to hail.

367
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,915
Well, the local
meteorologist said

368
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:52,388
we'll have more
blue skies tomorrow.

369
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,719
You-- You sure you don't want

370
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,657
to tweak that frequency
a little,Jack?

371
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:58,389
How old are you now?
Maybe you're not, you know,

372
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,296
hearing the old voice
of God so good anymore, hmm?

373
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:05,860
I hear it.
I hear it loud and clear.

374
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,371
OK, well,
you heard him, folks.

375
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,668
The Seahawks are going to win,

376
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,834
and tomorrow,
it's going to hail.

377
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,936
And next Thursday,
you're going to die.

378
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,810
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,913
I didn't ask for the power.

380
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,116
If I fiind out
you were up to this,

381
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:28,455
I will never speak
to you as long as I live.

382
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,430
Yeah, and that would be what?
About a week or so?

383
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:37,366
Tonight, Seahawks
over the Broncos by 6.

384
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:38,959
Take the points.

385
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,504
He said the Seahawks

386
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:43,541
were going to win, 19-13,

387
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,007
that tomorrow,
it's going to hail,

388
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:47,374
and next Thursday,
I'm going to die.

389
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,037
The Seahawks are going to win?

390
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,445
Andrea, focus.

391
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,642
- [Laughs]
- OK? Please.

392
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,514
Sweetie, the guy was crazy.

393
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:55,917
Don't worry about it.

394
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:58,353
I'm sure Pete put him
up to the whole thing.

395
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,687
Miss Kerrigan, Miss Fox.

396
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,693
Hi. We're just,
uh, here for drinks.

[Cheering]

398
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:09,627
Good to see you both again.

399
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:10,633
Thank you.

400
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:11,760
Enjoy your evening.

401
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,771
- Hi.
- Hi.

402
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,231
So what's the score?

403
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:18,367
Seahawks are up, 19-13.

404
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:20,104
19?

405
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:21,440
What is that?
What is that?

406
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:23,538
Is that 2 touchdowns,
a fiield goal, and a safety?

407
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,173
3 touchdowns,
2 missed extra points.

408
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,581
Huh.

409
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,119
TV Announcer:
Huge one here. Third and 13.

410
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,155
Second Announcer:
Broncos just haven't been able

411
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,691
to step up and make
that crucial play.

412
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,157

[Crowd Yelling]

414
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,256
Announcer:
Touchdown!

415
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,526
Yes!

416
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,931
Yes! Oh!

417
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,593
Ha ha ha ha ha!

418
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:45,601
Whoo!

419
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,602
Man:
We just lost.

420
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,696
I know, but it was
such a good pass.

421
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,240
Wait, wait,
they're contesting it.

422
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,435
Announcer:
We have a challenge to that last play

423
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,501
when McCaffrey caught
the ball on the sideline.

424
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,046
We saw the replay already,

425
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:57,206
and the call on the fiield
was for a catch, so--

426
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:58,374
What happened?

427
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,382
I think the receiver

428
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:00,713
might have stepped
out of bounds.

429
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,446
Announcer: ...really good
visual evidence to overturn it.

430
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,488
Referee:
Upon further review of the play,

431
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,854
the Denver receiver
stepped out of bounds.

[Inhales]

439
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,814
You hear something weird.

440
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:15,951
Like what?

441
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,119
Like something that might give me

442
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:18,662
a heart attack by next Thursday.

443
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,595
Lanie, you eat nothing but lettuce.

444
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,893
You'll die of starvation

445
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,297
before you die
of a heart attack.

446
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,165
Maybe it's high blood pressure,

447
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:26,794
or something more serious.

448
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,532
Do you get headaches?

449
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:29,732
No.

450
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:30,796
Vision problems?

451
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,069
No.

452
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:36,475
Maybe I should get an M.R.I.?

453
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,846
Lanie, your blood
pressure's fiine,

00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,111
your lungs are clear,

455
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:41,777
no lumps in your breasts.

456
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:44,754
You may be the single
healthiest person in Seattle.

457
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:46,517
Yeah.

- No.

- Did you do it?
- No.

Pete.

461
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,720
Lanie, I didn't do it,
all right?

462
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,778
Honestly,

463
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:20,414
I don't put that much
thought into you.

464
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:21,515
Oh, well, I wouldn't want you

465
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:22,753
to put too much thought
into anything, Pete.

466
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:24,454
You might hurt yourself.

467
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,996
Look, I can understand

468
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,361
why you might be
upset about this.

469
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:29,559
If I found out I had
a week left to live

470
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:32,194
and realized that
my entire life was

471
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,068
a meaningless quest for
the approval of others,

472
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,265
I'd be upset, too.

473
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,933
My life is not meaningless.

474
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,477
Unlike yours,
a hedonistic free-for-all,

475
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:41,944
an empty succession

476
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:44,777
of banal sexual,
physical encounters...

477
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:45,781
whatever you call it.

478
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,839
There's nothing banal about any--

479
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,510
Yeah? Well, that's not
whatAndrea said.

480
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:52,352
Why don't you 2 just
get a room already?

481
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,954
Well, speaking of meaningless,

482
00:20:57,028 --> 00:20:58,120
what are we doing here again?

483
00:20:58,196 --> 00:20:59,720
Lanie and Vin: Pumpkins.

484
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:01,128
Pumpkins shaped
like famous people.

485
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,131
Is that their heads,

486
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,462
or does that include
the entire body?

487
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:04,523
Is that funny?

488
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:07,002
It's supposed to be.
An attempt at humor.

489
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,003
If you owned a dictionary,

490
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:09,232
you would look that
word up under"H."

491
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,865
You know, Pete, if you had
less than a week to live,

492
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,002
I don't think
you'd be so funny, OK?

493
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,672
Lanie, he's a homeless guy, OK?

494
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:18,716
He lives in a cardboard box

495
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,478
in an alley on
Fourth and Sanders.

496
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,519
All right?
He's just some crazy nut

497
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:24,054
who had a bad case
of logorrhea.

498
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,612
Defiine logorrhea.

499
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,590
Logorrhea,
it's diarrhea of the mouth.

500
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,149
You know, he goes on
and on about things.

501
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:30,922
Usually,
it's sports and weather,

502
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,257
and sometimes he's right,

503
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,524
and sometimes he's wrong.

504
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:35,589
When it comes to matters
of life and death,

505
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,998
it's a little
out of his league.

506
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,899
Really?

507
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,461
Yeah, really.

508
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:09,623
Hi, Daddy.
Happy birthday.

509
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,293
Hi, dear.
Thank you.

510
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:15,405
It's made by Bose.

511
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,873
It's the best
sound quality in the world.

512
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:19,500
Thank you, Gwen.

513
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,943
Did, uh, you bring a gift, Pudge?

514
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:26,073
Yes, I did.

515
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:29,478
Of course I did.

516
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,456
Mariners season tickets. Wow.

517
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:35,890
Yeah, just like last year.

518
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,393
Why did you say

519
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:38,986
the kids couldn't come again?

520
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:41,293
Well, Conrad's soccer team

521
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,630
is playing in the division
championship tomorrow,

522
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:45,669
and of course,
Chloe has rehearsal--

523
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:48,001
international
children's orchestra.

524
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,870
I'm up for a job at<i>A.M.</i> U<i>SA.</i>

525
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,869
- Oh, really.
- Yeah.

526
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:56,345
Is that still on?

527
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:59,780
Yes.

528
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:03,643
Well, Lanie, the man
has worked the 5 a.m. shift

529
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,586
at the plant for 25 years.

530
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:08,386
I guess you could
give him a break, huh?

531
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:22,697
How's Cal?

532
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:26,301
He's fiine.
He's in New York.

533
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:31,238
In the off-season?

534
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:32,839
He's doing a commercial.

535
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:38,378
I like Cal.
He's a good kid.

536
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,720
I think the Ms
are going to have

537
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,454
a good year next year.

538
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:44,790
Dad, can I ask you a question?

539
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,124
Sure.

540
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:48,859
Gwen:
More cake, Dad?

541
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,764
Just like Mom used to make.

542
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,132
Maybe Lanie wants it.

543
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,068
No, I have to go, actually.

544
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:56,333
Oh--
Have some cake.

545
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,967
Dad, don't tempt her.

546
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,010
Happy birthday, Dad.

547
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,203

Is something wrong?

Uh, no, nothing's wrong.

Well, then why
are you calling me?

I don't really feel like

I know, Cal.
I just, um--

559
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,134
Listen, I've had a...

560
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,472
bizarre little evening,

561
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,409

I just want
to ask you something.

00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:14,882
what would you do
if you found out

565
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:17,048
I was going to die in,
like, a week?

566
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,357
Hello?

567
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,794
Are you on your period?

568
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:25,422
No, I'm not on my period.

569
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:27,433
I met a homeless guy,
and he had a vision.

570
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,969
Yeah, like ESPN?

571
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:35,373
No, he had ESP.
There's no "N," honey.

572
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:38,070
I know that, Lanie,
but you know what?

573
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,204
It's late, sweetie,
and I got to get up early.

574
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,613
And there's no such thing as ESP.

575
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:43,945
Yeah, I'm sorry.

You're right.

OK.

626
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,509
So, the truth is,

627

you really have no idea.

628
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,138
I mean, at all, right?

629
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:28,909
Like, you could be,
like, a .250 hitter,

00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,314
and, you know, you don't
want anybody to know that

631
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:32,317
because then they
wouldn't put money

I see and I say.

640
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:54,740
Now, if you could
prove me wrong,

641
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:57,333
if you could prove
that I'm wrong,

even one time...

then, great, I'm--
I'm not a prophet.

I'm a normal guy

who has a hunch
once in a while,

646
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,153
and I can go and fiind
a nice cozy bed

647
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,816
and live my life in peace.

648
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,416
OK, it's-- it's a deal.

649
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:14,586
I will prove you wrong,

650
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:18,153
and you will take away
the death sentence thing.

651
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:19,221
You're back to bargaining.

652
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,028
Mm-hmm, come.
Give me another prediction.

653

That's what I'm talkin' about.

986
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,227
All right, here we go.

987
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,161
All right, honey,
lay it on me.

988
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,926
There it is,
lay it on me.

989
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,365
What is it?

990
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,334
What?

991
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:20,928
It's some kind of metaphor, right?

992
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,769
You want us to step up
to the plate

993
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:23,933
or come out swinging or--

994
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,033
Actually, I was just thinking

995
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,202
when I start talkin' nonsense,

996
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,244
it helps if I just come out here

997
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:28,836
and pound the shit
out of the ball.

998
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:32,179
You know?
15, 20 minutes of this,

999
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,342
and you kinda forget
what you were worried about

1000
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:34,578
in the fiirst place.

1001
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,553
Your cure for my emotional crisis

1002
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,217
is batting practice?

1003
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,284
Is that right?

1004
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,506
What do you--
What-What is this?

1005
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:00,674
Is this you breaking up with me?

1006
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,015
# Another question #

1007
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,778
# Hangs in midair #

1008
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:11,947
'Cause, you know, they're pretty
much lined up behind you, Lanie.

1009
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:15,893
You might wanna take a minute
and reconsider.

1010
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,123
# There's an answer #

1011

#I know it's out there #

1012

a really long time to waste.

# That I may have missed #

1015
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,111
#I hope the answer #

1016
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,741
#Is as simple as this #

Look, I just spoke to
her on her cell phone.

- She said she'd be here.
- When, next Friday?

Hey, come on.
She said she was on her way.

every morning.

Andrea out to you.

Hey, come on, Dennis,
why don't you just give her

1040
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,403

Aw, jeez.

1044
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,544
Any sign of her?

Oh, no, <i>nada.</i>

1046

All right, well,
Dennis wants a live feed.

decides to show up.

Yeah.

Go on.
No pride, no ride!

Yeah, yeah.
Everything all right, there?

Everything's great.

1057

I got stuck in traffiic
way back there,

00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,371
and I thought I'd walk.

Where's your--
Where's your car now?

1060
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,301
I left my car.
I have a story to do.

1061
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:15,607
Hi, Vin. Wire me.

Vin, do not give her
that microphone.

Vin? I love you, Vin.

1064
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,482
I've never been able
to say that before

1065
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,610
because I was frightened.

1066
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,017
You know, Lanie,
that's really sweet,

1067

but, Lanie, are you sure
that you wanna go on air?

1068
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,547
I mean, did you have
a couple of drinks

1069
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,148
or something? Or--

1070

No, I'm not drunk.
I'm free.

That's good. That's good.
But you know what?

00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,447
We should get out of this.

1145
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,881
Not yet.

1146
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:10,580
#Can't be a man
'cause he doesn't smoke #

00:54:24,665 --> 00:54:26,599
Ow.

[Footsteps]

1174
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:37,510
Morning, Mick.

1175
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,275
A little hair of the dog for ya?

1176
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:45,319
[Sighs]

1177
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:47,547
Just point to the one
you were drinkin'.

1178
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:54,494
All right.

1179
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:57,156
I knew you were
a rum and Coke girl.

1180
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:03,562
You drink a little
bit of this down...

1181
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:05,799
you're gonna be
feelin' much better.

1182
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:15,143
No. No. Come on.

1183
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:16,877
A little bit more than that.

1184
00:55:22,456 --> 00:55:24,219
- Good girl.
- [Coughs]

1185
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:36,301
Oh, God. Did we--

1186
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,359
No.

1187
00:55:37,438 --> 00:55:39,201
[Laughs]

1188
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:41,901
Well, don't sound so excited, OK?

1189
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:44,035
You passed out in my car.

1190
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:45,840
Sorry.

1191
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:51,815
What-What happened?

1192
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:52,818
You don't remember any of it?

1193
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:54,411
- No.
- You don't remember

1194
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:55,420
talkin' to me on the cell phone?

1195
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:56,979
The bus drivers' strike?

1196
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:58,491
No.

1197
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,049
The live spot?

1198
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:02,721
Are you telling me
I went on the air?

1199
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:04,628
You went on the air.

1200
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,424
Without my makeup?

1201
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:11,096
Without your makeup,
without your lines...

1202
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:12,571
without your sanity.

1203
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,566
Oh... wow.

1204
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:20,305
Oh.

1205
00:56:23,284 --> 00:56:24,410
I don't know, Lanie.

1206
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:26,112
Seriously, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1207
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:29,384
You do not--
You do not wanna watch it.

1208
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:36,658
Oh, boy.
It's important to note

1209
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:38,665
that it can be very diffiicult
to be a reporter,

1210
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:39,700
and we're not here

1211
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:40,893
to make fun
of our brethren, but--

1212
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:42,833
But she is from a rival station.

1213
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:45,133
So, uh, let's see it again.

1214
00:56:45,206 --> 00:56:48,573
# When I'm watching my TV #

1215
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:51,941
# And a man comes on to tell me #

1216
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:53,275
# How white #

1217
00:56:53,347 --> 00:56:54,644
Woman:
Just how involved

1218
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,478
should reporters
get with their subjects?

1219
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,381
No.

1220
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:01,387
A local reporter
caused a huge traffiic jam

1221
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:03,013
when she turned a live report

1222
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,456
into an impromptu rock concert.

1223
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:08,723
#I can't get no #

1224
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:11,162
# No, no, no #

1225
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:14,967
# Hey, hey, hey #

1226
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:17,027
# That's what I say #

1227
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:19,504
I'm Lanie Kerrigan,
and that's [Bleep] life--

1228
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:23,208
Perfect.

1229
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:27,606
My life is over.

1230
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:30,978
I'm--

1231
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:34,021
I'm offiicially dead.

1232
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:37,319
I offiicially just--
just stopped breathing. I'm dead.

1233
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,891
Defiine life.

1234
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:48,558
My career.
My network job.

1235
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:51,434
My wedding.

1236
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:52,494
OK?

1237
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:53,562
Do you really think

1238
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,108
if you have no job
and no boyfriend,

1239
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:56,734
then your life is over?

1240
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,341
Will you shut up?

1241
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:01,210
My head is pounding,

1242
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:03,614
I haven't had a shower
since Saturday,

1243
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:06,050
and I have ringing in my ears.

1244
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,145
Ringing?

1245
00:58:08,222 --> 00:58:09,883
Yeah, well,
that's called a phone.

1246
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:11,185
I'll take care of that.

1247
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:14,860
Hello.

1248
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:17,022
Hey, Dennis.
How ya doin'?

1249
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:19,430
Yeah, no problem.

1250
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,627
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1251
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:23,892
No, Lanie?

1252
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:26,997
No. I mean, you know,
I saw her yesterday.

1253
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:30,269
Well, it's 7:15.

1254
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:32,943
All right.
Well, if I hear from her,

1255
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:34,605
I will give you a call. OK.

1256
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,917
Thank you.

1257
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:43,549
You're welcome.

1258
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:52,529
So...

1259
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,761
you want me to take you home?

1260
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,462
No.

1261
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:00,797
Wanna go try and
look for your car, maybe?

1262
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:03,343
[Laughs]
Oh, God. No.

1263
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,002
Well, look, you know what?

1264
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,637
What do you say
I take you to the airport,

1265
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:07,874
you can go off to Morocco

1266
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:09,575
with your last couple
of days here on Earth?

1267
00:59:15,756 --> 00:59:18,919
If it's OK with you,
I'd like to stay...

1268
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:20,927
here for a little while.

1269
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,725
All right.

1270
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,528
But you gotta
take a shower fiirst.

1271
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:51,158
Ooh.

1272
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:56,362
#Steam slowly builds #

1273
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,660
# Up now #

1274
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:04,530
# Between my ears #

1275
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:07,540
# There is fog now #

1276
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:11,276
# The soothing sounds #

1277
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:13,279
- Here ya go.
- Quid.

1278
01:00:13,347 --> 01:00:14,939
Quid. Yeah.

1279
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:16,448
What is that?

1280
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:18,007
What is quid?
It's money. Currency.

1281
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,017
In what language?

1282
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:21,646
In English.
As in England?

1283
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:22,654
Uh-huh.

1284
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:23,781
You know how in the U.S.,

1285
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,484
you would say, uh,
"I got a few bucks."

1286
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,186
Well, in England,
you would say,

1287
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,228
"I got a few quid."

1288
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:29,853
So it's slang.

1289
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,898
No. It's quid.

1290
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:33,866
It's slang.

1291
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:36,198
The queen does not use slang.

1292
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:39,603
You cannot use slang
in word games.

1293
01:00:39,673 --> 01:00:40,935
It was not slang.

1294
01:00:41,008 --> 01:00:43,602
You would let me use
"buck," wouldn't ya?

1295
01:00:43,677 --> 01:00:46,840
Defiine buck.
Buck as in male deer?

1296
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:50,315
Yeah.
Or buck as in buck off,

1297
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:52,852
or, I'm having such
a bucking good time

1298
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,852
shopping with you.

1299
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:54,945
You're telling me

1300
01:00:55,022 --> 01:00:56,114
that even though it's Tuesday,

1301
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,589
a day when normal people
have to work

1302
01:00:57,658 --> 01:00:58,750
or have appointments,

1303
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:00,020
you have absolutely

1304
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:01,994
no obligation whatsoever?

1305
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:04,428
No. Sometimes, you know,
I'll actually work.

1306
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:05,795
Oh, but only if you want to.

1307
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:07,333
Yeah. Yeah.

1308
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:08,834
And, uh, and what if

1309
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:09,869
Dennis called and said

1310
01:01:09,937 --> 01:01:11,029
you have to come
to work today

1311
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:12,299
or you'll be fiired?

1312
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:14,273
Well, then I would
probably get fiired.

1313
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,899
Just like that?

1314
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah, well, you know, Lanie,

1315
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,305
I know this is hard
for you to imagine,

1316
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:19,539
but there are some things that are

1317
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,912
a little bit more
important than work.

1318
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,848
Like what?

1319
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:27,648
Well, like today,
for example...

1320
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,450
I gotta go pick up my kid.

1321
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,692
Really?

1322
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:36,730
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
I have a son.

1323
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:38,832
Uh, you said you didn't

1324
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:40,423
have any obligations.

1325
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:44,938
You know, I don't really
look at him like an obligation.

1326
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:53,179
There he is.
Hey, Tommy.

1327
01:01:53,253 --> 01:01:54,242
Hey, Dad.

1328
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:55,481
How's it goin'?

1329
01:01:55,556 --> 01:01:56,488
Uh, pretty good.

1330
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:57,489
Good. Good.

1331
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:58,786
I got a little surprise
for you today.

1332
01:01:58,859 --> 01:01:59,826
- OK.
- All right.

1333
01:01:59,893 --> 01:02:01,724
I want you to meet someone
I work with.

1334
01:02:01,795 --> 01:02:03,660
This is Lanie.

1335
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:04,662
This is my boy Tommy.

1336
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:05,663
- Hi.
- Hi.

1337
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:07,495
It's nice to meet you, Lanie.

1338
01:02:07,568 --> 01:02:08,500
Nice to meet you.

1339
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:11,265
Well, Dad, is she coming with us?

1340
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:13,704
Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna
spend the day with us,

1341
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:16,402
see if she can
hang with the guys.

1342
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:17,670
What do you think?

1343
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:21,374
All right. Well, come on.
Let's get goin'.

1344
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:25,948
Pete:
Come on.

1345
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,189
Do you like kids?

1346
01:02:31,258 --> 01:02:32,850
Hey, come on, Tommy.

1347
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:35,622
What? I mean, what if her
and Cal Cooper

1348
01:02:35,696 --> 01:02:38,597
have kids someday
when they get married?

1349
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,929
Cal and I broke up.

1350
01:02:41,001 --> 01:02:43,162
You broke up with Cal Cooper?

1351
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:45,500
That's horrible, isn't it?

1352
01:02:45,572 --> 01:02:47,938
Can you still get good seats
for the Mariner games?

1353
01:02:48,008 --> 01:02:49,236
Probably.

1354
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:50,936
Well, look, you know,
Lanie's on TV.

1355
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:52,706
I'm sure if she can't
get 'em through Cal--

1356
01:02:52,779 --> 01:02:55,043
Yeah. Yeah. I know--
the <i>Seattle Life</i> lady.

1357
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:58,941
You should have sung

1358
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:02,477
<i>I Did ItAll For The Nookie,</i>
by Limp Bizkit.

1359
01:03:02,556 --> 01:03:03,488
Yeah?

1360
01:03:03,557 --> 01:03:05,218
I don't think
I know that one.

1361
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:06,224
- What?
- [Laughs]

1362
01:03:06,293 --> 01:03:06,918
Yeah, how do you know that?

1363
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,258
#It just takes some time #

1364
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:11,957
# Little girl,
you're in the middle of the ride #

1365
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:15,001
# Everything, everything
will be just fiine #

1366
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:17,901
# Everything, everything
will be all right #

1367
01:03:17,971 --> 01:03:20,098
# All right, all right #

1368
01:03:22,109 --> 01:03:24,100
#It just takes some time #

1369
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:26,839
# Little girl,
you're in the middle of the ride #

1370
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:30,144
# Everything, everything
will be just fiine #

1371
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:32,845
# Everything, everything
will be all right #

1372
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:34,181
# All right #

1373
01:03:34,254 --> 01:03:36,017
#It just takes some time #

1374
01:03:36,089 --> 01:03:38,922
# Little girl,
you're in the middle of the ride #

1375
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:41,961
# Everything, everything
will be just fiine #

1376
01:03:42,029 --> 01:03:44,623
# Everything, everything
will be all right #

1377
01:03:44,698 --> 01:03:46,427
# All right #

1378
01:03:55,509 --> 01:03:56,771
All right, little guy.

1379
01:03:56,843 --> 01:03:58,868
Hey, Tommy.

1380
01:03:58,945 --> 01:03:59,877
Hmm?

1381
01:03:59,946 --> 01:04:00,878
We're home.

1382
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:01,879
Mmm. Thanks, Dad.

1383
01:04:01,948 --> 01:04:03,210
You ready to go?

1384
01:04:03,283 --> 01:04:04,682
Oh, it was nice
to meet you, Lanie.

1385
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:05,911
It was nice to meet you.

1386
01:04:05,986 --> 01:04:06,918
You got your bag?

1387
01:04:06,987 --> 01:04:09,615
Yeah.

1388
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,920
I can't believe that you
broke up with Cal Cooper

1389
01:04:11,992 --> 01:04:13,323
just to go out with my dad.

1390
01:04:13,393 --> 01:04:16,294
Oh, no, Tommy.
Your dad and I aren't--

1391
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:19,491
aren't, you know.

1392
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:21,659
Yeah, Tommy.
Look, we, uh, Lanie and I

1393
01:04:21,735 --> 01:04:23,726
are just, you know,
we're just friends.

1394
01:04:23,804 --> 01:04:24,736
We just work together.

1395
01:04:24,805 --> 01:04:27,535
Then why is she wearing
your clothes?

1396
01:04:28,642 --> 01:04:30,906
Um...you know what?

1397
01:04:30,977 --> 01:04:32,945
l, uh--
I'll explain that to you

1398
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:35,208
a little later on, OK?

1399
01:04:35,282 --> 01:04:36,476
All right.

1400
01:05:01,608 --> 01:05:04,338
I swear, that's always
the hardest part.

1401
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:05,935
Is that his mom?

1402
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:07,639
Yeah.

1403
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:11,208
Yeah, we grew up together.

1404
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:13,616
You know,
back in New York.

1405
01:05:13,687 --> 01:05:15,678
Catholic school, when...

1406
01:05:15,756 --> 01:05:16,950
well, if you got a girl pregnant,

1407
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:19,719
you basically have 2 choices.

1408
01:05:19,793 --> 01:05:21,727
You can either marry her or...

1409
01:05:21,795 --> 01:05:23,695
marry her.

1410
01:05:23,764 --> 01:05:26,232
So--

1411
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:27,630
But then we split up,

1412
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:30,033
and she moved out here

1413
01:05:30,103 --> 01:05:32,537
and took Tommy with her.

1414
01:05:32,606 --> 01:05:34,233
You know, I had to follow, too.

1415
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:35,239
I just--
I couldn't bear to be

1416
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:37,435
that far away from him.

1417
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:38,739
And I don't know what's worse,

1418
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:39,744
you know?

1419
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:41,906
Getting divorced or...

1420
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:44,348
the two of us trying to
stay together for him.

1421
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:49,755
Well, I think
he's just really lucky

1422
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,688
to have 2 parents that love him.

1423
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:54,790
Yeah.

1424
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,466
You're not thinking about
Prophet Jack, are you?

1425
01:06:02,536 --> 01:06:04,299
No.

1426
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:06,839
No, I haven't
thought about that all day.

1427
01:06:06,907 --> 01:06:09,637
- Thanks to you.
- Oh.

1428
01:06:09,709 --> 01:06:11,870
Um--

1429
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:14,413
So, you got to admit,
it feels pretty good, doesn't it?

1430
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:15,812
What?

1431
01:06:15,882 --> 01:06:17,747
Doin' nothin'.

1432
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:22,946
[Sighs]
Yeah, it does.

1433
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:29,818
So, what do you normally do
on a Tuesday night?

1434
01:06:29,896 --> 01:06:31,659
Let's see. Normally,

1435
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:36,191
if I was with
a beautiful woman

1436
01:06:36,269 --> 01:06:39,102
such as yourself,
I would maybe, um--

1437
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:44,776
maybe ask her to come
back to my place.

1438
01:06:44,845 --> 01:06:46,813
Mm-hmm.

1439
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,869
And if she was wearing
all my clothes,

1440
01:06:47,948 --> 01:06:50,508
then I would insist
that she return them.

1441
01:06:53,687 --> 01:06:57,453
Um, are you trying
to have sex with me?

1442
01:06:57,524 --> 01:06:59,856
Yeah.

1443
01:06:59,926 --> 01:07:01,223
Yeah, I defiinitely am.

1444
01:07:01,294 --> 01:07:02,420
Good.

1445
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:16,733
# Love, be still #

1446
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:20,746
# Love, be sweet #

1447
01:07:20,814 --> 01:07:25,842
# Don't you dare #

1448
01:07:25,919 --> 01:07:30,253
#Change a thing #

1449
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:36,523
#I want to photograph you
with my mind #

1450
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:46,697
# To feel how I feel now
all the time #

1451
01:07:48,909 --> 01:07:52,208
#Say that you'll stay #

1452
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:56,648
# Forever this way #

1453
01:07:57,851 --> 01:08:01,412
# Forever and forever #

1454
01:08:01,488 --> 01:08:06,892
# That we'll never have to change #

1455
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,121
# Don't move,
don't breathe #

1456
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:11,425
# Don't change,
don't leave #

1457
01:08:11,498 --> 01:08:13,625
# And promise me #

1458
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:18,569
#Say you'll stay #

1459
01:08:18,638 --> 01:08:24,304
#Oh, we'll stay #

1460
01:08:24,377 --> 01:08:30,009
# This way #

1461
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,108
# Promise me #

1462
01:08:32,185 --> 01:08:33,618
# We'll always be #

1463
01:08:33,687 --> 01:08:36,713
# This way #

1464
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,724
#It's good to me #

1465
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:41,124
# Promise me #

1466
01:08:41,194 --> 01:08:42,889
# We'll always be #

1467
01:08:42,963 --> 01:08:45,796
# This way #

1468
01:08:45,865 --> 01:08:48,129
#It's good to me #

1469
01:08:51,805 --> 01:08:54,137
- So, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

1470
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:56,300
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1471
01:08:56,376 --> 01:08:58,310
What, you didn't have
a good time last night?

1472
01:08:58,378 --> 01:08:59,936
[Laughs]

1473
01:09:00,013 --> 01:09:00,945
'Cause I'm thinkin'

1474
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:02,948
maybe you should
meet me at 11:06

1475
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:04,711
in the equipment room
for a little quickie.

1476
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:09,684
Oh. But I might
be history by 11:06.

1477
01:09:09,756 --> 01:09:12,122
Well, then we don't have
to settle for a quickie.

1478
01:09:21,234 --> 01:09:22,394
I better go.

1479
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:24,937
I have a 9:00 appointment
to get fiired.

1480
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:27,166
Well, good.
That'll give us more time.

1481
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:36,615
All:
Surprise!

1482
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:38,119
Lanie, you got it!

1483
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:40,747
What?

1484
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:43,451
That stunt you pulled
on Monday was brilliant.

1485
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:45,391
Your face was on every news program

1486
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:46,894
in the country.
Lanie, you're famous.

1487
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:47,987
They want you in New York

1488
01:09:48,064 --> 01:09:48,996
for <i>A.M.</i> U<i>SA</i> tomorrow morning.

1489
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:51,431
You're gonna do
a live interview spot.

1490
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,559
Are we talking about--

1491
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:53,863
You got the network.
You did it.

1492
01:09:53,936 --> 01:09:55,369
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

1493
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:57,963
[Everyone Cheers]

1494
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:59,474
Oh, my God!

1495
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:01,237
Somebody get this girl a drink!

1496
01:10:02,445 --> 01:10:03,537
Pour! Pour! Pour!

1497
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:07,379
- [Everyone Cheers]
- Whoo!

1498
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,815
Here's looking at you, kid!

1499
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:10,216
To Lanie!

1500
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:42,050
- It's 11:06.
- Hmm.

1501
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:44,018
I forgot about that.

1502
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:49,353
Are you being weird?

1503
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:51,222
Defiine weird.

1504
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:55,159
- I got the job.
- I heard.

1505
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,496
Yeah.
[Laughs]

1506
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:00,661
So Prophet Jack was wrong.

1507
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:03,637
That was the fiirst thing
I asked him.

1508
01:11:03,706 --> 01:11:04,968
So that means what?

1509
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,133
So that means
that he's crazy,

1510
01:11:06,209 --> 01:11:08,803
that I'm not gonna die,
that I'm gonna live...

1511
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:12,314
in New York.

1512
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:13,939
When do they want you to leave?

1513
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:16,382
In a few hours.
They're picking me up.

1514
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:18,943
They want me to be
on the show tomorrow morning.

1515
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:23,090
And guess who they want me
to interview.

1516
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:25,855
I haven't a clue. Who?

1517
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:28,726
Deborah Connors.

1518
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:33,661
A live interview
with me and Deborah Connors.

1519
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:35,328
That's great.

1520
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,864
Well, congratulations.

1521
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,239
I'm sure you're
gonna do a great job.

1522
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,015
I want you to go with me.

1523
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,649
I don't wanna go back
to New York, Lanie.

1524
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:59,058
Because of your son?

1525
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:02,293
Yeah.
Yeah, because of him,

1526
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:03,525
and because I like it here.

1527
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:06,796
You know, I like my life.

1528
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:08,598
I'm not like you.

1529
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:11,403
I just think nothing ever

1530
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:13,635
satisfiies your appetite for long.

1531
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:16,968
Is that what you think of me?

1532
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:20,377
That's what I think.

1533
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:26,912
Would you be saying that

1534
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:29,116
if you thought I was
gonna die tomorrow?

1535
01:12:29,192 --> 01:12:31,319
I never thought
you were gonna die.

1536
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:35,664
I think you did.
I think you did.

1537
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:36,857
I think somewhere inside,

1538
01:12:36,933 --> 01:12:38,423
that's why you let me in.

1539
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:41,231
That's why you introduced me
to your son.

1540
01:12:41,304 --> 01:12:43,829
It's why you spent
the night with me.

1541
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,237
You thought you'd never

1542
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:46,775
have to follow through.

1543
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:48,400
I think that's what happened.

1544
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:50,411
That's not it at all.

1545
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:51,946
You know why I did
all those things?

1546
01:12:52,014 --> 01:12:56,280
Because on Monday, out
at the strike, I fiinally saw you.

1547
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,983
No. The real Lanie.
The real you.

1548
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:02,217
And that's who I want,
and that's who I still want.

1549
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:05,917
That's who I introduced to my son.

1550
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:11,230
This is everything
I've ever dreamed of.

1551
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:15,369
Well, then, I guess

1552
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:16,735
there's nothing
left to say, is there?

1553
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:23,106
You're gonna go to New York,
and I'm staying here.

1554
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:36,386
# Nowhere in the corridors
of pale green and gray #

1555
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,723
# Nowhere in the suburbs #

1556
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:41,729
#In the cold light of day #

1557
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:46,427
# There in the midst of it,
so alive and alone #

1558
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:51,201
# Words support like bone #

1559
01:13:51,274 --> 01:13:54,641
# Dreaming of Mercy Street #

1560
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:57,144
I got the job, <i>A.M.</i> U<i>SA.</i>

1561
01:13:57,213 --> 01:13:58,805
I'm going to New York.

1562
01:13:58,881 --> 01:14:00,610
When are you coming back?

1563
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:02,844
Oh, come on, Dad.

1564
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:05,079
It's not like
you're gonna miss me.

1565
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:06,587
You have Gwen.

1566
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:08,351
What's that supposed to mean?

1567
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:10,892
It's not supposed
to mean anything.

1568
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,689
It means that...

1569
01:14:12,762 --> 01:14:14,821
you've always
kind of favored Gwen.

1570
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:16,159
What kind of crap is that?

1571
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:17,961
I favored Gwen?

1572
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:20,525
I love both my girls
just the same.

1573
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:22,866
I know.

1574
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,734
Why don't you go over

1575
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:28,834
and open that top drawer
of that cabinet.

1576
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:33,479
What is this?

1577
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:35,380
It's you.

1578
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,015
I tape all your stuff.

1579
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:41,318
See that red one on the end?

1580
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:44,018
That's my favorite one.

1581
01:14:58,007 --> 01:14:59,599
#lf I should call you up #

1582
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:00,699
#Invest a dime #

1583
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,869
# And you say you belong to me #

1584
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:04,344
- Oh, God.
- [Laughs]

1585
01:15:04,413 --> 01:15:06,813
#Imagine how the world would be #

1586
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:08,076
#So very fiine #

1587
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:11,779
#So happy together #

1588
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:16,484
#I can't see me
loving nobody but you #

1589
01:15:16,559 --> 01:15:19,392
# For all my life #

1590
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:22,329
# La la la, la la la la #

1591
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:30,065
Pat, turn it off.

1592
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:37,835
I know I haven't always

1593
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:39,938
been there for you, Lanie.

1594
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:43,815
I've never really understood you.

1595
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:46,787
Couldn't fiind a way
to talk to you.

1596
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,188
But your mother could.

1597
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:54,926
You were the only person

1598
01:15:54,997 --> 01:15:57,056
that could make her smile.

1599
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:11,779
Will you watch me tomorrow?

1600
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:13,371
Yeah.

1601
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,316
I'm gonna call in sick
as soon as you leave.

1602
01:16:23,836 --> 01:16:27,636
An angel will fall
from the sky!

1603
01:16:29,241 --> 01:16:33,803
An angel will fall
from the sky!

1604
01:16:33,879 --> 01:16:35,904
You are so full of shit.

1605
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:37,005
Don't give him any money, pal.

1606
01:16:37,082 --> 01:16:38,140
He's a phony.

1607
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:39,741
An angel will fall from the sky.

1608
01:16:39,818 --> 01:16:42,252
Bullshit.
You said that a week ago.

1609
01:16:42,321 --> 01:16:43,845
I need to explain
something to you.

1610
01:16:43,922 --> 01:16:45,685
I am not a therapist.

1611
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:47,782
I do a volume business here.

1612
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,827
You and your girlfriend
can't fiigure it out--

1613
01:16:48,894 --> 01:16:50,794
She is not my girlfriend.

1614
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:51,795
Not my problem.

1615
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:53,422
Did she say that?
Did she say

1616
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:54,488
that she was my girlfriend?

1617
01:16:54,566 --> 01:16:58,662
I see and I say and you pay.

1618
01:16:58,737 --> 01:17:00,500
We do not develop a relationship.

1619
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:01,971
Yeah, but you see,
you're full of shit.

1620
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,235
OK? Because she's not gonna die

1621
01:17:04,309 --> 01:17:05,799
because she got the job.

1622
01:17:05,878 --> 01:17:07,209
The network job that you said

1623
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:08,268
she wasn't gonna get,

1624
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:09,473
which means you were wrong.

1625
01:17:11,383 --> 01:17:12,782
Was I?

1626
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,988
What is that supposed to mean?

1627

If she dies tomorrow,
then she doesn't get the job,

1628
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:24,591
and I was right.

1629
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:35,336
An angel will fall
from the sky!

1630
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:39,070
An angel will fall from the sky!

1631
01:17:40,712 --> 01:17:45,115
An angel
will fall from the sky!

1632

[Sighs]
This is the life, isn't it?

1633
01:17:57,462 --> 01:18:01,796
I guess.
I'm terribly afraid of flying.

1634
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:06,463
I can assure you,
we are not gonna die today.

1635
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:17,773
You know what?

1636
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:19,976
Vin, it just doesn't
make sense, you know?

1637
01:18:20,052 --> 01:18:21,314
I mean, the whole thing
with the two of us,

1638
01:18:21,386 --> 01:18:22,444
it just doesn't make any sense.

1639
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:24,580
Yeah, well,
love never does, Pete.

1640
01:18:24,656 --> 01:18:25,623
- Love?
- Mm-hmm.

1641
01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:27,022
I didn't say--
Did you hear me say love?

1642
01:18:27,092 --> 01:18:28,650
Whatever you say.

1643
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:30,319
No one said anything
about love.

1644
01:18:33,131 --> 01:18:34,359
Love.

1645
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:36,663
I got your love right here.
8 ball, side pocket.

1646
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:40,704
Curiously strong.

1647
01:18:40,772 --> 01:18:42,364
That's kind of like her,
isn't it?

1648
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:46,537
Are you gonna give me
an Altoids metaphor now?

1649
01:18:46,612 --> 01:18:47,874
No. No. No. Now, listen.

1650
01:18:47,946 --> 01:18:49,573
'Cause, uh, at fiirst,

1651
01:18:49,648 --> 01:18:52,378
you can only take her
in small doses, right?

1652
01:18:52,451 --> 01:18:54,282
You know, after a while,

1653
01:18:54,353 --> 01:18:56,321
you start to like
the burn, you know?

1654
01:18:56,388 --> 01:18:58,982
You acquire a little
taste for it, you know?

1655
01:18:59,057 --> 01:19:01,753
But it scares you,
'cause you're afraid

1656
01:19:01,827 --> 01:19:04,193
one day the drugstore's
gonna be flat out

1657
01:19:04,262 --> 01:19:05,923
of Altoids, and then what?

1658
01:19:05,998 --> 01:19:08,023
So you pick up
some cinnamon gum,

1659
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,000
or some, uh, you know,
spearmint Tic Tacs,

1660
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:11,592
but guess what?

1661
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,001
Nothing else is gonna

1662
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:15,232
cut it for you anymore, cowboy.

1663
01:19:16,675 --> 01:19:18,438
Yeah.

1664
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,910
Well, cowboy, Lanie's gone,

1665
01:19:20,979 --> 01:19:22,947
and Altoids aren't
really an option now.

1666
01:19:23,015 --> 01:19:24,482
So I'm just gonna
get on with my life.

1667
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,587
He said I was gonna
die by tomorrow.

1668
01:19:31,657 --> 01:19:32,851
And I believed him

1669
01:19:32,924 --> 01:19:34,619
because he predicted
this hail storm

1670
01:19:34,693 --> 01:19:36,024
and the football score

1671
01:19:36,094 --> 01:19:37,857
and the earthquake
in San Francisco.

1672
01:19:37,929 --> 01:19:40,489
9:06 on the dot.

1673
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:43,635
But he also said
that I would not

1674
01:19:43,702 --> 01:19:45,829
get this big job
that I was up for,

1675
01:19:45,904 --> 01:19:48,395
and guess what?

1676
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:49,963
I got it.

1677
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,002
That's where I'm going right now.

1678
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:55,137
So, you see,
there is no way

01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:57,545
you are gonna die
on this plane.

but an Angel
did fall from the sky.

01:20:39,157 --> 01:20:40,089
I mean, not an angel
with wings,

but an Angel, so, uh--
