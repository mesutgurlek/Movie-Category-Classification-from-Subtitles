Instead of doing just one crossword per week,
I could go daily.

- I could do five per week-

[Woman]
...Guadalupe Aguero, or to us, Baby Peggy...

605
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:34,706
was born with an extremely rare
birth defect: a third leg.

606
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:37,746
Shortly after the birth,
her poor immigrant parents separated.

607
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:42,046
Now with joint custody, one parent
wants the abnormal baby to keep the third leg.

608
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:44,780
- The other wants it gone.
- After months of legal wrangling...

609
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,788
the judge has ordered in favor of the mother.

610
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,858
Amputation surgery is scheduled for tomorrow...

611
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,018
but the father, Mr. Aguero,
isn't about to give up.

612
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:55,224
As his lawyers work to secure an injunction...

613
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:59,268
the father continues to rally support
around the rogue leg.

614
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:03,328
I'm quoting. " If God didn't want my daughter
to have a third leg...

615
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,432
he wouldn't have stuck one
between the other two."

616
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:09,671
So, for now, the fate
of the precious child's third leg...

617
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,806
is in the hands of a judge.

00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,950
- Yeah. The one who did the crossword.
- Yeah.

745
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,960
She followed me here.

746
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:08,553
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

747
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:12,726
I mean, I saw her at the bridge, and l- I think
she's with the protesters. She has red boots.

748
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:14,565
- Is she attractive?
- I mean, who cares?

749
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:18,163
I've been married to the same woman
for nine years. I care.

750
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:21,300
- I think she thinks that I invited her here.
- Did you?

751
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,039
No. I mean, well-

752
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,047
Kind of. I mean-

753
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,550
But I was just trying to be nice, you know,
to get her out of my truck.

754
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,018
You could have tried "Get out of my truck."

755
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,555
I can't be held responsible
for being a nice guy, right?

756
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:38,093
No. Of course not.
Unless she's doing a crossword all about you...

757
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,856
and following you
across the country like a stalker.

758
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:43,432
Stalker?

759
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,763
- Who has a stalker?
- Steve does. Big-time.

760
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,394
- No, no, no, no. What?
- Big-time.

761
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,939
Really? What's going on with that?

762
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,340
<i>No, I was telling him about Mary. Remember</i>
<i>Mary, the blind date my parents set me up on?</i>

763
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:57,379
She was on me like a mountain lion in the truck.

764
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,074
Great in theory, but... wouldn't stop talking.

765
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,083
She was like a talking encyclopedia.

766
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:06,044
So, uh, is she here, or-

767
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:08,020
No. No, no, no. I think she went up-

768
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:10,422
Red boots, with the protesters. Hot.

769
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,495
Red boots?

770
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,893
- You bang a fireman?
- No.

771
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,762
No, I did not bang a fireman.

772
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,028
Hmm.

773
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:23,469
All right.
[Grunts] I'm gonna go outside...

774
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,736
and get some, uh, snacks.

775
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,243
- You want anything?
- <i>[Angus] Oh, man. I could use a club soda...</i>

776
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,973
<i>with shaved ice with a twist oflemon.</i>

777
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,349
- Awesome. He's getting me drinks.
- You think that's where he's going?

778
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:42,890
- Yeah! - That's not where he's going.
I don't know what he's up to.

779
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:44,755
He's always thinking about something.

780
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:48,295
- <i>[Crowd] # Save the leg, my friend #</i>
- This glue is making me high.

781
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:51,799
- <i># Save the leg #</i> - It's the,
uh- It's the methylbenzene in there, Winston.

782
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,801
- Give me that.
- <i># Save the leg, my friend ##</i>

783
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,167
- Here.
- [Chattering]

784
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,240
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi.

785
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,241
- Uh, can I help?
- Oh, sure.

786
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:03,676
Mary, have you met Howard?
Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard.

787
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,841
- How do you do?
- Uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean.

788
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,419
- <i>[Chuckles]</i>
- Uh-

789
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,114
I'm just gonna sit down.

790
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:15,690
- So, what can I do?
- Can you, um- Can you do the ribbon?

791
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:18,488
- Yes.
- Okay. Here's scissors if you need them.

792
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,460
<i>[Chattering]</i>

793
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:23,464
- Mary.
- Oh, hey. That's that news guy.

794
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,193
Hartman Hughes.

795
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:28,099
So, this is the pro-legger camp.

796
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:30,172
- [Man] Yeah.
- Handsome group.

797
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:32,173
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

798
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,607
You folks are all for
keeping Baby Peggy abnormal.

799
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:37,942
- Abnormal?
- Extra legs equals extra awesomeness.

800
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,981
- [Whimpers]
- <i>[Mary] Yeah.</i>

801
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:43,109
- She'd just be like the tree frog.
- Come again?

802
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,346
A trematode parasite causes polymely-

803
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:48,049
that means "extra limbs" - in-in tree frogs. Yeah.

804
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:50,557
Happens all the time. It's -It's totally normal.

805
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,026
- <i>In some ponds,there's a quarter
of the tree frogs</i>- - Hartman Hughes!

806
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:55,120
with extra limbs,
and sometimes they found that if-

807
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,131
You know, over at the media tent...

808
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,599
we're gonna take a break in a few minutes...

809
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:02,466
and, uh, sure enough like you to join me.

810
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:05,905
Oh. [Chuckles]
I can't. Um, I have flute lessons.

811
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:12,573
[Clears Throat]
Will Steve be there?

812
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,341
- Who do you think sent me?
- Oh.

813
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,886
<i>All right, girl. You go, girl.</i>

814
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,513
Go on to that media tent with your bad self.

815
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:23,524
<i>Go get your man, honey.</i>

816
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,560
- I'll be right back.
- <i>Holler if you need backup.</i>

817
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:29,428
- Did Steve tell you all about the
crossword I did for him? - Oh, yeah.

818
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:32,296
There's no words to describe
how much it meant to him.

819
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:34,597
Oh, but there are. There are always words.

820
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:36,604
- You know-
- Yes?

821
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:39,641
It's easy to see
why he fell for you the way he did.

822
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:41,710
Oh.
[Chuckles]

823
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,913
- So, he, uh- Oh, yeah.
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

824
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:48,006
he told you all about
the incredible connection and intensity...

825
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,017
- and je ne sais quoi?
- Oh, yeah.

826
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:52,087
- <i>[Beeps]</i>
- He told me about the quoi.

827
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,452
He wouldn't shut his piehole about the quoi.

828
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:58,015
- But, you know, his bliss is tempered with fear.
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

829
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,685
- Oh.
- When you saw him today...

830
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:03,027
did he seem like a man
whose heart and loins were full of joy?

831
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,600
- <i>Um</i>-
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

832
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,466
l- l-l-I don't know. I don't know if- if-

833
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,471
- Mmm, no.
- No.

834
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:12,473
- It's because he's afraid, Mary.
- Oh.

835
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,635
He's afraid you're gonna... break his heart.

836
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:18,646
But I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that to Steve. I could never do that.

837
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:21,239
- I'm incapable-
- Shh.

838
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,012
You rest those pretty little mouth pillows, huh?

839
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,884
You're gonna need 'em later
for all sorts of naughtiness.

840
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:29,549
What I need to know from you right now...

841
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:34,289
are you gonna stick around long enough
to help us work through Steve's fear?

842
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,297
- Oh. Of course. Of course. Yes.
- Ah.

843
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:39,459
- If he tells you to go, you don't go.
- Mm-hmm. No? Okay.

844
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:44,472
Mm-mmm. He starts throwing words around
like "cuckoo" and "loony" and "crazy"...

845
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:46,474
- that's his fear talking.
- Oh.

846
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:48,476
- All right?
- Okay. Okay. Yes.

847
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:52,446
If he tries to run away, I want you to grab him.

848
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:55,642
- Okay. - And with the strength
that God gives you, hang on.

849
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,242
- Be calm and focused.
- Okay. Okay.

850
00:45:57,353 --> 00:45:59,253
- You wanna know why?
- Why? Yeah. Why?

851
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,687
You're the rock in this relationship.

852
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,691
I'm the rock.

853
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:07,285
- You're the glue that holds it together.
- I'm the glue. Okay.

854
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:10,331
Right here. Look at me. Focus.

855
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,302
Are you gonna soldier on...

856
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:16,303
no matter what happens?

857
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,635
Of course.

858
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:20,641
- Of course.
- Good.

859
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:24,201
- [Sighs] - You know what I see in those big,
beautiful eyes?

860
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:27,214
Plica semilunaris secretions?

861
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:29,216
Do I have something in my eye?

862
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:33,346
Bravery.

863
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,723
Hmm. Well, I'm a little nervous.

864
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:42,355
- Now you go get your Steve on.
- Okay. Okay.

865
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:45,127
- <i>[Angus] You said she was hyper?</i>
- Yeah, she's really hyper.

866
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,566
That's good. That's good.
The calm and focused ones...

867
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,036
they keep all that bottled up inside,
and before you know it-

868
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:52,471
[Grunting]

869
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:55,544
You know? But as long as she's hyper,
you don't have to worry about it.

870
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:57,840
One thing she isn't is calm.

871
00:46:57,947 --> 00:47:00,211
- [Whispering] Dude.
- Something you wanna tell me?

872
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,409
- Dude. Is that her?
- Hmm?

873
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,486
Is that her?

874
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,924
Oh.

875
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:10,993
Want some?

876
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:16,828
Okay.

877
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:19,834
- How'd she get in here?
- [Whispering] I don't know. She's calm.

878
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:25,437
Boy, did I miss you, Steven with a "V."

879
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,772
- Let's go for a talk outside.
- Okay. Walkie-talk.

880
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:30,778
- Right out here.
- Okay.

881
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,848
- [Whistling]
- All right.

882
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:36,780
- Oops. Yes?
- Okay.

883
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:38,911
- You can't stay here.
- Sure I can.

884
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:41,216
- No.
- That's the beauty of my job. I can send in...

885
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:44,293
- crossword puzzles from anywhere in the world.
- No. Listen. Listen. Okay.

886
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:46,953
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm?

887
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:49,031
I don't want you here. Okay?

888
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:51,031
But you said.

889
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:53,465
I said- I know- I'm a guy. Okay?

890
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:55,867
We say things we don't mean.

891
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:59,135
Well, then, how do I know
