Hello?

<i>(shouts) Ming!

4
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh, it's you!

5
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,473
Where's my painting? I want my painting.

6
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:54,978
In the mail? Well, that's original!

7
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,566
I have to say, I'm astonished
that you could do it!

8
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,570
The climb! All that schlepping
at your tender age!

9
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:07,282
Anyway, bad news.
The price for the goggles went up.

10
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:11,077
The Rembrandt's
not gonna cover my expenses.

11
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,541
Under the circumstances,
40 million would be a bargain.

12
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:22,881
I don't care how you get it.
Just make sure that you get it fast.

13
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:26,301
Tick-tock... tick-tock.

14
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,566
- Morning, Mr Cruz.
- Morning.

15
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:59,834
First you insure the art, only to watch it
get clipped a month after the client buys it.

16
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,962
Well, it could become
part of our ad campaign.

17
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:08,843
I'll remember that when I go upstairs to hear
about my new position in the Toledo office.

18
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,971
I called you at 4.30 this morning.

19
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:15,016
I was home in bed.

20
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,519
- You didn't pick up.
- I didn't wanna pick up.

21
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,687
You had company.

22
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:23,441
- He came in the window.
- How romantic.

23
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,985
I think that's how he got in.

24
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,573
This was 70 storeys up with smart-glass
windows at 400 pounds a pop.

25
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,909
He rigged something.

26
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:37,121
And I think it was...

27
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:42,126
...telescoping bolts.
- And you know this how?

28
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,837
Excuse me.

29
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,633
<i>(woman speaks Chinese)</i>

30
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:52,720
- You're showing off again.
- Let a thousand flowers bloom.

31
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,223
- Chairman Mao.
- You got it.

32
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,352
He left the window open when he came in.

33
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,646
The draught blew over the flowers.

34
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,191
I'll bet the bolts on that window
have fresh scratches.

35
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,610
- And who do we like for this?
- Guess.

36
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:09,320
Oh, gee. I wonder.

37
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,949
Indulge me.

38
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,577
Indulge you?

39
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:19,789
- Bob, may I?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.

40
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,045
Four weeks ago, when our client
bought the Rembrandt.

41
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,548
- See anyone we know?
- No.

42
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,426
No, and neither did anyone else.

43
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,641
Now look again.

44
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:42,228
You think he marked the buyer
at the auction house.

45
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,939
- Right.
- Good work, Bob.

46
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:50,862
- And let's not forget the calling card.
- Elvis has not left the building.

47
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,032
This is classic Mac, Hector.

48
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:59,329
In the five years I've known you, you've liked
MacDougal for half the cases we've worked.

49
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,582
- He's the best.
- He's also 60 years old.

50
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:07,545
He ain't Spiderman any more. He's a rich guy.
He doesn't have to steal a Rembrandt.

51
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,922
You think he steals because he has to?

52
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,009
Keep working.

53
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,865
So you get in here at 7am...

54
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:40,995
...you work until 10, eat lunch alone,
you have no friends at the office...

55
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,249
- Wow, you've been paying attention.
- I'm worried about you.

56
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,588
Maybe I like being alone.
Maybe I'm getting over someone.

57
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:55,802
Well, they say nothing gets you over
the last one like the next one.

58
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,639
Is this your way of asking me out,
Hector? Huh?

59
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:02,809
Well, um... not if you're gonna say no.

60
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,730
You may be right.

61
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:14,403
- He was here this week.
- He flew back to London this morning?

62
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:18,825
It might be worth sending someone
over there, see what he's up to.

63
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:22,912
- I know this guy.
- Do you?

64
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:23,663
Sure!

65
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:28,251
Some years back, when I was at the Bureau,
we sent two guys after him.

66
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:31,462
I know, I know. They disappeared.
I know the story.

67
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:34,966
- And these were both good agents.
- They were both men.

68
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,593
What do you have in mind for bait?

69
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:45,726
- The one thing I know he wants.
- Why not the Mona Lisa?

70
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,895
Our guy likes a challenge.

71
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,690
Come on.

72
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,526
I want this back.

73
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,721

Never carry a gun, or you
might be tempted to use it.

- To ask some questions.

If I don't like your answers,
you're going out the window.

- You'll just have to trust me.

Rule number two:
Never trust a naked woman.

89

I had nothing to sleep in.
Somebody stole my luggage.

Really? I'm shocked.

91

It's amazing what gets stolen
these days. Your bags...

That Rembrandt.

Mm.

94
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,741
Indeed. That Rembrandt.

95
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:33,454
- And this is your proposition?
- Yep.

96
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:37,291
- I don't think it's for sale.
- It's not. I'm gonna steal it.

97
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:41,170
From Bedford Palace?
It's rather well guarded.

99
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:49,428
- Well, good for you.
- But I need your help.

100
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,388
I can't get in and out.

101
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:55,017
I've already got a buyer
who'll give me 40 million for it.

I have no reason to believe
a word you've told me.

00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:02,149
- But you want to.
- Why is that?

104
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,819
Because you want the mask.

105
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,406
Mm.

106
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,034
First we try, then we trust.

00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:13,619
Meaning what?

108
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:16,955
Meet me outside the hotel, 9am.
Preferably dressed.

109
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,668
- How do I know you'll be there?
- Oh, I'll be there. And I'm never late.

110
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:24,004
- Not ever?
- Never.

111

If I'm late... it's because I'm dead.

You go straight in there and ask for Haas.

118
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,913
- Haas?
- Lovely fella.

119
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,164
Very low-key.

120
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:03,919
You tell him you want to buy a Qing vase.
The price is £200,000...

121
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:06,922
...which, of course, you won't pay.
- Why not?

122
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,759
Because you're going to steal it.
You are a thief, aren't you?

123
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,058
Take this card, which is fake.
As he turns to swipe it, you swipe the vase.

124
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,435
OK.

125
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,729

- Where's the vase?

- No, trust me, babe.

This is better than a real one. 200,000.

00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,790
- What's that?
- It's a credit card.

136
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,959
Yeah. And?

137
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,794
I need the miles.

138
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,966
What exactly... do you think this is?

139
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,346
- Harrods?
- No, I've never seen rats at Harrods.

Sure.

How funny is this?

143
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:51,485
I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake about the vase.

Too right.

- It was a cheap Victorian knockoff!

00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,236
- Give it to me.
- What is it?

159
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,196
Give it to me!

160
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,614
What is it?!

161
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:21,491
Bedford Palace.

162
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:25,412
The complete plans,
security system, soup to nuts.

163
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:44,639
Man, look what you've done
to this beautiful car!

164
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:47,976
Yeah, thank God it's not mine.
Here, some clothes.

165
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,981
- Where are we going? These are my clothes!
- Yes, you have some nice things.

166
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:57,611
- It was you? You stole my luggage?
- I'm a thief. So sue me.

167
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,156
- And where are we going?
- Up.

168
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:08,371
- Mac, where is my suitcase?
- It's with hotel security.

169
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:10,874
With what?!

170
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,919
Why?

171
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:17,464
Well, there was a robbery yesterday
at Cryptonic.

172
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:23,053
And someone stole five prototype superchips
worth $4 million each.

173
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:27,015
And one of these chips
is inside your suitcase.

174
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,476
- With hotel security.
- Yes.

175
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,981
And one anonymous phone call,
from me, plus the photos...

176
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,692
- What photos?
- Oh, yes.

177
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:39,986
These.

178
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:44,074
Who took?

179
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:50,038
Hey!

180
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:52,958
- This is entrapment!
- What?

181
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:57,545
- This is called entrapment!
- Actually, it's called blackmail.

182
00:20:58,254 --> 00:20:59,756
Entrapment...

183
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,385
...is what cops do to thieves.

184
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:06,179
You coming?

185
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,617
Almost there.

186
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:03,153
No lock? No security?

187
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:06,030
You're not casing the joint already, are you?

188
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:08,199
This way.

189
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,828
Oh, wow!

190
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:15,081
Shall we?

191
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,133
Oh, my God.

192
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:35,643
- This is quite a collection.
- Thank you.

193
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:38,605
Only contemporary art?

194
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:42,734
- You sound surprised.
- No, it's just not what I expected.

195
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:45,695
Where are the suits of armour
and crossed swords?

196
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,448
Up in the attic. Whiskey?

197
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,617
Sure. I'd love one.

198
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,578
Wow!

199
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:58,041
Is all this paid for?

200
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:01,461
- With blood. Cheers.
- To the mask.

201
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:09,761
- I'll show you to your room.
- Who else do you bring here?

202
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:11,888
No-one.

203
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:14,891
- That's sad.
- Why?

204
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:18,895
Well, to have something like this
and not share it with anyone.

205
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:23,483
I don't need to share it with anyone.
Most people buy art to show it off.

206
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,777
I collect art for me.

207
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,946
Your room's this way.

208
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:35,370
Good night, then.

209
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:39,123
- But it's still early.
- Yes, we have an early start.

210
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,292
But I'm not tired!

211
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:44,003
<i>Where do you sleep?</i>

212
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,675
Why?

213
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,886
Just in case I need anything.

214
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:57,934
<i>- May I ask you something?
- Sure.</i>

215
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:03,856
Has there ever been anyone you couldn't
manipulate, beguile, or seduce?

216
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,192
No.

217
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:10,947
Why, do I make you uneasy, Mac?

218
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:14,575
No. No, not at all.

219
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:22,166
In fact, I think now might be a good time
for you and I to, uh... discuss something.

220
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,670
- Well, what do you have in mind?
- Uh...

221
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:28,089
The rules.

222
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:30,049
Oh! OK.

223
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:34,887
In order for there to be
complete trust between thieves...

224
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:37,807
...there can be nothing personal.

225
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:45,189
A job is ajob. You do your part, I do mine.

226
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:49,861
<i>If one of us thinks about something
other than the task at hand...</i>

227
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:53,990
...we'll either both get caught,
or both get dead.

228
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:58,995
Good night again.

229
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:16,721
<i>(Mac) No...</i>

230
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,474
Nope. No...

231
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,060
No. No.

232
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,729
Nope.

233
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,773
- That's the way in.
- That's the lake.

234
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:33,613
Yes, I know it's the lake, dear. The first duke
dug a tunnel as a back door for his mistress.

235
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,532
100 years later, they flooded the place.

236
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:38,701
OK, so we go underwater.

237
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:44,457
I go underwater. I steal the mask.
You get a finder's fee of 10º/...

238
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,044
<i>But I have the code to the mask case, dear.</i>

239
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:50,796
Which you're now going to give to me.

240
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:53,841
No!

241
00:25:56,636 --> 00:26:00,556
- Have you been wasting my time?
- Have you been wasting mine?

242
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:09,315
I'll arrange your return to London.

243
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,654
I'm not who you think I am, Mac.

244
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:17,031
I hope not, for your sake.

245
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:20,534
I'm a thief.

246
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:23,496
So you keep telling me.

247
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:27,458
I stole the Rembrandt.

248
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:33,839
- Mac, I stole the Rembrandt!
- And I painted the Sistine Chapel!

249
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,759
Come on! Ask me how I did it!

250
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,553
- How did you do it?
- I came in from the roof.

251
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:44,183
I dropped 20 floors down
on a McNeal Descender.

252
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,728
- You must be a hell of a climber.
- I am.

253
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,316
Mm?

254
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:57,029
<i>I am a hell of a climber!</i>

255
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:04,370
I am... one... hell of a climber.

256
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:06,914
But how did you get it out of there?

257
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,625
Now that...

258
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,586
...is the most...

259
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,505
...beautiful part!

260
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:20,553
- I mailed it.
- No!

261
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:24,515
I put it down their own mail chute.

262
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:28,436
Simple...

263
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:32,189
...effective... safe.

264
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:33,983
That's very clever.

265
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,528
Nope. Not clever.

266
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,785
It was perfect!

267
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:48,205
Absolutely unbelievable!

268
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:54,837
<i>You're right. It is beautiful. Mm?</i>

269
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:00,885
Did you know that Rembrandt lived
with his parents well into his forties?

270
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:05,055
But of course you'd know that.
You're perfect.

271
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,143
How did you get that?

272
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:13,105
Why rob the penthouse... when
the mailroom's on the ground floor?

273
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,193
How did you know I took it?

274
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:22,490
There's only a handful of people
who can make the equipment you used.

275
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:24,241
And I know all of them.

276
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:27,703
- Someone was expecting that.
- Obviously.

277
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:31,332
- Mr Conrad Greene of Kuala Lumpur.
- Oh, God!

278
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:37,546
What was it? A down payment?
A service this Mr Greene is providing?

279
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,924
Yeah, something like that.

280
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:47,223
What could you possibly
want to steal in Malaysia?

281
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,808
- Hm?
- A hundred million dollars.

282
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:54,313
What's the job?

283
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:57,316
Like the wise man said:

284
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:03,906
First we try, then we trust.

285
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:20,798
Ah, good morning.

286
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:25,302
Wanna tell me why my Jaguar looks like
you drove it off a fuckin' cliff?

287
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,972
Thibadeaux, I'm awfully sorry.

288
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:33,185
- You owe me 140 G's.
- How about a $40 million Chinese mask?

289
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,981
Is it turbocharged with a six-CD changer?

290
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,484
Did you get everything I need?

291
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:45,739
- When we done, you buyin' me a new car.
- Agreed. Did you get the small pneumatics?

292
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:50,202
Yeah, I got the small pneumatics.
You gotta be a damn elf to use 'em.

293
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:52,162
- The det cord?
- It's in the van.

294
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:58,168
That's some nasty shit. Don't mix it with
nothing else or you'll be all over the floor.

295
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:05,342
- What the hell's this?
- IR thermo-camera, what you asked for.

296
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:11,432
- I specifically said no liquid-plasma screen.
- That was specifically all I could get.

297
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:14,393
How can I do this without the right tools?

298
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:19,398
Gimme a break, man.
You think I go to K-Mart and get this shit?

299
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,609
Figure out something. You always do.

300
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,281
- Where's the honey?
- In the loch, training.

301
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:31,869
I told her I swim for an hour every day,
so she'll do it for two.

302
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:39,334
So, when is it we do the dirty?

303
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:42,463
Maybe we should wait a bit.

304
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,842
She's got a biggerjob after this one.

305
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,303
This is big enough, man.

306
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:52,514
It's never big enough.

307
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,395
- You are keepin' this strictly business, right?
- Strictly.

308
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:03,817
Have you ever bought a woman's dress?

309
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,946
It's for the job. For her.

310
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,365
I don't know her size.

311
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:14,411
Well, I'd say she's probably a six, but...

312
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,830
...she'd look real fine in a four.

313
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:23,253
I had this girl, Tina. She said the dress made
the woman. I say the woman makes the dress.

314
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:25,422

Up.

484
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:18,715
Mm.

<i>Good. You've got three minutes on the guard.</i>

486

Balance. One point.

487
00:52:42,322 --> 00:52:44,407
Now lift.

488
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:53,541
Two minutes on the guard.

489
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:04,260
<i>Lift.</i>

490
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:07,764
Extend. Now turn.

491
00:53:21,402 --> 00:53:23,029
Up a little more.

492
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:27,909
Now bend the knee.

493
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:47,011
75 seconds.

494
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:07,532
<i>Freeze.</i>

00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:45,028
Now, remember the damn pressure switch!

499
00:54:52,118 --> 00:54:53,995
Ah.

500
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:16,225
Good girl.

501
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:23,149
<i>35 seconds.</i>

00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:31,949
Preparing pressure switch

503
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:48,800

- Let me have the mask.
- Here he is!

509
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:45,982
Now this is where we play Truth or Dare.

510
00:56:46,065 --> 00:56:47,191
What?

511
00:56:54,323 --> 00:56:57,034
First we start with truth, huh?

512
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:01,247
You work for Hector Cruz
at Waverly Insurance, hm?

513
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:05,710
Now...

514
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:08,754
...I dare you to lie to me.

515
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:12,049
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What!

516
00:57:15,595 --> 00:57:19,056
The job was a cover!
That's how I got the code.

517
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,851
No, no, no, you're playing both sides.

518
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:25,896
You're gonna sell the mask
to Conrad Greene, then turn me in.

519
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,899
- No, I need you for the job.
- There is no otherjob!

520
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:31,027
There is! It's worth over...

521
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:36,449
And don't tell me it's worth a hundred million.

522
00:57:36,532 --> 00:57:41,495
It's not. It's, it's... You're right, it's not.
It's worth over a billion.

<i>(Gin gasps)</i>

524
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:58,763
And that's just your share!

525
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:01,640
I'm not lying!

526
00:58:06,937 --> 00:58:09,774
I can't do this job without you, Mac.

527
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:13,027
Please come with me to Kuala Lumpur.

528
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:26,123
Can you just decide soon, please?

529
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,672
Four, three...

530
00:58:33,756 --> 00:58:35,883
...two, one.

531
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:42,348
Your time's up. You said you would tell me
what the nextjob is in 24 hours.

532
00:58:42,932 --> 00:58:45,017
It's a bank.

533
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:49,230
And?

534
00:58:49,605 --> 00:58:52,316
And I didn't say I'd tell you any more.

535
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:55,778
Isn't it beautiful here?

536
00:59:06,372 --> 00:59:08,457
<i>(car horn)</i>

537
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:19,468
Banks have never really been my thing.

538
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,138
Think a billion dollars and change your mind.

539
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:27,810
- I just don't like surprises.
- Trust me, there won't be any.

540
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,647
<i>Trust me. There always are surprises.</i>

541
00:59:49,373 --> 00:59:53,294
I must say, it's, uh... very homey.

542
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,504
Why, thank you!

543
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,764
Of course, when I said bank...

544
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:09,310
...I didn't mean just any bank.

545
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:12,605
A room with a view!

546
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:17,359
- I give you the world's tallest building.
- And we're going to steal it?

547
01:00:17,443 --> 01:00:21,113
Home of the International Clearance Bank...

548
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:27,453
...which I'm sure you know controls all big
money transactions in Southeast Asia.

549
01:00:28,412 --> 01:00:31,624
- Do I have your attention now?
- Undivided.

550
01:00:31,707 --> 01:00:37,296
Here, the headquarters of the International
Clearance Bank in New York.

551
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:41,634
Running from there are hackproof,
firewalled, dedicated lines...

552
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:45,220
...to computers in its branch offices
around the world.

553
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:48,474
The only access is from
central control in New York...

554
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:52,603
...or from the totally secure computers
in the branch offices.

555
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:57,316
In Kuala Lumpur,
only one man has unlimited access.

556
01:00:57,399 --> 01:01:02,863
<i>Lee Kuan Hong, Chairman of the International
Clearance Bank of Kuala Lumpur.</i>

557
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:08,619
Vaults are accessed by two things: a key code
and a completely unfakeable retinal scan.

558
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:12,164
- Morning, everyone. Nice day, uh?
- Hi.

559
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:14,416
Arghhh!

560
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,543
Which we're gonna fake.

561
01:01:17,086 --> 01:01:20,547
<i>Right now, our Chairman,
with a face full of Mace...</i>

562
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,925
<i>... is getting his eyes checked...</i>

563
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:26,261
<i>... with a little help from
Conrad Greene's guys...</i>

564
01:01:26,345 --> 01:01:28,013
<i>... hopefully.</i>

565
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:31,600
- With me so far?
- All the way.

566
01:01:31,683 --> 01:01:36,688
Now, because of the millennium bug,
our friends at International Clearance...

567
01:01:36,772 --> 01:01:41,819
...will be running integrity tests,
which they're rehearsing as we speak.

568
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:46,824
<i>- Prepare test shutdown for Sydney in...
- Just before midnight, local time...</i>

569
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:50,661
<i>... they'll shut down the mainframe
in each zone for 30 seconds.</i>

570
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:53,831
- Sydney is shut down.
- Run test program.

571
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:57,709
Now we need those 30 seconds
to patch into the mainframe.

572
01:01:57,793 --> 01:02:03,966
We then need ten seconds of one-on-one time
with the computer, to download...

573
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:07,553
..."the stuff".
- How do we acquire those ten seconds?

574
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:08,929
We steal 'em.

575
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:14,935
<i>The transmitter I left behind simply overrides
the signal of the atomic clock. So...</i>

576
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:20,357
...from 11pm tomorrow night their clocks gain
a fraction of a second every minute...

577
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,026
...and we gain our ten seconds.

578
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,530
And what is this "stuff" we are downloading?

579
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,043
Enya?

580
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:44,590
Cunningly disguised in there is a disk
that took me five years to make...

581
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:48,176
...cooped up in my broom closet
at Waverly Insurance.

582
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:53,056
It tells the ICB computer to transfer
relatively small amounts of money...

583
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:57,686
...from hundreds of corporations all over
Southeast Asia into my account.

584
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:00,647
<i>- Our account.
- Yeah, our account.</i>

585
01:03:01,273 --> 01:03:04,067
Eight billion dollars in total.

586
01:03:04,902 --> 01:03:07,237
<i>You said one billion.</i>

587
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:10,532
<i>Mm-mm. I said that was your share.</i>

588
01:03:10,616 --> 01:03:14,703
What can you do with seven billion
that you can't do with four?

589
01:03:16,163 --> 01:03:18,248
Hold the record.

590
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,001
Alone.

591
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:23,545
Sounds rather Ionely.

592
01:03:23,629 --> 01:03:25,589
Alone?

593
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:27,633
No. Alone is good.

594
01:03:28,884 --> 01:03:31,386
- You want a beer?
- Thank you.

595
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:36,016
- We'll need three weeks to prepare.
- What?

596
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:40,145
- Minimum.
- No. It has to be tomorrow night.

597
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:42,189
No way.

598
01:03:42,272 --> 01:03:46,652
You don't understand. It has to be
millennium midnight or it's never.

599
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:49,321
Then it's never. It's impossible.

600
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,871
You...

601
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:03,960
OK. Fifty-fifty.

602
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,962
What?

603
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:09,716
You heard.

604
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,346
It's impossible.

605
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:19,017
But doable.

606
01:04:47,003 --> 01:04:52,426
<i>(tour guide) Ladies and gentlemen, we are
now standing over 700ft above sea level.</i>

607
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:56,138
Our skybridge is the longest
and highest in the world.

608
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:59,933
It stretches over 300ft to the opposite tower.

609
01:05:00,016 --> 01:05:04,479
It is supported, as you can see,
by four flexible steel pillars.

610
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:08,483
The lights are being hung
for our millennium party tomorrow.

611
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:14,281
Over 40,000 light bulbs
will make this truly a sight to remember.

612
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:25,537
So, what have we here? We have the goggles
with the chairman's retinal scan.

613
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:29,999
And we have the chairman's
access card to the 86th floor...

614
01:07:31,876 --> 01:07:33,086
...in the bag.

615
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:35,088
Anything else I need to know?

616
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:39,634
Confucius, he say:
Don't use cannon to kill mosquito.

617
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:43,263
Right!

618
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:48,184
Well, now that I've shown you mine,
it's your turn to show me yours.

619
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:52,939
- Well, here she is.
- Oh, goody, goody, goody!

620
01:07:53,022 --> 01:07:54,899
Bring it to Papa.

621
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:59,404
Oh! A thing of beauty, huh? Ajoy forever!

622
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,242
And where's the mask?
I want my mask. Come on!

623
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:08,913
Oh! So you're working
with MacDougal on this, huh?

624
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,123
Yeah.

625
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:12,125
Uh-huh.

626
01:08:13,918 --> 01:08:15,295
Uh-huh.

627
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:19,966
I would suggest that you have
a little tête-à-tête with your partner.

628
01:08:20,049 --> 01:08:22,302
If he's still in the country.

629
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:26,347
In the meantime,
I'll hold on to the access card and goggles.

630
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:32,604
Conrad, you've gotta believe me.
I had no idea.

631
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:37,692
- I swear to God, I'd never do this to you!
- Don't! Don't pout at me, you little bitch!

632
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:41,029
- Come on, Conrad.
- Get out of here! Get out!

633
01:08:41,112 --> 01:08:44,574
Get out! Just get out! Get outta here!

634

<i>Baby, I'm glad to see you!</i>

635
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,377
I'm calling it off.

636
01:08:56,461 --> 01:09:00,340
You take this.
I'll get the Rembrandt for you later.

637
01:09:00,423 --> 01:09:04,719
- What you sayin'
- She's over her head. It's not happening.

638
01:09:04,802 --> 01:09:08,806
What about the big, giant, huge job
you were all cute about in Scotland?

639
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:12,727
Now you wouldn't be tryin'
to cut a brother out of anything?

640
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:16,105
- There's nothing to cut you out of.
- Sit down, Mac.

641
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:18,024
Sit down.

642
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:21,486
I said, sit the fuck down.

643
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:35,833
You know, Mac, I think it's time
to take your girlfriend out of the equation...

644
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:40,713
...and get down to the you-and-me of it all.
- She's not my girlfriend.

645
01:09:40,797 --> 01:09:47,303
See, I'm gettin' this little Yoko vibe, like all of
a sudden your girlfriend's the one in control.

646
01:09:59,816 --> 01:10:04,862
Now, you change partners,
you change the rules.

647
01:10:04,946 --> 01:10:09,325
And the rules are... Mac does the job.

648
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,494
I watch Mac's back.

649
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:14,622
You don't call off nothin' unless I say so.

- Why'd you take it?
- I was going to sell it.

661
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:47,381
Then why didn't you?

662
01:11:48,507 --> 01:11:52,303
Because... I... couldn't do it.

663
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:55,097
Why not?

664
01:11:56,432 --> 01:12:00,436
I knew that if I told you to forget this job...

665

666

- No.

668
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:10,321
Mm. Right.

669
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:19,956
- Were you worried about me, Mac?
- Well, yes.

670
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:23,417
- Were you?
- I was worried about both of us.

671

- Don't be.
- Hm.

672

Whoops, sorry. Forgot about the rules.

Mm.

No.

676

- Not once?
- No.

Never?

678
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:56,450
Never.

Alone is... good, eh?

680
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:05,584
No. Bullshit.

681

I hate alone. Alone sucks.

What are you doing here?

Oh, I read in the newspapers
that the mask thing's gone down.

702
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:53,168
I don't hear from my trusty agent,
so naturally I worry.

703
01:15:54,503 --> 01:15:58,507
I call the hospitals, I call the morgue...

...and, finally, I call the airlines.

705

I'm a man badly in need of news here,
Miss Baker. Help me out.

706
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:13,814
You want news, Hector? The news is, I don't
appreciate you blowing my cover like this.

707
01:16:13,897 --> 01:16:18,736
He's planning ajob that's
gonna make the mask look like...

You don't believe me? Fine.
Then pull me in and pick him up.

709

Why would I pull you in when you
seem to be getting so close to Mac?

Oh, jeez!

- Business...

you wanna tell me?

Look, give me until tomorrow.
I promise you, you'll have it all.

Don't lose her.

716

Guess she didn't appreciate my pictures.
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?

717
01:17:12,122 --> 01:17:16,376
- She's screwin' you both, man.
- She says it's business. I believe her.

718
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,923
Yeah, she's probably on her way to Mr Mac
right now to do a little "business".

719
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:25,385
Don't do that. You do not do that!
You do not speak like that! You do not!

to get all up and hard, my man!

You better be right.

723

All you gotta do is listen to old Thibadeaux.

724
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:57,084
I've never felt so underdressed in all my life.

OK. The dish should be coming on-line.

728

mean to. Is there any art in this building?

01:42:23,589 --> 01:42:25,508
Gin...

949
01:42:26,717 --> 01:42:29,011
...your life, it's all ahead of you.

950
01:42:29,095 --> 01:42:32,014
Mine... this is all I've got.

951
01:42:32,098 --> 01:42:33,891
No. You've got me.

952
01:42:36,269 --> 01:42:39,272
<i>(whispers) You got me.</i>

953
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,280
Listen carefully. In your other pocket...

954
01:42:48,364 --> 01:42:50,449
Let's do it.

955
01:42:56,122 --> 01:43:00,293
- Move and I blow his head off!
- Everybody, just be cool.

956
01:43:00,376 --> 01:43:04,255
- Nobody move! No-one moves, OK?
- Fellas, put your weapons down.

957
01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:08,926
- You, too, Hector! I'll kill him if you move!
- We'll get her at the next stop.

958
01:43:09,885 --> 01:43:11,971
Bye, Mac.

959
01:43:12,972 --> 01:43:16,225
She's headed toward the next station.
Move! Move it!

960
01:43:16,309 --> 01:43:19,228
- No guns! Get out of here!
- Move it! Move it!

961
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:50,217
<i>You know, I don't know
what just went down here...</i>

962
01:43:50,301 --> 01:43:55,056
...but I'm gonna see that you're busted
outta the Bureau for it.

963
01:43:55,181 --> 01:43:59,060
- It ain't over, Mac.
- I believe you.

964
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:17,244
Well, Mac, this looks like
the end of a terrible friendship.

965
01:44:17,328 --> 01:44:19,914
But you still owe me for today.

966
01:44:21,832 --> 01:44:24,085
I always pay my debts.

967
01:44:25,419 --> 01:44:30,716
Four prototype superchips.
Value: five million dollars each.

968
01:44:39,725 --> 01:44:42,019
Hope she was worth it.

969
01:44:42,686 --> 01:44:44,772
Oh, she was.

970
01:44:45,272 --> 01:44:47,691
I'll be seein' you, Mac.

971
01:44:48,984 --> 01:44:51,070
I don't think so.

972
01:44:55,825 --> 01:44:58,994
OK, Bob, let the people back on the platform.

973
01:44:59,078 --> 01:45:01,163
Bring me a damn car.

974
01:46:12,693 --> 01:46:14,778
How did you do it?

975
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:19,533
I jumped trains mid-station.
When the train slowed down, I just...

976
01:46:19,617 --> 01:46:22,786
- It was perfect.
- Was it now?

977
01:46:24,538 --> 01:46:28,625
You know what, Mac?
I don't wanna hold the record alone.

978
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:31,670
- No?
- I need your help on anotherjob.

979
01:46:31,754 --> 01:46:36,717
- The Crown Jewels or something?
- No! Come on, too easy!

980
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,888
I was thinking of... Well...
I know this guy in South Africa.

981
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:45,517
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds! The biggest
diamonds you'll ever see in your life!

982
01:46:45,601 --> 01:46:48,103
Have I told you how much I love diamonds?

983
01:46:49,688 --> 01:46:51,857
Mac?

984
01:46:54,443 --> 01:46:56,528
Mac?

985
01:46:57,946 --> 01:47:00,532
- Mac!
- What!

986
01:47:04,328 --> 01:47:06,580
So, what do you think?

987
01:47:06,955 --> 01:47:09,917
- About what?
- About my idea.

988
01:47:12,503 --> 01:47:14,588
It's doable.

989
01:47:18,258 --> 01:47:20,969
- Ohh!
- Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

990
01:47:49,873 --> 01:47:52,459
<i>? We both know</i>

991
01:47:55,337 --> 01:47:58,507
<i>? That the harder we try</i>

992
01:48:01,802 --> 01:48:04,805
<i>? Can' understand it</i>

993
01:48:05,514 --> 01:48:10,185
<i>? We're so caught up in the reasons why</i>

994
01:48:13,522 --> 01:48:16,650
<i>? Station to station</i>

995
01:48:17,484 --> 01:48:22,447
<i>? And we couldn' even say their names</i>

996
01:48:25,576 --> 01:48:30,956
<i>? I realise it's just a game</i>

997
01:48:36,795 --> 01:48:39,047
<i>? I...</i>

998
01:48:40,007 --> 01:48:42,718
<i>? Had lost my faith</i>

999
01:48:46,179 --> 01:48:48,140
<i>? Long ago</i>

1000
01:48:49,308 --> 01:48:51,476
<i>? I can see</i>

1001
01:48:52,811 --> 01:48:54,688
<i>? That if I</i>

1002
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:58,066
<i>? That if I stay close to your side</i>

1003
01:49:00,944 --> 01:49:04,573
<i>? That all of these pressures now</i>

1004
01:49:05,907 --> 01:49:08,994
<i>? I know they will subside</i>

1005
01:49:12,581 --> 01:49:16,918
<i>? You know, if ever you need me, yeah</i>

1006
01:49:17,336 --> 01:49:21,298
<i>? All you gotta do is fall</i>

1007
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,971
<i>? But I hear you say that</i>

1008
01:49:28,305 --> 01:49:30,891
<i>? You got it all</i>

1009
01:49:36,146 --> 01:49:37,939
<i>? I...</i>

1010
01:49:39,191 --> 01:49:42,027
<i>? Had lost my faith</i>

1011
01:49:42,569 --> 01:49:44,655

1012
01:49:47,741 --> 01:49:49,659

01:49:50,994 --> 01:49:54,122

1014
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,461
<i>? Long ago</i>

1015
01:50:00,295 --> 01:50:03,006
<i>? Strangers, so it seems</i>

1016
01:50:03,215 --> 01:50:06,051
<i>? I lie here for your touch</i>

1017
01:50:06,134 --> 01:50:12,099
<i>? And what I'd like to know
is why do I want you so much</i>

1018
01:50:12,182 --> 01:50:14,893
<i>? You say that it's just a game</i>

1019
01:50:17,896 --> 01:50:20,690
<i>? All through my life</i>

1020
01:50:22,067 --> 01:50:26,988
<i>? I have waited for you, yeah.</i>

1021
01:50:30,909 --> 01:50:34,079
<i>? I need to know now, I need to know now</i>

1022
01:50:34,162 --> 01:50:36,873
<i>? Have you waited, too?</i>

1023
01:50:36,957 --> 01:50:40,460
<i>? Are you feeling what I'm feeling?</i>

1024
01:50:40,544 --> 01:50:42,420
<i>? Oh...</i>

1025
01:50:44,047 --> 01:50:45,757

1026
01:50:50,011 --> 01:50:51,888
