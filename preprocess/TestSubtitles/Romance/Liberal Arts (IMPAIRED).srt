165
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,018
Another year
of faculty meetings,

166
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,219
I'd throw myself
off that nine-story building.

167
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,457
So how': the admissions game,
buddy?

168
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,226
- [mockingly] "How's
the admissions game, buddy?"

169
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,024
Whoa, is that
Professor Fairfield?

170
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,058
- Yeah.

171
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,059
- Wow, she looks fantastic!

172
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,470
Professor!

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,371
What is she like?
Is she cool?

174
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,932
- She's definitely not warm.

175
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,139
<i>-</i> I loved
her British Romantic Iii clan

176
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,478
She was, like, the belt teacher
I had here.

177
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,678
She was, like, the second best
teacher I had here.

178
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,583
[clears throat and whistles]

179
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,247
- Unbelievable.

180
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,950
[chuckles]
You are unbelievable.

181
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,184
- What?

182
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,266
- Tell her how you feel,

183
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,759


184
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,506
- Jesse, this is <i>my</i> daughter,
Zibhy.

185
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,565
. HO)'-

186
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,440
- Hi.
Hello.

187
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,911
- Peter, should we follow you?

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,641
- If you think that's wise.

189
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,242
- And he's like, "I had it
up to here with America

190
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,414
and its repressive, regressive,
fascist,“ whatever.

191
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,946
- I sound like that'?
That's how I sound?

192
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,117
- You do.
You sound like that

193
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,524
And he gets up in front
of the class.

194
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,289
He says, 'I ju?-l couldn't
take it anymore,

195
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:47,288
so I picked up my life,
and I moved to France."

196
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,460
- This is being ludicrously
misreported, by the way.

197
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,799
<i>-</i> So I raised my hand.

198
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,633
I said, 'Wait, wail, wait,
wait, wail, Peter.

199
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,435
"You're telling us you got
so angry at this country

200
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,307
that you moved to France?"

201
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,142
And Peter says, "Yeah.

202
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,272
Well, I had a Fulbright."

203
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,975
[laughter]

204
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,313
- Yeah, well, yeah,
if I told you

205
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,943
what this putz was like
when he was here,

206
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,146
he'd run out of the room crying.

207
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,415
- That's probably true.

208
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,320
- Well, what were you like
when you were here?

209
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,554
- I wan very handsome,
wasn't I?

210
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,855
Am I remembering that correctly?

211
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,123
- No, I don't remember that.

212
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,324
But what I do remember
is you being a real jerk

213
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,321
in your parents
on graduation weekend.

214
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,698
He didn't want to leave.

215
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,963
- Ifs true.

216
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,836
And I blamed my parents,
weirdly, all four of them.

217
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,806
Like it was their fault
college was ending.

218
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,933
- Don'! do that to us.

219
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,102
<i>- No, I won't.
- She says that now.</i>

220
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,477
- So your parents told me
you're in the improv group?

221
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,640
- Yeah.

222
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,706
- How's that?

223
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,479
<i>-</i> We the best
I love it

224
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,780
- What do you love about it'?

225
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:45,347
- Um, I think I love
how terrifying it is

226
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,690
and haw you have in say "yes"
to everything.

227
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,683
- Uh, sorry,
what does that moan?

228
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,321
- Ifs, like, the only rule
of improv.

229
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,626
You can never say "no."

230
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,692
You have to say "yes"
and then add something.

231
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,260
Like, uh-like, look.

232
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,796
Um, okay, Mom, you and I

233
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,138
have been wandering
in the desert for days,

and we're about to die, okay'?

00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,272
<i>-</i> OK!!-

236
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:12,273
- Okay, and I say,
"Hand me that lemonade,“

237
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,051
So hand me that lemonade.

238
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,083
- Jesus, Susan, hand her
the goddamn lemonade.

Jesse, hand me that lemonade.

00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,235
- It doesn't make sense.

247
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,576
We're in the desert

248
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,048
I mean, where would we get
lemonade?

249
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,950
[indistinct conversations]

250
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,214
- It's great seeing you guys.

251
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,585
- So what was your major'?

252
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,056
- I was English
with a minor in history,

253
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,956
just to make sure
I was fully unemployable.

- Right.
<i>-</i> What about you?

255

- Drama.

256

I mean, not officially yet,

257
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,022
'cause my dad's not totally
thrilled with the idea,

258
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,761
so maybe also art history?

259
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,928
- I'm just happy you go to clan
occasionally.

260
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,029
I thought maybe you just
improvised all day long.

Have you ever thought
about that'!

- About what?

265
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,038
- How everything in life
is basically improvised?

266
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,342
There's no script.

267
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,374
We're just making this up
as we go.

00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,377
You liking it?

489
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,613
<i>-</i> Uh, yeah.

490
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,518
Il': my second time reading it,
actually.

491
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,680
<i>-</i> WWI.

492
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,711
That's impressive.

493
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,849
Ifs not short.

494
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,051
<i>-</i> Yeah, I know.

495
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,684
- You know, he said
the purpose of fiction

496
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,251
was to combat loneliness.

497
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,923
<i>-</i> That': good.

498
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,329
I never heard that.

499
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,389
- Yeah.

500
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,923
Well, on the other hand,

501
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,163
spending most of your time
with an 1,100-page book

502
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,103
tends to put a dent
in your social life.

503
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,198
- Yeah.

504
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:20,701
Loneliness simultaneously
increased and decreased.

505
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,542
. HO)'-

506
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,480
- What,
you guys know each other?

507
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,280
- Yeah, we had Symbolic Logic
first semester.

508
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,775
Zibby.

509
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,879
- Right.
Dean, hi.

510
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,617
- Hey.
<i>-</i> I'm Joan, by the way.

511
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,113
<i>-</i> OK!!-

512
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>- Hmm.</i>

513
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,619
Interesting guy.

514
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,790
- Yeah.

515
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,027
I can'! believe
he's even back here.

516
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,797
- Why?
What do you moan?

517
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,634
- He had a manic episode
last year.

518
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,936
Eventually, they look him
lo a hospital

519
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,808
and, I don't know,
calmed him down, I guess.

520
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,971
He's supposed to be, like,
the smartest guy ever.

521
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,641
- Everything okay?

522
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,117
- Yeah, everything's great.

523
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,608
[whispers]
I puked.

524
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,985
<i>-</i> On.

525
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,148
<i>-</i> That's gross.

526
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,623
Sorry, you did not need
to hear that

527
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,592
Come on, let's-let's walk.

528
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,631
My parents really liked you.

529
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,928
- Oh.
That': nice.

530
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,060
I like them.

531
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,594
You're really lucky
to have parents like that.

532
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,128
- Like what?

533
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,834
<i>-</i> Like, I don't know.

534
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,002
Around, first of all.

535
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,774
Still together so they
can fret over you as a team.

536
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,337
<i>-</i> Yeah, I guess.

537
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,010
I like them best when they're
not being so parental,

538
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:36,782
which is, like, 1% of the time.

539
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,449
Oh, I thought
of this great trick

540
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,685
for having them annoy me less.

541
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,851
Want to hear if?
- Okay.

542
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,690
- Okay, I decided
to treat my parents

543
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,161
like they're always drunk.

544
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,130
<i>- [laughs]
- No, really, it works.</i>

545
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,725
Any time they say something
irritating or offensive,

546
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,362
I'm just like,
"Oh, I can't get mad at them.

547
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,360
They're drunk.
It's not their fault."

548
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,636
And why should I take advice
from drunk people seriously?

549
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,539
- That's great.

550
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,476
- Do you like classical music?

551
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,036
<i>-</i> Yeah, sure.

552
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,208
- Okay, I took this
music survey claw last year.

553
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,047
Oh, my God!

554
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,019
It totally changed my life.

555
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,991
I'm really happy
I ran into you last night

556
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,755
<i>-</i> Yeah, yeah, mo too.

557
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,729
Ifs random.

558
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:23,196
Who was that guy?

559
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,724
. What guy'-’

560
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,293
- The-last night, that guy.

561
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:31,240
<i>-</i> Oh, his name is Eric.

562
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,506
- Erie

563
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,070
ls Eric your fella?

564
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,049
- Il?ll?hll
No.

565
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,315
No.

566
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:46,847
You know, I think I like almost
everything about this place

567
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,621
but the dude situation.

568
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,060
- Not great?

569
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,757
- No one, like, dates.

570
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:57,393
Everyone': so casual
about it all.

571
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,767
- Same as when I was here.

572
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,898
- Yeah.

573
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:07,435
I guess there's part of me
that's a little old-fashioned.

574
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,978
- Well, on behalf

575
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:19,615
of all current and former
18- to 22-year-olds,

576
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,285
I'd like to apologize.

577
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,056
Forgive us.

578
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,892
Seriously.

579
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,797
We know not what we do.

580
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,063
- [laughs]

581
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,132
- I think one of the things

582
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,368
I loved the most
about being here

583
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,070
was the feeling
that anything was possible.

584
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,308
It's just infinite choices
ahead of you.

585
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:47,273
You'd get out of school,
and anything could happen.

586
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,685
And then you do get out, and...

587
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,950
life happens, you know'?

588
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,423
Decisions gel made.

589
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:56,450
And then all those many choices
you had in from of you

590
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,325
are no longer really there.

591
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,921
At a certain point,
you just got to go,

592
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,489
"Oh, I guess
this is new its going down.

593
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:07,164
And there's just something
a little depressing about that.

594
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,471
- Well, don'! you think you're
romanticizing youth a bit much?

595
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,171
You know, 'cause it's
just as hard and annoying

596
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,704
lo be young an it is to be old,
I'm assuming.

597
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,149
Nut that you're old,
'cause, you know, you're not

598
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,679
- Look, I get the whole
“we're all equal" argument,

599
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,452
and it's kind of true,
but it's also kind of not true.

600
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:32,361
Like, okay, I feel different now
than I felt when I was here,

601
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:36,322
and I hate to break this lo you,
but so will you.

602
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,198
- So you're saying things suck?

603
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,295
I should prepare myself
for suckiness?

604
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,637
- No, a liberal arts education
solves all your problems.

605
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,972
- Thank God!

606
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,374
- Worth every penny.

607
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:53,016
- We should hug.

608
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,450
- What?

609
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,316
- I mean, we could keep talking,

610
00:27:56,308 --> 00:28:01,314
but I think it would be better
if we hugged.

611
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,520
Come on.

612
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,892

- [laughs]

619
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,089
That's-l mean, I just mean
because I thought,

620
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,186
with the greenhouses”.

621
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:42,427
- Hey, before you go, I thought
you might like these,

622
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,867
'cause I don't really need 'em
anymore and, uh, here.

623
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,666
Ooh.
Look at this one.

Huh?
No?

- Nah.

- Oh, please,
that's a great shirt

628

You know the trouble I unused
in this shirt'!

629

- I can only imagine,

00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,110
- You gut no taste
on top of everything else.

631
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,982
Oh, my God,
what a beautiful shirt

632
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,612
Not giving it to you anyway.
- All right

1128
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:43,777
You love college so much, right?

1129
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,213
Isn't it all about understanding
different points of view'?

1130
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,944
- It's also about
developing taste.

1131
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:49,781
- That was snobby.
You're a snob.

1132
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:50,945
<i>-</i> No, I'm not

1133
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,113
<i>-</i> Yea, you are.

1134
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,611
You think it's cool
to hale things.

1135
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,453
And it's not.
It's boring.

1136
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,719
Talk about what you love,

1137
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,624
and keep quiet
about what you don't

1138
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,754
- Look, I know how this sounds,
but trust me.

1139
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,458
This is a big deal, okay'?

1140
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,931
This country is in bad shape,

1141
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,492
and it has to do,
in large part, I think,

1142
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,562
with people liking things
that are very, very bad.

1143
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,402
- But according to you,

1144
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:13,773
Why are you the one who gets
to decide what's good and bad?

1145
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,471
And do you only want
to surround yourself

1146
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,411
with people who've read
the same books as you?

1147
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:20,644
- I guess we're gonna have to
move on to a specific example-

1148
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,852
- Where are you?

1149
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,149
- What do you mean?

1150
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:28,145
<i>-</i> I mean, you are somewhere,

1151

but it's not here.

00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,221
<i>-</i> No, I'm-l'm here.

1153
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,491
<i>-</i> So why are we spending
all our time

1154
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,055
having a stupid argument
about a book?

1155
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,002

I don't know'

<i>-</i> No, how old are you?

1165

- It': none
of your goddamn business.

1166
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:31,179
Do you know how old
I feel like I am?

1167
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,882
19.

1168
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:38,223
Since I was 19,
I have never felt not 19.

1169
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:42,061
But I shave my face,
and I look in the mirror,

1170
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,395
and I'm forced to say,

1171
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:46,561
"This is not a 19-year-old
staring back at me,“

[sighs]

1173
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,939
Teaching here all these years,

1174
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:55,239
I've had to be very clear
with myself

1175
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,542
that even though I'm surrounded
by 19-year-old:

1176
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,071
and I may have felt 19,

1177
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,380
I'm not 19 anymore.

1178
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,318
You follow me?

1179
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:07,781
- Yeah.

1180
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,154
- Nobody feels like an adult.

1181
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,494
It's the world's dirty secret.

1182
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:30,935
- How perfect is the universe?

1183
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,380
- You're still here?

'cause you look like
you could use a friend.

1186
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:46,189
Did you know there's so many
preservatives in the food we eat

1187
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,890
that they're finding
it's taking longer

1188
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,991
for our bodies to decompose
once we die?

1189
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,296
- No way.
Really?

1190
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,464

- Please.

1193
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,940
- Caterpillars-
give me my hat.

1194
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,747
They're just scouting along,
right,

1195
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,685
being caterpillars.

1196
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:14,781
At some point, these cells
show up called imaginal cells.

1197
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,485
Scientists don't know
where they come from

1198
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,823
or why they appear,

1199
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,227
but these imaginal cells show up
inside the caterpillar

1200
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,164
and say, 'Get psyched,
caterpillar!

1201

1202
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:26,998
- Mm-hmm.

1203
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,970
- And whit do all
the other caterpillar calla do

1204
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,961
when these imaginal cells
show up?

1205
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,565
- I have no idea.

1206
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:33,666
- They attack 'em!

1207
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,336
Try to kill 'em!

1208
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:38,336
They're like, 'Screw you,
imaginal cells.

1209
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,144
'We're happy
being a caterpillar.

Gel lost!“

1211
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:45,979
Bu! eventually,
the imaginal cells keep growling

1212
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,855
and overtake the destiny
of the caterpillar

1213
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:51,189
and will it into this cocoon.

1214
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,058
And then guess
what happens next.

1215
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:56,030
- The caterpillar tum:
into a butter?y.

1216
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,023
- The caterpillar
turns into a butterfly.

1217
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,194
- That's awesome.

1218
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,533
- I know it is!

1219
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,266
- Yeah, that's good.

1220
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,731
- And that is why there is
no reason to be afraid,

1221
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:11,736
because everything is okay.

1222
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:15,683
- Yeah, I don't know
if I believe that.

1223
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,984
- It has to be true.

1224
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,718
There can be no other way.

1225
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:29,020

if you're real.

I mean, seriously.

Whatever you believe.

01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:39,632
What are you drinking?

1231

But just because we screwed,
don't assume we're suddenly-

1450
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,778
what is it you kids say
nowadays?

1451

BFFs?

1452
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,445
- Yeah, that's not really-

1453

- I mean, what do we really know
about each other?

1454

You're a nonsmoker.
Congratulations.

1455

You're going to live
to be a hundred.

1456
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,782
But what does it matter
if your life is joyless?

1457
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,386
And it will be.
Trust me.

1459
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:44,022
- You're gelling your clothes
and you're leaving,

1460
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,966

- Good.

1467
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:58,771
I've taught at this school

1468

I've seen the emergence of

all these effete,
overarticulate man-boys

who never learned to toughen up.

1471

Don't be one of them,

1472

Go work with your hands.

1473

Too bad Norman Mailer's dead.

01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,162
You guy: would have been perfect
for each other.

1478

<i>-</i> I'm just confused how-

1486
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,944
I mean,
you're a tenured professor

1487
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,683
in one of the most prestigious
English departments

1488

in the country.

1489
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,555
That's not fulfilling?

1490
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,857
- Sit through a faculty meeting
at a liberal arts college,

1491
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,328
Mr. Young Person.

1492
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,661
I assure you, you will lose
all faith in humanity.

1493
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,894
- Okay, but what about
the classroom?

1494
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,731
There had lo have been
some joy there

1495
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:57,136
I mean, you were
such a good teacher.

1496

<i>-</i> Thank you.

1497
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,175
I like to teach.

1498
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,836
I used to love it.

1499
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,368
- What happened?

1500
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:08,315
- Life happened.

- Okay, I'm gonna need
a little bit more'

1502

- Well, that's all
you're gonna get.

1503
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:15,380
Unlike you, I'm not
from the 'let me tell you

1504
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:18,120
every sick, sordid detail
of my life" generation.

1505
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:19,718
I value discretion.

1506
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,752
I loathe self-pity.

1507
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,697
So let's just leave it at this:

1508
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:27,657
people are disappointing.

1509
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,397
- Yeah, it's just,
I would think-

1510
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,928
- Don't get comfortable.
<i>-</i> Sorry.

1511
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,166
I would just think

1512
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:34,573
that spending so much time
with those poems

1513
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:38,238
would make you more, you know,
optimistic and hopeful.

1514
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:39,611
- Nonsense.

1515
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:40,945
They were miserable men

1516
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,916
who were granted a few moments
of transcendence,

1517
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,407
and they had the talent
and foresight

1518
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:46,580
to grab pen and paper
and write it down.

1519
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,748
Byron was probably
the happiest of the lot,

1520
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:51,918
only because he put his dick
in everything.

1521
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,793
- This is the saddest evening
of my life

1522
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,092
- Get used to it.

1523
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:59,726
My advice to you is this:

1524
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:03,966
put some armor around that gooey
little heart of yours.

1525
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:14,547
- Well, at least
I appreciate the irony.

1526
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,813
I just had the least romantic
night of my life

1527
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,581
with <i>a</i> Romantics professor.

1528
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,465
For what it's worth,

1529
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,634
I meant everything I said
about your class.

1530
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:45,806
It opened something in me,

1531
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:48,805
and I'm grateful for it.

1532
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,910
And if my heart is gooey,

1533
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:55,821
you're at least partially
responsible for that.

1534
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:18,938
- So you're still uninspired
by admissions.

1535
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,811
- Yeah, pretty much.

1536
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,147
- No little Jesse Fishers
out there?

1537
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,710
- Well, if there are,
I'm not meeting them,

1538
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:29,679
- Well, maybe you're just not
recognizing them.

1539
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,817
Anyway,

1540
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,294
I do appreciate you coming by.

01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:35,694
I really do.

1542

Here's a tip:
it doesn't work.

1548

I say you're getting wise.

You worry about getting old?

gonna be okay.

Unless it's a criticism,

1773
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,803
like, "You're already
judgmental and racist.

01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,018
and you'll have a little belly,

1777
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:24,991
And when you want more coffee,
you'll say to the waitress,

"Could you warm this up
