00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:23,810
We're just two lîttle gîrls
From Lîttle Rock

2
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:29,326
We lîved on the wrong sîde
Of the tracks

3
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,888
But the gentlemen frîends
Who used to call

4
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,408
They never dîd seem to mînd at all

5
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:39,363
They came to the wrong sîde
Of the tracks

6
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:45,161
Then someone broke my heart
In Lîttle Rock

7
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:50,441
So I up and left the pîeces there

8
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:53,366
Lîke a lîttle lost lamb I roamed about

9
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:55,968
I came to New York and I found out

10
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:00,764
That men are the same way everywhere

11
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:07,124
I was young and determîned
To be wîned and dîned and ermîned

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:11,565
And I worked at ît
All around the clock

13
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:15,093
Now one of these days
In my fancy clothes

14
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:20,612
I'm goîn ' back home and punch the nose
Of the one who broke my heart

15

The one who broke my heart

16
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:27,009
The one who broke my heart
In Lîttle Rock

17
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,326
Lîttle Rock, Lîttle Rock
Lîttle Rock

18
00:02:57,453 --> 00:03:02,846
I learned an awful lot în Lîttle Rock

19
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:08,286
And here's some advîce
I'd lîke to share

20

Or short or tall

23

For a kîd from a small street
I dîd very well on Wall Street

26

Though I never owned a share of stock

27
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,608
And now that I'm known
In the bîggest banks

I'm a-goîn ' back home
And gîve my thanks

Dorothy, wait a minute.

34

Louie, ask Mr. Esmond to come
to our dressing room.

- Yes, Miss Blake.
- Why the rush? He won't run away.

- I know, but I can't wait.
- For what?

37
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,813
Didn't you notice?
His pocket was bulging.

38
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,805
It's a bag of gumdrops.

39
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:46,047
It was square, like a box for a ring.
I think he's got a present for me.

40
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:49,842
Only you can be on-stage
with a spotlight in your eye...

...and still see a diamond
in a man's pocket.

- Gee, that makes me all warm inside.

- Mr. Esmond!
- Is it the right size?

48
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:28,082
It can never be too big.
Do you think it's too small, Dorothy?

49
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:33,412
- It should have a highball around it.
- Does it fit your finger?

50
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:35,883
Yes, it fits perfect.

the happiest girl in the world.

- To each other?
- Of course. Who else to?

He'd rather shove him
down an elevator shaft.

you conduct yourself on this trip.

You don't have to tell me that.

Me too. I don't know
what I'll do without you.

I don't know what I'll do without you.

You can be a naughty boy sometimes.

00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:21,172
Note the ruby eyes.

301
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:26,003
No reason to run me down.
Jealous. I have a way with ladies.

302
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:31,566
It's that diamond mine of yours.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

303
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:36,807
Çheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
What say we sit down?

304
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:40,608
I understand you're an entertainer.
I'll bet you're good.

305
00:26:40,853 --> 00:26:44,004
Thanks. Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?

306
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:47,250
I do.
Are you interested in diamonds?

307
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:51,731
- Not particularly.
- You must be an extraordinary girl.

308
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:55,084
- Will you do me a favor, sir?
- Çall me Piggie.

309
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,006
- Do me a favor, Piggie?
- Anything.

310
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:03,526
Don't spread it around about your mine.
I don't want my friend to hear.

311
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,485
She doesn't care for diamonds?

312
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:10,608
I'm trying to avoid trouble.
Do not tell her about the diamonds.

313
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,730
Did you say "diamonds"?

314
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:16,608
Well, well, well!
By George, I must say!

315
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:21,165
No doubt about it, no sirree.
No doubt about it at all.

316
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,969
- Miss Lee, meet Piggie.
- Delighted! Delighted!

317
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:31,805
You did say "diamonds." I can tell.

318
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:36,211
I control the second largest mine
in South Africa.

319
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:41,481
But this lady has a friend
she doesn't want to know about me.

320
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,810
- I wonder why.
- Oh, no, you don't.

321
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:50,446
Having heard so much about you,
I expected you'd be much older.

322
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:55,926
Me? You don't say. By George!
Older than what?

323
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,532
The Pyramids.

324
00:27:57,733 --> 00:28:01,965
I say if a man isn't a certain age,
he isn't interesting.

325
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:04,209
Honey, lay off!

326
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:06,722
Bless my soul. Çare to dance?

327
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:11,688
I'd enjoy to dance.
Thank you ever so.

328
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,843
- Another drink?
- No, thanks.

329
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:21,411
- Need a program to tell the players.
- I want to know who the players are.

330
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:26,568
- Like, who just stole second base?
- My name's Malone.

331
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:31,005
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy.
Well, Mr. Malone?

332
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,802
You're the most attractive girl here,
so I came over.

333
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:41,208
- Flattery will get you anywhere.
- Then we haven't any problems.

334
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:44,485
I was wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.

335
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:49,767
- I had some business to attend to.
- Then this isn't a vacation?

336
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,732
Not entirely.
There's still a telephone.

337
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,606
- In fact, I just had some bad news.
- Oh?

338
00:28:55,813 --> 00:29:01,126
My best 2-year-old will never
run again. He's worth $40,000.

339
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,325
It's not the money.
This might've been good.

340
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,650
- You're not one of those?
- One of what?

341
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:10,845
The kind who tells a girl
about his money.

342
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,009
What's wrong with money?

343
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:17,411
Yes, I'm afraid you are.
Go whistle up a rope.

344
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:18,881
Wait...

345
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:22,369
I can't stand rich playboys
who think they...

346
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:27,567
Now wait a minute! I'm not that bad
all the time. Sometimes I'm very nice.

347
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,373
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

348
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:33,212
So you're half sweet, half acid.

349
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:36,610
- Please, I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

350
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:41,369
I got some bad information.
Now that I've put my foot in it...

351
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:45,885
...I remember it wasn't you they were
talking about, but your friend.

352
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:49,210
- Lorelei.
- Or am I wrong again?

353
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,167
No, money is rather
a hobby of Lorelei's.

354
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,526
Oh, Piggie.

355
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:01,329
- You're worried about her.
- You're very observing.

356
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,364
Am I forgiven?

357
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:06,452
Çonsidering the man shortage
on this craft...

358
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:10,168
Good. We'll start all over again.
I promise that l...

359
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,011
We're gonna be interrupted.

360
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,732
We had a jolly time.

361
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:19,485
- Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggie.
- How do you do?

362
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:25,290
Piggie is the super-best dancer.
So light on his feet.

363
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:29,406
- I was sure he would be.
- You're trying to flatter me.

364
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:32,252
LORELEl: What's the matter?
- My wife.

365
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:36,128
- I thought it was his mine.
- Won't you join us?

366
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,689
- I just have.
- May I present Miss Lee?

367
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:43,050
- Miss Shaw, Mr...
- Malone.

368
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:47,485
- A pleasure, I'm ever so sure.
- Thank you.

369
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:50,412
We're having a jolly time.

370
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:55,403
Lady Beekman, that's the most
beautiful jewelry I've ever seen.

371
00:30:56,613 --> 00:31:01,607
I'm proud of the earrings. Heirlooms.
Been in the family for ages.

372
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:05,362
You'd never know it.
They look just like new.

373
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:11,128
You might be interested in my tiara.
I always have it with me.

374
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,483
Afraid to leave it in my room.

375
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:19,370
- But not afraid to show it to Lorelei?
- Stop. She won't know you're teasing.

376
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:25,123
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?

377
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,769
All blue stones.
Çozy little job, what?

378
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:32,323
- May I just hold it for a minute?
- Of course.

379
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,087
- How do you put it on?
- It goes on your head.

380
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:44,084
- You must think I was born yesterday.
- There's no other explanation.

381
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:49,327
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. It's a tiara.

382
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:55,608
You do wear it on your head! I love
finding new places to wear diamonds.

383
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,726
Excuse me, dear.
Miss Lee has promised me this dance.

384
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:03,130
We've got to dress for dinner.
We must go.

385
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,893
Well, all right. Au revoir.

386
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,165
A very pleasant au revoir to you.

387
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,891
My tiara. Thank you.

388
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,852
Poor fella. Two-to-one
she locks him in her closet.

389
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,807
- I'd be grateful if she did.
- I think he's cute.

390
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:27,605
You know very well what I mean.
You and that... What are you doing?

391
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:33,166
Just testing. Wonder what I'll
wear it with. How does it look?

392
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:36,171
Exactly like trouble.

393
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:47,607
I told the coalition leader that we
need a man who can do something about...

394
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:53,526
Finish your story, dear.

395
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,332
Your table, madame.

396
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:20,210
Good evening, Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Çrossley. Mr. Franklin.

397
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:23,561
- Mr. Mason. How do you do?
- Mr. Brooks.

398
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:24,768
How do you do?

399
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:28,409
- Is Mr. Spofford here?
- No, but this is his chair.

400
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:32,612
- You're here, Miss Lee.
MASON: Miss Shaw, you're here.

401
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:37,284
- Çould my friend have your seat?
- But of course.

402
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:39,723
She gets sick if she rides backwards.

403
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:42,766
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

404
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:49,771
- How are we at the same table?
- I was assigned this seat.

405
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:54,205
- How much did it cost?
- I can't tell. You'd get conceited.

406
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:56,728
Enjoying the trip, Mr. Franklin?

407
00:33:56,933 --> 00:34:01,131
How many times have you crossed?
Isn't it Ionely on the ocean?

408
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,484
I just adore conversation, don't you?

409
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:08,322
- Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.
- Oh.

410
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:12,765
Dorothy. Pardon me for whispering.
Try to make a good impression.

411
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,048
Okay.

412
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:18,764
Right this way, sir.
Mr. Henry Spofford.

413
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,411
- Hello.
MEN: Hello.

414
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,609
Hello. Hello.

415
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:26,970
Well, are you traveling by yourself?

416
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:30,165
No, I've got a valet,
a tutor and a trainer.

417
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:36,761
Well, having heard so much about you,
I expected you to be much older.

418
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:40,966
I'm old enough to appreciate
a good-Iooking girl.

419
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:44,404
This promises to be quite a trip.

420
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:47,963
Personally, I don't intend
to miss a meal.

421
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,368
How am I doing?

422
00:34:56,893 --> 00:35:01,364
- There's a place.
- Ernie, will you get some cigarettes?

423
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:10,205
I can't get over that passenger list.
Çalling a young boy "mister."

424
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:13,723
A girl could waste
a whole trip to Europe.

425
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,083
Think we better give up the idea?

426
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,723
If he were 16,
you could marry him in Tennessee.

427
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:24,290
- Drinks seemed like a good idea.
- You're a dear boy.

428
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:28,486
- What's your line, Mr. Malone?
- My line?

429
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:33,409
I tell a girl she has hair
like a tortured midnight...

430
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:36,770
...lips like a red couch
in an ivory palace...

431
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:42,001
...and I'm Ionely.
Then I generally burst into tears.

432
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,966
- Very seldom works.
- You idiot.

433
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:49,411
- What do you do for a living?
- Oh, that kind of line.

434
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:53,447
Nothing, I'm afraid.
Just clip coupons.

435
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:57,971
- Çoupons. That's like money, isn't it?
- Very similar.

436
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:03,088
I'm so pleased. Dorothy's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.

437
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:04,408
No taste?

438
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:07,411
No, I'm a hobo collector.
I might find room for you.

439
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:11,162
- She's joking.
- I hope not, I'm counting on it.

440
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:15,008
- Some people don't get her jokes.
- I'm gonna try.

441
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:19,684
Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend
a girl ever had.

442
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:24,125
She'll make a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.

443
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,325
- I've got to be going.
- Going? Where?

444
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:31,208
Don't worry.
I'm only concerned about you two.

445
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:33,921
There's a wonderful moon out.

446

There you are.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?

447
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:42,812
I'd love to. If you hadn't asked me,
I was going to ask you.

Really? Well, by Jove!
I say, will you excuse us?

- Very well.

450
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:00,482
I mean when we were talking
about the moon.

451
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:04,083
It reminded you of a moon
in Çoney Island.

452
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:06,727
Çould have been the same one. Why?

453
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,003
I remember I was wondering...

454
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:12,967
...what a rich man like you
were doing in Çoney Island.

455
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,122
Oh, well...

456
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:18,969
I rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.

It's not all his fault.

No, I...

Just what did you mean
by that remark?

466

coconut shells ward off the snakes.

- Before that.

I'll help you for two reasons.

Never mind the reasons.

534
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:29,763
The first is, I'm too young
to be sent to jail.

535
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:34,603
The second is, you've got

Look, someone's coming.

No cause for alarm, my dear.
It's purely medical.

01:23:45,413 --> 01:23:50,248
I don't have my driver's license
with me, but take my word for it.

1046
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:54,771
Look, that's I.
See my name?

1047
01:23:55,373 --> 01:23:56,886
FATHER: Oh...

1048
01:23:57,253 --> 01:23:59,687
I'm too old for this sort of thing.

1049
01:23:59,893 --> 01:24:02,646
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

1050
01:24:02,853 --> 01:24:06,926
How do you think I feel with
thousands of Lorelei Lees around me?

1051
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:09,931
But you're not marrying any of them!

1052
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:13,842
I love her. I love her very much.
I've never felt...

1053
01:24:14,053 --> 01:24:18,888
Oh, shut up! Young lady,
you don't fool me one bit.

1054
01:24:19,093 --> 01:24:22,290
I'm not trying to.
But I bet I could.

1055
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:26,890
You might convince this jackass,
but you'll never convince me.

1056
01:24:27,093 --> 01:24:31,928
- That's too bad. I do love him.
- Çertainly. For his money.

1057
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,124
No! Honestly.

1058
01:24:34,413 --> 01:24:39,168
You expect me to believe that you
aren't marrying him for his money?

1059
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:42,729
- It's true.
- Then why do you want to marry him?

1060
01:24:42,933 --> 01:24:47,006
- I want to marry him for your money.
- There!

1061
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,006
That's why we need his consent, silly.

1062
01:24:51,213 --> 01:24:55,570
We're getting down to brass tacks.
You admit you're after money.

1063
01:24:55,813 --> 01:24:59,203
No, I don't.
Aren't you funny?

1064
01:24:59,413 --> 01:25:03,645
Don't you know that a rich man
is like a pretty girl?

1065
01:25:03,893 --> 01:25:06,646
You don't marry her
just because she's pretty.

1066
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:09,242
But, my goodness, doesn't it help?

1067
01:25:09,453 --> 01:25:13,492
Would you want your daughter
to marry a poor man?

1068
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:18,164
You'd want her to have the most
wonderful things in the world.

1069
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:21,012
Why is it wrong for me
to want those things?

1070
01:25:21,253 --> 01:25:23,164
Well, I concede that...

1071
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:27,252
Say, they told me you were stupid.
You don't sound stupid.

1072
01:25:27,493 --> 01:25:31,645
I can be smart when it's important.
But most men don't like it.

1073
01:25:31,853 --> 01:25:35,482
Except Gus.
He's interested in my brains.

1074
01:25:35,733 --> 01:25:40,443
- No, that much of a fool he's not.
- You've changed your mind?

1075
01:25:40,693 --> 01:25:46,245
- I just don't know what to tell you.
- Daddy?

1076
01:25:46,493 --> 01:25:49,246
Not you. I guess I mean "Sonny."

1077
01:25:49,493 --> 01:25:52,769
Give me three minutes
alone with your father.

1078
01:25:52,973 --> 01:25:55,726
- Run along, darling.
- Yes, dear.

1079
01:25:55,933 --> 01:25:58,447
Now, about what we were speaking.

1080
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:02,805
There's a great deal to consider.
I just can't answer...

1081
01:26:13,573 --> 01:26:16,610
Please, take your places.

1082
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:34,005
Remember, on your wedding day
it's all right to say yes.

1083
01:26:38,093 --> 01:26:44,407
We're just two lîttle gîrls
From Lîttle Rock

1084
01:26:45,693 --> 01:26:51,882
And we lîved on the wrong sîde
Of the tracks

1085
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:57,046
But at last we won the bîg crusade

1086
01:26:57,293 --> 01:27:02,731
Looks lîke we fînally made the grade

1087
01:27:07,053 --> 01:27:17,042
Square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don 't lose theîr shape

1088
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:22,805
Dîamonds
Dîamonds

1089
01:27:22,973 --> 01:27:29,003
Dîamonds are a gîrl's...
Dîamonds are a gîrl's...

1090
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:33,610
... best frîend
