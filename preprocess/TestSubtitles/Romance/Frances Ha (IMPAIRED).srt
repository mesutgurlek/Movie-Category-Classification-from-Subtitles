Just kidding.
Um, it's kind of hard to explain.

760
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,339
Because what you do
is complicated?

761
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,591
Uh, because I don't really do it.

762
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,304
- I am a dancer, I guess.
- Mm.

763
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,477
Frances and I
are in the same company.

764
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,851
But Rachel's in the main company.
I'm an apprentice.

765
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:14,072
Hopefully the touring company soon.
I have a meeting with Colleen on Monday.

766
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,190
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

767
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,568
But things are really great.

768
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,946
Rachel and I have
a really cool apartment.

769
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,745
Or Rachel does,
and I'm staying there for six-ish weeks.

770
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,959
- Five.
- Right. Five. Yeah.

771
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,999
But everything's
up in the air right now.

772
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,919
I like being alone.

773
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,087
- I just got back from Sacramento.
- Oh!

774
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,836
Oh, Andy and Janelle
just got back from Paris.

775
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,635
Six and a half hours
on a plane with a baby.

776
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,429
Won't be doing that again soon.
But it was heaven.

777
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,644
Do you ever get to Paris?

778
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,309
Uh, no, not really.
Kind of, once.

779
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,065
Actually, no.
What's that museum...

780
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,059
with the escalators and tubes?

781
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,652
- The Pompidou.
- Yeah!

782
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,646
They have this great place
in the Sixth.

783
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,692
- Oh, it's a little pied-a-terre.
- Literally?

784
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,818
Yeah, but it's
a really special place.

785
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,829
Yeah, it's just so hard
to get to spend any time there...

786
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,457
since I got the job at the Journal...
and the baby.

787
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:10,454
I'd love to go to Paris.
I'll bet it's magic.

788
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,455
Uh, my friend
from college, Abby...

789
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,459
who moved there with her boyfriend
because he works at a bank...

790
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,213
in college, she was one
of the top five group of friends...

791
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,807
but then Zoe became closer
to the group and Abby moved...

792
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,470
to the outer circle.

793
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,936
Sophie and Abby
never totally got along...

794
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,600
<i>and then she started
dating Paul...</i>

795
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,224
who I always thought
would've dated any of us...

796
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,727
but... he ended up with Abby.

797
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,281
Well, if you're ever there...

798
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,867
- we like for it to be used.
- Yeah.

799
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,950
I don't see myself
getting there super soon...

800
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,699
but... thanks, thanks.

801
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,246
That is a very sexy dress.

802
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,329
Fuck, I sound
like a gay grandmother.

803
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,583
Frances, I think you know
one of my colleagues at Goldman -

804
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,630
Reade “Patch” Krause.

805
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,721
Yeah, I know Patch.
“'Sup, brah?”

806
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,007
That's him.
Nobody is better...

807
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,600
at anticipating inflection points
than Patchy.

808
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,438
His girlfriend, Sophie, and I
are the same person with different hair.

809
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,683
Not really.
We went to college together...

810
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:17,733
and we used to take the train into the
city on weekends and make bad decisions.

811
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,276
- You got pregnant?
- What? No.

812
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,992
She's a great lady.
I really like her. So smart.

813
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,737
Yeah. I mean - Yeah.

814
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,746
I mean, we're all smart.

815
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,366
Yeah, but she's...
book-smart smart.

816
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,710
She's actually not.
She doesn't really read...

817
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,955
except for work,
which is the funny thing.

818
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,548
She seems like
she reads a lot to me.

819
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,259
- I read way more.
- Mm-hmm.

820
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:44,347
I don't know why I'm shit-talking Sophie.
She's basically the best person I know.

821
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,927
- It's kind of crazy though, right?
- Mm, yeah.

822
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,395
- Which part?
- Japan.

823
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,105
Japan?

824
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,522
Yeah, they're moving to Japan
in a couple of weeks.

825
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,696
- Wait. What?
- Patch got transferred.

826
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,441
<i>it's a really cool position.
He's gonna be...</i>

827
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,781
<i>the director of research
for all the Asian markets.</i>

828
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,825

<i>Indefinitely.</i>

830

at Random House.

831
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,914
She quit.

832
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,457
Oh.

833
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,207
<i>[Andy] The Pilates thing is nice.
You feel so good.</i>

834
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,050
<i>[Rachel] Frances and I do
a lot of yoga. It"s good for dance.</i>

835

<i>It's fun to go with somebody,
to have a friend to go with.</i>

836
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,682

than I am in pictures.

837

<i>[Frances]
Nadia ?</i>

838
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,929
I want this one moment.

839
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,600
It's - it's what I want
in a relationship...

840
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,979
which might explain
why I am single now. Ha, ha.

841
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,105
It's, uh -

842
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,779
It's kind of hard lo -

843
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:50,322
it's that thing
when you're with someone...

844
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,824
and you love them
and they know it...

845
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,834
and they love you
and you know it...

846
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,999
but it's a party...

847
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,836
and you're both talking
to other people...

848
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,296
and you're laughing
and shining...

849
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,340
and you look across the room...

850
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,555
and catch each other's eyes...

851
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,345
but - but not because
you're possessive...

852
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,686
or it's precisely sexual...

853
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,687
but because...

854
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,645
that is your person
in this life.

855
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,236
<i>And ifs funny and sad,
but only because...</i>

856
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:26,153
this life will end,
and it's this secret world...

857
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,241
that exists right there...

858
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,454
in public, unnoticed,
that no one else knows about.

859
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,034
It's sort of like how they say
that other dimensions exist...

860
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,750
all around us, but we don't have
the ability to perceive them.

861
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,507
That's -

862
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,878
That's what I want
out of a relationship.

863
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,639
Or just life, I guess.

864
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,383

00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,868
I don't care.
I was just kidding.

Yes.

- Okay.

That's wonderful.
I'll get you the information.

Good for you, kid.
I lived there for a year.

- Yep. I was there when Serge Gainsbourg died.

- Weren't you, like, eight?

- I have so much to do.

Proust is pretty heavy.

- It's worth it, I hear.

- You have a pond?

I found something out
about Walden's Pond:

01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,782
It was five minutes
from his mom's house.

But I went here when I was younger.

Weird. For some reason, I thought
you had to be in college to do this.

1097
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,917
Nope. I just wanted
to get out of the city...

1098
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,421

program, so she hooked it up.
