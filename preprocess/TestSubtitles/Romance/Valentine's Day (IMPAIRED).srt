No. For leaning on my shoulder? Come on,
it's the least I could do. A 14-hour flight.

301
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,503
Oh, God, that's better.

302
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,881
-You on active duty?
-Yes, sir.

303
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,302
-Two bars. Is that lieutenant?
-Two bars is the captain.

304
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,266
You have a loved one in L.A.?

305
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,187
Well, l'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

306
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,277
How long--? How long has it been
since you've been home?

307
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,612
Eleven months.

308
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,739
And how long do you get to stay?

309
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,366
Just till tomorrow.

310
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:31,080
Wow. Fourteen-hour flight both ways
just for one night.

311
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,207
Wow, that's romantic.

312
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,168
You're a romantic.
I mean, that's quite a gesture.

313
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,339
That's commitment.

314
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,763
You on Facebook?

315
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,562
WOMAN: l need some chrysanthemums.
-What? You should speak English.

316
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,732
-l had to learn when l came.
-Chrysanthemums and calla lilies.

317
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,942
-l don't know what it--
-Michael, calm down.

318
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,736
What language do you speak in?

319
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,614
I used to speak Bulgarian,
but I'm an American citizen now.

320
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,701
Does anybody here speak English
with a Bulgarian accent?

321
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,120
MAN: Over here. l do.
-There he is.

322
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,748
Bulgarize away. Here we go.

323
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,208
There she is!
The future Mrs. Reed Bennett!

324
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,377
MlCHAEL:
Oh, chrysanthemums.

325
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,755
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, baby.

326
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,965
Hello, fiancée.

327
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,344
It sounds weird. Have you said it yet?
Nikki, take over for a minute.

328
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,720
Come this way.

329
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,057
Wait, these are for you.
I knew they were for somebody.

330
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,185
-Sarah, have you met my fiancée?
-Hi, Morley.

331
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,856
-Hi.
-l just like saying it. l feel so grown-up.

332
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,441
MlCHAEL:
Next, please!

333
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,071
-Look what you forgot.
-See, that is....

334
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,532
Is one empty hand.

335
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,702
Oh, yeah.

336
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,079
Don't be mad.

337
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,289
Mad? Why would I be mad?
I'm concerned.

338
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,042
Well, just....

339
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,837
Do you have any idea what it would be
like at work today if l wore that thing?

340
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,633
-l mean, people will be asking me--
-"Where'd you get the big ring?"

341
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,720
You know, "How many bridesmaids?"
And, "How did he do it?"

342
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,474
-"Gonna have kids? How many?"
-Three.

343
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,228
-What?
-Two dogs, and maybe some chickens.

344
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,065
-We can talk about it. We don't have to.
-Sweetheart, l just think right now...

345
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,694
...it would be better if maybe
we could just keep it a secret.

346
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,947
MAN: Where are you from?
WOMAN: l am from Ruse.

347
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,409
All right, you guys can start
a Bulgarian village together. All right.

348
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,161
Oh, my God, look, there's the bride. Hi.

349
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,997
Listen, l called my BFF, Tony.
He is already on the dress.

350
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,334
He does all the gowns in Vegas.
Cher, Celine, Carrot Top.

351
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,837
This is going to be so much fun!
Oh, my God, it's--

352
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,589
-Breathe, breathe.
-l have to breathe.

353
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,799
Okay.

354
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,970
-See what I mean?
-Yep, l get it.

355
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,180
EDGAR:
So...

356
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,475
...love is the problem?

357
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,770
-Did you ever have it?
-Oh, yeah.

358
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,481
EDlSON:
How old were you when you got it?

359
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:07,194
Let's see. I'd just started working
at an architectural firm...

360
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:12,116
...and there was this beautiful young girl,
and she was studying to be an actress.

361
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,452
Was your heart kind of going:

362
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,540
Yeah. Yeah, just that way. lt went,
bumpada, bumpada, bumpada, boom.

363
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,584
You betcha. Just like that.

364
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,044
One day l got up the courage
to introduce myself.

365
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:28,716
I walk out, walked right up to her
and opened my mouth and...

366
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,051
-...nothing comes out.
-Nothing?

367
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:37,016
Nothing. Not a peep. But she's just waiting
for me to say something, l'm like a statue.

368
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,061
So finally she says,
"All right, l'll meet you here at 6:30."

369
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,189
She knew what you were going to say.

370
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:48,402
Yep. Yeah. She's been reading my mind
like that for 51 years.

371
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,655
The pretty girl was Grandma, right?

372
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,367
The pretty girl is Grandma, right?

373
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,163
-When are we gonna get there, Grandpa?
-Coming up to Moorpark.

374
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,918
Making a left turn right here.
What's Moorpark spelled backwards?

375
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,587
EDlSON: I don't know.
-"Kraproom."

376
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,715
-Grandpa.
-And don't say that in school.

377
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,092
WOMAN:
Hello, Siena Bouquet.

378

REED: l'll come with you on runs.
ALPHONSO: You got it.

379
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,472
REED:
But we gotta hustle. They're flying in now.

380
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,932
I'm always hustling, baby.

381
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,644
REED: No, no, no. Like, "hustle" hustle.
Like, no, don't dilly-dally, okay?

382
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,646
Let me tell you, l don't dilly-dally.

383
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,606
-l only upsy-daisy.
-All right.

[MICHAEL BOLTON'S "WHEN A MAN LOVES
A WOMAN" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

385
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,569
When a man loves a woman

386
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,780
Crazy businessman.

387
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,326
This guy, like, he wants to give
family discounts to his 30 cousins.

388
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,621
What is this?
What have you got going--?

389
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,417
Excuse me. Can I help you?

390
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,713
I'd like to send a dozen of those
to the best girl at my school.

391
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,883
-And this musical card.
-A dozen of those with thi--?

392
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,638
This-- lt's....

393
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,307
Okay.

394
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,896
-All right, where am I sending these to?
-Falcon Crest Elementary.

395
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,314
You can MapQuest it.

396
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,317
I actually know where it's at.
I got a friend that goes there.

397
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,779
Cool. During recess
would be the best time.

398
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,575
When you get there, just hand me
the flowers, and I'll do the rest.

399
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,287
-Okay?
-l'll be there. Thank you, sir.

400
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,164
What's up with the cutest kid in the world
coming in here?

401
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:28,919
And he shorted me. He just gave me, like,
1 5 bucks for a $55 arrangement.

402
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,673
-Could I please have my receipt?
-What, did you get audited last year?

403
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,882
I did.

404
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,886
They always get the good guys,
I'm telling you. Here.

405
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,972
Thanks.

406
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,437
JASON:
So, like, last night, amazing.

407
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,106
This morning,
she couldn't get away fast enough.

408
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,193
Any chance there was a little, shall we say,
disappointment on her part?

409
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,780
No. What? No. None.

410
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,032
At all.

411
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,370
-Well-- No, no, no. It was fine.
-Fine's not good enough, dude.

412
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,040
It was better than fine.
It was a solid A.

413
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,209
Minus. B plus, A minus. A minus.

414
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,587
I hate Valentine's Day.

415
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,591
Why can't these guys deliver their
flowers to their girlfriends themselves?

416
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,844
-Wait, what?
-They just dump them in the mailroom.

417
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,306
-l mean, if they don't wanna take the time to--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

418
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,351
-lt's Valentine's Day today?
-Hello?

419
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,102
Happy Valentine's Day.

420
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,856
Wha--? No, it's a Monday.
Valentine's Day always falls on a Thursday.

421
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,901
That's Thanksgiving, Hoosier-head.

422
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:38,238
-Really?
-You're 25. You thought that for 25 years?

423
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,659
Dude, he's from Indiana.
They only celebrate Love Your Cousin Day.

424
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,829
No, you're thinking of Kentucky. Of course
Liz was acting weird this morning.

425
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,374
You do have something planned
for tonight, right?

426
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:53,045
How could I have something planned for
tonight? l didn't even know until right now.

427
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,800
I can do my lunch break,
and l can do after 5?

428
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,094
Okay, great.

429
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,429
No, no, no.
I don't mind people with fetishes.

430
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,225
No, no, no, very creative people.
I gotta put you on hold, sorry.

431
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,976
Good morning.

432
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,607
-You're a strong, confident person.
-Good morning. Who are you?

433
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,694
I am Liz. l am one of the receptionists.
I'm subbing for Monica.

434
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,613
Oh, yeah, Monica,
because she wanted today off.

435
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,448
Shit, she has a life.

436
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,576
She had a funeral, which is a life,
I guess.

437
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,453
Well, Liz, l'm Paula.

438
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:31,083
I know they call me Bipolar Paula. Don't.
But you should know l'm in crisis.

439
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,752
-Okay.
-l don't wanna talk about it.

440
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,130
-Okay.
-lt has nothing to do with being alone...

441
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,340
-...on Valentine's Day.
-Of course not.

442
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:42,302
And everything to do with the client
in crisis.

443
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,265
-That sounds challenging.
-"Challenging"?

444
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,309
Gotta figure out if he still has
an athletic career.

445
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,396
If he doesn't, big fat problemo.

446
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,732
Well, l'm here
to help you solve that problem.

447
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,443

He says, "You know, he'll be right back--"

-This counter for oversized items.
-But you sell tickets, right?

916
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:54,780
That counter is for oversized people
this counter is for oversized items, okay?

Did he say was his current wife?
"l'm sending flowers to my current wife"?

He didn't have to. I could tell.

Like you could tell
that my old boyfriend Eddie was gay.

-Eddie was gay.
-Eddie is married with two beautiful kids.

965
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,041
-Eddie has a cat named Babs.
-You've tried to talk me...

-Personally, l don't see it.
-That's what l'm doing here.

976
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,408
Because apparently everyone
and their mother felt that way...

01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,493
...but nobody had the guts to tell me.

978
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,539
And now, I'm left with some stupid ring
and an empty closet...

979
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:37,669
...and an ache in my gut the size of Texas
because nobody told me.

We're not allowed to touch them.

01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:26,468
Sir, what kind of man takes his shoes off
and leave them off in public?

1790
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:49,965
--wonder where they come from.
And the mystery of it all.

1791
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:52,801
I used to actually put them together...

1792
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:56,513
...and practice new designs with them...

1793
01:54:56,681 --> 01:55:00,142
...and drop them off at a random doorstep
with a note saying:

1794
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,978
"Somebody out there loves you."

1795
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:05,355
Then l got to thinking...

1796
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:09,401
...what if they found out
that someone was me?

1797
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:12,237
Would they want me to be the one that
loves them?

1798
01:55:14,282 --> 01:55:15,490
I would...

1799
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:19,661
...want that.

1800
01:55:25,543 --> 01:55:27,210
Am l about to kiss my best friend?

1801
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,881
I hope so.

1802
01:55:41,017 --> 01:55:44,186
-Not great.
-That was awkward. Awkward.

1803
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,480
-Just not great.
-Yep.

1804
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:49,399
-But this is my old-- Where l get down.
-This is your spot.

1805
01:55:49,567 --> 01:55:51,360
You really helped me out. Susan is....

1806
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:54,446
-Giving me a chance to be number one.
KARA: Congratulations.

1807
01:55:54,614 --> 01:55:56,073
-Thank you, again.
-Thank you.

1808
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:58,158
-l'm gonna have to teach you.
-That is....

1809
01:55:58,493 --> 01:56:00,535
KELVlN: No-- I'll teach you this.
KARA: It's not natural.

1810
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:03,080
-Keep the fist-- It's a little--
-Thank you. Okay.

1811
01:56:03,247 --> 01:56:04,873
-No, no, no. Open your--
-Open.

1812
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:07,542
-You know what? l got a better idea.
-Not happening.

1813
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:17,010
Okay.

1814
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,596
That was nice.

1815
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:26,395
Well, you didn't exactly, like,
knock it out of the park.

1816
01:56:26,562 --> 01:56:30,482
Well, we've never practiced,
you have to admit.

1817
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:33,735
-Maybe we should practice, then.
-Okay.

1818
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:53,505
Mommy!

1819
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:05,976
You're so big.

1820
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:23,618
-Did you imagine it better or worse?
-l did.

1821
01:57:23,786 --> 01:57:26,038
-You imagined it better?
-l gave you more credit.

1822
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:27,247
-Really?
-Yeah.

1823
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:31,543
-Well, l hate that l'm not living up to my--
-Well, l don't know.

1824
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:48,977
MAN [ON RADlO]:
It's Romeo Midnight, one last time.

1825
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,939
Only 30 seconds left now
before it's just another day.

1826
01:57:53,107 --> 01:57:54,649
So count it down with me, lovers.

1827
01:57:54,817 --> 01:57:59,613
And raise your glass to those three
little words that we all want to hear:

1828
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:03,658
"Let's get naked."

1829
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:18,423
I never had a inkling before, man.
I didn't know what to do.

1830
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:21,009
I need to get to the airport.

1831
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,262
Stupid--!

1832
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:31,937
Vladimir! Let me get my whip.

1833
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:38,860
You know I always
wanna answer yours first--

1834
01:58:41,197 --> 01:58:42,823
Oh! Just-- Let's do--

1835
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:46,701
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1836
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:48,954
Shoot, we gotta get to the--

1837
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:52,874
It's stupid. Stupid seat belt!

1838
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:03,051
ELIZONDO: Oh, there's a--
Hold it, there's a finger in there.

1839
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:04,845
You on Facebook?

1840
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:08,390
I can't hear out of this ear.

1841
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:11,643
Are you guys on Facebook?

1842
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:14,729
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1843
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:17,941
All right. l gotta get to the airport.

1844
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:21,945
She's probably at the gate by now.

1845
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:23,155
How did you do that?

1846
01:59:29,704 --> 01:59:31,705
-Hey, l'm Taylor.
-And l'm Taylor. Too.

1847
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:34,583
Yeah. It's confusing. Yeah, we know that.

1848
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,251
Marker.

1849
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,211
REDMOND: If you look out the window,
ma'am...

1850
01:59:38,379 --> 01:59:39,921
...we're passing
the famous Rodeo Drive.

1851
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:43,466
-Have you ever shopped here?
-l did once, actually.

1852
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:47,721
But, big mistake. Big. Huge.
