I need to thank somebody
who's here tonight.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,910
When I had her at State--
That didn't sound right.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,285
I never had her.
I wanted her, but never had her.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,688
What I meant was
when I took her class.

7
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,251
I had the worst case
of writer's block in the world.

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,026
All I had were terrible ideas.
I hated them all.

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,033
I was just about
to drop the class

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:40,937
when she said something to me
that changed everything.

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,946
She said, "Terrible ideas
are like playground scapegoats.

12
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:51,177
Given the right encouragement,
they grow up to be geniuses."

13
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:55,118
She told me to take one,

Never in the nude.
Always in a thong.

Actually, if you knew Frances,
you'd know these are avoidance.

- How's the novel going?
- Not so well.

33
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,866
But the procrastination
is coming along fabulously.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,340
Soon it will breed
abject self-loathing,

35
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,276
and then I'll just become
a writing machine.

What about Tom?
How's his book going?

Fine.
He's home writing right now.

You know Tom?

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,218
I met him recently,
sort of by coincidence.

40
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,782
The other coincidence is that
you reviewed a book of mine.

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,761
I did?
Did I like it?

42

You didn't.

Well, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,299
I'm sure there were a lot
of other critics who loved it.

45
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,465
And I really hope
you didn't take it personally.

46
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,500
You called my lead character
"unrealistic."

47
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,505
I think bad reviews
should just be forgotten.

I would like to give you this.
It comes in peace.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,612
You said you just couldn't
get interested in a novel

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,920
where the protagonist was a guy

52
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,327
who spent all of his time living
out his horny teenage fantasies.

53
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:48,356
I just find that ironic.

54
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,335
Ironic. Why?

55
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,004

I've got some
unfortunate news for you.

60
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,753
I just got off the phone
with your husband's attorney,

61
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,482
and they're going to
pursue alimony.

62
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,527
How can we be talking
about alimony

63
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,996
when I hardly make enough money?

64
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,863
But you supported him
during the marriage.

65
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,060
Yes.

66
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,968
But while he was researching
and writing his book,

67
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,302
I worked while
he pretended to be...

68
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,309
Unfortunately,
this is just about the math.

69

He was having an affair.

70
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,210
California's a no-fault state.

71
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,010
His attorney indicated
your husband

72
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,277
would prefer an alimony buy-out.

73
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,582
Since you two were living
rather modestly,

74
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,249
I don't think
the number should be too bad.

75
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:24,490
They're probably talking about
something like $200,000.

76
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,054
I don't have that money.

77

Unfortunately, you do.

78
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,729
The house?

79
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,739
Its value went through the roof
since you bought it.

80
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,372
And renovated it
with my mother's money.

81
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,710
Well, it's all
community property now.

82
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:49,780
So he gets
half the house and alimony.

83
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,314
There's leeway, and we'll make
all the arguments we can.

84
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,918
But there is a bargaining chip.
He wants the house.

85
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,295
- He wants to keep living there?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,493
And if you let him have it,

87
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,732
you could end up with
a lot of money in your pocket.

88
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,434
I understand he wants it
pretty badly.

89
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,172
I'm sorry.
This is so surreal.

90
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,611
How would he even find the money
to buy me out of my half?

91
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,580
Oh.

92

there is a section of the Alps
called the Semmering.

It is an impossibly steep,
very high part of the mountains.

728
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,375
They built a train track
over these Alps

729

to connect Vienna and Venice.

730
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:28,381
They built these tracks before
there was a train in existence

that could make the trip.

732

bad review I've ever received.

1464
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:37,174
You're kidding.

1465
01:43:37,244 --> 01:43:38,176
I'm not.

1466
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:41,874
It helped me get to
my next book.

1467
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:45,713
Anyway, I've been traveling
around Tuscany.

1468
01:43:45,786 --> 01:43:48,482
Someone said that
you lived up here.

1469
01:43:51,725 --> 01:43:53,090
I'm Ed.

1470
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,218
Hi.

1471
01:43:54,294 --> 01:43:55,056
Hi.

1472
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:56,755
Hi.

1473
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,991
I'm Frances.

1474
01:43:59,066 --> 01:43:59,760
Hi.

1475
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:01,095
Hi.

1476
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:05,066
There's a wedding going on.
This isn't your wedding.

1477
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:08,198
That would be unfortunate.

1478
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:29,622
<i>They say they built</i>
<i>the train tracks over the Alps</i>

1479
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,029
<i>before there was a train</i>
<i>that could make the trip.</i>

1480
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,863
<i>They built it anyway.</i>

1481
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:37,665
<i>They knew one day</i>
<i>the train would come.</i>

1482
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:42,640
<i>Any arbitrary turning</i>
<i>along the way,</i>

1483
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:44,472
<i>and I would be elsewhere.</i>

1484
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,444
<i>I would be different.</i>

1485
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:50,915
<i>What are four walls, anyway?</i>

1486
01:44:50,984 --> 01:44:52,884
<i>They are what they contain.</i>

1487
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:55,717
<i>The house protects the dreamer.</i>

1488
01:44:55,789 --> 01:45:00,158
<i>Unthinkably good things can</i>
<i>happen, even late in the game.</i>

1489
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,524
<i>It's such a surprise.</i>

1490
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:32,000
