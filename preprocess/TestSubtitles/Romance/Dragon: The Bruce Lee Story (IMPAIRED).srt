Hey! Ease up, ease up.

331
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,134
We come in peace.

332
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,936
I'm Benny Sayles and
this is Tad Overton.

333
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,763
We just wanna
ask you a question.

334
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,440
That jujitsu stuff.
Can you teach us?

335
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,230
Can anybody do it?

336
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,489
I told you.
It's secret chink stuff.

337
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,905
Aaaaah!

338
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,283
Shit!

339
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,035
You okay?

340
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,791
Yeah, I'm all right.

341
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,079
You see that? You see how it flowed?
Be like water.

342
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,706
Water's the softest
stuff in the world,

343
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,666
but it can fit
into any container.

344
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,548
It seems weak,
but it can penetrate rock.

345
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,722
Be like the nature of water.

346
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,302
That's it for today.
Friday we spar, eh?

347
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,637
All right.
All right.

348
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,438
WOMAN: Hi, guys.
GUYS: Hi, Linda!

349
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,681
Hi. Hi.

350
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,932
Hi.

351
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,352
Um,
is this class only for guys?

352
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,478
'Cause it looks like
you only teach guys.

353
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,235
I teach whoever wants
to learn. Usually guys

354
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,028
are the ones
interested in fighting.

355
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,406
I've dated some
of these animals.

356
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,782
I've done plenty of fighting.

357
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,246
Ha ha.

358
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,579
But seriously,
I'd like to take lessons.

359
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,537
How about Friday? 3:00?

360
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,254
That's a date.

361
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,424
(CHUCKLES) No,
that's an appointment.

362
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,085
There's a difference.

363
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,594
See ya, Bruce.

364
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,429
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

365
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,131
GUYS: Bye, Linda.

366
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,435
BRUCE:
Emotion can be the enemy.

367
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,359
If you give in to emotion,
you can lose yourself.

368
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,987
Be at one with your emotions,

369
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,111
because the body
always follows the mind.

370
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,364
This is not about winning.

371
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,945
This is about perfection.

372
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,411
Then why all
those colored belts?

373
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,457
The only thing belts are good
for is to hold your pants up.

374
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,792
Okay, let's spar, shall we?

375
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,714
Urn, Linda?

376
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,296
Linda and...

377
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,433
(CHUCKLING) Linda and me, I guess.
Come, Linda.

378
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,634
Go get 'em, Linda.

379
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:26,927
(LAUGHS)

380
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,770
Remember reference? Okay.

381
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,184
Mm-hmm.

382
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,566
Set?

383
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,898
You're open.

384
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,316
I saw it coming.

385
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,371
Uhh!
Yeah!

386
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,829
There you go. You see? It isn't
size or strength that matters.

387
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,708
It's focus. You all have
a chi, an inner spirit.

388
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,961
Focus and then there's nothing
you cannot bend to your will.

389
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,084
Like you just saw.

390
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,886
Find your reference
points and square off.

391
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,721
Good.

392
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,724
I kinda like this position.

393
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,094
Then say "yes" to a date.

394
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,309
All of us?
No, just you and me.

395
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,189
Why?
Why?

396
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,021
Yeah, why? Why me?

397

Kiss him? At least.

Teach them the beauty of that strange
thing and they're no longer afraid,

become part of them.

Make it great.

Linda, I forgot something.

1454
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:10,408
What?

1455
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:14,332
I forgot to tell
you I love you.

1456
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:20,042
You know, I don't think you've
ever said that to me before.

1457
01:55:21,123 --> 01:55:23,421
Yeah,
but I meant it every day.

LINDA: Three weeks before the
opening of Enter the Dragon,

1463
01:56:02,122 --> 01:56:04,295
<i>the film that brought
him international fame,</i>

1464
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:07,253
<i>Bruce fell into
a mysterious coma and died.</i>

1465
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:08,970
<i>He was 32.</i>

1466
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:13,471
<i>Over 25,000 people attended
his funeral in Hong Kong,</i>

1467
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:16,895
<i>but I buried him back home in
America to be close to us.</i>

1468
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:21,187
<i>All these years later, people still
wonder about the way he died.</i>

1469
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:24,478
<i>I prefer to
remember the way he lived.</i>
