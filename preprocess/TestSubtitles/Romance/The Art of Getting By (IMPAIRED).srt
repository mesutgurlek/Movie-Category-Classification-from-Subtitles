GEORGE: <i>Since the dawn</i>
<i>of recorded history,</i>

2
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:47,236
<i>something like 110 billion human beings</i>
<i>have been born into this world.</i>

3
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
<i>And not a single one of them made it.</i>

4
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,749
<i>There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,288
<i>Roughly 60 million of them die</i>
<i>every year. 60 million people.</i>

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,850
<i>That comes out to about 160,000 per day.</i>

7
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,622
<i>I read this quote once when I was a kid,</i>

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>"We live alone, we die alone.</i>
<i>Everything else is just an illusion. "</i>

9
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,505
<i>It used to keep me up at night.</i>

10
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,137
<i>We all die alone.</i>

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,303
<i>So, why am I supposed to spend my life</i>
<i>working, sweating, struggling?</i>

12
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,636
<i>For an illusion?</i>

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,607
<i>Because no amount of friends,</i>

<i>no girl,</i>

15
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,650
<i>no assignments</i>
<i>about conjugating the pluperfect</i>

16
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,589
<i>or determining the square root</i>
<i>of the hypotenuse</i>

17
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,592
<i>is gonna help me avoid my fate.</i>

18
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,224
<i>I have better things to do with my time.</i>

00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,227
<i>Filtered water and pictures of you</i>

22
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,325
<i>And I'm not coming out until this is all over</i>

23
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,762
<i>And I'm looking through the glass</i>

24
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,233
<i>Where the light bends at the cracks</i>

25
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,645
<i>And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs</i>

26

<i>Silhouettes when our bodies finally go</i>

30
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
Do you have your work, George?

31
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,230
- No.
- Why not?

32
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,201
- I was depressed.

33
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,536
Oh, yes? Why was that?

34
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,210
Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.

35
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,679
We're all gonna die one day, George.

36
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
I don't think that's a reasonable excuse

37
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,683
for not completing
your trigonometry exercise.

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,448
Well, I was trying to.

39
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,591
I just couldn't shake
this awareness of my mortality.

40
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,390
Everything seemed meaningless,

41
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,253
- including the assignment, unfortunately.
- (STUDENTS LAUGH)

42
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,196
I want you to go to the principal's office

43
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,598
and find meaning in the homework.

44
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,137
Bring it to me completed
by the end of the period.

45
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,959
- You're late.
- I was so engrossed in my work.

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,731
- I haven't done anything.
- You've always done something.

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,169
You better go.

49
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,836
Bill.

50
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,640
Even though you have
off-campus privileges as a senior,

51
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,978
if you are seen
anywhere in the city smoking,

52
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,142
you have your privileges revoked.
Automatic probation.

53
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,847
Why are you telling me?

54
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,523
- You think I can't smell?
- You can smell all you want.

55
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
Shall we get down to business?

56
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,717
Yes, we shall.

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,864
In a way, your future depends
on the next few months.

58
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
Not just for college.

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,004
I mean, it sets the tone
for everything that follows.

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,239
Now, I know how you think and I know

61
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,901
you're thinking it's too late
and you're gonna be a fatalist

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,409
and let it all go to hell.

63
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,876
But, George, if you keep performing
the way you are,

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,917
forget about college,
forget about graduating, even.

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,409
So,

66
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
this counts as your official warning.
Suspension is next.

67
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,523
I thought probation was next.

68
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,989
Don't play the angles, George.
They won't work.

69
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,225
Neither do jokes.

70
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
I wasn't joking.

71
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,627
I know you're capable.

72
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,032
I have a real problem with motivating.

73
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,206
But I think I can do it.

74
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,871
I'll try.

75
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,074
All right, go.

76
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,411
And don't make me regret it.

DOUGHERTY:
Who's smoking up here?

78
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,481
George! What do you think you're doing?

79
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,194
Sorry. I...

80
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,395
I was having a tough day.

81
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,557
I guess the stress finally got to me,
Mrs. Dougherty.

82
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,896
George, why do you do these things?

83
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,632
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

84
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,434
Now, what do you mean by stress?

85
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,985
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,697
- I got an e-mail from your school.
- Oh, Jesus.

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,532
Some kind of academic probation?

88
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,465
Can I help you?

89
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,134
Can I get you a tutor
or a private college advisor?

90
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,607
If you don't get into a decent school,

91
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,581
then I don't know
how you're gonna get a job.

92
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,208
I have it under control.

93
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,950
Honey, if you don't get into
a decent college...

94
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,515
- I'm gonna go watch TV.
- No, you will not watch TV.

95
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,855
You will stay here

96
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,159
till we can come up with a plan
for getting you into college.

97
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,994
I had a hard day at school, I'm tired,

98
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,728
and I'm gonna go relax now
for half an hour.

99
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,073
Then I will do my work. Okay?

100
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,647
HARRIS: George?

101
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,810
The fuck are you doing?

102
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,146
I'm drawing.

103
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,953
Are you sketching your subject,
you little shit?

104
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
Yes.

105
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,631
- I don't have a subject, Harris.
- Why the heck not?

106
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,739
I don't know.

107
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,468
George, you're going to have to start
digging around in there,

108
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
so you can develop that talent of yours,

109
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,010
so you can start to use that brain of yours

110
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

111
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,982
So, figure out what you want to say,
and say it.

112
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,145
- Harris.
- Yes.

113
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,087
I don't have anything to say.

114
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,162
(SHOUTING) Find something!

115
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,875
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,740
- I'm Sally.
- I know.

117
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
Thanks for covering for me.

118
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
No problem.

119
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,779
Why did you?

120
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,512
I don't know.

121
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,157
You were doing something so renegade,

122
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,691
I thought you deserved to get away with it.

123
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,623
I run afoul of the authorities so often,

124
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,289
I figured I could handle it better than you.

125
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,496
You're really weird.

126
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,607
SALLY: So, why don't you ever
do your work?

127
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,766
There are so many more important things
to think about,

128
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
homework ends up seeming like
an afterthought.

129
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,507
ADD?

130
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,446
No, they tried everything.

131
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,314
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

132
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,218
Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker.

133
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,216
No, it's more like,
we're living in a dying time, you know?

134
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,094
I mean, you got global warming, wars,
terrorism, tsunamis.

135
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,258
- Okay...
- We're definitely on the downhill side.

136
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,299
So, what are we working towards?
What's the point?

137
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,037
I thought I had fears,
but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

138
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,041
- Pain, death.
- Not me.

139
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,006
I fear life.

140
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,101
(LAUGHS)

141
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,973
Do you have any friends, George?

142
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
I'm kind of a misanthrope.

143
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,719
Not a choice, just a fact.

144
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,764
Okay, handsome.

145
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,536
Mom! Jesus!

146
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,278
Hi, banana!

147
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,679
You wanna come up?

148
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,423
I'm sorry about that, chicken.
We had a really late night.

149
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,551
I think we got home right before
you left for school.

150
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,192
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

151
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,665
- Well, George.
- Hello, Mrs. Howe.

152
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,396
- What a genuine pleasure.
- Very nice to...

153
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,596
Sally, do you know
where our stemware went?

154
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,832
I'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

155
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,363
What do you want, George?

156
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,803
CHARLOTTE: And this was before
we left the sticks.

157
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,971
So, I cock one eye, look down,

158
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,877
expecting to see a giant water bug,

159
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,681
or a water moccasin, or...

160

How'd you end up in New York?

171
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,019
My mom had me when she was 16.
My dad was a truck driver,

172
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,387
and one day he took off
and never came back.

This rich guy from New York,
who owned a textile plant,

we were castaways and he was the ship.

177

But I ended up here,

eight years old, new school,
new friends, fancy new clothes.

179

My mom divorced him a year ago,

180

and now she's back on the singles scene
with a vengeance.

181
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,684
I do think I should
get some homework done, though.

182
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,522
I should get going then.
Got work to do myself.

183

Clearly. Anyone else?

219
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,981
My favorite part of the book
is how the town's layout is described

220
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,883
from the perspective of a bee traveling
from one side of town to the other.

It's so visual.

222
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,558
So, I guess what Hardy's doing
is aligning his point of view

not with an all-seeing God
but with an insect,

00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,699
Hi. I'm George. I'm your liaison.

319
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,606
Hey.

320
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,313
<i>My name is Dustin Heath.</i>

321
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
I'm a student. I was a student here.

322
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,717
I was in the class
with that terrifying old man over there.

323
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,653
Yeah, I'm an artist.

324
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,547
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing here.

325
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,150
Was a little hungover when they
called me and asked me to do this

326
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,321
and I said yes
just to get them off the phone.

327
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,729
I got the schedule in the mail
several days later

328
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,391
and I was a little embarrassed.

329
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,096
I'm not really established or anything.

330
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,600
I had my first art show a year ago,
which was good.

331
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,974
Got me this coat.

332
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,117
Well, let me show you
some of my work here.

333
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,813
I don't know,
sometimes people look at your stuff

334
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,085
and, you know,
they think it's really interesting

335
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,558
or they think it's bullshit,

336
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,755
and I don't know the difference.
I honestly don't.

337
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,931
You just, you know, hope not to be
fooling yourself, I guess.

338
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,837
This is the next slide, here.

339
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,940
Anybody have any questions?

340
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,646
I mean, nobody asked me any questions.
Did I just suck?

341
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,708
You were probably the only real,
non-full-of-shit person speaking today.

342
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,752
It felt like Nagasaki in there.

343
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,321
You were great.

344
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,523
Thanks, man.

345
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,621
Do you paint?

346
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,524
Yeah, I'd like to.

347
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,260
I just don't know what to paint.

348
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,730
Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?

349
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,002
Does that make me not a painter?

350
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,100
The fact that you struggle with it
is a really good thing.

351
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,240
But how can you call yourself a painter
if you don't paint?

352
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,714
- You like Morgan?
- Not really.

353
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,484
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

354
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,590
(CHUCKLES)

355
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,558
I don't think anybody does, George.

356
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,623
At least you admit it.

357
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:56,893
If you want, you can come to my studio
in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.

358
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,465
You sticking around for the holidays?

359
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,577
Nah. St. Bart's. Family yacht.

360
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,679
Oh.

361
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,275
Kidding. No plans.

362
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,116
You're a loser.

363
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,854
Well, me, too. We should hang out.

364
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,288
Maybe.

365
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,127
Merry Christmas!

366
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,108
- Hi.
- Hey.

367
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,805
Should we come in?

368
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,748
Please.

369
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,750
Hi.

370
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,128
SALLY: These are amazing.
How long did they take?

371
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,992
They're all kind of different, you know?

372
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,166
Each one goes through its own little
process of death and rebirth.

373
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,528
That one literally took me two hours.

374
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,334
They're all their own little entities, really.

375
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,310
SALLY: You live here, too?
DUSTIN: Mm-hmm.

376
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,980
It's so simple.

377
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,310
It's not about comfort, really, you know?

378
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,751
You... How old are you?

379
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,256
18.

380
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,158
(CHUCKLING) No.

381
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,499
Every time I think about a subject,

382
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,626
or even try to visualize an image of
what I think I should paint,

383
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,262
I just feel like I'm full of shit,

384
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,603
like I'm trying to be something I'm not.

385
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,336
George, this is who you are.

386
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,004
This stuff is wonderful, man.
It really is. It's fantastic.

387
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,742
Really? No, they're just doodles,
you know, immature crap.

388
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,045
No, man.
This is what you should be painting.

389
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,815
At least until you evolve into
something else, you know what I mean?

390
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,390
But you gotta exercise the muscle

391
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,527
even if you're not feeling it,
you know what I mean?

392
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,188
You just... You gotta do it
or else it'll never happen.

393
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,462
Hey, man, by the way,

394
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,437
very nice work.

395
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,671
- Huh?
- Very nice work.

396
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,475
Oh.

397
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,339
Well, you guys are together, right?

398
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,679
No.

399
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,545
I'm sorry. That was stupid.
I shouldn't have said anything.

400
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,853
No, not at all. We're not together.

401
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,489
You like her.

402
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,818
You should like her, if you don't.

403
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,856
I'll leave that alone.

404
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,098
- That was so cool.
- Uh-huh.

405
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,701
I mean, he's amazing. Really talented.
Don't you think?

406
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,975
A little derivative.
I'm not sure he's the real deal.

407
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:35,416
Really? He seemed like it to me.
I mean, he's a mentor to you now.

408
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,489
- Aren't you psyched?
- I think he's a bit of a blowhard.

409
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,057
SALLY: (LAUGHS) You're so weird.

410
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,353
Did he say anything about me?

411
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,727
Nope.

412
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,071
- Did you read the Book Review?
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,339
New book about the M-1 tank. Can't wait.

414
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,505

but he'd come back every so often.

He roared up on his motorcycle,
took me out alone.

568

We had pancakes with chocolate syrup
at a diner, at night.

But we couldn't be more different.
I think he's a little disappointed.

575
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:49,090
I spent some time in Tokyo with him
when I was seven.

576
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,693
He was running a company there,
working 12, 14 hours a day.

577
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,561
So, I had this full-time Japanese
babysitter who didn't speak English.

578
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,895
We couldn't understand each other at all.

579
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,795

she ran out of things to do with me

most likely gonna get worse.

I'm a free-thinking individual

643
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,633
who chooses not to be engaged
in this discussion.

I'm sorry, Jack.
I need to be left alone right now.

I just can't do it right now.

I'm going through something.

655

- How are you?

00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,617
Yeah, that's kind of
what I wanted to talk to you about.

He's not exactly speaking to me either.

- Why? What happened?
- I don't know.

You know George.

He's complicated, I guess.

00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,037
Yeah.

680
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,630
I was wondering,

681
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,234
I'm not just George's friend to you, am I?

682
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,453
You and George should be together, Sally.

683
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,482
We're just friends.

684

There's no such thing.

We shouldn't be doing this.

George.

692
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:40,247
Been looking forward to reading
your Hardy paper. Today's the day.

693
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,916
Sorry, I don't have it.

694
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,388
George, this was
your final project of the year.

695
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,296
After this, there's just exams.
How am I supposed to grade you?

696
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,063
I'll have it to you by next week, I promise.

697
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,136
That's not gonna be good enough.

698
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,005
Hey, pal.

699
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,051
I called this meeting because
your teachers have reported to me

700
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,958
that you continue to refuse
to do the course work.

701
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,726
You have made zero effort to turn
your career here at Morgan around.

702
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,467
Yes, I did.

703
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:29,800
I mean, I did struggle with it
at the beginning, but I just couldn't.

704
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,328
Well, you are out of time.

705
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:35,431
The moment to decide your future
has arrived.

706
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:41,631
Now, against the recommendation
of some in this room,

707
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,602
I'm giving you a choice.

708
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,102
First is expulsion.

709
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,373
It's yours if you want it.

710
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:49,977
Second option,

711
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:55,181
if you want to graduate, you make up
every single assignment you missed.

712
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,980
Every paper, every exercise.

713
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,318
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

714
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:05,327
If even one is missing
on graduation day, no diploma.

715
00:54:07,865 --> 00:54:09,833
You have a little over three weeks.

716
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:15,204
George, I used to believe you had
more potential than anyone else here.

717
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,240
But you never delivered, not once.

718
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,532
I wasn't gonna waste the time
getting mad at you.

719
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,735
I'm not gonna waste the time
defending you now.

720
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,949
Forget the lack of respect
you show, George.

721
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:36,816
This is the way we make our living,
how we spend our lives.

722
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,028
But you simply don't care
what goes on around here.

723
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:42,824
Why would we continue to reward that?

724
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,468
You're right.

725
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:48,969
You shouldn't reward it.

726
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:54,474
I honestly don't know what to say.

727
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,844
Maybe it should be expulsion.

732
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,396
Did you tell my parents about this?

733
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:20,930
Yes, George, I had to.

734
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,484
Hey.

735
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,018
I don't know what to say.

736
00:55:37,855 --> 00:55:40,915
Is it my fault?
I mean, I've had a lot on my mind and...

737
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,390
It's not your fault.

738
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,496
I don't think I can do it.

739
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,532
Well, what do you mean?
What other choice is there?

740
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:52,568
- Mom, I'm not sure that I can.
- You're just gonna have to do it.

741

and just do it!

I don't care! I'm done listening to your lies!

This is your mess, and it's a disaster.

What does that mean?

750
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,393
I mean, you wanna tell us
where you've been spending your days

pretending to go to work?

759

Did you get that sorted out, Jack?

760

shop booth like a homeless person?

I swear. I promise, I...

778

I thought you were gonna leave it alone.

she just met

You want me to thank you?

784

I actually felt something.

785

That doesn't always happen.
It hasn't happened in a very long time.

And I've lived long enough to know
that when it does, you should act on it.

He's a 50-year-old man.

He's supposed to protect you.

We were already headed there.

804

His business went bankrupt
about a year ago,

01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:54,233
and I thought I should have faith in him
and support him.

But there was always some sort of excuse,

807
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,409
or his luck was about to turn.

808
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:04,639
So, he convinced me
to mortgage the apartment,

and I didn't wanna distract you.
