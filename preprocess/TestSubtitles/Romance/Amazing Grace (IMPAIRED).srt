I have a surprise for you.

is playing games with me again.

Breakfast, perhaps.
Not too early. I'm on holiday.

This is your 3 a.m. Dose.

33
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,878
So, cousin, you're waking me up
to give me medicine to help me sleep.

Ah. Now you're taking on the medical
profession, as well as everyone else.

Did you sleep?

Sleep is more exhausting

Wilber, Parliament doesn't deserve you.

Your last bill was defeated
because four of your loyal supporters

took free tickets to a comic opera
rather than stay to vote.

Marianne, are you expecting
someone else?

I have been a picture of health.

How about that?

Marianne, if I'd known you were
so starved of political conversation,

I'd have wrapped up a Tory
and sent him to your home by mail

However, Mr Wilberforce,
if we had met in other circumstances,

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,196
I would have told you how deeply
I admire your tireless efforts

86
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,557
to force our ridiculous Parliament
to abolish the slave trade.

87

If you had, I would have changed
the subject and talked about botany.

Botany? Why botany?

89

Anything but politics.
I'm in Bath to be cured of politics.

90

Well, I would have been bored by botany.

91
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,914
So, even in other circumstances,
it would have been a disaster.

[Wilberforce] Some simple truths
about this horrendous war

95
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,358
need to be restated for the benefit
of my honourable friends.

96
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,640
Simple fact. We have the rebels
on the anvil and a hammer in our hands.

00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,789
[Cheering]

98
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,554
There is no question
that our military force

99
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,154
is far superior
to that of the Americans.

100
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,632
But we must distinguish
between force and justice.

Where did this terrier spring from?

[Wilberforce]... rather
than able statesmen.

Surely it is time for the fat fellow
and his friends opposite

to make way for others
who consider the good of their country

106

of greater moment
than their own personal interests.

Oh, I think he's equal to the dangers.

110
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,197
My honourable friend suggests
we surrender to the revolutionaries.

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,558
Revolution is like a pox.
It spreads from person to person.

112
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,156
I bow to my honourable friend's
superior knowledge and experience

113
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,710
- in all matters regarding the pox.
- [Laughter]

114
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,952
Why would we withdraw from America

115
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
when half of the Americans
are loyal to the Crown?

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,595
Less than one in four Americans
are loyal.

117
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,072
If he calls that half, I'd hate to be
his wife and share half his bed.

- [Muttering]

123

The difference between appeasement
and surrender is merely a matter of time

Your Grace, you know these merchant boys
are richer than we are.

[Man] Aye. I have ten guineas left.

132
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,829
So ten it is.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,150
In or out, Wilberforce?

134
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,717
- A pencil and paper.
- No, no, no.

135
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,474
Brooks's Club house rules. No IOUs.

136
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,349
Amongst gentlemen, perhaps,
but Wilberforce is a tradesman.

137
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,114
You gamble with what you have with you.

138
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,398
Wilberforce, will you take my IOU?

139
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,956
- We split the pot and call it evens.
- To hell with that. Payment in kind.

140
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,475
There's nothing you have
I'd want, Your Grace.

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,558
Tarleton, fetch my nigger.

142
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,593
My coach driver.
Go and wake him up and bring him in now.

143
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,673
I bought a nigger in Port of Spain.

144
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,718
He eats better than I do,
so he's strong as an ox.

145
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,917
He'd fetch at least 25 guineas
at the West India Dock.

146
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,355
The game is over.

147
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,077
What's wrong, Wilberforce?

148
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,152
If I hadn't brought the boy to London,

149
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,959
he'd have been worked to death
in a sugar cane field.

150
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,590
I saved his miserable life. There.

151
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,913
I raise the stakes.

152
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,473
Wilberforce? In the game or out?

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,116
[Man] Evening.

154
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,558
You act as if
you'd never seen slavery before.

155
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,713
For me it's like arsenic.
Each new tiny dose doubles the effect.

156
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,559
- You're not afraid of Clarence.
- Because he's the son of the king?

157
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,111
So, you want "bloody noses
and cracked crowns"?

158
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,034
- Shakespeare, <i>Henry IV.</i>
- A play about England changing.

159
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,078
- As it will soon change.
- Only if we change it.

160
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,236
You don't believe you and I
could change things?

161
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,994
I would change myself first.

162
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,789
[Men singing]

163
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,510
Do you remember, Billy, at Cambridge

164
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,433
I had a reputation
as something of a singer?

165
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,397
I do remember.

166
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,358
So I think I'm going to go
and sing them a song.

167
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,559
[Men continue singing]

168
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,909
- Silence!
- [Singing continues]

169
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,157
Silence!

170
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,552
[Singing stops]

171
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,429
You sound like a chorus
of bloody tomcats.

172
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,628
Now, let me introduce you to somebody
who does it properly.

173
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,109
[Scattered applause]

174
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,589
I dedicate this song
to my honourable friend,

175
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,036
- His Grace, the Duke of Clarence.
- [Laughter]

176
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,953
It was written by my old preacher.

177
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,839
He was captain of a slave ship
for 20 years.

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,356
He repented his sins
and then he wrote this song.

179
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,639
# <i>Amazing Grace</i>

180
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,511
- # <i>How sweet the sound</i>
- Times are hard for the militant boys!

181
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,515
- # <i>That saved a wretch</i>
- [man shouting]

182
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,549
# <i>Like me</i>

183
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,716
# <i>I once was lost</i>

184
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,830
# <i>But now am found</i>

185
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,031
# <i>Was blind</i>

186
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,192
# <i>But now</i>

187
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,511
# <i>I see</i> #

188
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,910
Dear God, I know this is utterly absurd,

189
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,072
but I feel I have to meet you in secret.

190
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,757
[Man coughing]

191
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,833
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There is a beggar at the kitchen door.

192
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,551
I would turn him away, sir,
but you insisted I always check.

193
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,313
Just give him breakfast.

194
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,353
Very good, sir.

195
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,674
- Richard?
- Sir?

196
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,393
I know that lying down on the wet grass
is not a normal thing to do.

197
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,358
None of my business, sir.

198
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,511
Truth is, uh...

199
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,155
...l've been even more strange
than usual lately, haven't I?

200
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,833
It's God.

201
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,435
I have 10,000
engagements of state today,

202
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,319
but I would prefer to spend the day
getting a wet arse,

203
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,110
studying dandelions
and marvelling at bloody spiders' webs.

204
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,998
You've found God, sir?

205
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,835
I think he found me.

206
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,195
Do you have any idea
how inconvenient that is,

207
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,079
how idiotic it will sound?

208
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,959
I've a political career
glittering ahead of me

209
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,396
and in my heart I want spiders' webs.

210
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,478
"It is a sad fate for a man to die
too well-known to everybody else

211
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,234
and still unknown to himself."

212
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,470
Francis Bacon.

213
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,234
I don'tjust dust your books, sir.

214
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,555
When I was 15,
I almost ran away with the circus.

215
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,314
They said I could have been an acrobat.

216
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,515
- Good morning, Mr Pitt.
- Morning.

217
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,519
[Man] Excuse me, sir.

218
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,877
You read my letter.

219
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,316
The man who wrote that letter
was not you.

220
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,439
It was written by some wild preacher man
that has gotten into your head.

221
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,591
No.

222
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,913
- So did he reply?
- Who

223
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,198
God. You were going to ask God whether
you should take up politics or religion.

224
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,112
You're always too direct, Billy.

225
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,477
I urgently need to know
where your heart lies, Wilber.

226
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,154
- What's urgent?
- I...

227
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,991
I'm planning to become prime minister.

228
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,596
- [Laughs] Some day.
- No, I mean soon. Very soon.

229
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,396
Thanks to your performances in
the House, Fox and North will resign.

230
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,472
Lord Rockingham
will become prime minister.

231
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,839
Lord Rockingham's health is not good.
When he dies, I will make my move.

232
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,837
- You've worked it all out.
- I want you beside me, Wilber.

233
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,638
All the way.

234
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,075
You've read my letter
but not taken in a word.

235
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,392
I would have you in my government
in whichever capacity you choose.

236
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,634
[Sighs] Billy, no one of our age
has ever taken power.

237
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,828
Which is why we're too young to realise
that certain things are impossible.

238
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,114
So we will do them anyway.

239
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,515
I need an answer, Wilber.

240
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,075
Do you intend to use
your beautiful voice to praise the Lord

241
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,834
or change the world?

242
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,796
[Woman] Here. Cut this, will you?

243
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,238
- [Woman 2] I've got too much to do.
- [Woman 3] You take care of them.

244
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,992
Any more flour?

245
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,152
- [Girl] I can't!
- [Woman 1] Put your elbow into it.

246
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,512
Marjorie, Mr Wilberforce
is on his way down.

247
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,229
[Clucking]

248
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,598
Marjorie, I'm expecting
some people for dinner.

249
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
[Whimpers]

250
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,869
Marjorie? Marjorie?

251
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,550
- She's been run off her feet, sir.
- How so?

252
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,076
Well, take today, for example.
You have 25 guests for lunch.

253
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,229
Do I?

254
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,515
[Indistinct chatter]

255
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,112
If you remember, you decided
to reward various volunteers

256
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,034
who worked for some
quite precariously financed charities.

257
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,432
Some brought deserving children.
Others brought less deserving relatives.

258
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,077
- I really should get some sort of...
- Diary, sir. Yes. Or more cooks.

259
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,351
[Man] Go on! Go on!

260
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
Is that the appetiser?

261
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,879
No, that's His Grace,
the Duke of Clarence.

262
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,238
Wilberforce, the Reverend John Ramsay.

263
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,913
Reverend.

264
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,548
Edward Hope.

265
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,280
And Michael Shaw. Both friends.

266
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,989
- This is Olaudah Equiano.
- Mr Equiano. Please.

267
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,113
- You've travelled far to be here?
- No distance would be too great.

268
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,271
- And this is Hannah Moore.
- Mr Wilberforce.

269
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,635
Who has travelled
all the way from Clapham.

270
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,917
Finally, let me introduce
Mr Thomas Clarkson.

271
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,755
Beautiful house. Sweet little rabbit.

272
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,796
It's a hare, actually.

273
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,951
Please.

274
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,997
So come on. Who are they?

275
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,549
Why don't you ask them?

276
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,512
Well, I hope the goose is tender.
She was rather old.

277
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,478
I find the older I get,
the more tender I become.

278
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,916
- [Chuckling]
- [Bird squawks]

279
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,155
So, Miss Moore, you live in Clapham.

280
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,311
I hear it's very tranquil there.

281
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,552
When certain issues are raised
amongst my friends and I,

282
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,950
it is anything but tranquil.

283
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,317
Ah. And, uh, which issues are those?

284
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,916
Issues regarding
the making of a better world.

285
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,957
Better in which way?

286
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,079
If you make the world better in one way,
it becomes better in every way.

287
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,231
Don't you think?

288
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,917
Mr Equiano, what business
brings you to London?

289
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,277
My business in London is you,
Mr Wilberforce.

290
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,671
What? You wish
to discuss something with me?

291
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,479
No. We do not want to talk

292
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,519
because we hear that you are a man
who doesn't believe what he hears

293
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,274
until he sees it with his own eyes.

294
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,195
These are for the legs.

295
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,954
These for the arms.

296
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,109
This is for the neck.

297
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,879
Works like so.

298
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,590
When the slaves leave port in Africa,

299
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,558
they're locked into a space
four foot by 18 inches.

300
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,236
They have no sanitation,
very little food, stagnant water.

301
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,793
Their waste and blood fills the holes
within three days and is never emptied.

302
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,318
These irons and chains are to keep them
from throwing themselves overboard.

303
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,998
The chains are not unlocked until
you reach the plantation in Jamaica.

304
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,436
Around half of the slaves
are dead already.

305
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,552
In the markets, they stuff knotted rope

306
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,678
into the anuses of those who are sick

307
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,957
to disguise the dysentery.

308
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,513
When you reach the plantation,
they put irons to the fire...

309
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,597
...and do this.

310
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,834
To let you know that you no longer
belong to God, but to a man.

311
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,590
Mr Wilberforce, we understand
you're having problems

312
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,593
choosing whether to do the work of God

313
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,433
or the work of a political activist.

314
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,636
We humbly suggest that you can do both.

315
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,871
You planned this.

316
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,429
I've seen the literature
you've been reading.

317
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,558
You've stooped to searching
through my desk?

318
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,952
Sir William Dolben told me you'd asked
to be shown round the East India Docks.

319
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,717
So, you would use my private concerns
for your own political ends.

320
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,553
Yes, exactly that.

321
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,950
The principles of Christianity
lead to action as well as meditation.

322
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,192
Allow me to meditate on it
before I decide on any action.

323
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,035
Just think about this, Wilber.

324
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,510
The slave trade
has 300 MPs in its pocket.

325
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,760
It would be just you against them.

326
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,154
But you could do it.

327
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,356
You would do it.

328
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,075
[Indistinct chatter]

329
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,269
Oh, stop moaning.

330
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,551
[Man] Excuse me, sir.

331
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,198
Do you have a penny
for a boy that went to fight the Yanks

332
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,554
and came back half a man?

333
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,235
Hello, Mr Newton. It's me, William.

334
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,071
Hello, John. How are you?

335
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,676
Hello, John. It's me, Wilber.

336
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,511
I'm here to seek your...

337
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,630
[Wilberforce] The beggar at the door
assures me that I'm now old enough

338
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,109
to call you John.

339
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,558
[Laughs]

340
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,915
You're dressing very simply these days.

341
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,393
I'm a simple man. I try to pretend I am
a monk, but I don't have the willpower.

342
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,916
I'm a monk Mondays, Wednesdays...

343
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,835
When I read your name in the papers,
doing these great things,

344
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,912
I still see a tiny boy
with his hair a mess

345
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,548
and ink on his fingers.

346
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,516
So, what do you want
with an old creature?

347
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm here to seek your advice.

348
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,870
When you were a child,
you used to ask God for advice.

349
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,874
Then I grew up. And grew foolish.

350
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,871
And now?

351
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,274
Now... slowly, my faith is returning.

352
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
How slowly?

353
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,357
- No bolts of lightning.
- [Chuckles]

354
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,231
God sometimes does his work
with gentle drizzle, not storms.

355
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,313
Drip... drip... drip.

356
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,391
My friend William Pitt
has declared an interest in me.

357
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,993
William who?

358
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,070
He's offering me a place in the world.

359
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,074
Just make sure you're in the world,
not of the world.

360
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,909
There'd be no escape from power
once I have it.

361
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,595
- I would have to see things through.
- Why wouldn't you?

362
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,473
Are you contemplating
a life of solitude?

363
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,034
Wilber, you have work to do.

364
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,239
Besides, people like you too much

365
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,550
to let you live a life of solitude.

366
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,551
Haven't you chosen solitude?

367
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,919
You, of all people,
should know I can never be alone.

368
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,830
There now.

369
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,594
- There now what?
- You're the reason I came.

370
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,999
You told me that you live
in the company of 20,000 ghosts.

371
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,152
The ghosts of slaves.

372
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,479
I was explaining to a child

373
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,158
why a grown man cowers in a dark corner.

374
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,231
I need you to tell me about them.

375
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,278
I'm not strong enough
to hear my own confession.

376
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,510
- I thought time might have changed you.
- It has. I'm older.

377
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,355
Pitt has asked me
to take them on, the slavers.

378
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,273
I'm the last person
you should come to for advice.

379
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,749
I can't even say the name
of any of my ships

380
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,957
without being back
onboard them in my head.

381
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,069
All I know is 20,000 slaves live
with me in this little church.

382
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,279
- There's still blood on my hands.
- Will you help me, John?

383
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,954
I can't help you.

384
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,908
But do it, Wilber. Do it.

385
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,868
Take them on. Blow their dirty,
filthy ships out of the water.

386
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,600
The planters, sugar barons,

387
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,548
Alderman "Sugar Cane",
the Lord Mayor of London.

388
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,712
Liverpool, Boston, Bristol, New York.

389
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,432
All their streets running
with blood, dysentery, puke!

390
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,229
You won't come away
from those streets clean, Wilber.

391
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,756
You'll get filthy with it,
you'll dream it,

392
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,718
see it in broad daylight.

393
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,158
But do it. For God's sake.

394
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,557
Sir, I have Mr Thomas Clarkson.

395
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,719
Forgive me.
Mr Wilberforce was here a moment ago.

396
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,069
I'd better go and find him.

397
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,751
[Whining]

398
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,519
- [Crashing]
- [Barking]

399
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,992
- Good afternoon.
- Sorry if I alarmed you.

400
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,749
I had this box made up in the
exact dimensions of a slave berth.

401
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,353
I thought you could use it
in your practical demonstrations.

402
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,198
Why did you wait until your butler
had left before you got out of the box?

403
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,914
They all think I'm mad already.

404
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,596
As will most people
in the House of Commons

405
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,479
when I present my bill.

406
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,513
<i>[Man] Wilberforce, conditions in Jamaica</i>

407
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,831
<i>are far more brutal</i>
<i>than I could have imagined.</i>

408
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,028
<i>Many children are scalded to death</i>
<i>by the molten lava.</i>

409
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,433
<i>Others die of exhaustion</i>
<i>or roll into the fires in their sleep.</i>

410
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,230
<i>The result in the morning</i>
<i>is a few pounds of pure, refined sugar.</i>

411
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,755
[Knocking]

412
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,517
- [Groaning]
- Wilberforce, are you all right?

413
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,151
Sit up for me.

414
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,951
Here, drink this.

415
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,637
- What happened?
- I read James's letter from Jamaica.

416
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,190
When I fell asleep,
it was as if I were living inside it.

417
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,668
Perhaps the laudanum
the doctor gave you is badly mixed.

418
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,751
I know the effects of opium, Henry.

419
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,270
- This isn't the medication.
- What, then?

420
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,318
I was chosen for this task and I failed.

421
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,880
Some part of me does not accept
the idea that I've given up.

422
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,918
- I'll dilute this.
- Can you dilute what I feel?

423
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,311
You've given your youth
and your health for this cause.

424
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,392
It's time to let someone else try.

425
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,115
So, Mr Wilberforce...

426
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,669
...I understand you have
an interest in botany.

427
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,593
Botany, Miss Spooner? Whatever gives you
the idea that I might be interested

428
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,069
in something as tedious as botany?

429
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,558
[Snorts and coughs]

430
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,712
Sorry. It's a private joke.

431
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,719
Now, Wilber, I know
you're not interested in botany,

432
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,398
but there's a fascinating creeping ivy
up the far end of the garden.

433
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,597
Barbara, you really must
go and see it too.

434
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,751
Go on.

435
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,317
To irritate them,
let's pretend to argue.

436
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,994
- What about?
- Something we disagree on.

437
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,151
Think of something.

438
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,311
The war in France.

439
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,075
I think we should settle
with Napoleon right now.

440
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,152
So do I. Schools.

441
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,073
I'm a member of your movement
for free education.

442
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,869
I agreed with every word you said
on the Dales factory debate.

443
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,031
You read every word?

444
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,874
- No.
- Neither did I.

445
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,917
[Barbara giggles]

446
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,993
- Gin.
- Replace it in the cities with beer.

447
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,229
Absolutely.

448
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,634
I'm definitely alone
in my opinions about animals.

449
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,633
No. I joined your society
for the prevention of cruelty.

450
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,554
Well, I'm extreme. I have a pet fox,
a pet rat and a crow that can't fly.

451
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,109
I used to have a pet hare,
but it died of kindness.

452
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,078
- [Barbara laughs]
- America.

453
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,994
We must reassess the power
of the collective political process.

454
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,149
Agreed.

455
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,470
Oh, and, of course,
we are agreed on slavery.

456
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,110
I'm against flowers in church.
What do you say to that?

457
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,271
I am for them.

458
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,991
As am I.

459
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,150
I shouldn't talk about the slave trade?

460
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,360
I've spent so many years
talking about it.

461
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,750
So, what are a few more minutes?

462
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,150
When Mr Pitt
first became prime minister,

463
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,438
the two of you were like meteorites
shooting through our imagination.

464
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,434
- Whose imaginations?
- Girls my age.

465
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,591
You stopped taking sugar in your tea?

466
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,399
I wore an abolition badge
made by Josiah Wedgwood.

467
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,357
He was a good friend to us.

468
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,308
And I travelled 30 miles in the rain
to hear Thomas Clarkson speak.

469
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,517
- Did he deafen you?
- He opened my eyes.

470
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,910
- I met the African.
- Equiano.

471
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,914
He came to town with a hundred copies
of his book. They sold in an hour.

472
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,674
- You signed our petitions.
- A hundred times.

473
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,118
A hundred times. Three million names,
a million candles to read them by.

474
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,352
- Must have been so exciting.
- Exciting?

475
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,557
It seemed that every spring
the daffodils came out,

476
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,870
every summer the cherries ripened

477
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,749
and every autumn William Wilberforce
would present his bill to the House.

478
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,876
- And still...
- And still...?

479
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,838
And still, after all the badges,
the petitions,

480
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,797
all the speeches and the bills,

481
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,080
ships full of human souls in chains
sail around the world as cargo!

482
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,519
I'm sorry.

483
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,915
- This is why I shouldn't talk about it.
- I think you should.

484
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,879
There. We've found something
we disagree on.

485
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,273
"Am I not a man
whose soul is drawn to heaven

486
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,637
like water
from the dark well of Africa?"

487
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,199
From Equiano's book.

488
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,273
[Sighs] He was a man like no other.

489
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,593
Please, tell me about him.

490
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,791
It seems to me

491
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,670
that if there is a bad taste
in your mouth, you spit it out.

492
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,393
You don't constantly swallow it back.

493
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,632
<i>[Wilberforce]</i>
<i>Not long after I first met him,</i>

494
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,156
<i>he asked me to come</i>
<i>to the East India Dock.</i>

495
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,118
<i>He said there was a ship I should see.</i>

496
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,669
<i>A ship he knew well.</i>

497
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,398
Mr Equiano.

498
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,790
This way.

499
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,031
Thank you, sir.

500
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,317
- [Woman] Hello.
- [Man] Sweetheart.

501
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,352
They make you lie in this space.

502
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,355
The shackles dislocate
your hip or your shoulder.

503
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,239
You are in pain
all the way around the world.

504
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,671
How long is the journey?

505
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,638
Three weeks, if the weather is good.

506
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,473
For amusement, they sometimes
hang the women from these,

507
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,029
by the ankles, to rape them.

508
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,198
In stormy weather,
they take the very sickest

509
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,353
and throw them into the sea
to lighten the ship's load.

510
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,237
How did you survive?

511
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,632
Your life is a thread.
It breaks or it doesn't break.

512
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,349
Before I travelled in a ship like this,

513
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,752
I was a prince,
in many ways not unlike you.

514
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,109
It was a beautiful day like no other,

515
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,874
the last day I saw my home in Africa.

516
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,151
[Wilberforce] It is with a heavy heart

517
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,754
that I bring to the attention
of this House

518
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,516
a trade which degrades men
to the level of brutes

519
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,198
and insults the highest qualities
of our common nature.

520
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,318
I am speaking of... the slave trade.

521
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,358
[Protesting]

522
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,352
I know that many
of my honourable friends in this House

523
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,353
have interests in the Indies.

524
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,116
Others have investments in plantations.
Others are ship owners.

525
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,716
And I believe them
to be men of humanity.

526
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,350
I believe you all to be men of humanity.

527
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,715
- If the wretchedness of any one
- [clamouring]

528
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,678
Of the many hundreds of slaves
stowed in their ships

529
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,515
- could be brought to view...
- [protests drown out Wilberforce]

530
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,029
Order! Order!

531
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,670
I can hardly believe my ears.

532
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,152
- We can hardly believe your mouth.
- [Laughter]

533
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,792
It seems my young friend opposite
has a long-term strategy

534
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,394
to destroy the very nation
that spawned him.

535
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,120
[Shouting]

536
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,198
While I was in Virginia losing
my fingers in battle with the Americans,

537
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,909
- he was busy appeasing them.
- [Clamouring]

538
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:28,030
Now he would hand over the riches
of the Indies to the bloody French!

539
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,956
Lf... If we didn't have slaves,
there would be no plantations.

540
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:45,672
And with no plantations, how would we
fill the coffers of the king?

541
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,595
Does my honourable friend

542
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,673
really believe
that if we left off the trade,

543
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,278
the French wouldn't immediately step
into our place and reap the rewards?

544
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,396
[Clamouring]

545
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,836
All this food. There's only
a handful of people in there.

546
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,912
He's an optimist. Completely incurable.

547
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,390
Our defeat in the House today
was not unexpected.

548
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,028
But our intention
was to flush out the opposition

549
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,873
and discover how many people
would support us.

550
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,998
Yes, well, we certainly found out
who our friends are.

551
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,230
All 16 of them.

552
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,188
I... I sent a note of thanks
to everyone who voted for us.

553
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,157
How sweet of you.

554
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,709
Some of us know
how to take defeat graciously.

555
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,953
- Something to with with breeding?
- On this occasion, it probably is.

556
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,159
Everything that is said at this meeting
is being taken down for our records.

557
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,073
My friend James Stephen
has agreed to be our secretary.

558
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,355
You were saying?

559
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,719
As you can see, not many MPs
have responded to our invitation.

560
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,509
Indeed, outside my own family,
there is only one: Sir William Dolben.

561
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,353
Sir William, what brings you
to this gathering?

562
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:15,116
I recently took passage from
Sierra Leone aboard a slave ship.

563
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,352
What I saw during those 15 days...

564
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,353
But I believe there are plenty of others
in the House who share your feelings.

565
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,080
- They're just afraid to show it.
- Shame on them!

566
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,836
No shame. No shame. Were I the
representative of a port city,

567
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,074
how could I tell those whom I represent
that I'm voting to end their livelihood?

568
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,595
- Exactly so.
- [All talk at once]

569
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,069
How can human beings be commerce?

570
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,553
- It's exactly this pursuit of lofty...
- Nothing lofty about simple humanity.

571
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,711
Please!

572
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,273
Perhaps we should begin this journey
with the first step.

573
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,750
We are talking about the truth.

574
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,959
So we should hand it out to people.
Drop it from church roofs.

575
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,875
Paint pictures of it. Write songs
about it. Make bloody pies out of it.

576
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,871
[Clarkson] Go on.

577
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,873
There is a slave ship at dock in Tilbury

578
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,395
with twice the slave berths
it is insured for.

579
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,348
I know that for a fact.
But how do we prove it?

580
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,714
Wilber.

581
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,349
- Dear God.
- Well, almost.

582
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,037
I've spent 18 months being torn apart
by you in the House, Mr Wilberforce.

583
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,193
I thought I'd find out
what it feels like to be on your side.

584
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,156
I see you've got plenty of food.
Any of you saints drink?

585
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,069
Well, this one bloody does.

586
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,556
Thank you very much.

587
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,678
Agh!

588
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,071
Not fair! Not fair.

589
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,835
I'm not well. My belly.

590
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,389
What's wrong with your belly?

591
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,912
[Wilberforce] Oh!

592
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,958
Besides, you're prime minister.

593
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,156
It is my ministerial duty
to let you win.

594
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,835
[Laughs] So, what will we do with Fox?

595
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,869
- Put him in a box?
- Let him throw the heavy rocks.

596
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,113
- Provide the shocks.
- Put Lord Tarleton in the stocks.

597
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,516
Oh!

598
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,877
Oh, if the House of Lords could hear
the idiotic way we carry on,

599
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,715
they'd ban anyone under the age of 30
from holding high office ever again.

600
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,557
Well, at least with Fox on board,
the world will know we mean business.

601
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,393
The world doesn't know yet.

602
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,357
Nor will it, not until we're ready.

603
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,952
You were born for this, Wilber.

604
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,111
Sometimes I get giddy.

605
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,316
Why is it you only feel the thorns
in your feet when you stop running?

606
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,109
Is that some sort of heavy-handed
metaphorical advice for me, Mr Pitt?

607
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,396
Yes, I suppose it is.

608
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,236
We must keep going, keep going fast.

609

Gentlemen, would you stop the music,
please? Thank you.

616

Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have
enjoyed our little tour of the estuary.

617
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,271
But now our sojourn is almost over,
I have a confession to make.

618
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,910
This trip wasn't purely arranged
to reward those MPs

619
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,791
who have supported me in the past year,
nor am I the only sponsor.

00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,076
- What's he doing?
- Ladies and gentleman,

621
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,438
this is a slave ship. The <i>Madagascar.</i>

622
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,911
It has just returned from the Indies

623
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,950
where it delivered 200 men,
women and children to Jamaica.

624
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,399
When it left Africa,
there were 600 on board.

625
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,509
The rest died of disease or despair.

626
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,433
[Sniffing, moaning]

627
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,832
That smell is the smell of death.

628
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,679
Slow, painful death.

629
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,588
Breathe it in. Breathe it deeply.

630
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,595
Take those handkerchiefs
away from your noses.

631
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,795
There, now.

632
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,032
Remember that smell.

633
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,760
Remember the <i>Madagascar.</i>

634
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,072
Remember that God made men equal.

635
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,957
<i>[Wilberforce] All that winter,</i>
<i>we spread out across the country</i>

636
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,350
<i>gathering evidence for Parliament.</i>

637
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,876
Thomas rode to Bristol,
Liverpool, Plymouth,

638
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,474
<i>talking to men</i>
<i>who'd worked the slave ships,</i>

639
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,200
<i>ships' doctors who'd treated them,</i>

640
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,318
<i>slaves themselves</i>
<i>who'd been whipped and branded.</i>

641
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,313
Equiano published his account
of his years as a slave.

642
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,000
<i>He sold 50,000 copies in two months.</i>

643
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,111
Spare a coin, sir?

644
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,638
<i>Our supporters began to only buy sugar</i>
<i>produced without slaves in India.</i>

645
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,990
Or they stopped using sugar altogether.

646
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,071
It seemed our message was everywhere.

647
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,358
At least now there was hope. Real hope.

648
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,034
We had a year to collect enough evidence

649
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,556
to convince Parliament of our case.

650
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,918
The planters and the ship owners
began to spread rumours about us.

651
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,676
They called us seditious, secretly
working to bring down the government.

652
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,434
Clarkson sat in a coach to Birmingham

653
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,593
and overheard someone claim
that I'd secretly married a slave woman.

654
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,118
But the weight of our hope
made it all seem like glorious infamy.

655
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,272
How long have you been taking laudanum?

656
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,154
I recognise its presence.

657
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,115
My illness and my crusade
were born around the same time.

658
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,430
What is your illness?

659
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,278
The doctors tell me it's called colitis.

660
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,637
They don't really understand it,
but I do.

661
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,950
You see, sometimes my stomach

662
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,237
gets bored of being a stomach
and decides it's a sailing ship.

663
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,790
Then my heart gets jealous
and decides it wants to be a see-saw.

664
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,872
And before you know it,
my lungs are arguing with one another

665
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,429
whether to be lungs
or sponges full of seawater.

666
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,670
[Chuckling]

667
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,913
Well, at least that's what I tell
my nieces and nephews.

668
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,150
Marianne tells me you like children.

669
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,711
My poor father almost went mad

670
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,678
when I told him
I'd stopped taking sugar in my tea.

671
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,277
I was 14,

672
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,432
reading your name in the papers,
willing you to win.

673
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,112
I told my friends there was actual
slave blood in every lump of sugar.

674
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,549
Has this been so painful to talk about?

675
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,832
It's only painful to talk about
because we haven't changed anything.

676
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,434
But, unlike the slaves,
I have opium for my pain.
