00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,758
How are you?
Best meal on wheels right here.

159
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,262
Tell that to my cheese and bacon panini.
Total foodgasm.

160
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,055
Bacon?

161
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,849
Have a good night.

162
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,395
Bacon.

163
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,731
You know what? I'm also gonna get
the Georgia Dog Special.

164
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,900
- Yo, chef. Where're you going?
- Two seconds.

165
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,777
I added to my order.
Do you think he heard it?

166
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,029
I can't do anything with gloves on.

167

168
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,367
All right, excellent choice.

169
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,494
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

170
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,496
There's a line if you want to order.

171
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,417
The only thing I'm ordering is for you
to stop serving bacon, okay? Pig's our turf.

Oh, my God! Your turf?

174
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,006
- Yeah.
- Is this West Side Story?

175
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,090
Are we gonna rumble at midnight?

176
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,718
You know what, maybe I got
a whole gang of back-up dancers

177
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,386
- just ready to go, okay?
- Oh, wow!

178
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,513
You're the cheese truck, so stick to cheese.

179
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,640
- Can I order now?
- No! Just give me one second, please.

180
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,060
That's funny, 'cause I noticed that those
jalapeno fritters you guys are serving...

181
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,230
Are awesome, right? They're my invention.
I made them.

182
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,857
They have ricotta cheese in them.

183
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,817
Come on! That's like a little bit of cheese.

184
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,527
That's nothing compared
to the bacon crutch

185
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,154
you're propping these sandwiches up on.

186
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,781
They're paninis, they're grilled peach
and blue cheese paninis,

187
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,325
with a dash of bacon.

188
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,118
Also awesome. Also my invention.

189
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,703
(CHUCKLES)

190
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,248
All right, you wanna go? Let's go.
Your special against my special.

191
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,916
Whoever sells the most tonight, wins.

192
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,585
- Fine.
- Fine.

193
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,712
All right, if I win,
you have to have a drink with me.

194
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,714
And if you win, you may have

195
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,008
- three drinks with me.
- That's cute.

196
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,552
So you can stand me up again?
No thank you.

197
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,847
That was five years ago.
But that's sweet you still remember that.

198
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,266
I'm impressed, Rosie.

199
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,434
I'll see you in the field, all right?

200
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,394
- It doesn't keep me up nights.
- Sure.

201
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,854
Who's that?

202
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,857
This guy from high school. Total player.

203
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,401
- I'd play with that.
- Mmm.

204

Don't be gross. Don't be that girl.

205
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,159
You're not still hungry, are you?

206
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,287
I don't know. It depends on what you got left
in your picnic basket.

207

208

ROSIE: What did you think
was gonna happen?

212
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,790
MARCO: Well, I asked you to prom first,
all right. And then you said, "Maybe"

213
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,250
- so I decided to ask someone else.
- No, I didn't...

214
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,086
Yes, you did. So I asked someone else.
Then you said, "Yes."

215
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,257
So I tried to take you both.
What's so wrong with that?

216
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,884
- I'm not saying it worked.
- Fine.

217
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,220
I blocked out most of high school anyway.

218
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,139
Hey. Where'd you get this guy?

219
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,808
I fought a grill and the grill won.

220
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,351
Why'd you fight the grill?
It always wins.

221

- Yeah, guys love it, though.

- Do they?
- Guys love burned hands.

223
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,023
Yeah? Check this out. Okay.

224

First time breaking down a pig
when I was 16.

225
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,528
- Five stitches. Five. Yeah.
- Five?

226
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,572
- That is adorable!
- I wasn't asking your opinion, that's okay.

- That is adorable!
- All right, I wasn't asking your opinion.

Look. A deli slicer
nearly took my whole thumb off.

Making caramels.

- I know.

Are you always this mean?

- I'm gonna go.

Well, if you don't stop me,
I'm just gonna kiss you.

You're a comedian?

313
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,744
- (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) No. He's not.
- No.

314
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,455
- He's not even funny. At all.
- Yeah.

315
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,127
What he does is, he actually picks songs
for commercials for an ad agency.

316
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,421
- Great health insurance.
- Yeah.

317
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,924
They're working on a big ad
for Delta Air Lines...

318
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,468
Well, we're bidding on it.
It's not a done deal yet.

319
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,929
And how's the photography business?

320
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,598
Well, I'm still waiting for the Guggenheim
to start collecting my work.

321
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,393
But until then, I'm shooting at
the Aquarium.

322
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,520
And, you know, it pays the bills.

323
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,482
"All the white babies were taken"?

324
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,026
What?

325
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,278
Cookie?

326
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,362
No, thank you.

327
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,615
So you think we're looking at a year?

328
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,119
Well, every case has its own timeline.
You just have to be patient.

329
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,664
But on average, yes, a year. Maybe more.

330
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,291
More?

331
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,962
I could work with that, right?
Yeah, that sounds good.

332
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,548
So does that mean you like us?

333
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,342
I don't see any red flags.

334
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,721
But you need to baby-proof
if you're going to stay here.

335
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,264
Yeah. Of course.

336
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,891
Oh, do you have a wedding photo?

337
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,268
The Ethiopian authorities really like to
see that in the packet.

338
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,187
- No.
- Yeah, we do.

339
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,481
- Of course we do. Yeah, we do.
- No, we don't. We lost it.

340
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,650
- Yeah. We do. Where is it?
- No! No! No!

341
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,071
Hmm. I think it's right here.

342
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,117
Vegas. It was a costume wedding.

343
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,578
I was Prince, Holly was a showgirl.

344
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,623
He loves Purple Rain.

345
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,043
You know what, why don't we just say
it got burned in a fire?

346
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,628
Good one.

347
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,171
- Here.
- Thank you.

348
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,509
Wendy, can I go
on my 15-minute Facebook break?

349
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,886
Wendy?

350
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,888
- Wendy?
- Huh?

351
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,015
- Are you dead?
- Oh...

352
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,850
Hey.

353
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,438
Man, I was dreaming
that I had a kangaroo pouch.

354
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,315
That sounds awesome.

355
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,819
It was like a purse.
I could hide my snacks in it.

356
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,279
You're like a human-kanga hybrid.

357
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,447
(CHUCKLES)

358
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,824
Ow.

359
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,909
I like to rub my breasts, too.

360
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,828
(GASPS)

361
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,752
Gary! Gar Bear!

362
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,714
Gar! Gary! Gar Bear! Gar! Whoo!

363
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,844
- Wendy!
- We're pregnant!

364
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,054
I'm with child! We're pregnant!

365
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,806
- Oh, my God!
- We did it!

366
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,395
My balls work! My balls work! Oh, my God!

367
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,689
Keep it in your lane, people.

368
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,566
- (SCREAMS)
- I did it! I did it!

369
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,527
- WENDY: We did it! We're gonna have a baby!
- We made a baby!

370
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,992
Shit!

371
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,828
Rosie, hurry up!
I need my lucky bra for my interview.

372
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,496
- Ro!
- (TOILET FLUSHING)

373
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,208
Two seconds, that's all I wanted.

374
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,420
Whoa. What's her deal?
I thought she finally got laid.

375
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,504
I don't know.

376
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,549
HOLLY: I love these hardwood floors!

377
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,011
This is it, baby. It's so perfect.
This is the one.

378
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,598
Are you insane?
We're not buying, we're just looking.

379
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,225
You want the house or the baby?

380
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,685
I want the house for the baby.

381
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,979
We can't afford it.

382
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,190
- Hi.
- Hi.

383
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,858
Hi.

384
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,653
Look, this is it.
This is the one we have to get.

385
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,906
We're just looking.

386
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,659
WENDY: Stop worrying.
GARY: Okay, okay.

387
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,954
It's just, he gives me a hard time
when I'm late, you know.

388
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,206
(RINGS DOORBELL)

389
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,999
Don't let him get into your head.

390
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,419
Yeah. Okay. You're right.
He can't ruin this. Not today.

391
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,879
No.

392
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,634
So, Dad.

393
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,511
Wendy and I have
a little announcement to make.

394
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,805
- We're pregnant!
- We're pregnant!

395
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,684
Oh, my God!

396
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,269
Isn't that great?

397
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,312
(ALL LAUGHING)

398
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,106
- So are we!
- What?

399
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,650
You're... What, are you... Are you kidding?

400
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,362
Yeah, hell's bells.
I guess it's congratulations to all of us.

401
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,449
Holy... I had no idea
that you guys were even trying.

402
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,034
- Uh-uh. We weren't!
- No.

403
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,246
Now, look, son,
there's no blanks in this pistol.

404
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,705
Boom!

405
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,626
You guys, you've been trying
for quite a while.

406
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,503
What two, three months?
Something like that?

407
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,338
Two years.

408
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,216
Not everything's a race, Dad.

409
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,509
- Gar.
- RAMSEY: No.

410
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,052
- Yeah. Right?
- No. Not everything.

411
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,471
Only things where you can come in first.

412
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,640
- Okay.
- RAMSEY: Oh, come on.

413
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,559
Gary, let's celebrate.
Let's go to Margaritaville.

414
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,561
- I don't wanna go to Margaritaville.
- Come on.

415
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,021
I don't wanna go to Margaritaville.

416
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,857
Oh, everybody wants to go to Margaritaville.

417
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,528
- I don't wanna go.
- Come on!

418
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,197
I'm gonna break out
the Don Julio "Blank-o."

419
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,867
"Blanco," Dad. "Blanco."
That's how you pronounce it.

420
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,495
And it's 11 :00 a.m., kind of early for shots.

421
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,373
- It's 5:00 somewhere.
- True.

422
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,750
- Don't be a pussy.
- You know what?

423
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,336
RAMSEY: Margaritaville is
abierto for business.

424
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,007
Wendy, I just have to say, I am just
so happy to have a baby expert in the family.

425
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,217
- Oh...
- Are you feeling anything yet?

426
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,343
Joy.

427
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,053
- Yeah.
- Some exhaustion.

428
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,557
A little nausea. Some heartburn.
And my boobs are killing me.

429
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,934
Plus, I have to pee every five minutes.

430
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,689
But it's just proof
that a miracle is happening inside of me.

431
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,357
So I'm so happy.

432
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,901
It is a miracle, isn't it?

433
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,738
I mean, I thought I'd have to
give up my Pilates, and my running

434
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,326
- and tennis and my strip-aerobics.
- Sure.

435
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,953
Oh, and kickboxing, just all my activities.

436
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,289
But it just turns out
I have all this extra energy.

437
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,583
- You know? You know?
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,084
Plus,

439
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,004
I'm like crazy-horny.

440
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,506
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean,

441
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,886
if I even get a whiff of Ramsey,
it's like I just have to pounce, you know?

442
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,554
And I gotta give this old boy credit.

443
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,892
He's still got that race car engine
that can go the distance.

444
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,103
- Hormones. What're you gonna do?
- Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,147
I don't know.
Maybe not talk about it at brunch?

446
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,358
WENDY: Yep, that's what I'd do.
GARY: That's what I'd do, too.

447
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,109
- (GRUNTING)
- We're on the same page on that one.

448
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,028
Honey, I know you can't have any

449
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,031
- so I'm gonna do one for you and the baby.
- The baby!

450
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,449
Sweet.

451
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,828
- Here's to the Coopers.
- Yeah, you know what, what the hell.

452
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,538
- WENDY: Yeah.
- (COUGHS)

453
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,291
Well, that was delicious.

454
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,127
Honey, I didn't make any of it.
You know Ramsey don't want me cooking.

455
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,837
- Your mom and I...
- Not my mom.

456
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,672
We sure wish y'all could stay longer.

457
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,467
Yeah. That's the thing. It's such a bummer,

458
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,261
but the missus
and little Mini Cooper and I,

459
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,513
we have an appointment.

460
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,348
- Yes, at...
- Walmart.

461
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,891
- For paint.
- Yeah. And mulch.

462
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:18,020
Well, you know what they say.
Money isn't everything,

463
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,314
but sure keeps you connected to your kids.

464
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,149
- So how much you need?
- Dad, I don't need any money.

465
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,651
- I don't need any money.
- Come on. How much you need?

466
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,820
No, I don't need anything at all.
Thank you so much.

467
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,072
- Man pats.
- Man pats, that's great.

468
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,615
Come here, baby, give your mama a kiss.

469
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,825
- What?
- Okay...

470
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,493
- Baby.
- Okay.

471
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,162
My baby boy. I'm so proud of you.
You've grown up so fast.

472
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,248
Okay, Gary. Gar.

473
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,707
- What? Yeah.
- Okay.

474
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,961
- Awesome. This was so much...
- All right. We'll see y'all later.

475
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,004
Yeah, great, this was a thing, you know?

476
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,923
- Congratulations!
- Yeah, congrats.

477
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,676
RAMSEY: Come back soon!
WENDY: Don't ever kiss her again.

478
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,846
MARCO: Well, um...

479
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,724
Okay. Are you sure you took the test right?

480
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,186
You pee on a stick. It's idiot-proof.

481
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,523
No, I know. It's just, you know, one time.

482
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,649
ROSIE: Yeah.

483
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,489
So what do you want to do?

484
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,825
I don't know.

485
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,910
What do you want to do?

486
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,788
Look, I don't know.

487
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:22,084
I just found out, okay? You're the girl.
Don't you get to decide?

488
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,044
Great, great. So then it's all on me?

489
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,130
No. No, I didn't mean...

490
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,843
Shit. Should we get married?

491
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,555
"Shit. Should we get married?" Yeah.

492
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,224
No, it's just,
when you put it like that, that's...

493
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,810
Oh. I'm sorry, Rosie.
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.

494
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,688
- I didn't mean to...
- Then don't ask the wrong questions.

495
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,817
- Just forget that I said anything.
- No.

496
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,237
Just forget it 'cause I'll figure it out.
Whatever it is, it's not your problem.

497
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,572
- Rosie!
- It's fine.

498
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,157
I have to get back to the truck anyway.

499
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,711
HOLLY: There he is!

500
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,547
Perfect. Okay, guys, look right here.

501
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,591
Big smile.

502
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,928
Aristotle! Good smile!

503
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,098
Okay, beautiful. You can pick up your prints
at the kiosk at the front.

504
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,935
KARA: All right, everyone.
Aristotle needs his down time.

505
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,895
Okay, can we all wave bye-bye?

506
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,647
ALL: Bye!

507
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,440
Thank you, nice friend.

508
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,484
So, how's Alex? Is he excited?

509
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,444
Yeah! Yeah! He's...

510
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,114
No. Actually, he's... I don't know.

511
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,450
I don't know. Maybe he's just not ready.

512
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,494
- They're never ready.
- Yeah.

513
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,621
Dude's group.

514
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,039
- What?
- Dude's group.

515
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,666
It's like Fight Club,

516
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,085
only there's no fighting,
everybody has babies,

517
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,170
they don't talk about what they do there.

518
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,256
I don't know what they do there
and I don't need to know.

519
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,259
All I know is that Craig started going
when I was pregnant with Henri

520
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,386
- and he's losing his shit.
- Yeah.

521
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,139
Now, he loves being a dad
and he never misses a Saturday.

522
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,142
You want Alex ready?
Send him to the dudes.

523
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,813
Your blood pressure is low
and you are in good health.

524
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,774
- And Dad's gonna keep you that way, right?
- Right.

525
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,734
- Look at these pamphlets.
- Thank you.

526
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,903
That's all we need to know.
Let's not go crazy with the research.

527
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,155
I love research. It soothes me.

528
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,450
Well then, you'll love the wall.
I'll see you both in a month.

529
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,202
Wow!

530
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,121
- Look at the wall!
- No, no, no, no.

531
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,373
I don't want to know about
everything that can go wrong.

532
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,874
Oh, my God! Look at this.

533
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,710
Okay, there's breast-feeding,
we have to know about this.

534
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,087
Cord-blood-banking,
this is very important these days.

535
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,757
You need to learn the Bradley Method.
And... What? Oh...

536
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,634
"Circumcision: Yes or No?"

537
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,845
Of course. How is that even a question?

538
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,973
Actually, a lot of couples are choosing
not to circumcise these days.

539
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,975
- NURSE: Interesting.
- Who said that?

540
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,477
The expert, honey.
So clearly, there's a question.

541
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,939
- That's why it says "Yes or No?"
- My answer is "Yes." Yes! Yes!

542
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,191
- My answer is, "I need to read about it."
- No more...

543
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,193
See you tomorrow, okay?

544
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,704
I'm not gonna forget it.

545
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,667
- Can I get a "I can do it"? You can do it!
- (GIRLS LAUGHING)

546
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,421
- I can do it!
- Who are you doing it for?

547
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,256
Oh, my God.
Damn, this show gives me the munchies.

548
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,674
JULES: This is the beginning
of the rest of your life!

549
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,426
COURTNEY: I so wanna do that slide-y thing.

550
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,261
MOLLY: I feel so bad, but it's hilarious.

551
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,723
- COURTNEY: No, no, this is just so funny.
- I hope they're having fun.

552
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,353
- Hi.
- Hi.

553
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,146
ROSIE: Marco, this is Courtney and Molly.

554
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,982
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- COURTNEY: And vice-versa.

555
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,694
I thought you said "Cute Marco."
Not "Hot Marco."

556
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,780
MOLLY: Well done, Rosie.

557
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,531
- Well done.
- You said I was cute?

558
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,033
- Ignore them.
- COURTNEY: Yeah, we did.

559
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,035
So, you're going, right?

560
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,953
No, I'm not. I've already got friends.

561
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,915
- But these guys all have babies.
- Yeah. That sounds terrible.

562
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,418
Craig goes. You like Craig.

563
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,380
I tolerate Craig at a barbecue.
Not as a forced play date.

564
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:01,887
- If you go, just once...
- Holly, I am trying to work here, okay?

565
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,766
- Oh, my God!
- I'll give you one right here, right now.

566
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,102
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

567
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,853
- Right here, right now?
- Yes.

(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

570
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,685
Hey, Craig.

571
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,062
Alex, Vic. Vic, Alex.

572
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,106
Welcome to Happy Hour.

573
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,775
Let's walk.

574
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,193
Ow!

575
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,698
I sense your fear, Alex. It's cool.

576
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,241
You're still on the other side.

577
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,202
Stay on that side, Alex.

578
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,995
This is the side
where happiness goes to die.

579
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,622
VIC: Don't mind Craig. He's had a bad week.

580
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,959
Kara just took a three-day business trip
and little Henry there just got sick.

581
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,962
- Here you go, big boy. Walk it off.
- Thanks.

582
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,216
By the way, when we're around Kara,
it's still "Henri." "Henry's" on the DL.

583
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,342
Hmm-mmm.

584
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,052
- Henri.
- You got that, Alex?

585
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,137
It's very important. That's the first rule.

586
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,598
- Don't talk about what we walk about.
- Rule #1.

587
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,766
Got it.

588
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,061
See, Alex, women pretty much control
the baby universe. And why not?

589
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,314
They carried the damn things,
pushed them outta their vaginas.

590
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,150
I never used to use that word
for that part of the body but, trust me,

591
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,611
once a baby comes out of it, it's a vagina.

592
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,987
- ALL: Yeah!
- It changes.

593

Here, we're free.
No one's looking over your shoulder.

594

If you put the diaper on backwards
or forget to heat the bottle up,

595
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,328
you go with it.

596
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,039
If you wanna ditch those carrot sticks
and feed your kid McNuggets

597
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,374
- you go for it.
- Who cares?

598
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,584
And if your wife named your kid "Henri"

599
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,711
and you wanna ignore
that silent-H bullshit...

600
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,339
- Bullshit!
- ...you're in a safe place. What's up, Henry!

601
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,715
- ALEX: Good to know.
- Henri. What is he, a mime?

602
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,927
Where does "Henri" come from anyway?

603
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,263
- Cirque du Soleil.
- So dumb.

604
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,974
It looks like
you've got your hands full there.

605
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,268
Yeah, I got four under five.

606
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,605
One more, we can run a full court.
Two more and I got pallbearers.

607
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,277
I got Evander here. Venus and Jeter
are my twins, and my main man Jordan.

608
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:08,198
Sure, twice a year, I think about the price
of college and cry in my car for a half hour.

609
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,076
But then I punch myself in the dick
and get over it.

610
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,704
- I can go for four more.
- Really?

611
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,997
Come on, Jordan. Keep up.

612
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,833
PATEL: Craig, do you have some sunscreen?

613
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,752
Relax. Sunburn is full of vitamin D.

614
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,463

PATEL: Hey, big guy!

616
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,967
Fellas.

617
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,176
What's up, bro?

618
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,555
Offspring. New guy.

619
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,639
What's up, man?

620
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,308
DAVIS: Everybody good?
GABE: Yeah, man.

621
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,185
So, D-Biscuit, haven't seen you
hanging around. Where you been?

622
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,147
- Costa Rica, bro.
- Central America, classic.

623
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,231
I had to do some work.

624
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,399
- Really?
- Working it.

625
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,360
- "Work!"
- This lucky bastard's a surf photographer,

626
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,237
- travels all over.
- Sweet.

627
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,489
What?

628
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,493
Costa Rica.

629
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,829
- Ooh!
- Oh!

630
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,333
The mountains of Costa Rica.

631
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,001
Whoa! Whoa!

632
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,377
That's classified.

633
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,838
Gotta watch it, Davis.
That one looks like a wife.

634
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,964
She got "wife eyes."

635
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,675
"Girlfriend tits," but definitely "wife eyes."

636
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,969
I've got to get better pictures on my phone.

637
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,387
Your phone ain't the problem, bro.

638
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,015
Come on. You guys are the ones
living the real dream.

639
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,100
I will Freaky Fridaywith you anytime.

640
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,145
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, Patel, what's the Camaro situation?

641
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,606
- You ready to sell that bad boy or what?
- Never.

642
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,815
- Never?
- Yeah.

643
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,692
Ask him when was the last time he drove it.

644
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,194
Plus, you can't even get
a car seat in that thing.

645
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,197
Patel's wife wants him to trade in
his '69 Camaro.

646
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,616
We have bets on how long he can last.

647
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,203
Gabriel, I understand you've embraced
the minivan, and that's yourjourney,

648
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,873
but I don't want to drive a vagina on wheels.

649
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,001
My vagina seats seven, comfortably.

650
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,461
I've been in it a million times.

651
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,214
Plus, Patel test drove a minivan
last week anyway.

652
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,757
- What?
- So?

653
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,217
That doesn't mean anything!

654
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,594
I look at houses with Holly,
but we're not buying one.

655
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,054
(ALL LAUGHING)

656
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,556
- Bro, bro, bro.
- What?

657
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,226
When your wife says
you're just test driving minivans,

658
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,560
you're buying a minivan.

659
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,729
And when she says
you're just looking at houses,

660
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,356
- you're buying a house.
- No, I'm not.

661
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,983
VIC: Oh, yes, you are.
ALEX: I'm not buying a house.

662
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,234
Check your receipts.

663
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,069
Welcome to escrow, bitch.

664
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,406
No, thank you. Have the Breast Day!

665
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,409
Janice! Janice!

666
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,494
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

667
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,247
You are looking at
one of the keynote speakers

668
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,749
at the next regional ABC Kids Expo.

669
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,711
- Shut up! No!
- Yes!

670
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,504
You're living your wisdom!

671
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,672
I know!

672
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,924
- She's speaking at the Expo!
- I'm speaking at the Expo!

673
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,345

- Oh! Oh!

675
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,230
Sorry, I just... Sorry.

676
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,691
No more cell phones.
Landlines only from here on out.

677
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,987
I am protecting my miracle.

678
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,740
Actually, that was my cell phone.

(AD JINGLE PLAYING)

680
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,962
Hey, guys. I'm sorry.
Can I just borrow Alex for two secs?

681
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,338
- What?
- This is it!

682
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,673
- Already?
- Yes!

683
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,300
It's supposed to be a year. Or more!

684

SOCIAL WORKER: (ON SPEAKER)
You got lucky. I'm sending his pictures now.

685
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,889
His name is Kaleb, he's six weeks old.

686
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,226
We don't have any family medical history
and probably never will

687
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,396
so you two will need to consider
whether that'll be an issue for you.

688
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,981
- Well...
- It's not!

689
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,153
- Okay. It's not.
- It's not.

690

Great, I'll leave you to it.

Oh, my God! Alex, look at him!
He's gorgeous!

693
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,500
Can you feel it?

694
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,128
We're gonna be a family.

Oh, yeah. Real soon.

696

- Here, let's take a picture by the sign.
- All right.

697
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,764
Okay, make sure you get the sign
and the house.

698
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,140
And us.

699

It's a boy.

- Wow!
- Honey!

701

Evan, I'm pregnant. That's surprise enough.

It's a boy.

A boy! That's so cute! I love boys!

709

- Wow.

That's okay.

- Oh. Well...

714
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,234
He kinda looks like
the Loch Ness Monster to me,

715
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,944
but I'll take your word for it.

- Yeah.

Don't say that. It's not your fault. Okay?

00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,519
- We've got proof.
- You got it? Okay.

774
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,812
Yeah. That's great. Thanks, Jules.

775
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,772
- Jules, that was great.
- Thank you.

776
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,858
We are so excited to have you
as our Spring cover mom.

777
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,984
Me, too.

778
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,069
Listen, can we just try to keep it positive?

779
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,737
You know, there's a lot of articles out there

780
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,657
that make women over 35 who are pregnant
feel like crap.

781
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,033
- Right.
- And I just don't want...

782
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,911
- No, it's gonna be so...
- Sorry, I've got to take this.

783
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,623
Hey, you. Did you watch it?

784
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,793
That circumcision video you sent me?
Give me a little heads up next time.

785
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,712
I was eating lunch. Now I'm scarred for life.

786
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,799
Yeah, gross! Nobody needs to see
how the sausage gets made, Jules!

787
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,552
I'm not gonna let somebody
hurt my baby like that.

788
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,888
Jules, trust me.
He's not even gonna remember it.

789
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,307
It's not even medically necessary.

790
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,643
And besides, it actually makes the penis
less sensitive.

791
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,897
That's why you do it. Give the kid
some endurance, a fighting chance.

792
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,524
He's perfect as he is. I don't get the point.
What is it?

793
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,650
Um...

794
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,152
Because I'm Jewish?

795
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,448
Half Jewish.
Christmas tree Jewish, that's what you said.

796
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,909
But my penis is full Jew.
This is my jurisdiction.

797
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,411
JULES: Okay, so I have no say in
what happens to my son?

798
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:43,124
Besides, if you had your foreskin,
maybe I would like you a little bit more.

799
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,292
How much more?

800
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,127
A tip more.

801
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:51,382
Look, I would feel shafted if we didn't do it.

802
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,384
Can we discuss this weirdness later?
I'm working.

803
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,178
Okay.

804
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,346
I love you. Bye.

805
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,597
Love you, too.

806
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,392
Well, if it's any consolation,
I like an uncut guy.

807
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,021
Yeah, I once banged my way
straight across Eastern Europe.

808
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,773
It was fun.

809
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,109
ALEX: I don't know, man. Out of the blue,
I got this call and suddenly...

810
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,569
- VIC: Jordan!
- ...we got this baby.

811
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,279
VIC: That's right, you got a baby.
ALEX: It's not good.

812
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,991
They said it was gonna be
at least a year or more, all right?

813
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,203
And that's the one thing you can count on
with adoption, right? Time.

814
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,038
Woo, woo, woo!

815
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,666
ALEX: I need that time to save, to get ready.

816
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,251
There's no such thing as ready.

817
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,753
You just jump on a moving train
and try not to die.

818
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,631
- (SIGHS) Great.
- What's up, man? You terrified?

819
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,424
Because you should be.

820
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,969
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get to the hospital room.

821
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:40,098
And she's gonna be laying there
with her legs splayed wide open.

822
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,308
My woman gave birth doggie-style.

823
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,812
They can do that, you know.

824
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,815
And then out is gonna slide a little miracle.

825
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,986
Half you, half her, your DNA all mixed
together in one magical baby cocktail.

826
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,654
The best day of your life.

827
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,573
That's sweet, but Alex here is adopting.

828
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,740
Oh.

829
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,701
Yeah, do it that way. No fuss, no muss.

830
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,369
VIC: Come on, Jordan!

831
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,832
- What if he hates me?
- He will.

832
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,751
I mean, what if he tries to kill me
in my sleep when he's 15?

833
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,628
Well, then I guess
you're not a very good father.

834
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,672
That's normal.
That's like every Greek tragedy.

835
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,840
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.

836
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,717
I'm serious, okay? I need help.

837
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,968
Dude, you're gonna be fine.

838
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,304
You've just got to get over
your fear of babies. They can smell fear.

839
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,180
Like bears or wives.

840
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,057
You need some practice.
Here, hold Henry for a second.

841
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,350
- ALL: No, no, no, no, no!
- Do not do that.

842
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,477
- Do not touch his baby!
- Shut up!

843
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,563
That kid is a grenade, and he will go off.

844
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,898
You know what, start with Evander here.
She never cries.

845
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,150
No, I'm cool, thank you.

846
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,569
She fell off the changing table last week,
didn't make a sound.

847
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,113
You dropped your kid off a changing table?

848
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,365
How was that even possible?

849
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,658
It's very possible.

850
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,703
It's much more common than you think.
But you know what? Rule number two...

851
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,288
- We don't judge.
- No judging.

852
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:49,000
Stuffjust happens, okay?
Last week my kid ate a cigarette.

853
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,044
I caught him playing in the dryer yesterday.

854
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,503
I picked up the wrong baby from day care.

855
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,255
Found my baby swimming in the toilet.

856
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,091
And for the record,
the roll-off did not happen on my watch.

857
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,719
- Ooh. Dodged a bullet.
- No judging.

858
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,221
- Come on. Come on.
- No, really, that's okay.

859
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,390
- Come on. Come on. Here you go!
- That's all right.

860
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,975
GABE: Good catch.

861
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
(CRYING)

862
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,020
Take her back.

863
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,229
Take her back!

864
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,066
I hope that adoption agency
has a return policy.

865
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,526
Big help, guys. Glad I came out.

866
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,737
It's Davis!

867
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,657
ALL: (CHANTING) Davis! Davis! Davis!

868
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,742
- Yeah, bro!
- D-Bone!

869
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,910
- What is up?
- Boom.

870
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,913
S'up fellas, kids, Jordan!

871
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,626
Dude, this kid is like Mickey Rourke
in The Wrestler.

872
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,254
I wish he was that well behaved.
He's more like Mickey Rourke in real life.

873
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,339
(ALL LAUGHING)

874
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,299
So tall.

875
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,926
- Been working out?
- Oh, yeah.

876
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,596
I missed out on high fives before.
I'll take one if you had a spare.

877
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,308
- I got you, Craig.
- Thank you.

878
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,852
- Sorry, Davis.
- All right, I'm out of here.

879
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,065
Nice job, Craig.

880
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,967
Kara, what time is it?

881
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,553
I've got 20 minutes to make it
to the crib sale at Babies "R" Us.

882
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,888
I've been totally cracking out on baby stuff.

883
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,600
Sneaker-socks.
I've got my 2-in-1 swing rocker.

884
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,063
What is with the face?

885
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,482
Holly, I'm sorry to tell you this

886
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,318
but we just had our budget meeting,

887
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,487
and I don't know
that we're renewing your contract.

888
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,992
I've got to cut down on all my freelancers.
You were the last one hired.

889
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,079
Wait. But this is my main job.

890
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,833
We're about to close on the house.

891
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:58,796
I'm doing what I can to keep you,
but it just isn't looking good.

892
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,631
(SIGHS)

893
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,268
Okay.

894
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,895
- Don't hate me.
- No.

895
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,109
Do me a favor?

896
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,363
Don't tell Alex
until I can find something else. Okay?

897
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,284
Okay.

898
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,036
- I'm sorry.
- No.

899
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,583
JULES: And reach! And push.
Okay now, break starfish formation.

900
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,878
Let's get back in position.
I want opposite sets. Crunch it up.

901
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,130
I want 10 of those on each side.
That's 20, people.

902
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,841
And I need a minute.
And don't think I won't be watching you.

903
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,009
Keep it moving.

904
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,931
"I'm Not Circumcising My Baby."
Well done. Well done. Front page.

905
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:53,392
Okay, look, I was gonna tell you.
I did not say this to them.

906
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,729
They overheard our private conversation.
I would never talk to them about us.

907
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,189
Why is this such a big deal to you?

908
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,733
Because I don't think that it's right.
And I'm his mother.

909
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,903
And I'm his father.
Parenthood is about compromise.

910
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,780
- Well, then compromise, Evan.
- I have.

911
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,866
I stay at your place.
We spend the holidays with your family.

912
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,452
Yeah, but I have sacrificed
my entire body for this.

913
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,246
So that means
you just get to win every argument?

914
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,915
No, that means that in every relationship...

915
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,417
What are you guys doing?
Come on! Pick it up!

916
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,255
In every relationship,
there's an alpha and a beta.

917
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,422
- And I'm the alpha.
- And I'm the alpha.

918
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,550
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!

919
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,717
Jinx.

920
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,766
You know, I'm just gonna
stay at my place tonight.

921
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,565
Hey, Jules! If you're interested,
I never got snipped.

922

With the side effects, you know.
Because I know that

966

at this point in the pregnancy, acne and

bleeding gums, constipation,
it's all totally normal. Totally normal.

she got herpes.

00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,114
Baby shower!

1077
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,414
MARCO: Rosie!

1078
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,416
Hey, Rosie?

1079
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,419
Hey, stop!

1080
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,047
Hey, Marco! I didn't see you.

1081
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,591
That's bullshit. You looked right at me.

1082
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,219
How you doing? You okay?

1083
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,388
What are you doing here?

1084
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,099
I'm just seeing my favorite band.
I asked how you were.

1085
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,940
Sorry, I can't do this.

1086
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,777
Rosie, I miss you.

1087
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,617
Yeah, I miss me, too.

1088
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,454
Well, I guess it just takes time.

1089
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,791
Marco! What are you doing?

1090
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,797
Really? How much time?

1091
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,132
She's just a friend.

1092
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,973
You lost your one steady gig
and you didn't even tell me.

1093
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,934
- Are you kidding me?
- I know. I'm sorry.

1094
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,310
I was just trying to get something else

1095
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,770
- before you noticed.
- Right.

1096
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:44,650
So it would be "Hey, I got some newjobs,"
and not "Holy shit, we can't afford our life."

1097
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,027
You know, I know you've been
so worried about saving and the house...

1098
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,695
Yeah, we're in this together.

1099
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,989
Here I am,
trying to get ready for something that's...

1100
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,157
Oh, my God!

1101
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,951
- What?
- I knew it.

1102
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,160
You're not even ready?

1103
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,162
Look, I'm not like you, okay?

1104
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,332
I can't just look at a picture
and feel some magical bond.

1105
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,167
And you lying to me isn't helping.

1106
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,337
- Look, I know, okay? I screwed up.
- Yeah. You did.

1107
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,049
I just...

1108
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,222
I just couldn't handle
another thing being my fault.

1109
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,434
Okay? I'm the one with the bad eggs.

1110
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:22,980
I'm the one who made us spend
the 401 K money on IVF.

1111
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:29,695
And I'm the one who can't do the one thing
a woman is supposed to be able to do.

1112
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,906
Holly, that's enough. Stop it.

1113
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,371
(SIGHS)

1114
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,961
You don't even want this, do you?

1115
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,213
I never said that.

1116
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,133
Not out loud.

1117
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,802
I can't believe you didn't tell him. (BELCHES)

1118
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,972
You know what? Glass houses, Craig!

1119
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,560
I know all about how you call your son
"Henry" when Kara's not around.

1120
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,937
- Holly, let's go. Let's go.
- You what?

1121
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,607
You don't like the name "Henri"?

1122
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:11,361
That is such a bold-faced lie!
He's obviously joking!

1123
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,322
Guess who's not getting any tonight?

1124
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,573
First rule, Alex!

1125
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,911
An obvious joke that Latins with their Latin,
spicy Latin sense of humor...

1126
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,579
You've seen Univision. He was kidding.

1127
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,915
When you look like him, you can have

1128
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,417
- a spicy sense of humor, stupid! All right?
- Get in the car.

1129
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,294
- He was obviously kidding.
- You get in the car!

1130
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,087
Don't you talk to me like that!

1131
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,507
CRAIG: Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

1132
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,509
- KARA: Do not touch me.
- I love you so much.

1133
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,969
- Shut up. I don't want to hear it.
- I love you so much.

1134
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,513
KARA: Stop talking!

1135
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,434
Okay, here we are in Atlanta, Georgia.

1136
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,687
Home of one of the audience favorites
from Season 4.

1137
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,189
Okay, we're popping in on him

1138
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,942
and see how he's maintaining his weight
and healthy lifestyle.

1139
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,401
Here we go.

1140
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,945
Drop the pig, Gary Cooper!

1141
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,279
- What?
- That's right.

1142
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,906
Jules! Oh, my...

1143
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,157
- It's a documentary?
- GARY: Hi!

1144
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,535
- No. It's a real thing. It's live.
- What do we got there?

1145
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,746
This isn't actually for me.
I was just picking this up for a friend.

1146
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,915
Remember this guy? See that guy?

1147
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,750
- You remember him?
- Oh, jeez.

1148
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,794
This is a one-time thing. It's a treat.

1149
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,546
That's what I thought you might say.

1150
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,673
We've been doing a little recon on you.

1151
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,967
- Nice sweater, by the way.
- GARY: Thank you.

1152
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,219
My wife is pregnant, Jules, okay?

1153
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:21,431
And you know, it's really common for guys
to put on a little weight as their wife does.

1154
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,059
It's called "Couvade Syndrome"
or "Sympathetic Pregnancy."

1155
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,019
No. It's called a crutch, Gary.

1156
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,355
Come on. We need to deal with
what the real issue is.

1157
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:31,400
You need to deal with it today,
not 100 pounds from now.

1158
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,818
Do you wanna be this guy again?

1159
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,236
Could we stop this, please?

1160
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,029
Because you don't even understand
what I'm talking about.

1161
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,657
- I don't understand?
- It's not an issue you have in your life.

1162
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,492
- Stop it.
- Ever since I've had this belly

1163
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,495
people think it's okay,
not just to have an opinion about me

1164
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,831
but to have an opinion about my baby.

1165
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:49,042
Seriously, in what world
is it okay for a complete stranger

1166
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,004
to comment on my son's penis
before he's even born?

1167
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,508
Jesus! Somebody, anybody,
please ask me what I'm craving.

1168
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,261
What are you craving?

1169
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,305
That looks pretty good.

1170
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,307
They are really good.

1171
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,641
They're not good for you,
but they're really good.

1172
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,186
Okay, we can cut that part out.
Are we still rolling? We good?

1173
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,521
We good? Okay, here we go.

1174
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:13,108
We are gonna deal with this issue, Gary,
in a very healthy way.

1175
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,736
- Okay
- I wanna hear you say, "I can do it!"

1176
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,362
- Just like you did in Season 4.
- Okay.

1177
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,656
- I wanna hear it. Say it! "I can do it!"
- I can do it!

1178
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,199
- I can do it! I can do it!
- I can do it!

1179
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,368
- You and I are gonna do it together, Gary.
- Okay!

1180
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,329
You and I, here we go.
We're gonna do lunges. Ready?

1181
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:28,540
And I want it deep, to the knee,
and squeeze back up.

1182
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,666
One more. Come on in.

1183
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,043
Let's go.

1184
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,504
- Jules! Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Oh, my God!

1185
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,007
- Are you okay?
- JULES: No! I'm okay. Oh, my God!

1186
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,843
J.J.: Gary. Someone's gotta call 9-1 -1.
GARY: Okay, yeah.

1187
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:40,969
Oh, God! No!

1188
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,062
What's up, guys?

1189
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,234
Guys! Hey! Whoa, whoa! Wait up.

1190
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,904
Freeze! Don't take another step!

1191
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:03,075
You told your wife
Craig likes to call Henri "Henry"?

1192
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,870
- She did not take it well.
- Okay, my bad, my bad. I'm sorry.

1193
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,706
We're here to let off a little steam.
Not break up families.

1194
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:14,211
Craig shouldn't have to see his kids only
on weekends 'cause you got a big mouth.

1195
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,421
Hey, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

1196
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,798
Darn right you weren't thinking.

1197
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,218
You wanna adopt? Adopt some new friends.

1198
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,136
Come on, guys. Really?

1199
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,930
Unbelievable!

1200
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,726
ALEX: Craig! Come on, Craig!

1201
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,479
Hey, don't think
that I won't punch you in the neck

1202
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,897
just 'cause I have an infant strapped to me.

1203
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,776
- I still have full range of motion.
- Look, I'm in crisis here. All right?

1204
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,613
We had to pull out of the house.

1205
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,783
Now Holly won't even talk to me.
She thinks I don't want the baby.

1206
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,284
Well, do you?

1207
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,994
Yeah.

1208
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,496
Really?

1209
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,459
Okay, I don't know. I don't know.

1210
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:58,964
I mean, you said
this is where happiness goes to die.

1211
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,549
Henry cries if you touch him.

1212
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,969
You found your kid in the toilet, right?

1213
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,764
Jordan is a spaz.

1214
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,893
VIC: You're the spaz.

1215
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,564
You just don't get it. We love being dads.

1216
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,484
When I was young,
I used to think I was so happy.

1217
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,154
But now, I know I'm happy.

1218
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,531
Exhausted

1219
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,450
but happy.

1220
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,660
I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

1221
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:32,414
Yeah. You don't know true love
till you've wiped someone's butt.

1222
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,750
GABE: Look at me, man.

1223
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:39,004
I love my baby so much,
I worry I'm gonna eat him.

1224
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:45,093
I am a lackluster husband
but an above-average dad.

VIC: You gotta figure it out, bro.

1226
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,348
You're on your own.

Burn!

1228

That's it? What about the "no judging" rule?

1229
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:01,026
'Cause I'm feeling a little judged right now.

1230
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,029
You broke the code, bro.

1231
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,156
Yeah! Go do your pull-ups!

The hospital said I could fly pretty soon.

1234
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,874
Nice try.

1235
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:19,586
You need to stay in bed so we can keep
your contractions under control.

- You're having this baby in Atlanta.
- You don't understand.

1237

I have to get back to L.A.
I have to finish my show.

1238
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,385
And what?
Have your water break at 30,000 feet?

1239
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,554
I climbed Everest, okay?

1240
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,225
I'm pretty confident I can keep this baby in
until I get home.

1241
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,060
I can do that, okay? I can do it.

1242
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,480
No. You can't. You need to stay in bed.

1243
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,565
Honestly, you don't have a choice.

1244
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:45,195
Now who can you call
to come take care of you?

1245
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,325
WENDY: Gary, honey, slow down!
You're practically sprinting!

1246
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,160
Okay. Okay.

Squeaks, are you sure you feel all right?

1248
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,915
Quit asking me! I'm great!

1249
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,418
Oh, my...
Sweet bird of paradise, what is that smell?

1250
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,295
Is that you?

1251
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,549
If you must know it's the baby.

1252
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,261
The baby has gas, okay?
The poor little thing can't help itself.

1253
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,847
- Kinda smelt like you, actually.
- Don't talk about our baby like that!

1254
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,181
- Hi.
- Hi.

1255
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,767
- Wow, thank you!
- Thank you.

The baby just peed itself a little.

Are you sure that speaking at the Kids Expo
next week is the best idea?

1258
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,448
I need support!

01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,702
Hey! Look who made it!

Come on back!
These girls have got it goin' on back there!

1261
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,333
You too, Gar. Come on!
Your mom's gonna be glad to see you.

1262
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,795
Still not my mom. She was born in '86.

1263
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,631

We saw you on that Lose it and Weep show.

1275

My wife and I cried every pound you lost.

- Yeah, yeah. I'm working on it.

- Here you go, pal. Drink up.
- No, thanks. I'm good.

So, what is it like
to be the son of a racing legend?

- Yeah!
- Do you ever get on the track with that guy?

He cheated. He cheated.

1285
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,866
No. It was just an exercise
in gamesmanship.

1286
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,952
And beatdownsmanship.

1287

doesn't mean you're gonna be a bad dad.

You will not ridicule, you will not compete.

- Neither am I.

Look. I want you to know that I get it.

1380
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,190
I'll probably never really understand
what you went through.

1381
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,859
But I don't want that to be the reason
we're not together.

1382
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,530
You were right,
I never even took you out on a real date.

1383
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,032
But I want to.

1384
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,036
I made these for you.

1385
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:34,622
Caramels.

1386
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,207
Piece-of-shit double boiler.

1387
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,128
I thought you said never again.

1388
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,797
Well, I made an exception.

1389
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,718
Um...

1390
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,012
Marco, the reason we're not together

1391
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,972
has nothing to do with the fact
we were gonna have a baby.

1392
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,515
It wouldn't have worked anyway.

1393
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,810
That's bullshit, Rosie.
Give me one good reason.

1394
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,688
Okay, you don't have a car.

1395
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,233
What? Says the girl
with the duct-taped Civic.

1396
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,194
- Seriously?
- Fine. It's not the car.

1397
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,114
- You got me.
- Then what, Rosie? What?

1398
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:10,325
'Cause we were great.

1399
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,953
You know, you have the worst taste in girls.

1400
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:18,458
You go for the most obvious,
least-interesting chef groupies ever.

1401
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,084
What does that say about me
if that's what you're into?

1402
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,712
Well, they can't all be you, now can they?

1403
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:25,423
- You wanna know what it is?
- Yeah.

1404
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:30,428
Every time I look at your face, it kills me.
Is that enough of a reason?

1405
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,473
Can we be done
with this conversation, please?

1406
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,393
Yeah. We can be done.

1407
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,437
Here.

1408
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,525
No. I don't even like caramels.
Just keep them. Take them.

1409
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,451
(SIGHS)

1410
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:58,498
- SKYLER: Holly, thank you for coming.
- Sure.

1411
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,917
- I can't wait to see this.
- It's a little big.

1412
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,836
- Well, you know we wanted it big.
- I know.

1413
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,798
All right, let's see it.

1414
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,634
You might wanna wait
till you get home to open it, I think.

1415
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,636
Mmm-mmm. No, I wanna see it right here.

1416
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,846
Oh. Okay.

1417
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:18,476
I did it exactly how you want.

1418
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,648
I love it! I love it!

1419
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:26,067
- You do? Good.
- I love it!

1420
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,611
Holly!

1421
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:30,988
And when you come back from Africa

1422
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,283
I'm gonna get you to take a picture of
these twins, and my stepson's baby.

1423
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,577
I mean,
you are gonna be our family photographer!

1424
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:38,955
Hey!

1425
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:40,873
I felt a kick in there!

1426
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,669
I'm gonna cover this up for you.

1427
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,462
Do you wanna feel?

1428
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:52,260
Sure.

1429
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,346
It's two in there, yeah?

1430
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,147
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

1431
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,319
It really is a miracle, isn't it?

1432
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,512
(MUSIC BOX PLAYING)

1433
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:47,023
- Wendy! There you are!
- Hi, here I am.

1434
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:51,486
And looking so fantastic!
We are so glad you agreed to speak.

1435
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:55,198
Hello, there! Aren't you just loving it?

1436
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,909
Experiencing everything for yourself?

1437
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,912
You must be ecstatic,
every second of every day.

1438
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:04,165
Every day, every second, totally ecstatic.

1439
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,586
JANICE: Hey, Wendy.

1440
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,882
We have to get some of these for the store.
It tastes like real nipple.

1441
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,009
Janice, I don't think I can do this.

1442
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,429
I mean, I can't go out there
and just act like everything's peachy.

1443
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,097
I really feel like crap.

1444
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,807
It's so hot.

1445
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,560
You can do it.
Just put one cankle in front of the other.

1446
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:28,147
Get out there and tell the truth
and share your wisdom.

1447
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:31,275
Janice, I just peed myself.

1448
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,319
- That's natural.
- No, Janice.

1449
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,281
Like a lot.

1450
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,118
And now, please welcome
our keynote speaker,

1451
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,955
Wendy Cooper of The Breast Choice!

1452
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,591
Hi. That's me, here?

1453
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,385
Okay.

1454
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,053
I sit here. Okay.

1455
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,638
(SIGHS)

1456
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:03,724
Janice?

1457
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,143
- Janice? Sweetie?
- What?

1458
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:08,312
- WENDY: Get my speech. Get my speech.
- (ALL LAUGHING) (WHISPERING)

1459

- In my pocket!
- What?

1460
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,317
Sorry.

1461
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,822
- Okay.
- My God.

1462
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,615
- Okay.
- JANICE: Hi there.

1463
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,201
- What's this liquid on my butt?
- (SHUSHING)

1464
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,704
No. Don't. Okay, thank you.

1465
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:26,330
JANICE: Maybe I just

1466
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:30,751
- peed myself 'cause I'm pregnant.
- WENDY: No. No.

1467
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,295
- No.
- JANICE: Yeah.

1468
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:36,299
And that's why I go to The Breast Choice
for all my pregnancy needs.

1469
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:38,050
Thank you, Janice.

1470
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,510
JANICE: Okay. Um...

1471
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,679
- Over to Wendy.
- Yep.

1472
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,223
- Tell them about your glow.
- Thank you, Janice.

1473
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:50,980
The magical, happy miracle,
experiencing pregnancy.

1474
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:58,404
Pregnancy's glow is made
from two scoops of angel kisses.

1475
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:04,160
It begins when you feel the first...

1476
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,080
Sorry.

1477
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,375
- Hormones! Right?
- (WOMEN CHUCKLING)

1478
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,589
I just find myself crying all the time.

(EXHALES)

1480
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,053
Okay, you know what? The truth...

1481
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:24,722
The truth is...

1482
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:30,394
I can't think with this thing on.
I'm sorry. I am so uncomfortable.

1483
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:34,273
I don't even recognize my body anymore,
you know?

1484
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:37,193
It's like I could fit 20 of my old bras

1485
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:41,072
into this one giant piece
of Granny spandex that's just...

1486
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,740
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

1487
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:44,575
Okay.

1488
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,035
Thank you.

1489
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,496
- Should we all take off our bras?
- I think we're good.

1490
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,165
- It's a bit small.
- No. Please don't.

1491
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:54,210
I'm sorry.
I didn't think about any of this stuff

1492
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:57,755
before I got pregnant.

1493
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,175
I just wanted the glow.

1494
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:07,598
The one they promise you on the cover
of those magazines, with the pretty lady

1495
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:13,270
looking down at her perfectly round belly
with that sweet smile.

1496
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,817
Well, I'm calling it.

1497
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:20,861
I'm calling bullshit.

1498
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:25,950
I'm calling bullshit on the whole thing.
Pregnancy sucks.

1499
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:29,286
Making a human being is really hard.

1500
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:32,123
I have no control over my body
or my emotions.

1501
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,791
Gar Bear. I'm sorry.

1502
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,460
All I wanna do is punch you in the face

1503
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,379
but I love you so much so I don't mean it.

1504
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,465
I love you too, Squeaks. You're doing great.

1505
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,970
I don't know about you
but I didn't get the glow. I got bacne

1506
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:50,266
and hemorrhoids.
Have you ever seen those?

1507
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,017
Don't do it. Don't take the mirror down there.

1508
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:56,313
And then I have these
purple stretch marks everywhere.

1509
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:00,025
And pressure hanging from my uterus

1510
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,446
that makes me walk like
I was kicked in the vag. I just...

1511
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:07,616
Okay. Maybe it's time to stop there.

1512
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,869
- Too far.
- That's the end.

1513
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:12,037
I couldn't think of another way
to describe it.

1514
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:13,831
That was really good.

1515
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:15,958
WENDY: (SIGHS) So...
JANICE: There we go.

1516
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:17,668
Thank you.

1517
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,673
They say when it's all over

1518
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,676
you forget the whole thing.

1519
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,846
I, for one, really hope that's true.

1520
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:31,515
(FARTS)

1521
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,478
Like that. I really hope I forget that.

1522
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,813
Wendy Cooper, everybody.

1523
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,776
...hanging from my uterus

1524
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,820
that makes me walk like
I was kicked in the...

1525
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,323
No. I don't think you went too far at all.

1526
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,617
Seriously. No one's even gonna see this.

1527
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,702
This is gonna ruin my business.

1528
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,580
This is all gonna blow over.

1529
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:58,417
It's not a big deal at all for sure.

1530
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,003
WENDY: Oh, God.

1531
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,714
Gar. Oh, no.

1532
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,967
It's a mob. It's a mob, Gar.
Look at them, they look angry.

01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,312
We're having a baby!

1690
01:27:57,897 --> 01:27:59,606
- Okay, okay, good.
- The Baby Center.

1691
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,816
The Baby Center. So we're in the right place.

1692
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:01,858
- WENDY: Hi.
- Hi.

1693
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:02,943
- We're the Coopers.
- Hi.

1694
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,027
- We pre-registered.
- Yeah.

1695
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,112
Okay. Got you.

1696
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,322
- I've got my birth plan!
- Aren't you organized.

1697
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,116
Skyler Cooper.

1698
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:11,660
- Another Cooper?
- We reserved a deluxe suite.

1699
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:12,911
And this is your father?

1700
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,621
He's my husband.

1701
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,040
Sorry. Husband. Great.

1702
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,375
We're having a baby.

1703
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:19,876
I know you.

1704
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,378
I can do it!

1705
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:24,548
That's it. With your help,
I've lost eight pounds.

1706
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:26,383
Can you help me do the same?

1707
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,719
Do you happen to have
a room service menu?

1708
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,846
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how is your pain right now?

1709
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,806
Two.

1710
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,516
All right. Tough girl.

1711
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,351
Maybe a three.

1712
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,688
Was that a contraction? I barely even felt it.

1713
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,941
Sure was. What's your pain level,
on a scale of 1 to 10?

1714
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,070
Like a zero to a one.
Because I'm smiling, we're smiling.

1715
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,197
You're number one, baby.

1716
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:51,742
Okay, who wants to have a baby?

1717
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,410
Where the hell have you been?

1718
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:56,246
Okay, let's talk pain.
On a scale of 1 to 10, what do you feel?

1719
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,915
What are you, I think, maybe a six?

1720
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,710
What? I'm an eight! Frown, no tears. Eight.

1721
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:02,961
Are you getting an epidural?

1722
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,172
Do I look like somebody
who wants to drug my baby?

1723
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,590
Are y'all planning an epidural?

1724
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:09,426
- I don't know. I guess we'll see how it goes.
- Whatever.

1725
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:10,886
So do you want an epidural?

1726
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,888
Hell, no. Let's do this.

1727
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:14,097
That's right.

1728
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,725
EVAN: Here comes another one.
NURSE: Okay, breathe.

1729
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,101
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

1730
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:23,440
BOTH: Ooh! Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow!

1731
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,609
(GROANING)

1732
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,781
- Gar?
- Yeah?

1733
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,576
I changed my mind. I want the epidural.
I want it, Gary.

1734
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,661
No, no, honey. No, no, no.
You said you didn't want it

1735
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:40,248
and you said that even if you did ask for it,
that would just be the crazy talking...

1736
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,793
Gary! Get me the juice!

1737
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:45,337
That seemed a little crazy.
I will get you the juice.

1738
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,797
I need it, Gar.

1739
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,466
I'm sorry, baby.
Just don't come back without it, okay?

1740
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:50,759
- RAMSEY: No anchovies on that, right?
- Hey, Dad!

1741
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,261
Hey, son! Hey, you, too?

1742
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,679
It's not a race, Dad.

1743
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,640
(LAUGHING) That's my son.

1744
01:29:56,682 --> 01:29:58,308
Hey! Are you the anesthesiologist?

1745
01:29:58,476 --> 01:29:59,476
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

1746
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,311
My wife changed her mind.
She needs the epidural right now.

1747
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,480
I've got five women in front of her.
It's gonna be a little while.

1748
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:04,981
No, no, no, no. That's not okay.
She's in pain.

1749
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,149
Everybody's in pain.

1750
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:09,194
Okay, hold on. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1751
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:10,779
- Wait, wait! Wait!
- Really?

1752
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:13,865
- Dad! Dad!
- Yeah?

1753
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,450
I need your money roll.
I need your money roll.

1754
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,327
Sure. How much you need?

1755
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,329
Yeah. Okay.

1756
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,291
The crazy lady in 408 is next.

1757
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:24,835
She most certainly is, sir.

1758
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:29,798
You're gonna feel a little bit of pressure
in one or both legs. That's normal.

1759
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,050
You are so clutch, baby.

1760
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:34,136
So clutch.

1761
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,721
You're at eight centimeters.

1762
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,683
- Two more! I can push!
- Two more.

1763
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:41,476
Nine centimeters.

1764
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:42,644
Great!

1765
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,146
What is that in inches?

1766
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:47,399
You're at ten centimeters,
but the baby's not coming.

1767
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,860
We need to prepare for a C-Section.

1768
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,945
No, no, no, no. I have a birth plan.

1769
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:53,029
Yeah, we...

1770
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,448
I want to push. I want to push.

1771
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:57,534
I know, Wendy, but the baby's heart rate
is falling. We need to move now.

1772
01:30:57,743 --> 01:30:58,785
It's going to be okay.

1773
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:03,039
But I typed it. It's typed.
The birth plan, it's ready to go.

1774
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,917
I'm ready to push. I wanna push.
Please, I wanna push.

1775
01:31:06,502 --> 01:31:07,544
Please?

1776
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:10,881
So, Jules, you've been doing well.
Let's take a look, all right?

1777
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,509
Okay. Let's do this.

1778
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:15,969
Push.

1779
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,304
(GROANING)

1780
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:18,638
Here we go.

1781
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,474
- Let's do it.
- Say "I can do it."

1782
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,600
- Push.
- I can do it.

1783
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:22,726
Say "I can do it."

1784
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:24,186
- I can do it!
- Come on, Jules. Yeah!

1785
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:27,439
I can do... No, I can't do this!

1786
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,983
Oh! (SOBBING)

1787
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,610
Okay, Skyler.

1788
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,779
You're doing great, Tater Tot.
Just hang in there.

1789
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:38,408
Bear down and give it all you've got.
Ready?

1790
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:40,535
Okay, hang on. I have to sneeze.

1791
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,205
(SNEEZES)

1792
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:44,247
(BABY CRYING)

1793
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,167
Wow. That's one baby out.

1794
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,211
One down, one to go.

1795
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:55,383
(SCREAMING)

1796
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,678
You did this to me!

1797
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:03,475
That pig is wearing flippers. (CHUCKLING)

1798
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,103
Clamps.

1799
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:10,106
I love morphine.

1800
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:13,818
Don't you love morphine, Gar?

1801
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,070
GARY: Yeah.

1802
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,614
We should get some for the house.

1803
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:19,407
Okay.

1804
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,952
That's good. That's good. Almost there.

1805
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,497
You're doing great, Squeaks.
This guy's got a real steady hand.

1806
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,291
- You're fine.
- Yeah.

1807
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:32,170
(BABY CRYING)

1808
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,089
Here he is.

1809
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:36,550
Oh...

1810
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,888
Congratulations.

1811
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:44,432
Congratulations, Daddy.

1812
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:46,726
Oh.

1813
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:48,937
Okay, Jules. This is it. Are you ready?

1814
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:52,274
All right. I need you to bear down and push.
All right? Here we go.

1815
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:53,692
- Okay.
- Push! Push! Push!

1816
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,110
Come on, Jules. You can do it.

1817
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:57,445
- (SCREAMING)
- DOCTOR: All right. All right.

1818
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:58,738
I see his head, Jules.

1819
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,575
- Give me one more giant push, all right?
- EVAN: He's beautiful.

1820
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:04,035
I need the shoulders out. And push!

1821
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,623
That's good. That's good.

1822
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:12,043
All right.

1823
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,088
And it's a girl!

1824
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:18,842
It's a girl!

1825
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:19,926
(LAUGHING)

1826
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,887
Oh! (LAUGHING)

1827
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,889
- A girl's good. I like girls.
- It's a girl.

1828
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,437
Oh! There she is. Hi.

1829
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,730
(CRYING)

1830
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,195
Hi, baby girl.

1831
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:42,991
Hello, Emerson. I'm your mommy.

1832
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,619
Emerson is cute, right?

1833
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:47,329
Emerson. I love it.

1834
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,713
Jules, I knew you could do it.

1835
01:33:58,507 --> 01:33:59,841
Thank you.

1836
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,010
Hi.

1837
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,264
Hi, sweetheart.

1838
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:13,772
Squeaks, say hi to little Theo.

1839
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,443
Say hi to Mama. Can you say hi to Mama?

1840
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:22,947
Say hi to Mama. Yeah, that's Mama's finger.

1841
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:25,992
- Wendy? Hey, guys.
- We need more suction here.

1842
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,118
DOCTOR: We're getting
some high blood pressure.

1843
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:28,244
GARY: Is she supposed to be falling asleep?

1844
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:29,287

Mr. Cooper, I think you need to step out.
