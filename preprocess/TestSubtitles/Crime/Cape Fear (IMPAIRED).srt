I always thought that
for such a lovely river,

3
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,958
the name was mystifying:
"Cape Fear."

4
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:54,063
When the only thing to fear on
those enchanted summer nights...

5
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,574
was that
the magic would end,

6
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,510
and real life
would come crashing in.

We're supposed to read

which is a kind
of reminiscence,

and we have to attempt
something in the same style.

00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,431
Maybe this drama teacher
from the college...

156
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,765
will get her excited
about something.

157
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,304
About him, probably.

158
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,806
Why'd they have to make
such a stink,

159
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,173
like she was on
heroin or something?

160
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,871
I mean,
what's marijuana?

161
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,779
You and I smoked
dope in our time.

162
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:06,045
In some cultures,
it's considered
almost a sacrament.

163
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,348
I realize in ours
it's forbidden.

164
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,948
Right up there with
incest and necrophilia
and bestiality...

165
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,118
Honey, honey,
honey.

166
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,128
Worship of idols,
cannibalism.

167
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,357
Do that again.
What?

168
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,399
Do that again.

169
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,533
<i>[Fireworks Exploding]</i>

170
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,310
<i>Sam, somebody's</i>
<i>out there!</i>
What?

171
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,916
<i>Leave the light off.</i>
<i>Leave it off.</i>

172
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,054
I saw him when the
fireworks went off.

173
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,284
[Whispering]
What?

174
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,918
I think I talked to him
this afternoon.
You know him?

175
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,995
I want you the hell
off my property!

176
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,909
He's gone.

177
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,412
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>He said, "I'm gonna make</i>
<i>you think about loss, "</i>

178
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,650
or "I'm gonna make you
learn about loss."

179
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,420
Something like that.

180
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,926
That's very poetic.

181
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,930
Who is he, and where
did he come from?
<i>He's from...</i>

182
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,263
Leigh, get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

183
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,769
<i>He doesn't</i>
<i>mind me at all.</i>

184
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,169
<i>It's your dog.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

185
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,730
He shouldn't be up
on the table.

186
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,778
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>dog hairs in your tea.</i>
Get down.

187
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,975
<i>Where's he from?</i>
He's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers.

188
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,143
What was he
in prison for?

189
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:32,020
I think it was battery.
<i>You think it</i>
<i>was battery?</i>

190
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,994
Did he batter a man?
Did he batter a woman?
<i>I don't know.</i>

191
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,896
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kinda...

192
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,662
<i>I really</i>
<i>don't remember.</i>

193
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,000
What does he
want with you?

194
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,632
<i>He's just tryin'to bug us.</i>
<i>Just messin'around.</i>

195
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,575
He's an ex-con,
so he's just...

196
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:57,240
You know, he's probably
upset at the lawyer.

197
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,444
Yeah, your clientele.
<i>Yeah.</i>

198
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,550
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>
Bye, Danny.

199
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,855
<i>You look tired.</i>
Thanks.
I needed that.

200
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,360
I don't want
to alarm her,

201
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,863
but I'd rather Danny
didn't wander alone...

202
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,161
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods,

203
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,429
at least till I've
started a few things.

204
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,495
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?
Ben, our guard dog?

205
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,437
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?

206
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,909
<i>Just tell her.</i>
<i>I hardly know anything</i>
<i>about the man.</i>

207
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,640
I don't mean his biography,
just there's some creep around.

208
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,740
If you see him again,
call the cops and
then call me.

209
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,842
What about a weapon?

210
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,548
In case things get
exciting around here.

211
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,956
Would you feel more secure with
a loaded gun in the house?

212
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,518
We'd end up using it
on each other.
Or Danny would.

213
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,793
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.

214
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,697
<i>He doesn't want</i>
<i>to go right back.</i>

215
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,265
Call Lee Heller.
Lee's a colorful character,

216
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,468
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer in the state.

217
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,670
Good.
<i>Get me Lee Heller.</i>

218
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,545
You defended this guy,
right?
<i>Right.</i>

219
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,550
So what makes you think
he wants to harm you?

220
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,279
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.

221
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,914
The guy comes up.
We have a conversation.

222
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,015
He says to me,
"You're gonna learn about loss."

223
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,462
That'd hardly qualify under
the terrorist threat statutes.

224
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,363
Come on, Tom!
The guy's an ex-con!

225
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,368
You know as well as I do
what that means.

226
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,303
Last night, there he was
behind our house.

227
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,341
- Attempted b and E.
- No, not exactly.

228
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,867
He was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

229
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,744
<i>That's not even</i>
<i>trespassing, Sam.</i>

230
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,216
What can I say?
Get a restraining order.

231
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,652
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in ten days.

232
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,021
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Anything I can do.</i>

233
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,255
Tom, 14 years ago...

234
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,422
in this case,

235
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,729
I had a report
on a victim.
<i>It was a rape case.</i>

236
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,599
That's right, rape and
aggravated sexual battery.

237
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,298
I had a report
on this victim,

238
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,673
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.

239
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,475
And, uh...
I buried it.

240
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,447
Whew.

241
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,487
<i>Anybody else</i>
<i>know?</i>
No, I buried it.

242
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,649
I didn't show it to the client,
to the prosecution.

243
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,126
But if you had seen
what this guy had
done to this girl...

244
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,561
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have...

245
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,067
the assistance of counsel
for his defense."
<i>I know the 6th Amendment,</i>

246
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,999
but I believe in
the 6th Amendment.

247
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,128
That's why I left
the public defender's office.

248
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,142
Some folks just don't have
the right to the best defense?

249
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,678
<i>Of course they deserve</i>
<i>the best defense!</i>

250
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,182
But if you had seen what
he did to this girl...
<i>Buried the report.</i>

251
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,308
If it was your
own daughter, Tom...

252
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,786
Buried the report.

253
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,415
Jesus, Sam.

254
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,289
Oh, God.

255
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,098
But I don't see
how he could know that.

256
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,100
He was illiterate.

257
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,001
I had to read everything to him:
The probable cause affidavit,

258
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,064
the arrest reports,
everything.

259
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,940
There's no way
he could know that.

260
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:28,416
Danny, it's so quiet out here
and the light's so perfect.

261
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,862
Why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?
<i>Why?</i>

262
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,922
I told you why.

263
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,232
Well, is it because
he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

264
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,535
What do you know about that?
A flasher?

265
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,406
You don't think I've
been flashed before?

266
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,106
I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you've been flashed.

267
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,116
If you want to come out,
come on out.

268
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,119
Do whatever you want.

269
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,951
Oh, but don't
go outside.

270
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,894
<i>Afternoon,</i>
<i>Counselor.</i>

271
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,702
What do you want,
Mr. Cady?

272
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,732
<i>[Cady]</i>
<i>Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm!</i>

273
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,540
They're great at that age,
ain't they?

274
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,548
All those discoveries
ahead of them.

275
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,811
You're lucky,
Counselor.

276
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,149
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

277
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,088
After I went inside,
her mama told her I was dead.

278
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,091
Which,
in a way, I was.

279
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,960
Look, Mr. Cady,
I realize that you suffered.

280
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,365
I understand your problem,
but I mean, why me?

281
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,131
I was your lawyer.
I defended you.

282
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,537
Why not badger the D.A.
Or the judge?

283
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,008
"Badger"?
Why not them?

284
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,513
Badger.
Why not?

285
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,038
Best I remember, they was just
doin' right by their jobs.

286
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,314
I didn't do my job?
Is that right?

287
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,254
I pleaded you out to
a lesser included offense.

288
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,758
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

289
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,525
I'd have been up for parole
either way in seven years.
<i>Rape is a capital offense.</i>

290
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,122
You could've gotten life.
You could've done death.

291
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,192
You could be sittin' on
death row right now.

292
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,907
I learned to read
durin' my stretch.

293
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,603
First,
<i>Spot Goes to The Farm,</i>

294
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:32,048
then <i>Runaway Bunny,</i>
then law books, mostly.

295
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,176
Did you know that after
I discharged you,

296
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,345
I acted as my
own attorney?

297
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,651
Applied several times
for an appeal.

298
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,659
No, I didn't
know that.

299
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,319
Mm-hmm.

300
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,523
So, here we are...
two lawyers,

301
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,658
for all practical purposes,
talkin' shop.

302
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,227
How much do you want,
Mr. Cady?

303
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:57,298
How much do I want what?
How much money
do you want?

304
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,005
Money? Counselor,
do I look destitute to you?

305
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,243
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

306
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,252
You ever been a woman?

307
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,778
A what?
A woman.

308
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:16,658
Some fat, hairy,
ugly hillbilly's wet dream.

309
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,762
I realize that you suffered.
There's no question about that.

310
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,271
You don't know what
sufferin' is, Counselor.

311
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,899
Like it says
in Galatians 3:

312
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:34,878
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"

313
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,675
I learned from the get-go
in the joint...

314
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:41,618
to get in touch with the
soft side of myself,
the feminine side.

315
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,658
Well, I'm open to some
sort of discussion...

316
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,695
on compensation.

317
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,129
What shall be my
compensation, sir,

318
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,532
for being held down and
sodomized by four white guys?

319
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,594
Or four black guys?

320
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,833
Shall my compensation
be the same?

321
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,309
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?

322
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:10,337
How about
$ 10,000 in cash?

323
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,048
Do l...

324
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,720
Let's just
break that down.

325
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,226
That figure just came
to the top of my head.
Let's break it down.

326
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,560
For argument's sake,
let's say $20,000, $30,000.

327
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,361
I'll tell you what,
let's say $50,000.

328
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,801
$50,000 into 14 years.

329
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,704
Fourteen years
times 365 days...

330
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,709
I'd say is about
5,000 days.

331
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:43,407
You divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $ 10 a day.

332
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,144
That's not even
minimum wage!

333
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,552
To say nothing about the family
that I lost, the respect.

334
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,852
I don't think you really,
really understand...

335
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,119
what we're talkin'
about here.

336
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,127
Fourteen years.

337
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,856
<i>[Beeping]</i>

338
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,057
Whoops!
Uh-oh!

339
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,862
Gotta git. I'm late
for another appointment.

340
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,409
Sam, my man,
I got some good news.

341
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,740
I got the bank,
the account number.

342
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,042
I'll call your
son-in-law's lawyer.

343
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,446
<i>Mr. Bowden?</i>
<i>Your wife's on line one.</i>

344
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,644
Ask her to hold.
I gotta make a call.

345
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,983
I wouldn't make that call.
The way I'd handle...

346
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,988
<i>Mr. Bowden,</i>
<i>she says it's urgent.</i>

347
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,461
Yeah?

348
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,966
<i>[Leigh]</i>
<i>These kind of horrible,</i>
<i>high-pitched howls.</i>

349
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,094
They sounded like
he was screaming.

350
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,368
And then Danny came
running in, and...

351
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,968
I called the vet.

352
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,503
And then it was
so weird, because...

353
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,947
it was like he was
winding down,

354
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,923
just winding down
like an old clock.

355
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,858
And then all of a sudden
he just stopped.

356
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,123
He had this kind of...

357
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,861
his eyes just wide open,
and this kind of...

358
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,436
surprised look.

359
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,899
<i>And then...</i>

360
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,275
And then he died.

361
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,980
He just died, before
the vet even got here.

362
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,751
What'd the vet say?

363
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,657
That he was poisoned.
<i>Poisoned?</i>

364
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,661
What kind of a poison?

365
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,631
I don't know
what kind of poison.
<i>Jesus, Leigh!</i>

366
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,691
I told you not
to let him out!

367
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,033
- I didn't let him out!
- Then how?

368
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,630
<i>[Door Slams]</i>

369
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,200
I've got an English Setter,
so I don't cotton
to dog killers.

370
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,543
Trouble is, poisoning
a dog is just a fine.

371
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,742
But if he's unemployed,

372
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,809
he's gotta have money
or we'll bust him for vagrancy.

373
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,253
We'll give him
a full-body strip search.

374
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,383
Jerk a knot
in his tail.

375
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,519
All right.

One-way mirror.

He doesn't know

Yeah, that's him.

00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,038
Get the shirt off.

<i>Come on,</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,663

<i>Put the arms out straight.</i>

00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,618
Sheesh.

392
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,354
I don't know whether
to look at him or read him.

393
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,265
<i>Stand still.</i>

<i>One more step for you.</i>
<i>You know the routine.</i>

395
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,407
<i>Against the wall.</i>

396
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,877
We searched his apartment.
His car registration,
everything's in order.

397
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,848
<i>There's no guns or any weapons,</i>
<i>but we found these.</i>

398
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,678
<i>Cady's</i>

<i>$30,000?</i>

400
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,058
His mother died,
the farm got sold.
He got the proceeds.

401
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,222
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?

402
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,131
<i>We nail him for the dog.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

403
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,136
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.

404
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,401
No, uh...
we didn't let the dog out.

405
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,635
Cady came
into your house?

406
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,405
That's illegal entry
with intent!
No, no, no.

407
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,209
But he didn't come
into the house.

408
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,445
I don't know exactly
how he did it,

409
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,181
I just know
that he did it.

410
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,018
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.

411
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,650
You're a lawyer.
You damn-well know that.

412
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,627
<i>Get off the pants.</i>

413
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:33,503
He's gonna screw up.
The Sheriff assured me
that they always do.

414
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,335
He's gonna get
the message in
no uncertain terms.

415
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,375
I'd still like
to kill him.

Mmm, hot as a firecracker

Watch my arm.
It might be broke.

429

You have no right to be
pushin' me around.

430
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,517
I was just watchin'
the parade.

<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>I'm settled down.</i>

436
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,439
Sam, what are
you doing?
It's nothing.

437
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,707
Who was that?
Let's go.

438
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,079
<i>The fellow with the tie.</i>
<i>His wife took him away.</i>

439
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,675
<i>I think he really</i>
<i>hurt his arm.</i>

440
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,687
Mom.

441
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,618
<i>That's a strong drink</i>
<i>you've got there.</i>
<i>You said it.</i>

442
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,595
Just put a goldfish in it
and you'll be fine.

443
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,824
You seem to be having
a good time.

444
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,065
I've been
practicing.
<i>Practicing for what?</i>

445
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,073
<i>How to fall on</i>
<i>the floor?</i>
A life of debauchery.

446
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,472
Debauch...

447
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,069
Debauchery.
It's a three-syllable word.

448
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:59,845
Making fun of me?
That's okay, no problem.

449
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,716
I made you blush.
Blush?

450
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,416
You're now the color
of your shirt: Scarlet.

451
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,025
I had no business
getting stuck on a
guy who was married.

452

No, really,
but what did you do?

488
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,945
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant.

489

to arrest us,

this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me,

He's clever, cleverly so
that the law can't touch him.

605
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:18,801
I believe he's able to
slip into the house undetected.

606
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,538
Although, is he out?
I can't tell.

607
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,546
He's either out or in.
I'm not sure.

608
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,206
I can't see
through walls.

609
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,217
I'm not askin' you
to see through walls.

610
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,651
Why can't anybody
do anything for me?

611
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,951
What good are cops
and laws...

612
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,481
Sam, Sam, calm down.
Let me explain something.

613
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,427
The system is set up to handle
generalized problems...

614
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,761
like burglary
and robbery.

615
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,767
But if some lone creep targets
you for some obscure reason,

616
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,065
the system's slow
and skeptical.

617
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,162
It's pathetic, even.

618
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,903
<i>What's your connection</i>
<i>with this fellow?</i>

619
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,411
I was his lawyer,
his public defender.

620
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,504
But you shafted him
somehow.

621
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,379
Well, at least that's
the way he perceives it.

622
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,113
I don't care what you did.
What did he do?

623
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,020
He raped
a 16-year-old girl.

624
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,422
Do you have a daughter
around 16?

625
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,484
She's 15.

626
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,725
<i>I'll do a background check,</i>
<i>follow him for a week,</i>

627
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,096
and write you up
a risk assessment.

628
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,261
Great, great.
Now the cops...
I can find him.

629
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:24,740
Just take it easy,
stay calm.
<i>All right.</i>

630
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,834
Danny, you can just
relax because...

631
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,871
your daddy has a private
investigator on the payroll.

632
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,883
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

633
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,887
<i>What's your feeling about him?</i>
<i>What, Sam Spade?</i>

634
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:42,449
Mickey Spillane?
Peter Gunn?
Dirty Harry?

635
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:46,155
<i>Perry Mason?</i>
No, Perry Mason
was for lawyers.

636
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,825
The minute I walked in
this guy's office,
I felt relaxed.

637
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,891
This guy's
totally in charge.

638
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,130
Kersek deals with
these types for a living.

639
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,138
He looked like
he was gonna enjoy...

640
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,333
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,673
- Yes?
- It's me.

642
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:05,113
After you left,
I had this conversation with
a C.O. At Statesboro Prison.

643
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,447
<i>Seems our man Cady had</i>
<i>a job in the kitchen.</i>
Right.

644
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,148
<i>There was this other inmate</i>
<i>working there with him.</i>
Right.

645
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:16,352
Hated Cady's cigar smoke,
and was always moanin' about it.

646
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,658
They found him with his neck
broke and his tongue bit off.

647
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,789
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

648
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,139
<i>[Kersek]</i>
<i>They never could place Cady near</i>

<i>Get a good night's sleep.</i>

652
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:42,117
<i>Who was that?</i>
Our private eye.

653
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,950
I thought we were
relaxed now.

654
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,758
<i>New essex county</i>

Hi, Lori.
It's me, Sam.

657
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:01,567
Lori, I just feel god-awful
you got dragged into this.
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

658
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,972
If I had any idea that Cady
would hurt you to get at me,

659
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,534
I would've warned you.
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

660
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,172
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>
Yep, yep.

00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,344
<i>I'm so sorry</i>

I feel the same way.

664

<i>I think it's probably</i>

666
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,798
<i>I thought that maybe</i>

667
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:33,769
<i>I'm really gonna</i>
<i>miss you, though.</i>
Excuse me, Lori.

That sounds

<i>Yeah?</i>

All right, bye.

00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,111
Well, I just don't know

that insipid tone

sophomoric

Who was that, huh?
The girl that got beat up?

675
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,162
Yes, Lori Davis.
I already told you.

676
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,596
She works at
the County Courthouse.

677
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,430
And what?
You're fucking her?

678
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,764
Oh, no.

00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,637
Interesting choice, Sam.
Calling from our bedroom phone.

680
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,938
<i>Why is it</i>
<i>that whenever...</i>

681

I have a private

00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,413
you assume that I'm
fucking someone?

683
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,950
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?

00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,248
<i>Yes, that's why</i>
<i>he chose her.</i>

<i>[Leigh]</i>
<i>Christ, what a waste.</i>

696
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,855
The humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty secrets...

697
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,289
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.

698

<i>Why did you bother?</i>

00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:10,027
<i>Because you asked me...</i>
I mean, why did you bother?
Why did you bother!

700
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,625
Why did you bother
with you and me?

701
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,365
With the marriage?

702
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,306
Uprooting me and Danny,
moving?

703
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,742
That's what we decided to do!
You said you wanted to get out!

704
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,508
You don't get it.
What is it
I don't get?

705
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:28,381
<i>- What don't I get?</i>
<i>- Why put us through that!</i>

706
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,186

It's Danny.

707
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,955
Nothing.

708
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:40,656
I'm just losing
my mind here.

709
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,790
You don't have the balls
to walk out,

710
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,834
if that's what
you wanted.

711
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,837
Like I was gonna split
with you acting the way you act.

712
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,373
Acting?
You did some acting.

713
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,271
I don't remember
doing any acting.

714
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,277
You don't remember?
Let me refresh your memory.

715
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:59,907
Do you remember not
taking any work?
Not fixing any meals?

716
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,451
I'm not on
fucking trial here!

717
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,181
Do you remember crying
every morning and evening?

718
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,382
Do you remember that?

719
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,558
I scared you, huh?

720
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,359
What did
you think, Sam?

721
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,060
You thought maybe
I was gonna kill myself?

722
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,399
<i>Over you?</i>
Well, who else?

723
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,062
You pompous ass!

724
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,630
You wouldn't leave
the bedroom!

725
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,903
I wish you could
say the same.

726
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,411
<i>Isn't this what</i>
<i>Dr. Hackett talked about?</i>

727
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,448
Diggin' up the past.

728
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,009
The relevant issue is whether
I've been messin' around,

729
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,146
and I have not been.

730
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,249
<i>As far as this girl goes,</i>
<i>she's just a kid.</i>

731
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,351
That shouldn't
stop you.

732
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:48,194
She's a baby!
You gravitate to people
in the same profession.

733
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,857
You gravitate to women.

734
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,868
I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk.
She looks up to me!

735
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,770
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that!

736
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,305
Look, Leigh.
I'm scared.

737
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,815
This whole
thing has...

738
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:12,646
I keep feeling that there's some
animal out there, stalking us.

739
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,716
I think he wants to
hurt us in the worst way.

740
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,229
And that's got me
frightened to death.

741
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,729
You really are scared,
aren't you?
Oh, yeah.

742
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:30,170
Somebody finally
got to you.

743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,673
Look, Leigh,

744
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,939
I think that this guy
beat and raped her...

745
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,038
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,

746
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,606
that she wouldn't
press charges.

747
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,879
Because she knows
the system.

748
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,353
I mean,
she works in it.

749
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,721
She knows
that she'd be on trial.

750
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,226
And then, because she
wouldn't testify,

751
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:55,163
you would assume that there was
something going on between us...

752
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:59,293
and it would
cause a rift.

753
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:04,633
And that we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.

754
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:14,206
I'm glad we talked about this,
because we can work together.

755
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,218
We can beat that
son-of-a-bitch,

756
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,983
the two of us, together,
working as a team.

757
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,549
Oh, boy!
Jesus.

758
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,822
Oh, yeah,
this is great.

759
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,194
This is somethin' else.

760
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,825
Oh... shit!

761
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,505
<i>And here you go.</i>
I'm sorry.
I haven't ordered yet.

762
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:49,075
That fellow over there
sent this over, paid for.

763
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,212
Which one?
<i>That guy that's</i>
<i>just leaving.</i>

764
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,858
Excuse me.

765
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,418
Hey, Cady!
Come here.

766
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,487
<i>Wait a second.</i>

767
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,227
I've been in a real
bad mood lately.

768
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,236
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

769
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,501
- No.
- Get the hell outta here.

770
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:14,135
<i>I don't mean this town.</i>
<i>I mean the whole state.</i>

771
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:18,113
<i>I don't wanna see ya, hear ya,</i>
<i>and i don't wanna smell ya.</i>

772
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,274
Are you my friend?

773
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,375
No, I'm not
your friend.

774
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,386
I thought maybe
you were my friend,

775
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,979
because I like to plan my
comin's and goin's with friends.

776
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,992
But if you're not my friend,
I'd call that presumptuous.

777
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,190
I'd call it downright rude,
'cause I ain't your porch-baby.

778
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,697
Well, gee-golly-gosh.

779
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,929
I sure am sorry I offended you,
you white-trash piece of shit.

780
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,766
Ooh, I got the all-over
fidgets on that one!

781
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,636
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shiverin' all over.

782
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:49,611
<i>It's not necessary to lay</i>
<i>a foul tongue on me, my friend.</i>

783
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,615
I could get upset.
Things could get outta hand.

784
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,651
And then
in self-defense,

785
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,449
I could do somethin' to you
that you would not like.

786
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,547
You feel squirrelly.
You just jump.

787
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,422
You threatenin' me?

788
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,428
- You threatenin' me?
- You catch on fast.

789
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,329
'Cause I'm well within
my rights to be here.

790
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,833
And if I stay here,
what you gonna do?

791
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,336
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.

792
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,429
You watch your step.

793
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,371
What you gonna do,
arrest me?

794
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,037
You a cop, or were
you not good enough
to remain on the force?

795
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,512
That's the feelin'
I'm gettin' here.

796
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,412
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.

797
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,259
Ma'am,
this belong to you?

798
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:43,197
<i>Can I help you?</i>
<i>I just found it.</i>
<i>Thought you might need it back.</i>

799
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,930
If a dogcatcher comes across
a dog without a license,

800
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,370
he's liable to think
it's a stray...

801
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,670
<i>and do</i>
<i>God-knows-what to it.</i>

802
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,267
You know, um...

803
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,745
Our dog is...
He passed away.

804
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,044
<i>What a shame.</i>
Yeah.

805
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,677
A man's best friend.
A woman's, too.

806
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,620
<i>Even without closin'my eyes,</i>
<i>I can picture him...</i>

807
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,683
Big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet.

808
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,752
Keepin' you company while
you're tryin' to finish up...

809
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,298
those pesky,
little sketches.

810
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,531
Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?

811
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:26,773
<i>Get the hell outta here</i>
<i>before I call the police!</i>

812
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,038
<i>I'm not doin'nothin'.</i>

813
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,774
I'm just givin' you back
your dog collar.

814
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,873
You want to
look around?

815
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,214
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.

816
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,254
Nice house.

817
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,290
Yeah, it is a nice house.
You satisfied now?

818
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,658
<i>Or is there more,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

819
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,993
<i>Is that it?</i>

820
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,362
There is gonna be more,
isn't there?

821
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,027
You won't stop
until you're happy.

822
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,368
How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?

823
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,738
You don't know
anything about me.

824
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,367
I know what I see,
ma'am.
<i>Yeah?</i>

825
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,036
Mm-hmm.

826
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,112
I wanted to know
what you looked like.

827
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,242
I've been waitin'
to see your face,

828
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,981
but now that I see you,
you are just repulsive.

829
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,422
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>I'm not your type.</i>

830
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,723
No.
<i>All that prison time</i>
<i>made me coarse.</i>

831
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,026
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos.

832
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,589
There's not a whole
lot to do in prison...

833
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,569
but desecrate your flesh.

834
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,037
<i>It didn't have to be that way</i>
<i>for either of us...</i>

835
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,540
<i>if your husband hadn't</i>
<i>betrayed us both.</i>

836
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,510
Who knows? We might've
been different people.

837
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,139
We might've been happy,
Leigh.

838
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,982
- Mom, someone's on the phone!
- Danny, don't come out here!

839
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,396
<i>Hey, Sam!</i>
<i>Yo, Sam!</i>

840
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,730
I thought I'd
catch you here.

841
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:02,795
Well, that little
smart aleck made me.
He what?

842
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,807
It wasn't my fault.
He was lookin' to be covered.

843
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:09,140
There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie
in that little prick.
I told ya.

844
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,804
You know where he was?

845
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,974
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra,

846
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,041
by Friedrich Nietzsche.

847
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,986
He's this German philosopher.
Said that God is dead.

848
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,354
We can keep goin' this way,
but it's gonna get expensive.

849
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,919
I'm not so concerned about days.
Stay on him a few more nights.

850
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,761
Do you really want
to resolve this situation?

851
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,269
I'd love to resolve it.
<i>Then I've got</i>
<i>a suggestion.</i>

852
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,998
There's men that can
be hired, by me,

853
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,666
to do a little
hospital job on Cady.

854
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,214
What are we talkin'
about here?

855
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,341
Two pieces of pipe,
a bicycle chain.

856
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:51,444
Sam, he won't be
so scary after that.

857
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,716
Are we agreed that
I'm a lawyer?

858
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,886
<i>Maybe 2,000 years ago</i>
<i>we'd have taken this guy</i>
<i>and stoned him to death.</i>

859

<i>I can't operate outside the law.</i>
<i>The law's my business.</i>

00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:10,738
<i>I'm home!</i>
<i>Where is everybody?</i>
In here.

861
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,742
Evenin', ladies.

862
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,643
Oh, chicken.

863
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,147
How is everything?
Is everything okay?

864
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,547
<i>Yeah.</i>
Good, good.

865
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,489
He was here today.

<i>Drama.</i>

<i>How ya doin'?</i>
Fine.

<i>You sound</i>
<i>kinda down.</i>
No...

<i>Anything</i>

877
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,091
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>You know, Danielle...</i>
<i>all that negativity,</i>
<i>you can use that.</i>

879
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,804

880
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,139
<i>I'm the kind of teacher</i>

<i>Everything you're</i>

<i>when that time</i>

886

<i>The anger that you feel</i>

So, class is tomorrow
in room 110, right?

00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:01,411
No, it's been changed
to the theater.

894

What better place
for drama, right?
<i>Yeah.</i>

And remember, Danielle,

896
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:12,724
you can use all those fears

<i>I didn't think summer session</i>

fall's chorus program.

I'm here for

00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,900
Hi.

922
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,563
Oops.
Am I busted?

923
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,664
No.
I hope not.

924

You can't smoke grass

Yeah. Are you

Yeah.

01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:09,602
Oh, I'm sorry.
How rude.

934

Ow.
[Chuckles]

943
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,868
Little trick I learned.
Take it.

944
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:55,440
You know, when we spoke
on the phone last night?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

945
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:59,579
Um... you really made sense
to me and...

946
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,749
I thought a lot.

947
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,521
Those are human truths, darlin'.
That's what it's all about.

948
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,859
That's what
we deal with here.

949
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,058
<i>See the book you have,</i>
<i>Thomas Wolfe?</i>

950
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:14,501
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

951
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,631
I like the end where, um...

952
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,835
Eugene's journey...

953
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,142
It was really, uh,
mystical, you know.

954
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:27,944
And it was almost like
a pilgrimage?

955
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,077
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.

956
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:34,817
Those were the facts
of Wolfe's life.

957
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,826
The novel is what you would call
a "roman a clef."

958
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,863
<i>You know what</i>
<i>that is?</i>

959
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,229
I'm not sure.
<i>Nonetheless,</i>

960
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,894
you can't escape your demons
just by leaving home.

961
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,928
Although writers do find
new freedom when they
relocate abroad.

962
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:55,569
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read his trilogy?
"<i>Plexus, Nexus,</i> and <i>Sexus."</i>

963
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:59,308
No.
<i>You haven't</i>
<i>read that?</i>

964
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,146
You're missin'
something.

965
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:07,485
Well, you know what?
I did read <i>Tropic of Cancer.</i>

966
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,583
Just parts of it though,
'cause, uh...

967
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,561
I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?

968
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:18,532
But, his descriptions are
pretty vivid, I would say.
<i>Yeah.</i>

969
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,365
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,

970
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,372
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead
with wings on it.

971
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,840
I didn't read
that part.

972
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,742
<i>Of course not.</i>
<i>You're not allowed.</i>

973
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,212
Your parents don't want
you to achieve adulthood.
That's natural.

974
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,444
They know the pitfalls
of adulthood, all that freedom.

975
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,611
They know it
only too well.

976
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:41,316
<i>Temptation to stray,</i>
<i>deflecting their guilt</i>
<i>and anger onto you...</i>

977
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:46,020
for a crime that's
not even a crime...
for smokin' grass.

978
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,063
Wh...

979
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:54,903
Wait a second.
Um... where are you from?

980
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,531
Where am I from?
<i>Yeah.</i>

981
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,541
Where do you think
I'm from?

982
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,077
I don't know, but...

983
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,477
If I told you,
you gonna get mad at me?

984
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:07,311
No.

985
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,521
I'm from a black forest.

986
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,459
That's funny.

987
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,761
You're not the
drama teacher, are you?

988
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,495
Maybe I'm the
big, bad wolf.

989
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,104
Um...

990
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:35,338
So, you're that guy that's
been hanging around the house?

991
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,380
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?

992
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,847
Your mom's dog was killed?

993
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,544
Yeah.

994
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:45,212
I didn't even know
anything about that.

995
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,746
That's a shame.
That's a damn shame.

996
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,521
Yes, it was.

997
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,085
<i>What kind of dog</i>
<i>was it?</i>
Um...

998
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,723
I don't know.
He was just...

999
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,529
He was fluffy and...

1000
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,900
Fluffy?

1001
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,769
Mm-hmm.

1002
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,999
So you didn't do that?

1003
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,272
Of course
I didn't do that.
