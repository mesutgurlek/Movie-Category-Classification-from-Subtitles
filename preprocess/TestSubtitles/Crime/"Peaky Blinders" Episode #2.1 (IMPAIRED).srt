HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

30
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,050
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,490
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

32
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,220
if he should pass before me.

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,170
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law -

34
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,610
when we were in France,
fighting for the King.

35
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,940
Amen.

36
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,930
And in the end it wasn't war
that took Freddie.

37
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,050
~ BABY CRIES
~ Pestilence took him.

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,340
Come here.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,570
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

40
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,260
before he was cruelly taken.

41
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,250
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

42
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
you might come back to Birmingham.

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,050
God, do you know how funny it is

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,930
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,210
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,690
Do you know how unfair it is

47
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,780
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

48
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,180
So now they've made you
ashamed of us, eh?

49
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,970
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

50
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,730
Karl's with his cousins.

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,100
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

52
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,250
Ada, are you coming home?

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,660
I'm going home.

54
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,610
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,300
That's not what I said.

56
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,570
There's another reason
we want you home.

57
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,330
We're planning an expansion.

58
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,090
I'm taking premises in London...

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,370
~ Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait. ~ Polly,

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,890
if Ada was weeping then I'd stop.

61
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,410
But she's not.

62
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,490
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,610
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

64
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,180
Yeah, well,
I'm not a Shelby anymore.

65
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,300
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

66
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm free.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,820
I've got to get Karl home.

68
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,050
I told you. Let me do it.

69
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,730
It's all right.

70
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,100
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,580
"Till the danger passes"?

72
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,580
That'll be the bloody day.

73
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,980
THE CHILDREN SHOUT

74
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,610
It happened at exactly 7am.

75
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,340
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

76
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,940
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

77
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,100
I'd say it was something
to do with the gas.

78
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,660
It's just been fitted.

79
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,690
Madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

80
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,700
~ DEBRIS CRUNCHES
~ Madam!

81
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,660
This is all over the place.

82
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,140
Confetti.

83
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,210
You can go.

84
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,300
Right.

85
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,420
Who?

86
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,540
Who did this to us?

87
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,540
Whisky. Irish.

88
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,650
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

89
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,250
Gas and electric don't mix.

90
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,490
Who'd have thought
they would, eh?

91
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,940
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

92
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,420
You know something?

93
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,410
In these times of hunger
and hardship,

94
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,340
business is surprisingly good.

Polly, it feels a little bit to me
like things are getting out of hand.

So get 'em in hand.

Do you know what Ada said to me
this morning?

She said we all look like we work
in a factory under the ground.

128
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,340
She said we look like ghosts.

129
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,500
She'll be back.

130
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,090
When?

131
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,580
When she needs us.

132
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,410
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

133
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,290
~ Six. ~ Six what?

134
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,140
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

135
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,300
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

Why?

137
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,580
Seven.

138
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,290
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

139
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,420
or we'll find somebody else who can.

You blew up my pub.

144
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,490
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

145
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,410
A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

146
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,820
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

147
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,420
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you, eh?

148
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,730
I read somewhere that you Paddies

149
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,100
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

150
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,010
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

151
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,090
That's funny, don't you think?

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,860
A war about peace.

153
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,170
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

154
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,180
Forgive me, I get confused.

155
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,420
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

156
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,460
So stop fucking smiling.

157
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,930
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

158
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,730
You have a son at the
Cherry Wood Road School in Harborne.

159
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,890
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

160
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,740
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

161
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,970
Poor boy if the race was important.

162
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,290
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

163
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,530
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

164
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,820
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

165
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,580
No.

166
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,450
He researches his enemies,

167
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,700
that's why he's been chosen.

168
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,500
I am chosen?

169
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm chosen.

170
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,220
Can the chosen one smoke?

171
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,780
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

172
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,540
Chosen by whom?

173
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,260
By an informed consensus.

174
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,420
I have things to do.

175
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,770
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

176
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,940
what he's been chosen for.

177
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,490
From now on, Mr Shelby,

178
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,460
you shut your fucking Gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

179
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,860
Fuck!

180
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,930
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

181
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,250
clear of coppers between
midnight and four tonight.

182
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,180
Right. Could I ask why?

183
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,810
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

184
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,730
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

185
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,580
That's all. You can go.

186
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,650
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

187
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,180
No charge.

188
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,130
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

189
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,170
Just passing through, he says.

190
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,130
He's very grand these days.

191
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,770
He's head of some
secret department -

192
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,140
the Irish Desk.

193
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,740
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

194
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,380
I'll say good night, Tom.

195
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,060
I want to speak to a representative!

196
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,260
MAN CALLS OUT

197
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,810
Father! Father!

198
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,570
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

199
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,250
Get the fuck off me!

200
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,090
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

201
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,650
I demand to speak to
a representative
of His Majesty the King!

202
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,850
Make your peace with God.

203
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,810
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

204
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,170
~ Father. ~ Come on.

205
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,740
Where are you going?

206
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,010
Does someone here have
business with the King?

207
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,610
Major Campbell.

208
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,940
~ SHOUTING CONTINUES
~ About time.

209
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,570
I am a very busy man, Governor.

210
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,370
In seven and a half minutes,

211
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,890
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

212
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,810
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

213
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,540
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

214
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,490
No, Governor,

215
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
I hear no bells.

216
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,410
Since yesterday morning,

217
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,410
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

218
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,890
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

219
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,810
It's a little late to be coming up
with nonsense like that,

220
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,010
don't you think?

221
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,090
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

222
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,370
there would be a last-minute pardon,

223
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,260
which has not materialised.

224
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,050
Forgive me, Governor,

225
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,500
but what business is this of mine?

226
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,170
He says the man who hired him

227
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,130
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

228
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,620
an Ulsterman.

229
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,010
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

230
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,690
a bullet wound in his right leg.

231
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,460
No...

232
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Still no bells. Governor...

233
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,570
..you have a very clear remit.

234
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,250
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

235
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,260
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

236
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,460
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man...

237
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,730
..to the gates of hell.

238
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,820
Is that clear?

239
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,530
And...if you should ever have
the desire

240
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,060
to discuss this matter
with anyone else...

241
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,980
..I know where you live.

242
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,620
Arthur,
Tommy's called a family meeting.

243
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,450
Arthur!

244
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,850
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

245
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,220
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

246
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,780
Arthur!

247
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,020
2,000.

248
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,420
Come on.

249
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,420
Sit down, Finn.

250
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,180
~ Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
~ He's on his way.

251
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,980
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

252
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Whisky - left over from
the explosion.

253
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,100
It's good stuff, as well.

254
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,490
Right...

255
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,690
Before Tommy gets here,

256
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,010
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

257
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,570
between the rest of us.

258
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,740
YOU think?

259
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,940
Yeah.

260
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,820
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

261
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,180
..when did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

262
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,450
If you have anything to say,
you wait for Thomas.

263
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,970
Polly's fucking right.

264
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,180
I see all the books.

265
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,060
Legal and off track.

266
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,220
Sort of stuff you don't see.

267
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,210
And in the past year

268
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,730
the Shelby Company Limited

269
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,090
has been making £150...

270
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,620
a day.

271
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,970
Right? A fucking day.

272
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,890
Sometimes more.

273
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,610
So what I want to know

274
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,570
is why are we changing things?

275
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,020
Polly, look what's happened already.

276
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,930
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

277
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,090
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

278
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,570
~ Who said anything
about cockneys? ~ Who else?

279
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,530
Do you know who did it, do you?

280
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,700
No, she doesn't know who did it.

281
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,170
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

282
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,020
Everyone's allowed to speak.

283
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,140
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

284
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,980
I speak for our household.

285
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,490
~ So... ~ John, this company
is a modern enterprise

286
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,090
and believes in
equal rights for women.

287
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,660
On your feet, Esme.

288
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm not a blood member
of this family

289
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,410
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm NOT a member

290
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,580
I can see things
in a different light.

291
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,250
So I'll get to my point.

292
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,970
That would be nice.

293
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,330
As my husband said,

294
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,570
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

295
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,890
But London...

296
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,820
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

297
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,650
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

298
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,290
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

299
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,660
And there are foreigners
of every description...

300
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,460
..and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

301
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,250
I have a child,

302
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,060
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

303
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,700
I want John to see him grow up.

304
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,170
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

305
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,100
and keep chickens or something.

306
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,770
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

307
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,940
"Thomas"?

308
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,100
That's all I have to say.

309
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,420
ARTHUR: That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

310
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,970
Wash them down with a nice drink.

311
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,260
Thank you, Esme.

312
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,210
Firstly, the bang in the pub
was nothing to do with London.

313
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,650
Understood?

314
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,130
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

315
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,730
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

316
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,420
so long as we stick together.

317
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,610
And after the first few weeks,

318
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,090
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

319
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,570
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

320
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,740
That's right.

321
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,450
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed their reservations.

322
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,730
Fair enough.

323
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,930
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

324
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,460
walk out the door...

325
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,020
..right now.

326
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,140
Go raise your chickens.

327
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,700
For those of you with ambition...

328
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,220
..the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

329
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,170
Tomorrow?

330
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,260
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

331
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,170
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

332
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,770
We have 18 staff.

333
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,170
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

334
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,180
Oh, I changed the combination.

335
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,620
So what's going on, Thomas?

336
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,700
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

337
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,340
Give me the combination, Polly.

338
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,060
Polly, give me the combination!

339
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,370
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

340
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,890
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

341
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,180
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

342
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,580
So why tomorrow?

343
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,610
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

344
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,050
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

345
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,450
What, so you just roll up
and take the city?

346
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,780
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

347
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,890
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

348
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,970
have been at war in London
for six months.

349
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,090
It's not our war.

350
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,730
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

351
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,050
~ Yeah, but we don't.
~ We need a foothold

352
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,170
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

353
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,180
The Jews control Camden Town.

354
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,130
Your mother said,

355
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,460
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

356
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,610
No-one gets killed, Polly.

357
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,010
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

358
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,490
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

359
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,010
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

360
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,890
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

361
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,540
Now please, open the fucking safe.

362
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,140
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there...

363
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,780
..about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

364
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,730
But when it comes to it,

365
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,660
you don't listen to a word we say.

366
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,860
Maybe you don't trust us.

367
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,500
She was one woman, Thomas.

368
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,770
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

369
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,530
Forgot about who?

370
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,610
SHE SIGHS

371
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,180
SHE UNLOCKS THE SAFE

372
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,460
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

373
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,380
GRUNTING

374
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,700
HE EXHALES

375
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,100
Are you going to London now?

376
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,300
No, there's something
I have to do first.

377
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,130
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

378
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,290
I got it out of a catalogue.

379
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,820
I'm doing a correspondence course.

380
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,330
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

381
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,980
It's a test you have to do.

382
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,260
Will you come back before you go?

383
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,100
No.

384
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,810
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

385
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,890
as if we were ordinary people.

386
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,020
Yeah.

387
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,850
Let's begin.

388
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,540
Hands on the table.

389
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,810
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

390
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,020
So, let's welcome them.

391
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,330
Starting with you.

392
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,530
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

393
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,650
My husband.

394
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,250
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

395
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,810
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

396
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,570
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

397
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,500
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

398
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,900
She's an un-sanctified charlatan.

399
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,020
And you?

400
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,540
Who do you seek?

401
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,970
Well, the truth...

402
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,730
Sorry, the truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

403
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,220
So I came here to find out.

404
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,780
Er...

405
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,530
You see, my son and my daughter

406
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,370
were taken from me
when they were very small -

407
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,850
taken by the parish authorities.

408
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,570
And I never knew
what happened to them.

409
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,100
But lately...

410
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,420
I've had a feeling.

411
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
Like, a feeling...

412
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,820
I can't put it into words.

413
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,060
And I keep having a dream.

414
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,050
I see a pretty girl,

415
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,740
about 18 years old.

416
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,140
And she's standing
across the street...

417
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,530
..and she tells me
she's passed over.

418
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

419
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,900
On May 15th.

420
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,980
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

421
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,380
And she shouts...and shouts.

422
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,130
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

423
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,900
because I'm her mother.

424
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,090
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

425
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,060
after they stole her from me.

426
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,740
But if she does want
to say goodbye...

427
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,940
I thought this would be the place.

428
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,650
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

429
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,820
You're Gypsy?

430
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,860
The part of me that dreams is Gypsy.

431
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,820
My maiden name is Shelby.

432
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,740
So...

433
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,500
..perhaps you could do me first.

434
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
No!

435
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,930
SHE YELLS

436
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,540
No!

437
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,940
NO!

438
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,900
SHE CRIES

439
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,220

All right, Tommy's here.

459
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,740
Hang on!

460
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,770
John!

461
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,980
I'm coming!

462
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,010
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

463
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,930
10 if I'm still sober.

464
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,290
I got it from the doctor -

465
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,060
it keeps me nice and calm.

466
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,850
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

467
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,410
to stop us fucking wanking.

468
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,290
Polly said it's good for me temper.

469
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,330
~ It slows me down, Tom. ~ Arthur...

470
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,370
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

471
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,050
~ I need you fast. Not slow, eh?
~ DOOR OPENS

472
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,050
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

473
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,530
~ I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of! ~ Right.

474
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,690
You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

475
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,330
Nothing wrong with opinions, John.

476
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,980
~ Get in the fucking car. ~ Shut up!

477
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,970
ARTHUR SHOUTS: Right!

478
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,690
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

479
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,180
Sit down, you mad bastard.

480
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,620
DOOR CLOSES

481
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,260
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

482
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,090
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

483
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,700
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

484
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,930
She's one of ours.

485
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,860
Anything over £1, tell me.

486
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,980
Polly...

487
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,770
I don't wish to pry
into your business

488
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,650
but you should know something.

489
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,410
That woman is a trickster.

490
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,170
What woman?

491
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,250
Her sister was in
the wash house early,

492
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,980
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

493
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,980
What woman?

494
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,780
Gypsies talk to each other.

495
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,580
What woman?

496
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,060
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

497
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,130
I'm sorry...

498
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,970
So what do you know?

499
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,930
I know they push the glass.

500
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,450
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

501
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,850
It's a trick.

502
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,180
They tell you what
you already believe.

503
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,490
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

504
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,250
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

505
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,050
And in this fucking wash house,

506
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,780
did they tell you why I went there?

507
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,290
You tell a soul in this family,

508
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,300
and I swear I will cut you.

509
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,340
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

510
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,380
It is a matter of honour.

511
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,330
Look at this! Look.

512
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,970
I love it.

513
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,410
Your Esme was right
about one thing -

514
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,530
you can't beat the countryside.

515
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,300
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day...

516
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,850
..and keep chickens.

517
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,420
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

518
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,580
~ Oh, for fuck's sake! ~ Take these.

519
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,490
We need to bury him.

520
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,530
Who the fuck is that?

521
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,010
It's Irish business.

522
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,650
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

523
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,210
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

524
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,010
John, grab his head.

525
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,650
So, we're not really
going to London?

526
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,450
Once we bury him,

527
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,260
then the holiday begins.

528
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,010
GIGGLING

529
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,540
CAR HORN TOOTS

530
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,540
Much obliged.

531
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,700
BAND PLAYS ENERGETICALLY

532
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,260
It's a fucking freak show.

533
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,530
What the fuck is that racket?

534
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,700
~ This is what they call music
these days, brother. ~ Music?!

535
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,490
Oi!

536
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,930
Oi! Put it away.

537
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,260
Fuck off!

538
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,410
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

539
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,260
It's all right, isn't it?

540
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,290
Irish whisky - a bottle.

541
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,580
And hurry up!

542
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,930
MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH

543
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,450
Fucking hell,

544
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,420
I recognise a few of these lads.

545
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,690
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

546
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,410
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

547
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,810
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

548
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,420
Just the lieutenants, John.
No sign of the officers.

549
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,100
Right, let's line them up.

550
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,500
Holiday!

551
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,530
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

552
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,540
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

553
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,770
We just bought a fucking bottle.

554
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,010
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

555
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,610
Yeah, we get that a lot.

556
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,810
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

557
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,650
without prior agreement.

558
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,900
And what line would that be,
my friend?

559
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,500
They say this is provocation.

560
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,220
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

561
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,820
You're breaking the rules.

562
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,890
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

563
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,500
MAN SHOUTS: Peaky scum!

564
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,660
BAND CONTINUES PLAYING

565
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,620
~ HE LAUGHS
~ Who the fuck's next?

566
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,140
Come here!

567
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,930
PEOPLE SHRIEK

568
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,620
Put some ice on 'em!

569
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,300
Get out.

570
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,180
Yeah?

571
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,130
Yeah?

572
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,620
Are you going to use that?

573
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,540
Didn't think so.

574
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,770
We came here...

575
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,820
not to make enemies...

576
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,460
No!

577
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,380
We came here to make new friends.

578
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,570
Those of you who are last

579
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,660
will soon be first.

580
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,170
And those of you who are downtrodden

581
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,580
will rise up.

582
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,780
Yip.

583
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,860
You know where to find us.

584
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,490
I think I've lost a tooth.

585
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,940
I'll have none left at this rate!

586
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,850
Some fucking holiday this is.

587
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,490
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

588
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,370
~ Here, this'll fix you. ~ Give me that!

589
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,490
You, John boy...eh? How are you?

590
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,410
~ Or should I ask your fucking wife?
~ Oh, give over!

591
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,810
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

592
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,930
Fuck the chickens.

593
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,570
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

594
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,130
Let's paint the town, eh?

595
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,250
JOHN CHEERS

596
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,300
~ KNOCK ON DOOR
~ Come.

597
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,050
~ Oh, dear God! ~ Good Lord,
I assumed it was Betty with tea.

598
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,810
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

599
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,290
No, because she takes lunch -
like normal people.

600
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,810
And you can turn around,

601
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,450
this lady is
a professional life model.

602
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,020
She does this for a living.

603
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,210
I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

604
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,100
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the house. Just, erm...

605
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,450
..keep your back turned,
if you must.

606
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,820
MAJOR CAMPBELL MUMBLES

607
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,460
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

608
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,450
Well, I...I...play cards on occasion.

609
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,250
You're a stranger to cocaine
and exotic dancing, too, I imagine.

610
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,250
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

611
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,980
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

612
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,050
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

613
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,050
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

614
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,610
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

615
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,530
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

616
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,970
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for the bigger task.

617
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,730
~ Expressions elude me,
I think too much. ~ Sir?

618
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:46,810
I need your authority
to proceed with all urgency

619
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,610
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

620
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,570
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

621
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,650
Yes, sir.

622
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,980
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

623
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,410
To apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

624
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,010
you have to know his weaknesses

625
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,930
and I know this man's weaknesses
intimately.

626
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,090
And after "mission accomplished",

627
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,210
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

628
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,980
Absolutely not, sir.

629
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,770
So when he's served his purpose,

630
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,730
he will be consigned to history

631
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,010
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

632
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,570
You mean at the end of a rope?

633
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,050
Well, the end of the rope

634
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,300
has been this man's destiny
since the night he was born.

635
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,450
DOOR OPENS

636
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,900
You're early.

637
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,410
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

638
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,730
What?

639
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,660
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

640
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,650
Good.

641
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,330
Now, come with me.

642
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,850
No, shut your eyes!

643
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,170
~ SHE LAUGHS
~ This way. ~ What are you doing, Tom?

644
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,420
You've got to sit down
here. Right...

645
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:28,570
Sit down. Now, OK...

646
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,770
~ Type this. ~ Why?

647
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,290
Lizzie, type this.

648
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,930
"If wi..." Put your cigarette down.

649
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,850
Right. "If winter comes..."

650
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,530
~ SHE STARTS TYPING
~ "..then can spring be far behind?"

651
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,890
Why?! Did you say spring?

652
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,660
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

653
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,410
Let's see.

654
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,690
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

655
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,050
Put in the question mark.

656
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,970
Now type this.

657
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,330
"Wanted - secretary
for expanding business."

658
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,730
Slow down!

659
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,380
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch-type."

660
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,610
"Five days a week.

661
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,050
"Eight pounds
and four shillings a month.

662
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,420
"Must be able to start immediately."

663
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,140
Are you serious?

664
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,100
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

665
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,860
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

666
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,020
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

667
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,100
All of it this time.

668
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,340
No exceptions.

669
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,690
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

670
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,820
Don't be late.

671
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,490
DOOR OPENS

672
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,890
Newmarket was profitable.

673
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,850
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

674
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,490
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

675
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,530
he said you poured it away.

676
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,650
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

677
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,170
Oh, that's how it works
in London, isn't it?

678
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,010
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

679
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,450
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

680
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,490
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

681
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,300
~ Stop fucking fighting me!
~ Somebody has to.

682
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,370
That arrived an hour ago.

683
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,010
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

684
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,410
I was going to burn it.

685
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,850
I should have.

686
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,130
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

687
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,020
Now you're at war with Sabini.

688
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,370
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

689
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,130
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

690
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,740
She goes mad if I'm late!

691
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,290
Ada Shelby?

692
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,460
No.

693
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,820
THEY GRUNT

694
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,690
Your brother broke the rules.

695
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,210
I don't have a fucking brother.

696
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,730
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

697
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,330
~ Let's go for a drive. ~ No!

698
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,780
~ Hold her steady, boys. ~ Get off!

699
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,820
SHE YELLS

700
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,860
Fucking hold him!

701
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,260
TOMMY GROANS

702
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,890
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

703
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,130
I was at the races.

704
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,700
Sabini.

705
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,660
Don't say my name.

706
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,610
Jesus!

707
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,620
Franco,
take my name out of his mouth.

708
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,380
TOMMY GROANS AND GURGLES

709
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,450
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

710
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,610
Pay for the petrol.

711
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,420
HE MOANS

712
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,340
HE SPLUTTERS

713
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,610
You see how much I know about you?

714
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,340
I even know what's in
your fucking mouth.

715
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,730
Look at me.

716
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,410
Look at me!

717
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,700
Look at me.

718
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,370
You take up with the Jews.

719
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,890
Yeah, you think that's
what London's all about.

720
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,290
You can just come down,
pick a side.

721
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,850
You fucking clown!

722
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,660
Now your life is over.

723
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,770
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

724
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,450
Your mistake.

725
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,580
You remember that
when you get to hell.

726
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,540
Finish him off.

727
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,810
GUNSHOTS AND SHOUTING

728
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,100
