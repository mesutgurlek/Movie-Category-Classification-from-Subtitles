DR. NORTON: It's okay.

335
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,759
Relax. If you get too emotional, it'll
change the chemistry in your brain.

337
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,724
It'll throw the system out.

Now, we agreed on this a
long time ago, Raymond.

I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

346

My work here is driven
by its own questions.

And your work is brilliant. But
your ideas are being underutilized.

348

Look, I think I found a way

349
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,326
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

350

end, leaving me exposed like that.

353
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,639
Detective Murphy's just
a little impulsive.

354
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,799
So put him on the payroll.

355

Why are we talkin' about this?

356
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,599
It won't work. And now
that his partner got hit,

357
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,679

Paralyzed from the waist down.

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,239
Well, check the psych evaluation.
He's far too unstable.

395
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,249
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

396

DR. NORTON: Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

397
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,319
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

398
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,519
We have to be scientific.

Alex makes his own decisions.

822
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,479
<i>Now, when he engages in battle,</i>

823
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,839
<i>the visor comes down and
the software takes over.</i>

824
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,879
<i>Then the machine does everything.</i>

825
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,448
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

826
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,239
<i>LIZ:
But if the machine is in control,</i>

827
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,851
<i>then how is Murphy accountable?</i>

828
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,959
Who's pulling the trigger?

829
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,399
Well, when the machine fights,

830
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,999
the system releases
signals into Alex's brain

831
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,679
making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

832
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,599
I mean, Alex believes right
now he is in control.

833
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,247
But he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

834
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,041
Crap!

835
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,199
So you've circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

836
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,359
But that's illegal.

837
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,369
No. No, no, no.

838
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,839
It's a machine that
thinks it's Alex Murphy.

839
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,326
And in my book

840
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,285
that's legal.

841
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,401
Well done.

842
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,485
Well done.

843
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,323
Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an
exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?

844
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,639

What is it?

It's okay, sweetie.

866

- I don't know.
