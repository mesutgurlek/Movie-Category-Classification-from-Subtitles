(DOOR BUZZER RINGS)

2
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,658
MARLOWE: My name's Marlowe.
General Sternwood wanted to see me.

3
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,912
Yes, Mr. Marlowe.
Will you come in, please, sir?

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,834
- I'll tell the General that you're here.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,516
Morning.

6
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,564
You're not very tall, are you?

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,567
Well, I tried to be.

8
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,030
Not bad-looking,

9
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,366
though you probably know it.

10
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,742
Thank you.

11
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,204
- What's your name?
- Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

12
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,999
That's a funny kind of name.

13
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,334
- You think so?
- Uh-huh.

14
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,963
What are you? A prizefighter?

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,048
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's a shamus?

16
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,218
- A private detective.
- You're making fun of me.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,386
Uh-huh.

18
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,185
(GIGGLES)

19
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,354
You're cute.

20
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,564
(DOORS OPEN)

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,650
The General will see you now, sir.

22
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,661
- Who's that?
- Miss Carmen Sternwood, sir.

23
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,746
- You ought to wean her. She's old enough.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,927
- This is Mr. Marlowe, General.
- How do you do, sir?

25
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,929
- Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,639
Brandy, Norris.

27
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,892
How do you like your brandy, sir?

28
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,602
In a glass.

29
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,313
I used to like mine with champagne.

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,440
Champagne cold as Valley Forge

31
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,109
and with about
three ponies of brandy under it.

32
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,777
Come, come, man. Pour a decent one.

33
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,822
I like to see people drink.

34
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,617
That'll do, Norris.

35
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,328
You may take off your coat, sir.

36
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,954
MARLOWE: Thank you.

37
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,790
Too hot in here for any man
who has any blood in his veins.

38
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,669
GEN. STERNWOOD: You may smoke, too.

39
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,713
I can still enjoy the smell of it.

40
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:40,010
Nice state of affairs when a man
has to indulge his vices by proxy.

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,723
You're looking, sir, at a very dull
survival of a very gaudy life.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,935
Crippled, paralyzed in both legs.

43
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,479
Very little I can eat,
and my sleep is so near waking

44
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,314
that it's hardly worth the name.

45
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,776
I seem to exist largely on heat,
like a newborn spider.

46
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,319
Yeah.

47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,947
The orchids are an excuse for the heat.

48
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,866
- Do you like orchids?
- Not particularly.

49
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,159
Nasty things.

50
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,995
Their flesh is too much
like the flesh of men.

51
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,082
Their perfume has
the rotten sweetness of corruption.

52
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,545
Tell me about yourself, Mr. Marlowe.

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,216
There isn't much to tell.
I'm 38. I went to college.

54
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,927
I can still speak English
when my business demands it.

55
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,971
I used to work for
the district attorney's office.

56
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,682
It was Bernie Ohls, his Chief Inspector,
sent word you wanted to see me.

57
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,643
You didn't like working
for the district attorney, eh?

58
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,148
I was fired for insubordination.
I seem to rate pretty high on that.

59
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,775
Yeah.

60
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,735
I always did, myself.

61
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,697
What do you know about my family,
Mr. Marlowe?

62
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, you're a widower, a millionaire.

63
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,201
You have two young daughters.

64
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,245
One unmarried
and one married a couple of years ago

65
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,955
to a man named Rutledge,
but it didn't take.

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,666
- Both living with you and both...
- Go on, sir.

67
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,919
Both pretty, and both pretty wild.

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,047
MARLOWE: What'd you want
to see me about?

69
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,465
I'm being blackmailed again.

70
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,050
Again?

71
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,387
GEN. STERNWOOD: About a year ago,
I paid a man named Joe Brody $5,000

72
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,514
- to let my younger daughter alone.
- Hm.

73
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,142
- What does that mean?
- (CHUCKLES)

74
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,936
It means, "Hm!"

75
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,896
It didn't go through
the district attorney's office

76
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,315
or I would've heard about it.

77
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,567
- Who handled it for you?
- Shawn Regan.

78
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,943
Shawn Regan?

79
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,029
There must be some reason
why he isn't handling it this time.

80
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,031
- What is it?
- Shawn has left me.

81
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,366
I thought I hadn't seen him around lately.

82
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,785
About a month ago, without a word.

83
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,081
I had no claim on him.
I was only his employer.

84
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,460
But I had hoped that he'd come
to regard me as something more than that.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,379
And that at least he'd have said goodbye.

86
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,341
That was what hurt.

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,469
You knew him too?

88
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes, in the old days when he
used to run rum out of Mexico

89
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,932
and I was on the other side.

90
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,851
We used to swap shots between drinks

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,686
or drinks between shots,
whichever you like.

92
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,271
(CHUCKLES)

93
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,357
My respects to you, sir.

94
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,985
Few men ever swapped more than
one shot with Shawn Regan.

95
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,781
He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army.

96
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,867
- But then you knew that.
- No, I didn't.

97
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,952
Oh, help yourself, sir.

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,413
I know he was a good man
at whatever he did.

99
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,709
No one was more pleased than I when
I heard you'd taken him on here as your...

100
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,169
Whatever he was.

101
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,796
My friend.

102
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,798
My son, almost.

103
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,424
(LAUGHS)

104
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,010
Many an hour he sat here with me,
sweating like a pig,

105
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,638
drinking the brandy
I could no longer drink

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,556
and telling stories
of the Irish Revolution.

107
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,809
Well, enough of that.

108
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,143
Here.

109
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,738
GEN. STERNWOOD: Read the other side.

110
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,675
- These her signatures?
- Yes.

111
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,011
- Who's Arthur Gwynn Geiger?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

112
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,347
- Did you ask her?
- No, and I don't intend to.

113
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,683
If I did, she'd just suck
her thumb and look coy.

114
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,228
Yeah, I met her in the hall.
She did that to me.

115
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,481
Then she tried to sit on my lap
while I was standing up.

116
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,816
GEN. STERNWOOD: Well?

117
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,362
Your other daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.
She mixed up in this?

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,989
- No.
- They alike? They run around together?

119
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,409
They're alike only in having
the same corrupt blood.

120
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,372
Vivian is spoiled, exacting,
smart and ruthless.

121
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,127
Carmen is still a little child
who likes to pull the wings off flies.

122
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,173
GEN. STERNWOOD: I assume
they have all the usual vices,

123
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,717
besides those they've
invented for themselves.

124
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,220
If I seem a bit sinister
as a parent, Mr. Marlowe,

125
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:57,184
it's because my hold on life is too slight
to include any Victorian hypocrisy.

126
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,020
I need hardly add that any man
who has lived as I have

127
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,357
and who indulges, for the first time,
in parenthood, at my age,

128
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,234
deserves all he gets.

129
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,278
GEN. STERNWOOD: Well?

130
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,161
Pay him.

131
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,498
- Why?
- She signed these notes, didn't she?

132
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,874
Yes.

133
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,589
Who's this Joe Brody
you paid the $5,000 to?

134
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,634
I can't recall.
My butler, Norris, would know.

135
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,553
I think he called himself a gambler.

136
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,805
Geiger says these are gambling debts.

137
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,724
They may be.

138
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,267
Think they are?

139
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,602
No.

140
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,897
I guess you want me
to take this Geiger off your back,

141
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,106
- is that right?
- Yes.

142
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,900
Want to know anything
or just get rid of him?

143
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,610
I just want to get rid of him.

144
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,612
It may cost you a little.

145
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,907
Thanks for the drink, General.

146
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,618
I enjoyed your drink
as much as you did, sir.

147
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,828
- You'll hear from me.
- Good luck.

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,345
Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like
to see you before you leave, sir.

150
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,180
And about the money,

151
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,517
the General has instructed me to
give you a check for whatever you require.

152
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,310
Instructed you how?

153
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,605
Oh, I see, sir.
I forget that you're a detective.

154
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,066
- By the way he rang his bell, sir.
- Ah.

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,193
- You write his checks?
- I have that privilege.

156
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,279
Good for you. I don't need any money now,

157
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,531
but when I do,
I get $25 a day and expenses.

158
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,699
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,077
- How did Mrs. Rutledge know I was here?
- She saw you through the window, sir.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,038
And I was obliged
to tell her who you were.

161
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,540
I don't know as I like that.

162
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,334
Are you attempting
to tell me my duties, sir?

163
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,670
No, just having fun
trying to guess what they are.

164
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,338
This way, sir.

165
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,760
- Go right in and say you're expected.
- Thanks.

166
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,850
You wanted to see me?

167
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,275
So you're a private detective?

168
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,235
I didn't know they existed,
except in books.

169
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,614
Or else they were greasy little men
snooping around hotel corridors.

170
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,532
My, you're a mess, aren't you?

(SCOFFS)

172
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,202
I'm not very tall either.

173
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,539
Next time I'll come on stilts, wear
a white tie and carry a tennis racket.

174
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,167
I doubt if even that would help.

175
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,046
Now, this business of Dad's,
think you can handle it for him?

176
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,756
- It shouldn't be too tough.
- Really?

177
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,549
I would've thought
a case like that took a little effort.

178
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,925
Not too much.

179
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,720
What will your first step be?

180
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,056
- The usual one.
- I didn't know there was a usual one.

181
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,892
Sure there is. It comes complete
with diagrams, on page 47 of

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,562
How to be a Detective in 10 Easy Lessons,
correspondence school text-book.

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,189
And your father offered me a drink.

184
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,566
You must've read another one
on how to be a comedian.

185
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,817
Hear what I said about the drink?

186
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,527
I'm quite serious, Mr. Marlowe.
My father's not a...

187
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,113
- I said your father...
- Help yourself.

188
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,994
Now, look, Mr. Marlowe,
my father's not well

189
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,955
and I want this case handled
with the least possible worry to him.

190
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,208
That's just the way
I was going to handle it.

191
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,252
- I see. No professional secrets?
- No.

192
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,588
- I thought you wanted a drink.
- I changed my mind.

193
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,173
Then, what...

194
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,805
- How'd you like Dad?
- I liked him.

195
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,307
He liked Shawn. Shawn Regan.

196
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,810
- I suppose you know who he is.
- Uh-huh.

197
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,105
You don't have to play poker with me,
Mr. Marlowe.

198
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,440
- Dad wants to find him, doesn't he?
- Do you?

199
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,777
Of course I do. It wasn't right
for him to go off like that.

200
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,113
Broke Dad's heart,
although he won't say much about it.

201
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,699
- Or did he?
- Why don't you ask him?

202
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,660
You know, I don't see what there is
to be cagey about, Mr. Marlowe.

203
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,953
And I don't like your manners!

204
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,956
I'm not crazy about yours.
I didn't ask to see you.

205
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,375
I don't mind if you don't like my manners.
I don't like 'em myself.

206
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,377
They're pretty bad.
I grieve over them long winter evenings,

207
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,046
and I don't mind your ritzing me,
or drinking your lunch out of a bottle.

208
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,424
But don't waste your time
trying to cross-examine me.

209
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,218
- People don't talk to me like that!
- Oh!

210
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,975
Do you always think you can handle people

211
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,935
- like trained seals?
- Uh-huh.

212
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,979
I usually get away with it too.

213
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,148
How nice for you.

214
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,525
Just what is it you're afraid of?

215
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,738
Dad didn't want to see you
about Shawn at all, did he?

216
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,114
Didn't he?

217
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,199
Could you find him if Dad wanted you to?

218
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,701
Maybe. When did he go?

219
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,411
About a month back.

220
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,955
Just drove off one afternoon
without saying a word.

221
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,791
They found his car
parked in some private garage.

222
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,127
MARLOWE: They? Who's they?

223
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,503
Dad didn't tell you, then.

224
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,799
Yes, he told me about Regan, but that's
not what he wants to see me about.

225
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,968
That's what you've been trying to
get me to say, isn't it?

226
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,679
I'm sure I don't care
what you say, Mr. Marlowe.

227
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,640
I'm wasting your time.

228
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,185
Goodbye, Mrs. Rutledge.

229
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,776
Oh, Norris.

230
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,945
You made a mistake.
Mrs. Rutledge didn't want to see me.

231
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,656
I'm sorry, sir. I make many mistakes.

232
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,396
- Did you find what you wanted?
- Yes, thanks.

who'd be interested in first editions.

full set, of course?

- You do sell books, hmm?

The broken ends of the rails
are dry inside.

All right, put her down.

Whatever it was, it was covered.

the skin while he was still alive.

Only that two or three
of the Sternwood chauffeurs

you worked in bed like Marcel Proust.

There isn't much money in this business
if you're honest.

445
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,800
- Are you honest?
- Are we gonna start that again?

446
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,719
I'm sorry. Also about yesterday.
Perhaps I was rude.

447
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,721
We were both rude.

448
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,890
You want to see me about Taylor?

449
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,018
So you know about that? Poor Owen.

450
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,604
Yeah. The DA's man took me
down to Lido last night.

451
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,023
Turned out he knew more about it
than I did.

452
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,609
For instance, he knew that Owen Taylor
wanted to marry your sister once.

453
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,112
Perhaps it wouldn't have been
such a bad idea.

454
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,572
You see, he was in love with her.

455
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,908
But I didn't come here about Owen. I...

456
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,246
Do you still feel you can't tell me
what my father wants you to do?

457
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,580
Not without his permission.

458
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,416
You can't even tell me
if it was about Carmen?

00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,583
No.

00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,560
A woman telephoned me
shortly after this thing was delivered.

466
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,146
- What else was there?
- Does there have to be something else?

467
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,398
Well, this thing
isn't worth $5,000 to anybody.

468
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,233
- Well, they think it is.
- Why?

469
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,569
The woman said
if they didn't get the money today,

470
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,280
I'd be talking to my sister
through a wire screen.

471
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,491
She said there was a police jam
connected with it.

472
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,826
What kind of a jam?

473
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:58,994
I don't know.

474
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,956
You know where this picture was taken?

475
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,499
I haven't the slightest idea.

476
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,251
- Or when?
- No.

477
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,962
- Talked to Carmen about it?
- She was asleep when I left.

478
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,922
Figure out a story?

479
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,883
- Norris fixed that.
- How?

480
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,177
She was in all evening.

481
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,929
Police already checked that
when they called about Owen.

482
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,723
Go ahead and scratch.

483
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,145
What was Owen doing
with your car last night?

484
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,814
Nobody knows.
He took it without permission.

485
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,107
Why? Do you think that...

486
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,485
That he knew about this picture?
I don't rule him out.

487
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,571
Then outside of what the woman said,

488
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,157
you don't know any reason
why they want $5,000 for it?

489
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,661
That's why I came to you.

490
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,706
There's usually five fingers on any glove.
Why didn't you go to the police?

491
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,083
- Because I thought...
- 'Cause you were afraid

492
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,001
they might turn up something
that I couldn't sit on.

493
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,378
Then where would the Sternwoods be?
Isn't that right?

494
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,756
May I use your phone, Mr. Marlowe?

495
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,015
Hello. Police headquarters, please.

496
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,560
Hello, this is Mrs...

497
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,981
Hello. What do you want, please?

498
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,149
I don't want a thing.

499
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,611
- What? I called you? Say, who is this?
- You called me.

500
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,821
Sergeant Reilly at headquarters.

501
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,115
Sergeant Reilly? Well, there isn't
any Sergeant Reilly here.

502
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,282
I know that, but look, brother...

503
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,034
Now, wait a minute,
you better talk to my mother.

504
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,869
I don't wanna talk to your mother.

505
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,163
Why should I wanna talk to your mother?
She didn't...

506
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,623
Hello. Who's this?

507
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,417
The police?
Well, this isn't a police station.

508
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,378
Well, if you know it, then why did you...

509
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,797
Look, this is not a police station.

510
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,467
What was that you said? (CHUCKLES)

511
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,719
My father should hear this.

512
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,389
No, I don't want to talk to your father
or to his mother.

513
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,474
- Hello. Who is this?
- This is the police talking.

514
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,518
- Yeah, but she just told you that...
- I'm the police.

515
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,437
Oh, you're the police.
Oh, he's the police. That's different.

516
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,064
What can I do for you?

517
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,526
I can do what? Where?

518
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,737
Oh, no, I wouldn't like that
and neither would my daughter.

519
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,408
I hope the sergeant
never traces that call.

520
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,827
- You like to play games, don't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

521
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,746
Why did you stop me phoning?

522
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,707
'Cause I'm working for your father.

523
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,210
Or, because I think I'm beginning
to like another one of the Sternwoods.

524
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,213
I prefer the second reason.

525
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,757
Well, let's get back to business.

526
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,677
- Have you got $5,000 in cash?
- No.

527
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,512
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

528
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,599
- Where from? Your father?
- I'd rather not.

529
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,017
Where would you get it?

530
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,562
- Well, from Eddie Mars.
- The gambler?

531
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,273
Well, that explains why you haven't
got $5,000 in cash.

532
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,400
- I like gambling.
- So do I.

533
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,943
How do you know he'll give it to you?

534
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,280
Oh, I can get the money.
I've been a good customer of Eddie Mars.

535
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:45,076
Another reason, there's a bond between
Mr. Mars and the Sternwoods.

536
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,289
You see, Shawn Regan ran off
with Eddie's wife.

537
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,041
That doesn't interest you?

538
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,377
Might make it easier for me to find him.

539
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,255
That is if I were looking for him.

540
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,218
- Is Regan mixed up in this?
- No.

541
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,470
No, Shawn's not in any
cheap blackmailing scheme.

542
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,972
I'm glad you said that.
Do you want to tell me now?

543
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,808
- Tell you what?
- What it is you're trying to find out.

544
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,061
You know, it's a funny thing.

545
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,480
You're trying to find out what
your father hired me to find out.

546
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,482
And I'm trying to find out
why you want to find out.

547
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,651
You could go on forever, couldn't you?

548
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,070
Anyway, it'll give us something
to talk about next time we meet.

549
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,697
Among other things. Oh, Mrs. Rutledge,

550
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,283
you wanted me to do something about this,
didn't you?

551
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,493
Mmm-hmm.

552
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,495
That woman who called. How'd you leave it?

553
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,664
She's to call me back at 6:00 this evening
with instructions.

554
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,457
All right, you phone me
as soon as you've heard from her.

555
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,667
- All right.
- Oh, and Mrs. Rutledge,

556
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,669
as long as you're gonna pay five grand
for the rest of these,

557
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,087
you better take this one with you.

558
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,755
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

559
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,219
Well, it wasn't intentional.

560
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,720
Try it sometime.

561
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,522
- Well, I'm back again. Remember me?
- I'm afraid I...

562
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,777
Do you remember me now? Hmm?

563
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,238
- Now, see here! What's the big idea?
- Take it easy, sister.

564
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,240
That was only a stall
about those first editions.

565
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,491
- What are you...
- I got something to sell.

566
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,035
Something Geiger's wanted for a long time.
Is Geiger in?

567
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,163
No. No, he isn't.
You might come back tomorrow...

568
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,666
Drop the veil, sister.
I'm in the business myself.

569
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,168
I haven't got all day. Is he sick?
I could go to his house.

570
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,546
No, that wouldn't do.
Perhaps if you'd come back tomorrow...

571
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,965
Say, Agnes, you...

572
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,217
Come on, Carol.

573
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,763
Hurry up, will you?

574
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,891
- Perhaps you could...
- His name's Lundgren, isn't it?

575
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,727
- Just what do you want?
- Who's the other guy?

576
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,603
You'd better come around tomorrow.

577
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,189
- In the morning? Early?
- Yes, early.

578
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,692
Because it looks like you're moving today.

579
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,581
- All right, driver. Let's go.
- Okay.

580
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,713
Around the corner, then take it easy.

581
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,383
- Where are we going?
- Follow a car. A tail job.

582
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,760
I'm your girl, bud.

583
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,511
It wouldn't be bad.

584
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,930
That station wagon
coming out of the alley.

585
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,557
That's the one.

586
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,397
Here you are, sugar. Buy yourself a cigar.

587
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,566
If you can use me again sometime,
call this number.

588
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,901
Day and night?

589
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,654
Uh, night's better. I work during the day.

590
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,315
- What're you...
- Remember me? I'm Doghouse Reilly,

591
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,526
the man that didn't grow very tall.

592
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,945
What's the matter?
Couldn't you get in the house?

593
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,865
Come on. I've got a key.

594
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,119
- Where'd you leave your car?
- 'Round in back.

595
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,679
- You looking for something?
- I just...

596
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,015
How much do you remember about last night?

597
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,850
Remember what?

598
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,518
I was sick last night. I was home.

599
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,645
I mean before you went home.
In that chair there.

600
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,731
- I...
- Uh-huh. You remember, all right.

601
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,318
Quit your stalling
and stop biting your thumb.

602
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,529
- Were you the one who was here last night?
- How much do you remember?

603
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,617
- Well, are you the police?
- No, I'm a friend of your father's.

604
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,202
Who killed Geiger?

605
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,579
I... Who else knows about it?

606
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,748
What, that he's dead? I don't know.

607
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,708
Certainly not the cops
or they'd be camping here.

608
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,627
Was it Joe Brody?

609
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,629
Joe Brody? Who's he?

610
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,090
Now, look, sister. I don't know
how much trouble you're used to,

611
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,052
but I hope you've had
plenty of practice dodging it.

612
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,513
- Did Brody kill him?
- Kill who?

613
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,889
Ahh.

614
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,977
Yes. Yes, Joe did it.

615
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,771
He did?

616
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,607
Why?

But you're ready
to tell the police he did it, huh?

That is, if we can get
the photograph he's got.

- You mean...
- Oh, yes, it's gone.

621
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,159
I looked for it last night.
Brody took it with him.

- I've got to go home now.
- Uh-uh.

All right, but I wouldn't say anything
to the police about Brody just yet.

As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't say anything about anything,

last night or today.

Don't argue with the man.
Do as he says. Sit down.

771
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,170
Marlowe, you're ruining everything.

772
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,922
- I'm not ruining anything. If you'd...
- Yes, you are.

773
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,341
Say, look! What are you up here for?

774
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,928
To keep her from paying you off,
and to take the cops off your neck.

775
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,430
- Now, I'm not ruining...
- What cops?

776
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,933
The cops that want to find out where
all that lead in Geiger's body came from.

777
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,310
Look, Joe, you shot Geiger.

778
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,104
- I didn't know that...
- The cops don't yet.

779
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,856
The trouble is he wasn't alone
when you shot him.

780
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,442
Either you didn't notice that
and I think you did

781
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,402
or you got scared and ran away.

782
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,612
But you had nerve enough
to take the film out of the camera

783
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,323
and you had nerve enough
to come back later and hide the body.

784
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,992
- You're crazy. Joe didn't...
- Shut up.

MARLOWE: So that you could
clean out Geiger's store

there was a murder to investigate.

787
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,459
You take chances, mister.
It's lucky for you I didn't shoot Geiger.

788
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,669
Yeah, but you can step off for it
just the same, Joe.

789
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,129
You were made to order for the rap.

790
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,589
You think you've got me framed?

791
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,757
- Positive.
- How come?

792
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,468
Because somebody'll tell it that way.
I told you there was a witness.

793
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,261
Now don't go simple on me, Joe.

794
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,930
You mean Carmen. She would.
She'd say anything.

795
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,058
So you have got that picture.

796
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,684
I guess you think I'm dumb.

797
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,895
Just average, for a grafter.

798
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,939
You see, Joe,
either you were there last night

799
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,358
or you got the picture
from somebody who was there.

800
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,860
You knew Carmen was there

801
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,238
because you had your girlfriend here
threaten Mrs. Rutledge with the police.

802
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,990
Now, the only way
you could have known enough to do that

803
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,992
was by being there
and seeing what happened

804
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,161
or having the picture
and knowing when and where it was taken.

805
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,370
That makes sense, doesn't it?

806

And what do you get out of this?

807
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,208
Just a guy who gets paid
to do other people's laundry.

808
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,960
And all I'll get out of it
is that picture.

I'm down to nickels.

- But...

Now let's see, where were we?

Oh, yes,
you were just about to get something.

822

There'd better not be any more prints.

There won't be.

- No.

826

Later.

You're cute. I like you.

Yeah? What you see's nothing.

Get out!

841

Not yet. We got a few things
to straighten out.

842
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,535
I told you to get out.

843

Go on, Joe.
What difference does it make now?

844
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,789
Why'd you put the bee on Mrs. Rutledge?

845
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,042
Well, I tapped the old man once,
six or seven months ago.

846
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,376
I figured it might not work twice.

847
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,879
Well, what made you think
Mrs. Rutledge wouldn't tell him about it?

848
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,465
- How well do you know her?
- We'll pass that.

849
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,799
Well, she gets around.

850
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,969
I figured she might have a thing or two
she wouldn't want the old man to know.

851
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,388
That's a little weak,
but we'll pass that, too.

Look, you got what you came for,
and you got it cheap.

854
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,562
I don't know anything about a picture.
Do I, Agnes?

855
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,105
Yeah, but Joe,
you just gave me the picture.

856
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,816
You're a half-smart guy.
That's what I always draw.

857
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:01,654
Never once a man who's smart
all the way around the course. Never once.

You and every other man I've ever met.

Say, Joe, where'd you get that picture?

861
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,077
It fell out of somebody's pocket.

862

You got an alibi for last night?

863
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,163

864
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,331
Huh.

865

That's a great witness.

Okay, Joe, you can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.

867
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,754
Wait a minute,
what do you mean, a couple of murders?

868
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,257
I mean two murders.
Where were you about 7:30 last night?

869
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,175
- Why, I...
- Where were you?

870
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,344
All right, I was watching Geiger's place.

871
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,762
Why?

872
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,015
- To get something on him.
- Try looking at me while you're talking.

873
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,518
Well, it was raining hard
and I was sitting in my car.

874
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,354
There was a car parked out front
and another part way down the hill.

875
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,522
I was in back.

876
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,440
- Who else was back there?
- Nobody.

877
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,484
There was a big Packard near where I was.

878
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,861
So I took a look at it
and it was registered to the Sternwoods.

879
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,029
And then?

880
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,908
Well, then, nothing happened,
so I got tired of waiting and went home.

881
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,369
- You know where that Packard is now?
- How should I?

882
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,413
It's in the sheriff's garage.

883
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,000
It was fished out of 12 feet of water
off Lido Pier early this morning.

884
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,876
There was a dead man in it.
He'd been sapped.

885
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,712
The car was pointed
toward the end of the pier

886
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,879
and the hand throttle pulled out.

887
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,131
Why, you can't pin that on me.

888
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,382
I can make an awful good try at it.

889
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,134
- Why, I...
- Sit down, Joe.

890
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,472
You see, the dead man was Owen Taylor,
Sternwood's chauffer.

891
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,058
He went up to Geiger's place
because he was sweet on Carmen.

892
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,020
He didn't like the kind of games
Geiger was playing.

893
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,148
He let himself in the back way
with a jimmy, and he had a gun.

894
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,985
And the gun went off, as guns will,
and Geiger fell down dead.

895
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,903
So Owen ran away taking the film with him.

896
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,822
You went after him and got it.
How else would you get it?

897
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,073
All right, you're right.

898
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,284
I heard the shots and saw him
run down the back steps

899
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,744
and enter the Packard and away.

900
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,579
- Yeah.
- I followed him.

901
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,290
He turned west on Sunset.

902
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,208
And beyond Beverly,

903
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:42,463
he, uh, skidded off the road
and, uh, came to a stop.

904
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,923
So I came up and played copper.

905
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,552
He had a gun and he was rattled,
so I sapped him down.

906
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,597
I figured the film might be
worth something, so I took it.

907
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,932
That's the last I saw of him.

908
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,562
So you left an unconscious man
in a car way out near Beverly someplace.

909
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,273
And you want me to believe that
somebody conveniently came along,

910
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,151
ran that car all the way down
to the ocean, pushed it off the pier

911
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,111
and then came back and hid Geiger's body?

912
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,155
- Well, I didn't.
- Somebody did.

913
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,741
And you wanted time to take over.

914
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,618
You can't prove I did it.

915
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,787
I don't particularly want to.

916
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,165
All I want to do is find out
what Geiger had on the Sternwoods.

917
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,002
Well, maybe you and I
can make a little deal.

918
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,296
Go ahead.

No. He asked me to give you a check.

work out a little first,

You got a touch of class,

but I don't know how far you can go.

1016

Go ahead, Marlowe,
I like the way you work.

In case you don't know it,
you're doing all right.

There's one thing I can't figure out.

1020

- Uh-huh.

1021
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,455
I'll give you a little hint.

1022
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,666
Sugar won't work. It's been tried.

1023

Then what'd you try it on me for?

1024
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,920
Who told you to sugar me off this case?

But somebody put you up to it
and it wasn't your father.

1029
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,140
No, he's not well. I used my own judgment.

Are you sure?

1031
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,103
Of course, I know it hasn't worked
so well up till now.

1032
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,230
What's Eddie Mars
got to do with this case?

1033
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,399
Nothing. He runs a gambling house.

You're playing something else, too.

Did you know he owned
the house Geiger operated in?

1041
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,539
And that he was mixed up
in that racket, too?

1042
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,707
No. I don't believe it.

1043
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,834

we could have had a lot of fun,

- Hello, Marlowe. Glad you came.

1081
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,705
You've never been here before, have you?

1082
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:06,915
No, it's the first time.

1083
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,833
I wouldn't be here now if you
hadn't told me over the phone

1084
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,585
I could come up here if I needed help.

- Yeah.

01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,512
I like the way you've handled
this whole thing.

1088
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:21,721
It made me sore at first,

1089
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,099
but I see now you knew
what you were doin'.

1090

You and I could get along.

- For what?

1093
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,317
Still careful, huh?

1094
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,529
All right, then, I want some information

1095
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:38,822
about Shawn Regan.

1096
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,037
I heard you got that already
from the Bureau of Missing Persons.

- You get around, huh.
- My boys do.

1098

- Where is he?
- I haven't any idea.

1099
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,626
You didn't bump him off, did you?

1100
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,503
No. Do you think I did?

1101
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,046
Well, that's what
I came up here to ask you.

1102
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,214
You're kiddin'.

1103
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,715
All right, I'm kiddin'.

1104
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,844
You didn't do it yourself,

1105
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,137
and none of your boys
are good enough to do it.

1106
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,304
I used to know Regan.

1107
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:06,391
I thought you told me
you weren't looking for Regan?

1108
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,893
I wasn't then. Maybe I just got curious.

1109
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,854
You see, I finally got it
through my thick skull

1110
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,522
that half the General's worries were

1111
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,649
that Regan might be mixed up
in this blackmail business.

that washed the whole thing up.

That, I'm sure of.

1117
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,245
It's finished then.

1118
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:31,583
The General thinks like you do.

1119
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,750
He paid me off today.

1120
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,294
I'm sorry to hear that.

1121
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:37,422
I wish he'd hire you on a straight salary
to keep that daughter of his home.

1122
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,257
- She's out there now.
- Yeah, I know. I heard her.

1123
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,092
She's not very popular around here.

1124
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,220
When she loses, she doubles
and I wind up with a fistful of paper.

1125
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:45,930
If she wins, she takes
my money home with her.

1126
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,432
Well, you get it back next time,
don't you?

1127
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,892
She's spent it somewhere else by then.

1128
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,643
- I see. She goes on the cuff, huh?
- Yeah.

1129
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,562
I'd keep her out of here, then.

1130
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,607
Well, it looks like
I took the long trip for nothing.

Sorry I can't help you.

1132
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,943
You mind if I look the place over
before I go back?

No, go ahead. Take that door.

Maybe.

You know, there's one thing
that puzzles me.

1138

You don't seem in much of a hurry
to find that wife of yours.

From what I hear, she's not the kind
of a wife a guy wants to lose.

1140
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,295
Could it be that you know where she is?

Maybe Regan, too?

Plymouth coupe, maybe?

No. Why should I?

about where I am all the time.

You like my father, don't you?

1231
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,287
Well, why don't you stop?

1232
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,498
Remember I told you
I was beginning to like

1233
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,166
another one of the Sternwoods?

1234
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,126
I wish you'd show it.

1235
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:50,378
That should be awful easy.

1236
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:00,972
I liked that.

1237
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,182
I'd like more.

1238
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,941
That's even better.

1239
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:17,530
All right. Now that's settled,
what's Eddie Mars got on you?

1240
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,075
- So that's the way it is?
- That's the way it is.

1241
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,203
Kissing you is all right. It's nice.
I'd like to do more of it.

1242
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,289
But first, I want to find out
what Eddie Mars has on you.

1243
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:27,498
If you say that again, I'll...

1244
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,666
I'll keep on saying it until I find out.

1245
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:32,461
Look, angel, I called Eddie Mars
and told him I was coming up to see him.

1246
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,005
When I arrived, you were there.

1247
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,214
The two of you staged an act.

1248
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,382
He let you win a lot of money

1249
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,509
and then sent a man around
to take it away from you.

1250
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,845
Just to prove
there was nothing between you.

1251
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,763
You're shaking again.

1252
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,307
Take me home.

1253
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,933
Sure, I will.

1254
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,685
But first open that bag.

1255
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,855
If there's 28 grand in it,
I'll eat every word I've said.

1256
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,565
Come on, open it and make a sap out of me,

1257
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,108
or else stop playing me for one.

1258
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,318
Take me home.

1259
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:58,696
All right, I'm afraid that's
as far as I'm gonna carry you.

1260
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,032
From now on,
you can take care of yourself.

1261
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,385
Well, what does the hat-check girl
get for a tip?

1262
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,054
I'm trying to think
of something appropriate.

1263
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,221
How'd you get in here?

1264
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,890
Bet you can't guess.

1265
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,391
I'll bet I can.

1266
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,185
You came in through the keyhole
like Peter Pan.

1267
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,394
CARMEN: Who's he?

1268
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:32,813
A guy I used to know around a pool room.

1269
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,191
You're cute.

1270
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,485
I'm getting cuter every minute.
How did you get in?

1271
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,820
I showed the manager your card.
I stole it from Vivian.

1272
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,239
I told him you said to come
up here and wait for you.

1273
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,491
I want...

1274
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,576
See, I remembered.

1275
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,745
What do you remember about Shawn Regan?

1276
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,205
I didn't like him.

1277
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,373
Yeah? Why?

1278
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,833
He didn't pay any more attention
to me than you do.

1279
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,502
Treated me like a baby all the time.

1280
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,629
How does Eddie Mars treat you?

1281
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:59,465
- I don't know him.
- You sure?

1282
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:00,841
You know who he is, don't you?

1283
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,094
He's always calling Vivian up. Why?

1284
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,261
Is he cute?

1285
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,890
You know, I think
you're telling the truth, for a change.

1286
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,059
Is he as cute as you are?

1287
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,602
Nobody is.

1288
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,813
All right, kid, I've had a long day.
You'd better be going.

1289
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,022
Mm-mm.

1290
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,358
- Come on, Carmen. Come on.
- I don't want... I...

1291
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,699
- CARMEN: You can't...
- Shut up.

1292
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,706
(PHONE RINGING)

1293
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,627
Yeah?

1294
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,212
BERNIE: Hello, Phil.

1295
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,964
Hello, Bernie. What's up?

1296
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,549
I want to see you down here right away.

1297
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,467
I just woke up. I haven't had breakfast.

1298
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,469
- It's 2:00.
- 2:00?

1299
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,096
Yeah. If you're not in my office
in 30 minutes,

1300
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:48,556
you'll be eating on the county.

1301
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,976
I'd rather buy my own.
I know that food the county puts out.

1302
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,603
- All right, I'll be there.
- Okay.

1303
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:04,780
Don't you know any better
than to wake a man up

1304
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,240
at 2:00 in the afternoon?

1305
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,200
- What's up?
- I got some orders for you.

1306
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,619
You are to lay off the Sternwood case.

1307
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,747
- Huh? Who says so?
- The DA.

1308
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,582
The DA, huh?

1309
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,295
He must've changed his mind.

1310
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,506
- Who changed it for him?
- General Sternwood.

1311
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,133
Personally?

1312
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:27,470
All right. Between you and me,
he didn't talk to the General.

1313
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,764
He talked to the daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.

1314
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,098
Oh!

1315
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,018
- Any reason given?
- Not that I know of.

1316
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,438
Well, there's no law says a man
can't work on a case without a client.

1317
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,898
You know, just to keep his hand in.

1318
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,025
Now, look, Phil, I'm just supposed
to tell you to lay off...

1319
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,402
I know. You just work here.

1320
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,071
Bernie, put yourself in my shoes
for a minute.

1321
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,823
A nice old guy has two daughters.

1322
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,951
One of them is, well, wonderful.
And the other one is not so wonderful.

1323
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,329
As a result,
somebody gets something on her.

1324
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,914
The father hires me to pay off.

1325
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,166
Before I can get to the guy,
the family chauffeur kills him.

1326
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:00,252
But that didn't stop things.
It just starts them.

1327
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,462
And two murders later,

1328
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,881
I find out somebody's
got something on Wonderful.

1329
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,216
BERNIE: Who's somebody?

1330
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,343
- I think it's Eddie Mars.
- Why?

1331
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,553
For one thing, he owns the house
Geiger was killed in.

1332
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,013
He did.

1333
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,058
The day after the murder,
he transfers the deed to a dummy.

1334
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,269
What have you got that
hooks Mars up with Mrs. Rutledge?

1335
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,563
Well, last night the two of 'em...

1336
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,941
Well, I don't want to bore you
with the whole story,

1337
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,400
but they went to the moon to prove to me

1338
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:25,569
there was nothing between 'em,
but I think there is,

1339
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:27,238
and I think it's got something
to do with Shawn Regan.

1340
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,741
Who's missing and supposed to have
run off with Eddie Mars' wife.

1341
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,034
Uh-huh.

1342
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,661
What does the General think
about all this?

1343
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,081
I don't know.
Wonderful won't let me get to him.

1344
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,582
You still want me to lay off?

1345
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,001
Well, the DA does,

1346
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:44,421
but you generally do all right
following your own hunches.

1347
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,257
Thanks, Bernie.

1348
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,550
Well, I'm going out
and getting some breakfast.

1349
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:48,884
You want a cup of coffee?

1350
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:50,970
Mm-mm.
I can't afford to be seen with you.

1351
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,640
Well, so long, Bernie.

1352
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:23,836
NORRIS: Sternwood residence.

1353
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,130
Hello, Norris. This is Marlowe.

1354
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,715
Yes, Mr. Marlowe. I...

1355
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,175
Norris, I'd like to come out
and see General Sternwood.

1356
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,303
I don't think
it would be possible, sir, tonight.

1357
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,470
Yeah? Why not?

1358
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,472
I've been trying to call you,
Mr. Marlowe.

1359
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,183
Mrs. Rutledge is very anxious
to talk to you.

1360
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,269
If you'll wait just a minute,
I'll put her on.

1361
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,437
Uh-huh.

1362
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,648
Say, sugar, you got a match?

1363
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,025
Sure thing.

1364
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,570
VIVIAN: Hello, Marlowe.

1365
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,071
Hello?

1366
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,323
Thanks.

1367
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,158
Hello?

1368
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,619
Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.

1369
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:58,913
Hello, Marlowe. I wanted to tell you,

1370
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,332
you can stop worrying
and call off your bloodhounds.

1371
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:02,666
We've found Shawn.

1372
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,209
What's that? You've found Shawn?

1373
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:07,129
Yes, he's been in Mexico.
He hasn't been very well.

1374
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:08,589
Yeah? What happened?

1375
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,508
An accident of some kind.
We didn't get all the details.

1376
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,510
I'm leaving at once to meet him.

1377
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:14,845
Oh, I see.

1378
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,681
I suppose the General's quite pleased.

1379
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,601
We haven't told him yet.
We thought it best to wait.

1380
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,020
Well, thanks for telling me.

1381
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,396
Have a nice trip.

1382
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,273
I will. Goodbye.

1383
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,691
Goodbye.

1384
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,436
Say, mister, would you please...

1385
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,408
(GRUNTING)

1386
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,785
This is just our way of sayin' lay off!

1387
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:21,286

(GROANS)

1390
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:55,946
You the guy that's been tailing me?

1391
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,615
Yeah. My name's Jones. Harry Jones.

1392
01:23:58,783 --> 01:23:59,950
I want to see you.

1393
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,160
That's swell.

1394
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,621
Did you want to see those guys jump me?

1395
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,623
I didn't care one way or the other.

1396
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,960
You could've yelled for help.

1397
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,129
A guy's playin' a hand, I let him play it.

1398
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,881
I'm no kibitzer.

1399
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,967
You got brains.

1400
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,802
Get my hat, will you?

1401
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,890
Help me up to my office.

1402
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:41,867
That working over they gave you

1403
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:44,244
was about the best I've ever seen,
and I've been around, too.

1404
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,621
Yeah.

1405
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,456
Used to run a little liquor.

1406
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:50,167
Rode the scout car
with a Tommy gun in my lap.

1407
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,336
- A tough racket.
- Terrible.

1408
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:54,421
Sit down. You make me nervous.

1409
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,590
Maybe you don't believe me.

1410
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,133
What do you want?

1411
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:59,510
That's better.

1412
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,721
I've got something to sell, cheap,
for a couple of C's.

1413
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,473
Don't let me stop you.

1414
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,974
Don't you even want to know who I am?

1415
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,018
I already know.

1416
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,269
You're not a cop.

1417
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,772
You don't belong to Eddie Mars,
because I asked him.

1418
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,274
So you must be one of Brody's friends.

1419
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,401
So Agnes is loose again, huh?

1420
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:18,195
- How'd you know that?
- (CHUCKLES)

1421
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,448
She's a nice girl.
We're talking about getting married.

1422
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,200
She's too big for you.

1423
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,619
That's a dirty crack, brother.

1424
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,996
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

1425
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,252
Maybe I've been running around
with the wrong people.

1426
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,671
Let's cut the babble. What do you want?

1427
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,840
You're looking for something.
Will you pay for It?

1428
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:39,591
- If it does what?
- Helps you find Regan.

1429
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:42,219
This is getting funny.

1430
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,848
I'm supposed to pay you two C's
for telling me I'm looking for Regan.

1431
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:47,975
People have been telling me that for days.

1432
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,893
I don't even pass out cigars anymore.

1433
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:52,187
Do you want to know what I've got,
or don't you?

1434
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:53,564
I don't know.

1435
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,775
$200 buys a lot of information
in my circle.

1436
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,361
Would you pay it to know
where Eddie Mars' wife is?

1437
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:01,905
Would you pay 200 bucks for that, shamus?

1438
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:04,408
I think I might. Where?

1439
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:05,576
Agnes found her.

1440
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,246
She'll tell you.
When she has the dough in her hand.

1441
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,290
You might tell the cops for nothing.

1442
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:13,208
I ain't so brittle.

1443
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,127
Agnes must have something I didn't notice.

1444
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,421
I ain't tried to pull anything.

1445
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,340
I came here with a straight proposition.
Take it or leave it.

1446
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,259
One right guy to another.

1447
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,595
You start wavin' cops at me.

1448
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:25,929
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1449
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:27,598
I am.

1450
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:29,016
Okay. $200 it is.

1451
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,434
Have you got the money?

1452
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:31,602
Where's Agnes?

1453
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,937
You know Puss Walgreen's office,
Fulwider Building,

1454
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,856
428, in the back?

1455
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,566
No, but I can find it.

1456
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,526
Will you be in shape
to meet me there in an hour?

1457
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,736
Yeah, I guess so.

1458
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,446
You bring the dough,
and I'll take you to Agnes.

1459
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,865
- Okay.
- Okay.

1460
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,201
JONES: Who are you? What do you want?

1461
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:33,997
What did you follow me in here for?

1462
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,500
MAN: I wanted to see you.

1463
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:40,879
JONES: Who are you?

1464
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,840
MAN: I work for Eddie Mars.
My name is Canino.

1465
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:47,844
JONES: Canino? Yeah,
I've heard about you. Sure.

1466
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:49,763
CANINO: I thought you would remember.

1467
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:50,973
JONES: What do you want?

1468
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,725
CANINO: I want to know why you been
following that Detective Marlowe.

1469
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,060
JONES: Who says I've been?
CANINO: I do.

1470
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,020
That was a mistake, your mistake.

1471
01:27:57,188 --> 01:27:59,064
- Eddie Mars don't like it.
- JONES: I don't see what business...

1472
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,984
CANINO: Sit down and quit stallin'.
Why are you tailing Marlowe?

1473
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,778
JONES: All right, there's no harm tellin'.

1474
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,363
It was for Joe Brody's girl.

1475
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,699
She's got to get out of town.
That takes dough.

1476
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:09,950
She figured she could get it
through Marlowe.

1477
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,118
Why would he pay?

1478
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,413
You know about the night
the kid bumped Brody.

1479
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,873
Well, the young Sternwood girl was there.

1480
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,333
Only, Marlowe didn't tell the cops that.

1481
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,379
So Agnes figured it was railroad fare
as soon as she could get hold of him.

1482
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,298
- You get it?
- CANINO: Sure, I get it.

1483
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,341
- Where's this Agnes?
- JONES: What do you care?

1484
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,969
What do you want with her?
What's she got...

1485
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,555
What's the matter, Jones?
Ain't you ever seen a gun before?

1486
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:32,723
Where's the girl?

1487
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,057
- Listen...
- You want me to count

1488
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:36,018
three or somethin', like a movie?

1489
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,145
- Where's Agnes?
- All right.

1490
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:40,397
You win.

1491
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:44,234
She's in an apartment at 28 Court Street.

1493
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,781
I guess I'm yellow, all right.

1494
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:52,367
You just got good sense.

1495
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:56,371
I ain't gonna hurt her.
Not if everything's like you say.

1496
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:57,748
You're nervous, ain't you?

1497
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,958
- Maybe you need a drink.
- Never mind. Thanks...

1498
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:01,209
- I think you need one.
- I don't think so...

1499
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:02,502
You got a glass?

1500
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,296
Yeah.

1501
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,089
There at the water cooler.

1502
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:24,066
There you are, pal. Drink her down.

1503
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,443
Well, drink it.

1504
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,945
What do you think it is, poison?

1505
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,281
I'll bet that Agnes of yours
wouldn't turn it down.

1506
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:33,992
No, I'll bet she wouldn't.

You got a girl living there
named Agnes Lozier?

Nobody by that name here.

Well, have you got a brunette
with green eyes, kinda slanted,

wears a gray hat and gray suit?

Oh, hello, Agnes. This is Marlowe.

- Marlowe, the man you want to see.

01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,599
- Yeah. Yeah, I want it.
- Have you got a car?

1541
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:04,434
- Yeah.
- Where can I meet you?

1542
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:05,727
Rampart and Oakwood.

1543
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,479
I'll be there in half an hour.

1544
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,625
What happened to Harry?

1545
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,962
There's no use going into that.
You don't really care, anyway.

1546
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,506
Just put it down, "Your little man
deserved something better."

1547
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:36,341
Here you are. Here's your $200.

1548
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:40,345
Well, Joe and I were out
ridin' on Foothill Boulevard

1549
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,972
a couple of weeks ago.

1550
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:44,641
We passed a brown coupe,
and I saw the girl who was drivin'.

1551
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,309
She was Eddie Mars' wife.

1552
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:47,769
There was a fellow with her, Canino.

1553
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:48,979
Yeah, I know him.

1554
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:50,313
Yeah, there're some people
you don't forget

1555
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:52,315
even if you've only seen them once.

1556
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,276
So we got curious and Joe tailed them.

1557
01:32:54,443 --> 01:32:55,944
- Do you know where Realito is?
- Uh-huh.

1558
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,613
Well, about 10 miles east,
there's a side road.

1559
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,615
Just off the highway, there's
a two-bit garage and paint shop

1560
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:02,284
run by a guy named Art Huck.

1561
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:05,662
Hot car drop likely.
And a frame house right behind it.

1562
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,247
That's where Eddie Mars' wife is holed up.

1563
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,457
- You're sure of that?
- Why should I lie?

1564
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,668
Art Huck's 10 miles east of Realito?
Is that right?

1565
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:12,836
Yeah.

1566
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:15,839
Well, so long, copper. Wish me luck.
I got a raw deal.

1567
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:17,882
Your kind always does.

1570
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,699
Open up. I got a flat back here
on the highway.

1571
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:09,536
Sorry, mister. We're closed for the night.
Better try Realito.

You could scare off
a lot of trade with that.

You can get yourself hurt,
kicking on doors.

01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,142
Cut it out, Art.

1578
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:35,186
The guy's right.
You run a garage, don't you?

1579
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:37,981
Go ahead. Give him a hand.

1580
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:40,608
Thanks, mister.

I suppose you can fix flats.

Good as you can make 'em, bud.

1583
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,532
But right now, I'm busy
workin' on a spray job.

1584
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,492
It's too damp for a good spray job, Art.

1585
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,619
You got time to fix his tires.

- Yeah. But I don't...
- Get movin'.

01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,039
Sure.

1588
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:57,667
Here. Here's the key to the back.
Put the spare on.

1589
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,169
That'll make it easier.

1590
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,676
Yeah, I took a skid up at the corner.

1591
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,387
A front tire went.
Lucky to find some help.

Yeah. You live around here?

No. Just drove in
from Reno and Carson City.

- Partly.

to have run off with.

You had to go on with this, didn't you?

1619

Where are they?

1620
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,325
They've gone down the road to telephone.

To call up Eddie Mars, huh?
To find out what to do with me.

1622

(CHUCKLES) Well, I could've told 'em that.

Why did you have to go on?

Why did you have to make trouble?

Eddie never did you any harm.

1628

Besides, I was never in love with Shawn.

1629
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,679
We were just good friends.

1630

If I hadn't hidden out here
when Shawn disappeared,

1631
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:18,975
the police would have been certain
he killed him.

1632
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,435
Well, maybe he did kill him.

1633
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,270
Eddie's not that kind.

1634
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,105
You mean Eddie Mars never kills anybody?

1635
01:38:24,273 --> 01:38:25,648
No.

1636
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:27,901
- You really believe that, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

1637
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:32,280
How do you suppose I found out
you were here?

1638
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,489
I don't know. How did you?

1639
01:38:33,657 --> 01:38:36,034
Well, a little man named
Harry Jones told me.

1640
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:38,786
A funny little guy, harmless. I liked him.

1641
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:40,163
He came to sell me the information

1642
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,166
because he found out
I was working for General Sternwood.

1643
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,169
How he found out's a long story.

1644
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,963
Anyway, Canino, your husband's hired man,

1645
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:51,257
got to him first
while I stood around like a sap.

1646
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,635
I was in the next room.

1647
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,345
Now that little man is dead.

1648
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:57,347
- But Eddie Mars didn't do that.
- You're lying.

1649
01:38:57,514 --> 01:39:00,183
No. Eddie Mars never kills anybody.
He just hires it done.

1650
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,351
I don't believe you.

1651
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:02,894
You think he's just a gambler, don't you?

1652
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,479
Well, I think he's a blackmailer...

1653
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:05,855
- You'd better stop talking!
- ...a hot car broker,

1654
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:07,190
a killer by remote control.

1655
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:08,399
He's anything that looks good to him.

1656
01:39:08,567 --> 01:39:10,276
Anything with money pinned to it.
Anything rotten. He'd...

1657
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,322
Ask him when you see him.

1658
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:18,159
Well, I got rid of her.

1659
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:19,911
She's okay. I like her.

1660
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,288
You like too many people.

1661
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,916
Never mind, angel. The water feels good.

1662
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,419
I wonder if you'd do
what she did for a man.

1663
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:30,797
I was wondering that myself.

1664
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:34,926
Huh. Well, there's nothing to do
but wait for Canino to come back.

1665
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:37,261
He doesn't know I was in the other room.

1666
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:39,514
You know what he'll do
when he finds out, don't you?

1667
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:40,807
He'll beat my teeth out

1668
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,934
and then kick me in the stomach
for mumbling.

1669
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:44,936
Well, that'll be just a start.
It won't be pretty to watch...

1670
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,729
Please don't talk like that.

1671
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:48,815
- You should have gone to Mexico.
- Stop, please.

1672
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:51,109
Then you couldn't have gone, could you?

1673
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,860
The border patrol would have
checked you through alone.

1674
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,446
Too many people would have
seen you without Regan.

1675
01:39:55,614 --> 01:39:56,781
It was much safer to come here with her.

1676
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,408
Much safer, especially for Eddie Mars.

1677
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,245
Will you get out of this
and stay out if I let you go?

1678
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,788
No.

1679
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,249
Take this thing out of my mouth, will you?

1680
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,017
Ah, that's better.

1681

Watch your fingers.

1683
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,291
Don't cut towards your hand.

1684
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,337

- None that I know of.

Look, angel.
I'm gonna leave you in a tough spot.

- That's all right with me.

01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,952
- and then scream your head off.
- I will.

1695
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:27,830

You heard what I said.

1699
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:23,905
There! There! Behind the wheel!

1700
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:27,867
Over here, Canino.

Here.

1702

That looks like the key.

We'll have to take his car.

1704
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,910
How far is it from back there
to the nearest telephone?

1705
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,829
About eight or 10 miles to Realito. Why?

1706
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:17,250
When Eddie Mars' wife gets my car fixed
and he finds out what happened,

1707
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,751
there'll be plenty of trouble.

1708
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:20,836
You'll be in it just as much as I will.

1709
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:22,672
I don't mind, as long as you're around.

1710
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:27,927
I didn't have a chance to thank you
for what you did back there.

1711
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:30,263
You looked good, awful good.

1712
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,974
I didn't know they
made 'em like that anymore.

1713

I guess I'm in love with you.

1714
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:40,189
Will you go to the police with me?

1715
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,316
- I can't.
- Why not?

1716
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:46,237
What if I told you I killed Shawn Regan?

1717
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:48,155
Will you tell the police that?

1718
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:50,992
I will if you take me there.

1719
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:54,829
I'm not going to.

1720

Look, angel, I'm tired.

1721
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:00,376
My jaw hurts and my ribs ache.
I killed a man back there,

1722
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:03,421
and I had to stand by
while a harmless little guy was killed.

1723
01:45:03,588 --> 01:45:04,964
Do you think I could tell 'em
all that happened

1724
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,341
because Geiger tried to
throw a loop over Carmen?

1725

they'll swarm over your house so fast

have been in for the last six years

will look like a police convention.

1728
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,851
They'll all ask the same question.

1729
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:18,394
"Where's Shawn Regan?"

1730
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,772

make it look like she ran off with Regan?"

1731
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,566
"Why did you hide out there?"

1732

You're playing with dynamite.

- Don't ask any more questions.

I'm not even gonna ask you
how you got into this mess.

I'm goin' to ask Eddie Mars
if I can get there quick enough.

Yeah, Marlowe, or what's left of him.

another as good.

- Where are you talking from?

I'm in Realito, maybe the same place
Canino called from.

Only now, it's me that's calling.

Why don't you go to the police?
I just killed your best boy.

- Now, do you want to see me or don't you?
- Yeah.

01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:52,530
All right. Where?

1755
01:46:53,156 --> 01:46:54,490
How about going to Los Olindas?

Oh, Los Olindas' too far.
Not your apartment, either.

How about that house of mine?

that Geiger lived in?

- That's up to you.

- About 40 minutes.

She didn't tell me a thing

except that she killed Regan.
But I didn't believe that.

Regan's dead, all right,
but she didn't do it.

- I asked you how it happened.

- Well, Carmen liked Regan, but...
- He liked your wife.

And he said no to Carmen.

1798
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:25,659
She gets mad when anybody says that.
I've seen her that way.

- Go on.
- She was pretty high.

she couldn't remember much about it.

1801

Yeah, I've seen her that way, too.
Then you hid the body and started...

1802
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,126
You can't prove that...

1803
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,420
It'll be just as bad for you
if I prove it to myself.

1804

Then you started to blackmail

How did you prove to her
that Carmen had done it?

Go ahead, prove it to me.

are doing out there.

that goes out that door?

- You look at this.

haven't you ever seen a gun before?

- Now don't go crazy...

And Jonesy took it better
than you're taking it.

- That's one, Eddie.
- Don't, Marlowe, don't. Don't!

You'd better come up
and get me out of here.
