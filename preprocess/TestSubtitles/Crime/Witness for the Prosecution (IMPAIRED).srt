1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,473
<i>(gavel)</i>

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,319
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,876
All persons who have
anything to do before my lords,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,869
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer
and general jail delivery

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,197
for the jurisdiction
of the Central Criminal Court

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,757
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,313
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,310
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,195
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,710
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,035
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

12
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,598
We've been flat on our back
for two months, we'd better be careful.

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,274
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

14
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,834
How lucky you lawyers are.

15
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,350
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy

16
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,074
and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up.

17
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,112
And then peritonitis set in
and he went like that.

18
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,198
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

19
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,309
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

20
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,476
Oh, shut up!

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,556
Williams, my cane.

22
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,516
Here he comes!

23
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,159
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,273
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

25
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,393
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

26
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,875
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,037
Nothing. I'm just happy
that you're your old self again.

28
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,199
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

29
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,756
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know,

30
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,111
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

31
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,677
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

32
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,152
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

33
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,034
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,311
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

35
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,797
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

36
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,549
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

37
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,355
If anything happened to you,
what would happen to me, after 37 years?

38
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,438
37 years! Has it been all that long?

39
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,350
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

40
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,190
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

41
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,110
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.

42
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,870
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,956
Right here.

44
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,829
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,713
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.

46
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,389
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.

47
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,231
What's all this?

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,751
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

49
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,190
Of course. The solicitors
have been breaking down our doors.

50
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,915
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

51
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,477
Divorce case, a tax appeal,
and an important marine insurance claim.

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,797
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,072
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

54
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,557
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,
tobacco, female companionship.

55
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,194
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,309
Sorry, sir.

57
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,955
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

58
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,709
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

59
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,958
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,
get undressed and lie down.

60
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,675
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,234
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,

62
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,559
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

63
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,391
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

64
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,436
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,395
For four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored, probed,

66
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,479
punctured, pillaged and plundered
my helpless body

67
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,559
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk.

68
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.

69
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,033
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

70
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,436
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

71
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,836
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

72
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,632
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

73
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,911
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

74
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,713
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

75
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,879
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,275
No. Upstairs.

77
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,113
A few puffs after meals? Please.

78
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,313
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

79
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,194
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.

80
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,509
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,349
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

82
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,393
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

83
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,116
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.

84
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,915
Here you are. Simply press this button
for up and this one for down.

85
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,998
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption should collapse,

86
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,238
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister...

87
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,920
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.

88
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,750
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

89
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,760
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

90
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,553
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

91
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,231
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,430
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

93
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,028
Serious criminal matter.

94
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,277
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

95
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,358
He can't accept anything
of an overstimulating nature.

96
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,552
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

97
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,148
Hello. Distressing news about your health.

98
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,795
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

99
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,629
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

100
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,993
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

101
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,078
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

102
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,794
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

103
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,992
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

104
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,113
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

105
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,198
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.

106
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,954
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,072
Mayhew! Mayhew!

108
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,839
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

109
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,350
Don't worry, we won't take the brief,
but an old friend needs help.

110
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,199
Surely I can give him a word of advice.

111
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,108
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

112
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,834
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

113
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,554
You go ahead. Start it without me.

114
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,358
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.

115
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,075
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

116
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,555
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

117
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,752
Seems silly to me,
but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

118
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,668
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

119
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,836
Well, for murder.

120
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,439
Oh!

121
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,155
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.

122
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,955
Middle-aged widow, well-off,
living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,116
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

124
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,038
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

125
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,355
struck on the back of the head
and killed.

126
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,517
Vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence.

127
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,349
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

128
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,916
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

129
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,953
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

130
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,198
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

131
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,359
The defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

132
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,031
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

133
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
This will take all our cunning.

134
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,197
Young man!

135
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,117
Come here, please.

136
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,358
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,516
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

138
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,598
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

139
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,115
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

140
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,073
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

141
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,476
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

142
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,912
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

143
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,192
Then let's make absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

144
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,199
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

145
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,073
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

146
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,749
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

147
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,509
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

148
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,790
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.

149
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,879
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

150
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,117
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,708
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

152
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,990
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,112
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

154
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,153
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

155
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,838
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

156
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,794
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

157
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,630
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

158
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,514
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

159
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,110
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement

160
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,472
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

161
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,670
Well, it can't be helped now.

162
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,032
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

163
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,835
He thinks that he made a statement
and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

164
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,636
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

165
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,990
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

166
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,193
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

167
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,834
We try not to make a habit of it.

168
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,393
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?

169
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,957
Of course. There was that case of
that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

170
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,231
In jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap.

171
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,830
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

172
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,078
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

173
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,829
That's all right for him. What if
it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

174
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,032
How would they have restored him
to his normal life then?

175
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,358
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

176
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,359
It's just when you say these things
are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

177
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,996
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

178
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,556
Let's get this straight. I may have done
something highly unethical.

179
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,150
I've taken your cigar
but I'm not taking your case. I can't.

180
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,195
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,118
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

182
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,915
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

183
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,398
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

184
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,436
Hold this.

185
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,749
Carter?

186
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,634
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

187
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,558
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

188
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,910
Not even as a nurse during the war.

189
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,669
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

190
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,950
You'll like Brogan-Moore,
he's had excellent training. Under me.

191
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,868
This morning I had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly I have three.

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,639
We should explain
that I have very little money.

193
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,990
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

194
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,315
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.

195
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,432
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

196
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,472
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,833
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.

198
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,157
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

199
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,398
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

200
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,230
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

201
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,911
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

202
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,508
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

203
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,997
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

204
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,714
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

205
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,277
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

206
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,994
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

207
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,511
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

208
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,553
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

209
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,114
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

210
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,277
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

211
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,595
But my best is really this eggbeater.

212
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,030
It not only beats,
it also separates the yolk from the white.

213
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,469
Is that really desirable?

214
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,034
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,277
The trouble is, I need money
for manufacturing and promotion.

216
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,279
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

217
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,554
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

218
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,309
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

219
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,159
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,

220
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,035
daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,
if I had any money.

221
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,111
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

222
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,674
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

223
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,078
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

224
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,953
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

225
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,356
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

226
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,632
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

227
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,875
<i>(squealing brakes)</i>

228
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,719
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

229
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,194
You buy that hat. I insist.

230
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,631
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

231
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,038
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

232
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,434
Go on, please.

233
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,028
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

234
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,355
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.

235
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,630
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

236
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,198
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

237
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,160
<i>(gunfire and action-sequence music)</i>

238
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,632
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

239
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,035
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

240
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,391
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

241
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,670
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

242
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,871
Thank you. It's such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again.

243
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,835
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

244
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,349
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

245
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,153
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

246
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,400
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

247
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,559
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

248
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,194
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

249
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,198
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

250
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,357
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.

251
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,155
All I knew was she seemed to be
very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

252
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,953
She and her husband
lived abroad in British Nigeria.

253
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,471
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

254
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,751
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.

255
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,952
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

256
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,390
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea.

257
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,476
<i>(Mrs French laughs)</i>

258
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,948
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

259
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,036
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

260
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,118
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

261
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,152
It must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal, which is it?

262
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,794
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

263
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,912
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

264
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,429
We must have one. Is it expensive?

265
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,870
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,834
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

267
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,397
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

268
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,518
Ha!

269
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,557
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

270
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,636
Why not?

271
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,320
This is a charming room.

272
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,558
Hubert and I collected all these things
when we lived in Africa.

273
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,830
Hubert was my husband.

274
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,519
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

275
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,029
That's the mask of the witch doctor.

276
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,549
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

277
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,275
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.

278
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,397
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

279
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,636
Oh, here's tea.

280
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,511
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

281
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,518
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

282
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,995
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

283
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,076
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

284
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,352
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

285
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,270
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

286
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,076
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

287
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,590
Oh, is she? I thought
she came with the collection.

288
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,428
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.

289
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,233
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

290
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,871
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

291
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,912
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

292
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,156
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

293
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,432
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

294
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,917
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

295
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,996
and unsanitary.

296
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,074
Tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder.

297
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,314
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

298
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,273
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to <i>The Mikado</i>.

299
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,313
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

300
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,399
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

301
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
How much money did you get
from Mrs French?

302
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,191
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

303
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,915
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

304
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,996
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

305
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,032
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

306
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,799
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

307
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,117
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

308
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,992
- Because...
- Because what?

309
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,556
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

310
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,989
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

311
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,908
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

312
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,316
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

313
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,671
Because she was rich,
and you were after her money.

314
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,791
Well, yes, in a way.

315
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,030
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

316
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,311
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?

317
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,510
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?

318
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,234
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

319
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,794
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

320
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,549
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

321
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,433
with a gramophone blaring <i>The Mikado</i>.

322
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,120
Perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries.

323
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,677
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

324
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,588
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

325
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,917
I didn't do it. No matter
how bad things look, I didn't do it!

326
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,192
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

327
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,196
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

328
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,676
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

329
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,995
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

330
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,874
As for things looking bad, they
don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

331
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,152
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

332
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,477
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

333
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,512
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

334
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,589
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

335
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,359
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

336
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,710
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.

337
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,868
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

338
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,639
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?

339
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,548
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

340
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,316
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

341
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,116
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

342
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,913
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

343
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,315
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

344
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,715
- Oh, how <i>do</i> you do?
- Badly, thank you.

345
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,719
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

346
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,070
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

347
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,192
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

348
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,312
You will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion, hm?

349
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,113
That leaves us with a murder for profit.

350
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,199
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

351
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,757
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

352
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,792
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

353
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,070
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

354
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,398
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

355
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,751
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

356
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,555
Oh, we'll simply put a lean
on Mr Vole's £80,000.

357
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,912
- What? 80,000?
- The? 80,000 Mrs French left you.

358
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,155
Left me?

359
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,229
They opened Mrs French's
bank vault today and found her will.

360
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,192
- Congratulations.
- ? 80,000!

361
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,756
And I was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater.

362
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,836
I must call Christine.

363
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,193
Oh.

364
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,198
This doesn't make things
look any better for me, does it?

365
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,630
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

366
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,073
They will indeed.? 80,000 makes for
a very handsome motive.

367
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,760
I thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me!

368
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,836
It's not unlikely.

369
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,189
<i>(car pulls up)</i>

370
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,156
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

371
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,637
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

372
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,992
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

373
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,477
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

374
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,115
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

375
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,800
You're getting the de luxe treatment.

376
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,074
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

377
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,795
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police

378
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,595
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

379
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,075
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.

380
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,591
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

381
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,280
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

382
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,872
I have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering Emily French.

383
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,790
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

384
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,753
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?

385
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,269
That won't be necessary, sir.

386
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,790
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

387
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,595
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

388
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,874
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

389
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,994
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

390
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,236
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.

391
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,158
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

392
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,909
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

393
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,715
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

394
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,236
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

395
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,194
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

396
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,276
Good day, sir.

397
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,355
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

398
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,598
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

399
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,110
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

400
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,915
Of course. The prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery.

401
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,397
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

402
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,511
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

403
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,474
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

404
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,269
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

405
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,631
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

406
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,752
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

407
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,348
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

408
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,439
For my first day this has already
been rather hectic. I should be in bed.

409
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,074
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

410
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,150
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

411
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,148
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

412
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,430
Take me, I'm yours.

413
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,077
Oh!

414
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,591
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

415
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,271
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

416
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,393
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

417
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,910
<i>(woman)</i> I do not think
that will be necessary.

418
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,308
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,

419
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,115
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

420
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,629
I'm Christine Vole.

421
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,274
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

422
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,356
How do you do?

423
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,392
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

424
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,318
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

425
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,230
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

426
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,796
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder. Is that it?

427
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,230
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

428
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,874
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.

429
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,958
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

430
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,034
Your husband will have
to stand trial, I'm afraid.

431
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,154
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

432
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,599
Oh?

433
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,439
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

434
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,028
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

435
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,393
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

436
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,228
Is it, perhaps,
that this cause is too hopeless?

437
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,790
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It
was a mistake to let you come back here.

438
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,434
I should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort.

439
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,915
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.

440
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,873
Shut up. You just want
to see me in those nasty shorts.

441
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,151
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

442
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,114
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

443
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,193
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

444
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,232
After your rest
we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.

445
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,318
Then perhaps
we'll have a walk around the square.

446
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,000
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

447
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,477
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

448
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,071
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

449
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,591
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

450
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,474
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

451
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,909
All right. Hop in!

452
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,269
Sir Wilfrid?

453
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,632
Sir Wilfrid!

454
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,478
Come back!

455
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,391
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

456
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,635
Go on.

457
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,355
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

458
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,552
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.

459
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,514
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

460
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,710
and the socks were two sizes too large,

461
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,434
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.

462
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,516
Leonard has a way with women.

463
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,192
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

464
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,155
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

465
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,271
Yes. A lot of money.

466
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,076
Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?

467
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,350
Is that what he told you?

468
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,869
Surely you're not suggesting different?

469
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,879
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.

470
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,632
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

471
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,915
You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

472
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,555
I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.

473
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,911
What hypocrites you are in this country.

474
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,915
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

475
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,477
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

476
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,479
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

477
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,876
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

478
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,959
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

479
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,799
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

480
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,595
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

481
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,280
I assume you want to help your husband?

482
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,838
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

483
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,919
There. Isn't that
more comfortable for you?

484
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,671
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.

485
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,554
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?

486
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,956
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

487
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,957
Isn't it the truth?

488
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,877
Of course.

489
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,798
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

490
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,992
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

491
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,315
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

492
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,591
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian

493
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,234
and who must have an interpreter.

494
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,511
We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

495
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,915
as long as they tell the truth.

496
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,271
You're aware that when you're
in the witness box you will be sworn

497
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,358
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

498
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,189
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

499
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,269
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?

500
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,669
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

501
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,395
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

502
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,717
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

503
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,719
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

504
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,956
How very convenient.

505
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,150
We are dealing with a capital crime.

506
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,909
The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.

507
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,520
He is not my husband.

508
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,989
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

509
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,874
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

510
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,788
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

511
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,879
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.

512
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,514
But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.

513
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,835
Don't you think you should be grateful?

514
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,996
One can get very tired of gratitude.

515
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,714
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

516
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,991
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.

517
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,236
And you?

518
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,635
You want to know too much.

519
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,115
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> gentlemen.

520
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,359
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

521
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,996
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

522
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,910
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."

523
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,749
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.

524
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,155
And you're satisfied, I hope?

525
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,833
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

526
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,394
That woman's up to something. But what?

527
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,399
The prosecution will break her down
in no time when she's in the witness box.

528
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,876
This case is going to be rather
like the charge of the Light Brigade

529
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,629
or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.

530
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,069
With the odds all on the other side.

531
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,634
I haven't got much to go on, have I?

532
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,228
The fact is, I've got nothing.

533
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,396
Let me ask you something.

534
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,876
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?

535
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,676
Do you?

536
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,309
Do you?

537
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,396
I'm not sure.

538
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,956
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

539
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,753
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

540
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,440
I'll take it from here.

541
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,515
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

542
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,995
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

543
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,032
Did you hear me? A match!

544
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,277
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

545
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,554
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

546
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,194
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

547
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,470
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

548
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,556
This is what you were wearing that night.

549
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,434
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

550
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,915
Over here against the wall, please.

551
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,073
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.

552
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,590
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

553
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,314
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

554
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,193
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.

555
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,515
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.

556
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,599
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

557
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,110
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

558
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,754
Mayhew, give me the reports.

559
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,917
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

560
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,955
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

561
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,276
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

562
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,436
particularly her income tax returns."

563
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,358
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms
are very complicated.

564
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,631
There's also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will.

565
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,638
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

566
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,354
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

567
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,430
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

568
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,155
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?

569
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,829
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.

570
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,399
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

571
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,593
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

572
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,599
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

573
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,076
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

574
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,078
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.

575
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,352
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

576
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,436
In Germany in 1945.

577
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,958
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

578
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,675
<i>I was stationed outside Hamburg,</i>
<i>with an RAF maintenance unit</i>.

579
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,113
<i>I'd just installed a shower in the officers'</i>
<i>billet, so they gave me a weekend pass</i>.

580
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,196
<i>(music and cheers)</i>

581
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,355
<i>(woman)</i> Come on!

582
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,959
[ Join the party ]

583
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,038
[ Have a hearty glass of rum ]

584
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,630
[ Don't ever think about tomorrow ]

585
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,718
[ For tomorrow may never come ]

586
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,991
[ When I find me a happy place ]

587
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,032
[ That's where I wanna stay ]

588
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,759
[ Time is nothing
as long as I'm living it up this way ]

589
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,510
[ I may never go home any more ]

590
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,916
[ Dim the lights
and start locking the door ]

591
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,191
[ Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me ]

592
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,756
[ After all that's what sailors are for ]

593
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,670
[ I've got kisses and kisses galore ]

594
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,951
[ That have never been tasted before ]

595
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,197
[ If you treat me right
This could be the night ]

596
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,799
[ I may never go home ]

597
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,473
[ I may never go home ]

598
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,312
[ I may never go home ]

599
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,993
[ I may never go home ]

600
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,476
[ I may never go home any more ]

601
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,756
[ I may never go home any more ]

602
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,917
Hey, <i>Fräulein</i>, show us some legs.

603
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,999
They rob you blind
and then throw you a ruddy sailor!

604
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,510
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

605
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,312
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!

606
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,637
All right, <i>Fräulein</i>,
if you won't show 'em, I will.

607
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,716
<i>(cheering)</i>

608
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,756
<i>(whistle)</i>

609
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,552
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

610
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,795
Come on.

611
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,353
Bring him round to the other truck.

612
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,192
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

613
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,036
Gesundheit.

614
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,239
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

615
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,351
Oh, let me help you.

616
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,436
<i>(discordant noise)</i>

617
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,314
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

618
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,839
<i>(discordant noise)</i>

619
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,269
I'm terribly sorry.

620
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,595
You better go. We've had trouble enough.

621
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,599
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

622
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,918
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

623
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,430
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

624
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,516
Cigarette? Gum?

625
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,315
You're burning my nose.

626
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,829
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

627
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,394
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

628
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,999
How much?

629
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,190
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?

630
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,108
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

631
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,196
Got any hot water at your place?

632
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,596
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

633
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,278
Nearby.

634
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,872
Come.

635
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,036
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

636
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,630
This is pretty horrible.
In a <i>gemütlich</i> sort of way.

637
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,196
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.

638
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,551
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

639
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,319
She has a Ford automobile.

640
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,398
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

641
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,637
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.

642
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,230
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

643
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,635
You'd better sit down on the cot.

644
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,398
The cot?

645
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,910
Getting more <i>gemütlich</i> all the time.
Are you married?

646
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,871
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

647
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,514
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

648
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,394
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.

649
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,071
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

650
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,350
But it's getting better.

651
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,957
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, <i>ja voll</i>.

652
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:22,030
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

653
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,469
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

654
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,556
Very fair.

655
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,558
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

656
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,636
I would.

657
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,068
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

658
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,872
Milk?

659
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,752
Sure.

660
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,590
Milk. Sugar.

661
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,029
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

662
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,912
Yeah.

663
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,634
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,

664
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,117
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

665
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,199
Don't worry, we'll work out something,
like an instalment plan.

666
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,676
[ I may never go home any more ]

667
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,438
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

668
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,314
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

669
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,714
Ooh.

670
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,798
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

671
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,115
Maybe I can fix it.

672
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,196
I'm good at it.

673
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,878
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

674
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,675
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

675
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,951
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

676
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,789
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.

677
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,276
First time she saw it, she was so happy
she broke down and cried.

678
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,916
Naturally. She had a solid roof
over her head and a British passport.

679
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,398
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

680
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,230
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.

681
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,071
You're not? Why not?

682
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,795
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar
with the subtleties of our language.

683
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,229
The prosecution could easily trip her up.

684
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,352
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.

685
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,519
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

686
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,996
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

687
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,591
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

688
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,350
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

689
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,040
Let us wish each other luck.

690
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,712
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

691
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,356
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.

692
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,235
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

693
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,114
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

694
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,199
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

695
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,118
murdered Emily Jane French.

696
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,834
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

697
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,918
Are you guilty or not guilty?

698
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,399
Not guilty.

699
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,158
<i>(murmuring)</i>

700
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,316
Members of the jury,

701
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,036
the prisoner stands indicted for that he,
on the 14th day of October,

702
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,913
murdered Emily Jane French.

703
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,635
To this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty.

704
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,389
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

705
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,398
whether he be guilty or not.

706
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,711
Members of the jury,
by the oath which you have just taken,

707
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,230
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence.

708
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,874
You must shut out
from your minds everything

709
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,436
except what will take place in this court.

710
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,950
You may proceed
for the prosecution, Mr Myers.

711
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,470
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

712
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,151
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

713
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,034
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

714
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,116
appear for the defence.

715
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,190
I trust we are not to be deprived

716
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,118
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

717
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,392
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

718
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,592
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

719
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,669
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

720
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,999
You may, Mr Myers. You may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution.

721
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,270
Thank you, my lord.

722
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,188
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

723
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,279
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

724
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,913
a woman of 56.

725
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,272
How he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection.

726
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,868
On the night of October 14 last,

727
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,834
between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

728
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,314
Medical testimony
will be introduced to prove

729
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,637
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

730
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,274
and it is the case for the prosecution

731
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,472
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

732
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,556
That's not true! I didn't do it!

733
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,590
<i>(murmuring)</i>

734
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,759
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

735
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,555
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

736
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,353
and from the medical
and laboratory experts,

737
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,918
and the evidence of the murdered
woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.

738
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,669
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

739
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,519
- New Scotland Yard.
- <i>(man)</i> Chief Inspector Hearne.

740
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,598
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

741
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,271
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

742
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,960
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.

743
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,072
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

744
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,509
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

745
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,315
It may interest you to know
that I am descended from a warrior family

746
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,594
which traces its brave past
back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

747
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,996
You're to have a calcium injection daily,

748
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,829
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

749
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,794
Any pain or shortness of breath,
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets

750
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,559
under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...

751
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,753
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.

752
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,271
Carter, I'd better take
that Thermos of cocoa with me.

753
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,119
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

754
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,394
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

755
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,954
It is cocoa. So sorry.

756
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,992
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

757
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,680
Take care of this, Carter.

758
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,795
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

759
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,273
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

760
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,994
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.

761
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,477
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

762
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,556
Come along, Carter.

763
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,558
From the body temperature
and other factors,

764
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,275
we placed the time of death
at between 9.30 and 10pm,

765
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,679
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

766
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,673
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

767
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,870
Were there any signs of a struggle?

768
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,230
None. Just the one blow.

769
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,148
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

770
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,431
My lord, I must object.

771
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,755
My learned friend refers
to the assailant as "the murderer".

772
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,316
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

773
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,273
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

774
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,111
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

775
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,310
Please rephrase your question.

776
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,231
Yes, my lord. Inspector,
is it your opinion that the assailant,

777
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,353
whether he, she or it,
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

778
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,596
My lord, I am taken by surprise

779
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,396
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

780
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,318
Quite so. You'll have
to do better than that, Mr Myers.

781
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,670
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.

782
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,360
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

783
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,436
<i>(murmuring)</i>

784
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,757
Silence! Silence!

785
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,836
<i>(gavel)</i>

786
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,718
Very well, Inspector,
let us proceed with the facts.

787
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,072
After establishing the cause and the time
of death, what did you then do?

788
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,875
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

789
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,993
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

790
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,398
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

791
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,636
- No others?
- No others.

792
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,356
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

793
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,634
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

794
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,594
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

795
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,953
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

796
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:19,519
You're saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside?

797
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,838
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

798
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,758
After all, if he insists
on answering his own questions,

799
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,156
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

800
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,635
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?

801
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,716
Yes, my lord.

802
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,153
Inspector,

803
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,750
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman's property was missing?

804
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,838
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

805
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,353
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

806
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,234
break into a house,
do they leave without taking anything?

807
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,429
No, sir.

808
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,358
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

809
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,630
Is that the jacket?

810
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,395
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

811
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,476
Where did you find this, Inspector?

812
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,068
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

813
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,589
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

814
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,075
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

815
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,668
Though an attempt
had been made to wash them out.

816
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,597
What tests were made?

817
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,759
First to determine
if the stains were human blood,

818
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,189
then to classify it by group or type.

819
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,880
And was the blood
of a particular group or type?

820
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,798
Yes, sir. It is type O.

821
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,071
And did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman?

822
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,430
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

823
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,109
- The same. Type O.
- <i>(murmuring)</i>

824
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,869
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

825
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,835
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

826
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,269
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

827
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,155
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

828
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,555
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

829
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,910
So the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery

830
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,156
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

831
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,114
Can't we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house,

832
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,834
suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her,

833
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,157
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

834
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,748
I submit, my lord,
that it is entirely impossible

835
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,271
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

836
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,550
With or without gloves.

837
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,434
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

838
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,753
Inspector, when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

839
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,759
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist,

840
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,431
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

841
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,199
And were you not told
the same thing by his wife?

842
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,029
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

843
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,435
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife

844
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,439
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread?

845
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,997
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

846
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,555
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

847
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,514
You agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?

848
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,995
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

849
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,032
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

850
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,309
Yes, sir, it might.

851
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,355
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

852
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,235
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

853
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,715
- That is correct.
- However,

854
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,150
if the prisoner's blood
were also of this same group,

855
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,874
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

856
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,594
from the household accident
he described to you.

857
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,029
Yes, sir.

858
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,789
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood, Inspector?

859
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,399
No, sir.

860
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,793
I have here a certificate

861
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,038
stating that Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

862
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,355
at the North London Hospital.

863
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,756
And that his blood is group O.

866
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,956
Inspector, granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife,

867
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,038
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

868
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,073
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

869
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,873
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

870
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,353
You may stand down.

01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,752
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

877
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,236
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

878
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,150
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

879
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,592
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

880
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,315
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

881
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,557
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

882
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,717
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

883
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,991
poor feckless bodies, afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work.

884
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:42,114
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

885
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,232
Aye. Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

886
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,920
She knew me and she trusted me.

887
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,793
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.

888
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,596
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

889
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,159
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

890
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,558
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

891
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,753
I promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired.

892
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,350
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

893
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,712
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

894
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,355
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

895
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,109
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

896
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,516
So after supper I slipped
back to get it as it was no distance.

897
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,791
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.

898
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,150
I let myself in
and went upstairs to my room.

899
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:38,274
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

900
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,359
- No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!
- <i>(court murmurs)</i>

901
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,436
Talking and laughing they were.

902
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,950
But it was no business of mine,
so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

903
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,356
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.

904
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,234
You say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9?

905
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,592
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

906
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,998
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

907
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,877
I went back to my niece. Och,
she was delighted with the pattern. Si...

908
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,755
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

909
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,509
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

910
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,596
before she went to bed.

911
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,077
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.

912
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,998
Did you really think
that a burglary had been committed?

913
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,076
My lord, I must protest!

914
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,193
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

915
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,074
Miss McKenzie, were you aware
that Leonard Vole was a married man?

916
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,953
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.

917
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,036
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

918
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,915
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

919
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,635
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

920
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,116
that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?

921
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,596
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

922
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,396
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

923
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,399
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

924
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,035
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

925
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,674
- Why?
- <i>(laughter)</i>

926
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,794
Members of the jury, it is possible
for a woman to read <i>The Life of Disraeli</i>

927
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,879
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

928
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,070
<i>(laughter)</i>

929
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,320
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

930
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,796
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

931
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,229
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

932
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,193
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

933
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,990
You heard Mrs French
and the prisoner discussing her new will?

934
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,839
Yes. He was to have all her money,
she told him,

935
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,192
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did.

936
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,596
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

937
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,871
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

938
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,117
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.

939
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,560
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

940
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,637
Would you...? Thank you.

941
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,958
Miss McKenzie, you have
given evidence about two wills.

942
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,036
In the old will, that which was revoked,

943
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,835
were you not to receive
the bulk of Mrs French's estate?

944
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,109
That's so.

945
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,358
Whereas in the new will, except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity,

946
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,995
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

947
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,749
It'll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money.

948
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,032
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.

949
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,628
I'm not antagonistic to him.

950
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,594
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

951
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,470
<i>(laughter)</i>

952
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,556
I suggest you formed this opinion

953
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,309
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

954
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,433
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

955
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,154
Now. On the night of October 14

956
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,431
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

957
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,870
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

958
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,434
You mean you only heard the voices?

959
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,279
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

960
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,392
What makes you say
the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?

961
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,718
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

962
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,150
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

963
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,078
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door,

964
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,794
yet you are sure
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

965
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,593
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

966
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,670
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

967
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,234
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

968
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,478
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

969
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,513
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

970
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,518
Yes. She was fond
of a talk or a good play.

971
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,757
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

972
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,950
what you really heard was the television

973
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,548
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

974
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,958
There was a play called <i>Lover's Leap</i>
on the television that night.

975
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:07,312
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

976
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,275
Because the television was away
being repaired that week, that's why.

977
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,038
<i>(laughter)</i>

978
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,516
<i>(gavel)</i>

979
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,277
Silence! Silence!

980
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,912
Odd. It's not time yet.

981
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,952
If my learned friend has no further
questions, I'd like...

982
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,038
I have not quite finished.

983
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,597
You are registered, are you not,
under the National Health Insurance Act?

984
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,315
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.

985
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,352
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

986
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,278
I am sure that many agree with you.

987
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,555
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

988
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,150
- <i>(quietly)</i>... a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

989
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,158
I protest against the way
in which this question was put!

990
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,238
I will repeat the question, my lord.

991
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:11,071
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

992
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,876
did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?

993
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,989
Yes, I did.

994
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,429
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

995
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,634
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

996
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,832
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

997
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,918
that you could distinguish the voice of...

998
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,156
<i>(quietly)</i>... the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

999
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,236
Who? Who?

1000
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,270
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1001
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,356
No further questions.

1002
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,915
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.

1003
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,953
Six months ago I applied for
my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

1004
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,835
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

1005
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,793
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

1006
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,229
<i>(laughter)</i>

1007
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,477
<i>(Myers)</i> Call Police Constable Jeffries.

1008
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,718
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

1009
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,559
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1010
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,549
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1011
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,033
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?

1012
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,950
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

1013
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,716
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

1014
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,836
Christine.

1015
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,834
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1016
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,430
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1017
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,074
My lord, I have the most serious objection

1018
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,113
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

1019
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,231
I call my learned friend's attention

1020
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:29,717
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

1021
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,753
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1022
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,350
And you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1023
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,040
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1024
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,039
No.

1025
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,472
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1026
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,114
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1027
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,550
There is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner,

1028
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,513
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage?

1029
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:01,033
My lord, the so-called previous marriage
is, in fact, well-documented.

1030
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:06,917
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1031
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:11,556
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1032
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,399
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.

1033
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:20,197
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1034
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,597
You're willing to give evidence against the
man you've been calling your husband?

1035
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,119
Yes.

1036
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,355
You stated to the police that on the night
that Mrs French was murdered,

1037
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,508
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1038
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,154
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?

1039
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,797
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.

1040
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,391
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1041
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,919
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1042
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,876
Silence!

1043
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,956
I must have silence.

1044
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,198
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1045
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,153
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1046
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,239
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1047
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,750
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1048
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,474
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

1049
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,716
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1050
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,910
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1051
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,918
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1052
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,190
He said "I've killed her."

1053
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,632
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1054
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,753
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1055
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,190
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1056
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,357
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

1057
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,075
My lord is most gracious,
but pray let the witness continue.

1058
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,273
We are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction.

1059
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,109
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1060
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,038
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1061
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,756
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1062
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,599
It was that woman
he had been seeing so often.

1063
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,271
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1064
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,675
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1065
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,791
But you've changed your story now. Why?

1066
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,036
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1067
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,357
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1068
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,119
He married me
and brought me to this country.

1069
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,152
What he has asked me to do I have
because I was grateful.

1070
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,192
It was not because
he was your husband and you loved him?

1071
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,276
I never loved him.

1072
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,797
It was gratitude, then,
that prompted you to give him an alibi

1073
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,276
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1074
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,790
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1075
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,956
That woman, she was a harmless old fool,

1076
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,514
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder.

1077
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,474
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1078
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,160
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1079
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,430
Then this is the truth?

1080
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,950
That Leonard Vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten,

1081
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,071
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,

1082
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,159
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1083
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,432
That is the truth.

1084
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,597
That is the truth, before God?

1085
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,756
That is the truth.

1086
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,196
Thank you.

1087
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,590
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,
which do you prefer to be called?

1088
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,676
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1089
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,679
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1090
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,794
However, it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1091
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:41,232
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1092
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,318
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1093
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,396
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1094
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,478
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1095
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,398
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

1096
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,670
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1097
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,998
And in the ceremony, when you swore
to love, honour and cherish your husband,

1098
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,509
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1099
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,757
And when the police questioned you
about this wretched man

1100
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,189
who believed himself married and loved,

1101
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,709
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1102
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,515
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1103
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,758
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1104
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:22,078
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1105
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:26,876
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1106
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,390
The question is, Frau Helm,
were you lying then, are you lying now?

1107
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,115
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1108
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,629
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1109
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,510
<i>(coughs)</i>

1110
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,792
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.

1111
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,072
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1112
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,239
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1113
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,319
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1114
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,828
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1115
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,714
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1116
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,594
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1117
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,280
when she was sworn here today.

1118
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,518
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1119
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,676
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1120
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,756
<i>(muttering)</i>

1121
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,718
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1122
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,310
- In German, the word is <i>Meineid</i>.
- Yes. <i>Meineid</i>.

1123
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,431
It means to swear falsely under oath.

1124
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,278
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1125
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:38,155
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1126
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,635
Yes, I'm aware.

1127
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,311
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1128
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,910
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1129
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,917
So help me, God.

1130
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:56,272
Then that, my lord,
is the case for the prosecution.

1131
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,995
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1132
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,636
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1133
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,670
Silence.

1134
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,389
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?

1135
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,109
My lord, members of the jury,

1136
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:39,189
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1137
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,518
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1138
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,030
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne,

1139
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,029
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner, as he always does.

1140
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,870
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1141
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,788
Whether it is theory
or actual fact, however,

1142
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,354
you will decide for yourselves.

1143
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,352
And then you have heard
the evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1144
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,473
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1145
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,830
One, the death of her beloved mistress

1146
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:19,398
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of? 80,000,

1147
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,193
which she'd fully expected to receive.

1148
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,995
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1149
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,834
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

1150
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,713
in both these... mishaps.

1151
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:40,112
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1152
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,711
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1153
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:49,356
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1154
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:53,075
I objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence

1155
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,589
<i>harmful</i> to her husband.

1156
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:02,114
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1157
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:08,156
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it.

1158
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,033
For what it is worth.

1159
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,832
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.

1160
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,873
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1161
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,788
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1162
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:30,392
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1163
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,273
on this tragic riddle.

1164
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,276
The prisoner himself.

1165
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,750
Members of the jury,

1166
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,316
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1167
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,997
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give will be the truth,

1168
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,157
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1169
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,313
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1170
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,398
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1171
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,594
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did
you not on the night of October 14 last,

1172
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,870
murder Emily Jane French?

1173
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,194
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1174
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,151
<i>(muttering)</i>

1175
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,558
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1176
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:39,754
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1177
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,269
The defence feels
his faculties should be spared

1178
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,836
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution.

1179
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,713
This is not a plea for any indulgence.

1180
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,752
I am confident that
no matter how searching this may be,

1181
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,633
the prisoner will withstand it.

1182
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,595
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1183
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,676
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1184
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,791
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1185
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,670
No.

1186
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,916
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1187
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,750
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of? 80,000?

1188
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,029
No, I didn't.

1189
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:17,836
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1190
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,111
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

1191
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,555
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1192
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,115
Yes, sir.

1193
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:33,234
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1194
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,477
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1195
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,672
who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own

1196
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,268
at the times that he has stated.

1197
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,710
Apparently, this splendid effort
was without results.

1198
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,115
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1199
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,312
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1200
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,911
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat.

1201
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:01,239
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1202
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,478
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1203
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,479
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1204
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,751
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?

1205
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,839
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1206
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,795
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1207
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,948
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1208
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,389
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1209
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,151
My lord, the lady was so described to me.

1210
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,558
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1211
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,557
Oh.

1212
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,671
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1213
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,870
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

1214
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,117
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1215
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,438
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1216
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,835
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1217
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,918
And in the afternoon,
you started plans to dispose of it.

1218
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,156
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1219
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,317
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1220
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,476
We had a drink and walked out together.

1221
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,391
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1222
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,594
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1223
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,429
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1224
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,836
Anyway, it irritated me,
so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,

1225
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,316
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,
but it was just an act!

1226
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,433
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit? 80,000!

1227
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,917
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but...

1228
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,272
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1229
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,188
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1230
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,675
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1231
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:52,193
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1232
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,995
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1233
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:01,708
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1234
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,354
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1235
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,792
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1236
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,354
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1237
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:15,393
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.

1238
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,318
And the fact, Mr Vole,
is that we've only your word for it.

1239
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,238
That you left Mrs French's house
at the time you say,

1240
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,956
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1241
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,117
Somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house!

1242
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,438
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1243
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,711
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands.

1244
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,718
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1245
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,796
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1246
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,718
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

1247
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,956
You came home at ten past ten!

1248
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,278
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1249
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,516
You killed Emily French!

1250
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,870
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1251
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,709
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!

1252
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,231
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1253
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,035
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1254
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,310
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1255
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:19,560
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1256
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,515
What?

1257
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,997
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1258
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,999
It'll all be over by the afternoon,
and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1259
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,396
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1260
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,877
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection.

1261
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,833
And there's a lot more packing to be done.

1262
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,390
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1263
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,672
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1264
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:56,110
I watched when Frau Helm
was on the stand. They didn't like her.

1265
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:00,313
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1266
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,557
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1267
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,476
No.

1268
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,273
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1269
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,674
I'm not sure.

1270
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,395
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
<i>Meineid</i> or perjury, she lied.

1271
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:17,355
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1272
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,869
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1273
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,798
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1274
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,310
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1275
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,035
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1276
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,835
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.

1277
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,713
He's entitled to the best that I can do.

1278
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,719
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal
for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1279
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,992
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1280
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,509
<i>(telephone rings)</i>

1281
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,518
- Yes?
- <i>(woman) This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?</i>

1282
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,916
- Well, yes, it is.
- <i>Let me talk to the old geezer</i>.

1283
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:06,238
- Who is this speaking, please?
- <i>Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im</i>.

1284
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,750
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?

1285
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,031
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1286
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,354
<i>Well, really, madam!</i>

1287
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,358
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1288
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,029
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1289
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,310
<i>It's about that German wife</i>.

1290
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,830
<i>I've got the goods on her and it's for sale</i>.

1291
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,314
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1292
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,670
<i>Well, hello, ducky</i>.

1293
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,598
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1294
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:41,429
<i>I'm not just saying</i>.
<i>I've got it in black and white</i>.

1295
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,393
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1296
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,876
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1297
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,276
I'll be here for 30 minutes
because that's when me train leaves.

1298
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,551
If you want the lowdown on
that German bag, get yourself here.

1299
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,114
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1300
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,310
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1301
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,513
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1302
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,317
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1303
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:14,672
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1304
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,157
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1305
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,032
Balderdash.

1306
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:26,393
I'm too old and too sick
to go on a wild-goose chase.

1307
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,273
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1308
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,358
Euston Station, where do you think?

1309
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,831
Now, sir?

1310
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,712
Shortly.

1311
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,079
Cigar!

1312
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,916
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1313
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:47,556
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1314
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,636
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1315
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,840
<i>(train announcement on PA)</i>

1316
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,472
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1317
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,151
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

1318
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,510
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.

1319
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,074
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1320
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,112
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1321
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:35,473
No need for mine. If I did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1322
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,673
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.

1323
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,268
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1324
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,678
You realise that you're duty-bound
to give any evidence that you might have?

1325
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,237
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1326
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,672
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1327
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,430
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1328
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,314
Poor bleeder, he's been took in
by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.

1329
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:09,389
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1330
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,159
Well, I don't expect you...

1331
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,119
Well, as I say, I don't expect you
to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1332
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:23,597
If these letters get the boy off,
it's? 100 for me, right?

1333
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:28,396
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer? 10.

1334
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,796
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1335
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,639
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1336
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,796
If these help prove my client's innocence,

1337
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:40,310
? 20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1338
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,352
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.

1339
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,755
- ? 40.
- All right, blast yer.

1340
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,633
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.

1341
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,716
How do we know
these are from Mrs Vole?

1342
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,992
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1343
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,233
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.

1344
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,749
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1345
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,235
Good heavens, look at this.

1346
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,676
Juicy, ain't they?

1347
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,588
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1348
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,678
What's the difference
so long as she gets what's coming?

1349
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,837
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1350
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,236
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1351
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,635
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1352
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:33,910
Ha!

1353
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,828
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1354
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,715
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1355
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,630
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1356
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,959
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1357
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,278
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1358
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:02,918
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im
away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1359
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,750
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.

1360
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,954
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another? 5 for the letters.

1361
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,232
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1362
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,796
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1363
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,148
Unbelievable.

1364
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,398
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1365
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,431
Miss, um...

1366
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,357
Where is she?

1367
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:44,672
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1368
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,951
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1369
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,036
Good idea.

1370
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,558
<i>(gavel)</i>

1371
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,113
Silence!

1372
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,276
Be upstanding in court.

1373
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,874
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1374
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,036
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer

1375
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,994
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

1376
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,272
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1377
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,711
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1378
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,149
it has the right to be heard last.

1379
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:42,310
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1380
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:46,638
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1381
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:51,276
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1382
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,676
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion.

1383
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,829
- I will briefly summarise these facts...
- <i>(footsteps)</i>

1384
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,555
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1385
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,238
That is, if Sir Wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings.

1386
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,638
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech
for the crown, however, is premature.

1387
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,550
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1388
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,389
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1389
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,637
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1390
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,036
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1391
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,789
I have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent.

1392
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:40,472
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1393
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,909
at page 463.

1394
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,113
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1395
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,516
1942 at page 153.

1396
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,393
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1397
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,433
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1398
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,028
since you appeared for the prosecution.

1399
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,676
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.

1400
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,950
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1401
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,071
Letters, my lord.

1402
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:12,158
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1403
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,836
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1404
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:21,350
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1405
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,075
in the king against Sullivan
was sustained.

1406
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,316
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1407
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:34,797
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1408
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,957
As yours is now, by me.

1409
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,036
<i>(muttering)</i>

1410
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,196
Call Christine Helm.

1411
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,552
Christine Helm.

1412
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,353
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

1413
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:12,070
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1414
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:16,034
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1415
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,309
Yes.

1416
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,912
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1417
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,874
It's a simple question. Do you
or do you not know a man called Max?

1418
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,195
Max? Certainly not.

1419
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,995
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1420
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,509
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.

1421
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:42,239
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1422
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,633
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1423
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,990
I suggest that on October 20

1424
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,317
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1425
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,796
...addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1426
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,833
The letter was but one of a series
written to the same man.

1427
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:02,676
Lies! All lies!

1428
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,759
You seem to have been, well, let us say,
on intimate terms with this man.

1429
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,519
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1430
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:14,919
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1431
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,716
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened."

1432
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,673
"I believe all our difficulties
may be ended."

1433
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,268
I will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies!

1434
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:29,075
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1435
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,395
- It isn't?
- No!

1436
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,796
I write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it.

1437
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,199
Like this?

1438
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,072
<i>(muttering)</i>

1439
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,920
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

1440
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,314
<i>(laughter)</i>

1441
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:53,718
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him
and that's what he is.

1442
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,992
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough
to identify your letter paper.

1443
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:02,830
Now, if you like, I can have an expert
identify your handwriting.

1444
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,757
Damn you!

1445
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,118
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1446
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,356
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1447
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,836
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!

1448
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,313
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1449
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,034
Usher, get the witness a chair.

1450
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:20,116
<i>(Christine sobs)</i>

1451
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:30,030
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1452
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,954
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened."

1453
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,595
"All our difficulties may soon be solved."

1454
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:48,589
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about."

1455
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:54,317
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone."

1456
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:01,316
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder,

1457
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,149
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves,

1458
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,034
and that he even admitted to me
that he'd killed her?"

1459
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:12,470
"Strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him."

1460
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,070
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1461
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,909
because they will take him away forever

1462
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:24,591
and I shall be free and yours,
my beloved."

1463
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:29,350
"I count the hours until
we are together. Christine."

1464
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:36,068
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?

1465
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,868
I now ask you again, Christine Helm,
did you write this letter?

1466
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,117
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.

1467
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:58,199
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1468
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,038
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1469
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:05,314
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1470
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,876
If you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom,

1471
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,470
I strongly advise you
not to add to your crime.

1472
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,195
But, if this letter
has not been written by you,

1473
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,869
then now is the time to state this fact.

1474
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,350
I wrote the letter.

1475
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,630
<i>(muttering)</i>

1476
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:30,514
And that, my lord,
is the case for the defence.

1477
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:41,316
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1478
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,510
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.

1479
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:47,599
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.

1480
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,869
I concede.

1481
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,072
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1482
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,556
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1483
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,956
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1484
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,039
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1485
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:06,277
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1486
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,393
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1487
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,352
Come along.

1488
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,236
Where's my wig?

1489
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,355
The prisoner will stand up.

1490
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,555
Members of the jury,
are you all agreed upon your verdict?

1491
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,234
We are.

1492
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,433
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole,

1493
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,917
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of Emily Jane French?

1494
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,033
Not guilty, m'lord.

1495
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,435
<i>(shouting / gasping)</i>

1496
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,514
Silence!

1497
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,432
Silence!

1498
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,869
Leonard Stephen Vole,
you have been found not guilty

1499
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,391
of the murder
of Emily Jane French on October 14.

1500
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:46,832
You are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court.

1501
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,477
Persons with anything more to do
before the queen's justices

1502
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:02,750
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery

1503
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,635
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1504
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,549
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1505
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,069
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1506
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,476
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1507
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,275
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1508
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,075
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1509
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:36,192
"Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr
when they charged me.

1510
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:41,269
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1511
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,477
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1512
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,636
and the other on a banana peel.

1513
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,832
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?

1514
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,838
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,

1515
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:05,873
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1516
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,558
<i>(commotion)</i>

1517
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:23,391
- <i>(woman)</i> Every word you said was a lie!
- <i>(man)</i> You ought to be locked up! Liar!

1518
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,717
You'd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd, madam.

1519
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,796
Thank you.

1520
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,551
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1521
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,993
Let me finish the last of the cocoa
while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1522
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:45,318
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1523
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:15,073
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1524
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,634
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1525
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,514
I don't mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin.

1526
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:23,870
But I have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons.

1527
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,118
In case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1528
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:30,356
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1529
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:33,950
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,

1530
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:38,232
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1531
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,830
If I were appearing
for the prosecution, it would be.

1532
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,794
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1533
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,912
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1534
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,556
and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1535
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:59,198
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1536
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,878
What are you driving at?

1537
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,833
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1538
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,313
- We?
- Remember?

1539
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,955
When you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife,

1540
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,993
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent? That gave me the idea.

1541
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,633
What idea?

1542
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:20,072
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1543
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,988
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1544
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:28,193
because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.

1545
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,869
So now you know
the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.

1546
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,999
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1547
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,680
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1548
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,193
I suspected something, but not that.

1549
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:54,198
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1550
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,915
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1551
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:00,793
All those blue letters!

1552
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,390
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1553
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,875
There's never been anyone but Leonard.

1554
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,150
My dear, could you not have trusted me,

1555
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,068
worked with me truthfully
and honourably? We would have won.

1556
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,998
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1557
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:19,157
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1558
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:22,431
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

1559
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,915
I knew he was guilty.

1560
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:31,033
That can't be true! No!

1561
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,509
Listen to me, once and for all.

1562
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:37,234
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1563
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:40,670
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1564
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,792
And you saved him? A murderer?

1565
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,956
Again, you don't understand.

1566
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,036
I love him.

1567
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,875
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1568
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,558
Leonard!

1569
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,717
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1570
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,796
Leonard, Leonard.

1571
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:10,039
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1572
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:15,598
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got
out of this alive, let's stay this way.

1573
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,076
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1574
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,317
Who did? You got me off
and I can't be tried again for this.

1575
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:26,831
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1576
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,554
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

1577
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:32,672
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1578
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,793
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1579
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:41,277
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1580
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,233
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1581
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,796
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1582
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,710
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1583
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,389
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be? 5,000 for the defence.

1584
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:01,071
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1585
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,955
Standing in the witness box, having
to face you, saying I never loved you.

1586
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,229
What is it, Leonard?

1587
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,069
The luggage is in the car and we've
only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1588
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:13,668
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1589
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,074
Len!

1590
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,792
Oh, Len!

1591
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,478
Len...

1592
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:23,589
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1593
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:26,109
Leonard, who's this girl?

1594
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,834
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1595
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,712
Tell her, Len.

1596
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,196
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you in the travel bureau?

1597
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,357
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1598
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:41,951
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1599
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,198
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1600
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:51,997
and we're going away on a cruise,
just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1601
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:56,910
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1602
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,634
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

1603
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,593
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany,

1604
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,792
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1605
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,277
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1606
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,153
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.

1607
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:17,671
Don't make it worse
or they'll try you as an accessory.

1608
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,995
And you know what that means.

1609
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,591
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1610
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,120
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1611
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,151
let them try me for...!

1612
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:32,032
Argh!

1613
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,952
<i>(Diana screams)</i>

1614
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,352
<i>(sobs)</i>

1615
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:57,077
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1616
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,389
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1617
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,431
Killed him?

1618
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,710
She executed him.

1619
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,748
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

1620
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:14,352
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1621
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:24,428
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1622
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,189
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1623
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,278
We are not going yet, are we?

1624
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,353
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1625
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,040
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,
and Mayhew too.

1626
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:43,278
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1627
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,152
Sir Wilfrid?

1628
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,840
You've forgotten your brandy.
