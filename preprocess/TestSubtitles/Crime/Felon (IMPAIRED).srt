The DA's sympathetic
to your situation. He is.

He's agreed to reduce

Hold on. What does that mean?

If you plead no contest,

219

he'll reduce the charge
to involuntary manslaughter.

It means you get no more

Hey, uh...

1765
01:37:03,765 --> 01:37:05,666
John went out the way
he wanted.

1766
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:09,070
They never broke him.

1767
01:37:09,138 --> 01:37:10,271
No.

1768
01:37:12,574 --> 01:37:14,341
No, they didn't.

1769
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:16,176
(♪)

1770
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:33,694
JOHN: <i>Usually I'm quoting
someone else's words.</i>

1771
01:37:33,762 --> 01:37:37,048
The least I can do is give you
<i>some John Smith originals.</i>

1772
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:38,967
<i>They won't be poetic.</i>

1773
01:37:39,034 --> 01:37:40,534
<i>But they'll be the truth.</i>

1774
01:37:40,636 --> 01:37:43,738
Close 13!

1775
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:47,108
What's up, come on, man.

1776
01:37:47,176 --> 01:37:49,277
I'm supposed to be in PC
the rest of my fucking term.

1777
01:37:49,344 --> 01:37:51,312
Jackson said...
Jackson's dead.

1778
01:37:55,884 --> 01:37:56,951
You can get up.

1779
01:37:57,019 --> 01:38:00,254
JOHN:
<i>Yes, prison desensitizes you.</i>

1780
01:38:00,406 --> 01:38:02,273
<i>But it also forces you to see</i>

1781
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,575
<i>what's most important.</i>

1782
01:38:04,643 --> 01:38:07,912
<i>Family. And loyalty.</i>

1783
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:11,365
<i>Because a con like you knows
neither exists in this place.</i>

1784
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:21,909
<i>So don't run from who
you've become, felon.</i>

1785
01:38:21,977 --> 01:38:23,144
<i>Embrace it.</i>

1786
01:38:23,211 --> 01:38:24,662
<i>Grow from it.</i>

1787
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:28,182
<i>And you'll never lose sight
of what truly matters.</i>

1788
01:38:29,718 --> 01:38:34,004
<i>That's my final piece
of advice, Wade Porter.</i>

1789
01:38:34,072 --> 01:38:35,723
<i>You protect your
family at all costs.</i>

1790
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,826
<i>Even if you're forced
to kill again.</i>

1791
01:38:38,894 --> 01:38:41,129
<i>Because if I had
to, I'd wipe out</i>

1792
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:43,797
<i>the whole planet
to get mine back.</i>

1793
01:38:52,841 --> 01:38:54,391
<i>So long, friend.</i>

1794
01:39:05,203 --> 01:39:08,139
