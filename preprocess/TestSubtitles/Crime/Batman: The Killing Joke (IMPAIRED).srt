00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,245
Now, you stinking little stain!

488
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,483
I'm going to ask you politely,
one last time.

489
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,846
Where is he?

490
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,850
CARNY OWNER: Ah, there you are.

491
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,762
So, had enough time
to look over the property?

492
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,690
It's what you're looking for?

493
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,208
Well, it's garish, ugly
and smells like piss.

494
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,160
Can't quite make out
whether it's bums or rats, but it's piss.

495
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,369
I'm a connoisseur
when it comes to eau de toilette.

496
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,010
As for the rides,

497
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,166
any innocent little child
getting on one could be maimed or worse.

498
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,209
So you don't like it?

499
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,290
Don't like it?

500
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,006
I'm crazy for it! (CHUCKLES)

501
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,208
Okay, okay, that's great.

502
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,728
So the price, with what you've
mentioned, we can negotiate.

503
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,886
No need to, sure your price is steep,
but as I look around,

504
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,084
all I can see is I'll be making a killing.

505
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,927
And money? Not a problem.

506
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,006
Not anymore.

507
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,728
How'd it go? Did they like your act?

508
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,684
Well, they, uh...

509
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,649
They said they might call me.

510
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,728
I got nervous and blew a punch line.

511
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,761
Oh.

512
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,606
What do you mean, "Oh"?

513
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,882
I didn't mean anything.

514
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,011
Yes, you did, the way you said
"oh" like that.

515
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,850
Jesus, all I said was...

516
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,161
You said, "Oh."

517
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,731
As in, "Oh, so you didn't get the job?"

518
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,325
As in, "Oh, I should've known?"

519
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,767
As in, "Oh, so how are we going
to feed our baby?"

520
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,207
You think I'm not worried about that?

521
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,807
You think it's all a big joke to me?

522
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,401
I have to go up on stage

523
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,006
and nobody laughs.

524
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,889
And you think I don't care.

525
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,691
You think, you think... (CRYING)

526
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,883
Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

527
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,808
I don't mean to take this out on you.

528
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,649
You're suffering enough,
being married to a loser.

529
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,364
- Honey, that's not...
- Yes, it is true.

530
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,689
I can't support you.

531
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,087
Oh, Jeannie.

532
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,051
Shh. It'll be okay.

533
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,567
The baby won't be here
for another three months.

534
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,090
Mrs. Berkis will let us slide on the rent
a little longer, she feels sorry for me.

535
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,330
She hates me.

536
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,929
She comes out in the hallway to scowl
at me every time I take the stairs.

537
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,604
That smell like cat litter and old people.

538
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,042
I've just got to get you out of here
before the baby comes.

539
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,044
All I need is enough money
to get us set up in a decent neighborhood.

540
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,250
For crying out loud, there are girls on
the street who earn that in a weekend

541
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,850
without having to tell a single joke
or blow a punch line.

542
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,604
(LAUGHS)

543
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,447
Come here and stop worrying about us.

544
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,206
I love you, job or no job.

545
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,846
You're good in the sack
and you make me laugh.

546
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,846
CARNY OWNER: Let me tell you something.

547
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,368
You ain't going to regret
buying this place.

548
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,164
It ain't as bad as it looks.

549
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,443
I hope you're wrong about that.

550
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,128
Come on, a little spit and polish,
you'll have yourself one hell of a carnival.

551
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,965
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you are so right,
and thanks to your smooth salesmanship

552
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,125
and your silver tongue,
I'm completely sold.

553
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,645
Let's shake on it.

554
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,882
Sure, sure, it's my privilege.

555
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,611
Yes, yes, it is.

556
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,486
Who are they?

557
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,484
Spit and Polish, my attorneys.

558
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,644
They persuaded your partner
to sign over the deed about an hour ago.

559
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,928
The property's already mine.

560
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,524
I can see that you're happy about that.

561
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,125
Now, I must dash.

562
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,124
There's equipment to rent,
plus workers to hire,

563
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,124
and of course,
I need to secure my main attraction.

564
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,408
Uh, do feel free to stick around.

565
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,721
Your refreshments, Master Bruce.

566
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,809
Well, then, sir, do you need my further
assistance or should I just go away?

567
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,365
That'll be fine.

568
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,126
Trying to figure out
what he intends to do.

569
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,248
It's almost impossible.

570
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,370
Excuse me if I find that comforting, sir.

571
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,846
I don't know him, Alfred.

572
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,330
All these years and I don't know who he is
any more than he knows who I am.

573
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,250
Are you sure of that?

574
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,641
What do you mean?

575
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,167
I mean don't underestimate him.

576
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,601
I don't and neither should he
underestimate me.

577
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,727
You can't save everyone, sir.

578
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,286
He drives me.

579
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,001
How can two people hate so much
without knowing each other?

580
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,647
I hate this. Whenever we jail him, I pray,
"Please, God, just keep him there."

581
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,285
And then when he escapes, it's,

582
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,920
"Please don't let him
do something too awful this time."

583
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,081
I hate it.

584
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,642
Dad, just once, could you leave
your work at the office and relax?

585
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,610
I made you some cocoa.

586
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,605
Thanks, but tonight
I could use something a little stiffer.

587
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,321
You know, I found that
Catwoman scrapbook you couldn't.

588
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,084
It was behind the wardrobe.

589
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,331
You really ought to let me work
out a filing system for you,

590
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,329
something like we use at the library.

591
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,571
GORDON: Mmm-hmm.

592
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,641
Oh, look.

593
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,406
You've got paste squidging out,
don't get it on your pants.

you're fussier than your mother was.

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,561
We're going to work out.

598
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,285
You'll have to entertain her
while I get ready.

599
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,649
(CHUCKLES) Look at this one.
First time they met.

600
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,644
He was just robbing banks then. Remember?

601
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,929
What I remember is you describing
his white face and green hair.

602
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,242
I was just a kid,
scared the hell out of me.

603
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,805
GORDON: I thought you'd be interested.

604
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,203
Yeah, well, I had some
really interesting nightmares.

She thinks she's a coffee table edition,

though I can't say much
for this volume's condition.

613
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,688
I mean there's a hole in the jacket

Refreshing to hear, not by the book.

Speaking of which, this one won't be
walking off the shelf anytime soon.

In fact, the idea
of her walking anywhere seems remote.

Here's to crime.

You see, I have a reason, a good one.

632
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,164
I have to prove myself...

633
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,802
As a husband and a father.

634
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,371

Of course.

637
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,931
Did I ever tell you
I started out as a lab assistant?

638
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,366
Of course, I did, right?

639
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,848
A good job, a real good job,
but my heart wasn't in it.

to make people laugh

Now I'm not feeling good.

644
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,041
That's why I'm here, for one big score!

645
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,248
Hey, can you try and be cool?

646
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,281
Sorry, I usually don't drink at lunchtime.

647
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,681
You're not lying when you say
we'll get away with it?

648
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,644
Nobody will know I was involved?

649
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,286
Not to worry, friend.
We'll take care of you.

650

We need your help getting into that
chemical plant you used to work in

and into the playing card company
next door.

Wait a minute,
I've seen that before in the papers.

656

Smarten up, wise guy.

659
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,370
There ain't no Red Hood.

660
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,047
Just a bunch of guys
like yourself and a mask.

661
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,771
Right, the most valued member of the crew,

662
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
he gets to wear it, no questions asked.

670
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,522
Well, therein lies the beauty.

671
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,684

just like the cops use, huh?

I quit 'cause it creeped me out.

675
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,844
So grim and ugly,
it was getting under my skin.

But you know it
like the back of your hand.

No. No, of course not.

then I can lead a proper life.

804
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,369
You! I swear to you.

805
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,808
When he escapes, it ain't long till he
comes around, recruiting, you know?

806
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,122
But not this time. Nobody's seen him.

807
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,406
(GROANS)

808
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,921
MAN: Yeah?

809
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,889
Step away from the door.

810
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,606
Oh, shit.

811
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,281
(MAN SCREAMS)

812
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,403
(GRUNTING)

813
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,161
(SCREAMS)

814
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,321
You done?

815
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,323
- Yeah, I heard he got out again.
- You heard?

816
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,086
Read.

817
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,490
Calm down, I have no idea where he is

818
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,847
or what in the hell
he's got planned, trust me.

819
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,490
I can't trust you.

820
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,444
No, but believe me.

821
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,450
If I knew anything, I'd tell you, honest.

822
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,051
People in my, uh...

823
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,531
Let's call it "line of work."

824
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,881
Criminals.

825
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,725
Yeah, we may be scared of you.

826
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,810
We're terrified of him.

827
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,647
Order in the court! Order in the court!

828
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,290
I'll have ham on rye.

829
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,930
(ALL GROAN IN DISGUST)

830
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,084
It doesn't have to be good
to be a classic.

831
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,247
So, Commissioner, I need your help.

832
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,890
Is that why I'm here?

833
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,487
That's why you're here right now,
like right now, as in this moment.

834
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,405
Do me a favor and live in it, okay?

835
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,847
Anyway, me and my colleagues,
we couldn't come up with

836
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,321
one sound mind and body between us.

837
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
So, we're counting on yours.

838
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,323
What should be done with someone
who has no regard for the law?

839
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,801
- ALL: Yeah!
- WOMAN: He's right.

840
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,566
Someone who treats people like meat!

841
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,641
A man who has no problem
brutalizing his fellow man to get his way.

842
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,007
- Now, now.
- What would you do to a man

843
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,891
who breaks the laws
you are sworn to uphold?

844
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,169
A monster who ignores
everything you stand for!

845
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,961
Come on, is it that bad?

846
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,170
Yes, it is, and if it were up to me...

847
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,640
Right now, it is.

848
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,924
I'd throw the book at him.

849
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,241
ALL: (CHANTING) Throw the book!

850
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,683
Throw the book!
Throw the book! Throw the book!

851
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,482
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

852
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,046
What are you waiting for?
Throw it! Throw it!

853
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,087
- (ALL CONTINUE CHANTING)
- JOKER: Throw it! Throw it!

854
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,526
Throw the book!

855
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,530
Right on target.

856
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,045
Truth is, Commissioner,

857
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,727
the man on trial here,
you consider your friend.

858
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,962
WOMAN: Nope, which is funny.

859
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,167
Funny?

860
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,926
Yeah, he usually comes
around here, right away.

861
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,525
Like before it's even on the news,

862
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,842
he broke out of the nuthouse again,
he's had a roll.

863
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,010
You'd think the most important
thing for him is to...

864
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,686
What?

865
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,409
- (GIGGLING)
- Have a good time.

866
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,001
So, why do you think
he hasn't been to visit?

867
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,401
I don't know.

868
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,449
Maybe, he found himself another girl.

869
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,489
Hey, somebody wants you.

870
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,288
(WHIMPERING)

871
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,560
Uh-uh-uh. No fair hiding.

872
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,606
(WHIMPERING)

873
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,050
Ugh. Well, I'd see why.

874
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,567
You don't look so good.

875
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,162
Well, I don't blame you, not when that
bowl of cherries some call life,

876
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,170
turned out to be the pits of hell.
(CHUCKLES)

877
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,451
Perhaps, a song might
bring a smile to your face.

878
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,726
(SINGING) When the world is full of care

879
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,486
And every headline screams despair

880
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,090
When all is rape,
starvation, war and life is vile

881
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,810
Then there's a certain thing I do

882
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,804
Which I shall pass along to you

883
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,330
That's always guaranteed to make me smile

884
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,609
Yes!

885
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,242
I go loony

886
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,284
As a light bulb-battered bug

887
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,364
Simply loony

888
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,126
Sometimes foam and chew the rug

889
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,727
Mister, life is swell in a padded cell

890
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,690
It'll chase those blues away

891
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,525
You can trade your gloom for a rubber room

892
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,081
And injections twice a day

893
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,404
Just go loony like an acid casualty

894
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,928
Or a Moonie or a preacher on TV

895
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,523
(LAUGHING)

896
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,120
When the human race wears an anxious face

897
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,769
When the bomb hangs overhead

898
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,605
When your kid turns blue

899
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,411
It won't worry you

900
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,325
You can smile and nod instead

901
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,370
When you're loony

902
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,251
Then you just don't give a fig

903
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,688
Man's so puny

904
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,161
And the universe so big

905
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,890
Barbara? No!

906
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,684
If you hurt inside, get certified

907
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,611
And if life should treat you bad

908
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,211
Barbara! Barbara!

909
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,967
Don't get even, get mad

910
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,361
Barbara!

911
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,886
Yes!

912
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,121
Ah, here they are now.

913
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,281
Holy Christ! That must be
the best ghost train in the business.

914
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,768
I mean, when they went in,
the fellow in the middle

915
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,247
didn't look a day over 17.

916
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,566
(LAUGHING) Well, that's what
a dose of reality will do to you.

917
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,241
It's why I never touch the stuff.

918
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,763
I find it waters down the hallucinations.

919
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,046
So, Commissioner, how's things?

920
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,923
Commissioner? Hello? Anybody home?

921
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,203
Oh. This wasn't supposed to
turn out boring.

922
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,842
Oh, put him away in his cage.

923
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,764
We're about to open for business.

924
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,283
Let's hope our main
attraction gets livelier.

925
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,444
Give him time to reflect upon life

926
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,764
and all its random uncontrollability.

927
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,081
THUG 1:
Hey, quit your daydreaming, friend.

928
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,366
It's showtime.

929
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,003
I was just remembering.

930
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,691
I used to walk along here
to work each morning.

931
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,649
Ah, that's good, real good.

932
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,484
That's just what we need you to do.

933
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,563
THUG 2: Just guide us through
this stinking factory

934
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,882
so we can get to the joint next door.

935
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,169
And stay far away from us
while we do the dirty work.

936
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,121
It's like we're practically giving you
money by cutting you in on this.

937
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,486
Right now?

938
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,165
Will I be able to breathe?

939
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,651
Not if you smoke.

940
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,850
(CHUCKLES) That's a good one.

941
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,686
Maybe, I should be looking into your line
of work instead of you looking into mine.

942
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,770
You got a funny shaped head.

943
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,930
Maybe I should've been a clown
instead of a comedian.

944
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,322
There. You can see, friend?

945
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,127
(ECHOES) Yeah, but everything's red,

946
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,251
stuffy too and it smells.

947
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,851
Ooh, my voice sounds echo-y.

948
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,606
THUG 2: Then shut up and get to work.

949
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,882
RED HOOD: Okay, we go through here
past the filter tanks

950
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,089
and then Monarch Playing Cards
is just beyond the partition.

951
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,047
You know this place looks
even worse in red.

952
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,122
- It looks like...
- GUARD: Hey, you! Freeze!

953
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,601
Come on, come on, get 'em up!

954
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,285
Murph, get some men over to the rear bays.

955
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,408
We're being robbed by the Red Hood Mob.

956
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,121
You asshole!
You said there was no security.

957
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,169
RED HOOD:
They must have altered things since I left.

958
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,721
- (AIR HISSING)
- It's so loud.

959
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,929
For God's sake, run!
This is all screwed up, run!

960
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,401
Man, which way?

961
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,244
I can't see where I'm going.

962
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,289
You useless son of a bitch.

963
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,010

some Wallball this weekend.

1124
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,531
Getting pretty good.

1125
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,167
Maybe another night, Dad,
I got plans tonight.

1126
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,127
I can't help it
if your daughter's so popular.

1127
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,125
I'll talk to you, later.

1128
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,926
(PHONE BEEPS)

1129
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,323
(POWERING UP)

1130
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,931
Right then, back to work.
