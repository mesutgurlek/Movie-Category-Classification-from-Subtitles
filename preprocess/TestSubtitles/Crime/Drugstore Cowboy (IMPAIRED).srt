1
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,719
I was once a shameless,
full-time dope fiend.

2
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,180
Yeah, me, bob,
the sweet mother's son.

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,020
Me and my crew
robbed drugstores.

4
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
I had done them all...
up and down
the pacific northwest...

5
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,300
with the pharmacies
opened or closed.

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,940
Didn't matter
except for technique.

7
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,119
But don't get the idea
it was easy.

8
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,580
It's hard
being a dope fiend,
and it's even harder...

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,479
Running a crew.

10
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,879
Diane was my wife.

11
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,719
I loved her.
Man, and she loved dope.

12
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,599
So we made a good couple.

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,439
Whenever I got out of the joint,
I always ended up with Diane.

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,759
Rick was my sidekick...
my muscle.

15
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,639
He was no novice
to the life of crime.

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,479
His record showed a steady climb
from juvenile offender
to small-time thief.

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,940
He was gonna do
just fine.

18
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,679
Nadine was Rick痴 old lady...

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,660
a counter girl he picked up
during one of our jobs.

20
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,959
She was a piece of work.

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,719
She had no record,
just a smile that caught us all
a little off guard.

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,740
I was the undisputed
leader then.

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,660
I carried the whole
goddamn outfit on my back,

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,060
like it was
my own newborn son.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,900
But I guess deep down,

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,159
I knew we could never win.

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,620
[Siren blaring]
We played a game
you couldn't win...

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,860
[garbled radio chatter]
To the utmost.

29
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,580
Good morning.
I like your hat.
Good morning.

30
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,679
- Do you have wintergreen gum?
- I'm sorry. I don't think
we carry that.

31
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,660
- Hey!

32
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,900
Hey! Come out here!
This lady's having a fit!

33
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,959
Hey!

34
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,940
[Rick]
Come on, she's spazzin'
all over the place!

35
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,340
Come on!

36
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,919
I think she might
swallow her tongue.

37
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,420
Look at that!
She's turning blue!

38
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,679
[Woman coughing]

39
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,599
Excuse me.

40
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,580
- Are you too busy to take
the money for the cough syrup?
- Just a... just a minute.

41
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,279
There is...
just a minute, ma'am.

42
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,100
Wait a minute, man.
She's foaming here.

43
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,220
I need an ambulance.
A woman is having a...
an epileptic seizure.

44
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,620
- So how'd we do?

45
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,620
Aw, so-so.

46
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,300
Are you sure
you're okay?

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,460
...really good.
Hey! Let's go! Come on!

48
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,879
Hurry up!

49
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,279
I told you to walk,
not crawl.

50
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,439
You said walk,
and that's what we did.

51
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,900
Yeah, I said walk,
but I didn't mean
to go window-shopping.

52
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,639
goddamn it, bob.
Why do you got to fix
in the car?

53
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,559
Can't you wait till
we get home,

54
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,060
like everybody else?
Shut up
and watch your driving.

55
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,719
Christ!
Look at this traffic
up here. Shit.

56
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,140
We gotta get home.
Idiot! Move over!

57
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,319
After any kind of drug haul,
everyone in the crew indulged.

58
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,679
I'd laugh to myself as I
pictured blues or dilaudid...

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,620
in such great amounts
that the spoon would
literally be overflowing.

60
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,879
Upon entering my vein,

61
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,279
the drug would
start a warm itch
that would surge along...

62
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,639
until the brain consumed it
in a gentle explosion...

63
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,519
that began in the back
of the neck...

64
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,919
and rose rapidly
until I felt such pleasure,

65
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,300
that the whole world
sympathized and took on
a soft, lofty appeal.

66
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,599
Everything was grand then.

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,580
Your worst enemy,
he wasn't so bad.

68
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,359
The ants in the grass,
they were just,

69
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,759
you know,
doing their thing.

70
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,079
Everything took on the rosy hue
of unlimited success.

71
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,479
You could do no wrong.

72
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,940
And as long as it lasted,
life was beautiful.

73
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,959
[Diane]
Oh, goddamn it!

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,460
Screw you, buddy.
Move over.

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,119
Where'd you get
your goddamn license?

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,140
Shithead!

77
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,839
All right, now everybody
just act cool,

78
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,220
just like we just
got back from church.

79
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,599
Has anybody seen my lighter?

80
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,479
So, I was working
for this guy...

81
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,420
al, al Valdez...

82
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,700
and, um, he had
this great idea.

83
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,679
...and you, like,

84
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,140
just put shit on them
and water.

85
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,380
Only, he always
got loaded.

86
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,719
- Nadine?
- Give me the same as Rick,
I guess.

87
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,599
I don't think so.

88
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,879
Why not?
Nadine, you can't shoot...

89
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,799
no goddamn blue.

90
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,740
Give her half of one, bob.
That'll keep her in the crapper
all afternoon.

91
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,660
Goddamn it.

92
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,020
I was in there, just like you.
I ought to get the same
as everyone else,

93
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,900
even if I can't
shoot it all
right now.

94
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,919
That ain't the way
things work around here,
Nadine.

95
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,839
I mean,
you don't do shit.

96
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,340
It's me that's taking
the big risk.

97
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,479
What about Diane?
She didn't do
anything either.

98
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,879
Really?

99
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,799
That what you think?

100
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,959
Don't give her
a goddamn thing, bob.

101
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,879
Just kick her ass
out in the street
where we found her.

102
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,380
No. No.
Fair is fair.

103
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,119
You want your fourth,
you got it, Nadine.

104
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,479
But I ain't taking on
no apprentices and giving them
a full end of my thing.

105
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,980
You take it,

106
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,860
and get out.

107
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,620
Nadine, just take your
half a blue, shoot it
and go puke a while.

108
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,799
Shh.

109
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,159
All right, everybody.
Just act cool.
Nadine, pick up...

110
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,559
come on!
Pick up the drugs!
Rick, get your gun.

111
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,180
Get in the bedroom
and back me up.

112
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,319
It's David.
It's just David.
David, what do you want?

113
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,679
I just want to see you
for a minute, bob.
Come on, let me in.

114
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,220
You alone?
Hell yes, I知 alone.

115
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,439
Did you think I brought
my rat-faced granny along
to hold my hand?

116
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,460
David, you're an asshole.

117
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,959
What the hell, Pard.
Have you finally gone
completely crazy, man?

118
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,879
What the fuck
do you want?

119
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,239
What are you holding?
I ain't holding
diddly, small-fry.

120
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,159
I was just thinking
about going by
your place...

121
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,039
to see if you had
any speed.
Yeah, well,

122
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,399
I got some speed.
Really?
Cool.

123
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,900
Come on in.
Fucker.

124
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,620
What's up, Rick?

125
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,420
All right.
So you got speed?
What kind of speed you got?

126
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,159
I've got crystal methedrine.
This shit is good, man.

127
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,660
I've been up all night
on the stuff.

128
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,540
Here, man.
Try one on the house.

129
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,679
How much of this shit
you got on you right now?

130
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
I've got ten grams.

131
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,999
All right, let me
talk to Diane.

132
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,879
Why don't you sit back
and watch a little TV?

133
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,900
All right.

134
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,439
Baby?

135
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,900
This kid out here
says he's got speed.

136
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,319
What do you want
that goddamn speed for?

137
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,340
You know how ringy
it makes you?
I know, but listen.

138
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,599
What night is it tonight?
It's Saturday night, right?

139
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,479
Let's get some speed.
We'll fix up.

140
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,500
Then we'll go hit
that big, fat pharmacy.
You know the one.

141
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,900
Right next to
the unemployment office.

142
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,260
Babe, you know how
these things go.
It's like a crap game.

143
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,519
When you're hot,
you shoot everything.
You shoot the works.

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,519
When you're cold,
you lay off a bit.

145
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,799
Right now, I知 so hot,
I知 burning up all over.
All right, buster.

146
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,199
If you're so goddamn hot,

147
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,119
why don't you lay me down
on the bed right now,

148
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,039
and make love to me?
Aw, come on, Diane.

149
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,959
You know what I mean.
[Diane]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

150
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,799
So, you watch, uh,
I spy last night?

151
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,679
No. I watched
outer limits.

152
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,700
I'm hot to steal.

153
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,959
Shit, we could
do that anytime.
Come on.

154
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,420
Besides, we got company.

155
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,639
So, like, Dave,
do you think you could
get me a TV?

156
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,519
Yeah, I could
get you a TV.
Color.

157
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,919
Yeah, but what could you
do for me, man?

158
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,839
How about
some valium, man?

159
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,759
Look like
you could use it.

160
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,159
Ten milligrams,
sixty valiums.
That's cool.

161
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,620
Well, listen...
what?

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,540
Don't tell bob.

163
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,460
I won't tell bob.

164
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,860
Fuck that guy.

165
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,740
Hey, twerp.
We're gonna fix you up now.

166
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,660
Hey, man, you guys
got any blues?

167
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,060
Blues? Me?
Hell, no.

168
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,839
You know how hard
it is to get blues
these days, David.

169
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,439
How about some morphine?
I got some good old
morphine.

170
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,460
What'd you get, man?
Morphine sulfate?

171
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,719
You know, you're crazy, man,
'cause I can't even read
a stop sign...

172
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,039
when I知 on that crap,
my eyes get so far
out of focus.

173
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,359
Besides, I知 not trading
no uptown crank
for no downtown trash.

174
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,860
What can I say, David?
That's all I got.
That's all I can give.

175
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,140
That's bullshit, man.

176
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,319
You guys think I知 dumb.
I'm not as dumb
as you think I am.

177
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,740
Hey, David?
Too bad we couldn't
do business, pal.

178
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,460
All right, man.
Fuck! I'm sorry, okay?

179
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,380
I didn't mean
any of that.
It's all right.

180
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,660
So how many quarter grains
of that morphine are you
gonna give me for this?

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,399
I'll hit you with
nine quarters
per package.

182
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,319
And that just 'cause
I知 feeling good.

183
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,719
And because you're
a real stand-up dude,

184
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,639
I値l take all ten grams
from you.

185
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,479
Ten grams?
All right, that's nine apiece.

186
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,500
Nine times ten is, uh...
it's 75.

187
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,420
Yeah, 75.
It's 75.

188
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,239
That's 90, bob.

189
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,260
Yeah, bob, that's 90.

190
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,159
Hey, bob, how much
do you want for her?

191
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,559
How much of this
for her?
Huh?

192
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,879
How much
of this to you want
for the foxy female?

193
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,279
What do you think I am,
some kind of closet pimp?

194
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,679
I've never heard
of such a violation
of women's rights...

195
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,999
in all my life.

196
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
David, just
out of curiosity,

197
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,799
how many bags of speed
would you give me
for this girl?

198
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,719
I, I don't know...

199
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,599
you little twerp.
You touch me and I値l
knock your block off.

200
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,479
She's mean, man.
All right, all right.

201
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,879
Let's finish this deal.

202
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,759
Pick up your stuff,
David, and go.

203
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,639
We've got some things
to do.
All right. Sorry, Diane.

204
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,039
Here, bob.
Yeah.

205
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,999
All right, man.
All right, thanks.

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,879
See ya.

207
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,900
All right, you guys.
Have a good evening.

208
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,599
Next time you step
in the middle...

209
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
of one of my deals
to help me with my arithmetic,

210
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,879
I値l sell you to the first
one-eyed carnival freak
I can find...

211
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,380
for a pack
of chewing gum.

212
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,180
Look at me, babe.
I'm hysterical.

213
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,020
Sorry, bob.

214
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,460
Just try to remember.

215
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,679
Was it a down collar,
a scoop-neck, or what?

216
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,700
It was a blouse.

217
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,500
I really don't
remember.

218
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,660
oh, please don't hesitate
Diane, have you gone
crazy or something?

219
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,439
Put a little love
in your heart

220
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,359
and the world
Diane,

221
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,340
what the fuck
are you doing?
Will be a better place

222
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,119
what, are you on glue
or something?
Diane, look.

223
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,519
Will be a better place
we ought to be
out working, man.

224
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,439
I know this hospital
up on the coast.
I know it's a virgin.

225
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,319
I know it is.

226
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,260
This place has got
security zero.

227
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,039
I bet they
got coke, man.

228
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,060
All those hospitals,
they always hold
big-time coke.

229
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,359
You're crazy, bob.

230
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,239
Man, we just pulled off
the best score
we make in months,

231
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,119
and off you trot
looking for more.

232
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,220
You don't know
when to take a break.

233
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,540
Come on, bob.

234
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,300
You know me.
I can't stand
to go on forever like this.

235
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,479
Come on.
Just take me in the bedroom,
and just hold me for a while.

236
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,879
What do you want me
to hold you for?
Look, Diane.

237
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,900
We ought to be
out cracking.

238
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,199
I thought you loved me.
Why don't we
just, uh...

239
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,180
you won't fuck me,
and I always have to drive.
Why don't we just...

240
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,439
head up to that hospital
right now.

241
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,279
See if we can't make it
up there before it gets
daylight out.

242
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,679
I mean, babe...

243
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,079
you're just gonna flip out
when you see this one, man.

244
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,100
I mean...

245
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,279
I can just see all those
colored bottles
of pills...

246
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,300
that hospital's
holding for me
right now.

247
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,140
Up against the wall.

248
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,660
Come on,
up against the wall.
Don't give me any shit, man.

249
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,980
Check the other room.
Check the other room.

250
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,239
All right, you two,
turn around.

251
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,119
You know, I just
said the other day,
"it looks like Bobby Hughes...

252
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,039
finally slowed down a little,"
and bang, you knock off
another pharmacy.

253
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,919
- Bullshit, man.
- You gotta expect me
to drop by.

254
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,839
I didn't hit
no drugstore in years.
Bullshit!

255
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,820
Look, man.
You're not gonna
find nothing.

256
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,919
I'm calling my lawyer.
I'm sure he can straighten
this whole thing out.

257
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,319
Look at me.
Do I look like
I知 using?

258
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,820
You piece of shit.

259
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,159
That's real nice, bob.

260
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,559
Looks like you're hooked
to the gills.

261
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,479
You got a warrant?

262
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,839
Yeah, I got a warrant.
I got it pasted on the end
of one of these slugs.

263
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,740
You give me any more shit,
and I値l give you a good,
close look at one of them.

264
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,039
Whoa, heavy, man.

265
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,060
You guys been reading
too much Mickey spillane
or something?

266
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,980
You don't seem
to understand, bobby.

267
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,820
Hey, not those clubs.
Those are my ben hogans,
man.

268
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,180
Why you gotta mess
with the clubs?

269
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,500
So what are you
hitting these days?

270
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,719
- I got my handicap
down around eight.
- Eight? Bullshit.

271
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,639
Where do you play?

272
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,039
Mayfield.
I hit a 75 last time
I was out there.

273
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,959
I don't play those
public courses, greaseball.

274
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,839
Mayfield is for pussies,
and that's why you have
an eight handicap.

275
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,340
How am I supposed to play
if my clubs are all broke?
Come on, man.

276
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,599
Have a heart.

277
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,060
Break two more and then
leave the fuckin' clubs alone.

278
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,799
All right?
Thanks, man.

279
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,679
Diane, you haven't gone
and hid the drugs...

280
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,180
in some stupid place
like the frosted flakes
again, have you?

281
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,020
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,
fuckwad.

282
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,220
Jesus. How old is she?
Is she over 18?

283
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,519
Twenty-two.
You're twenty-two
years old, right?

284
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,439
Twenty-two.
Twenty-two.

285
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,460
It's lucky for you.

286
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,639
Okay, kiddies,
here's how it's coming down.

287
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
You can just tell us
where the drugs are
and save yourself...

288
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,060
a whole lot of trouble.

289
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,279
Or you can sit there
with your mouths shut,

290
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
and we're gonna tear
this place apart,
board by board.

291
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,700
Now, how's it gonna be?

292
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,439
Man, I love cops.

293
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,420
If there were no
hot-shit cops
like gentry around,

294
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,679
the competition
would be so heavy...

295
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,119
there'd be nothing
left to steal.

296
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,380
Right?

297
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,420
All right.

298
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,180
You two take the car.
Get an apartment.
All right, bob.

299
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,479
Get something
over on the west side.

300
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,399
We haven't hit nothing
over there in weeks.

301
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,319
Should be
pretty cool by now.
Okay, bob, I will.

302
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,639
Don't mess it up.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Just relax.

303
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,439
Diane and I are going
over to my mother's house
to get some new threads.

304
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,460
Something nice.

305
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,879
Oh, lord.
Hi, ma.

306
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,799
It's my dope fiend
thief of a son...

307
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,260
and his crazy little
nymphomaniac wife.

308
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,540
Hey, mom.

309
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,260
Please tell me what
I did to deserve this...

310
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,959
never knowing when there's
gonna be a knock on my door
telling me my baby's dead.

311
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,180
Green, with an overdose.

312
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,399
Shot by a mad pharmacist
or run over by a car...

313
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,860
while fleeing
from police pursuit.

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,919
Why me?
Ma, you don't happen
to have those clothes...

315
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,420
I left here last time
I was sent to the joint,
do you?

316
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,340
I threw all that
stuff away years ago.

317
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,260
I thought you were
never gonna get out.
How could you think that?

318
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
He is a thief
and a dope fiend,

319
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,959
and that is more important
to him than I am.

320
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,060
If you say so, ma.

321
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,740
He can go to prison.
He likes it there anyway.
Don't you, Robert?

322
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,940
Why do you hate
bob and I so, mom?

323
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,679
What have we ever done
to make you hate us so?

324
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,079
I don't hate you, Diane.

325
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,999
And I don't hate Robert
either.

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,359
And the good lord
knows that to be the truth.

327
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,759
I truly feel pity
for you both.

328
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,679
You are grown up now,

329
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,479
and yet you still act
as children who want to do
nothing but run and play.

330
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,180
You cannot run and play
all your life, Diane.

331
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,180
Is there anything else
of yours up there?

332
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,479
If there is,
just give it away.
I can always get more.

333
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,980
Oh, to be sure.
You'll just go
steal some more.

334
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,100
[Woman on radio]
Yeah, 61, can you pick up
a fare, southeast locale?

335
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,420
Shut up!

336
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,479
So, this is our
new home.

337
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,500
Yeah, bob.

338
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,239
Why do they call it
Josephine?

339
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,119
I don't know.

340
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,100
The guy that rented it to me
is named dale.

341
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,380
Maybe Josephine
sounds better.

342
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,479
The last time I dropped acid
I decided to make
a self-portrait.

343
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,980
Groovy, isn't it?

344
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,559
Yeah. I can just see
all those bottles
of pills...

345
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,439
that hospital
is holding for me
right now.

346
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,359
...our stereo buy
of the month.

347
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,719
You can choose any of these
great systems for only...
hot dog.

348
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,700
Bob, speaking of dogs,
do you think
that Rick and I...

349
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,100
could get a little pup?

350
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,359
Just a little something
to hold and pet
when you guys are gone?

351
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,719
Make your first payment
45 days...
no.

352
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,119
No. No fuckin' dogs.

353
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,959
Why, bob?
What do you got
against dogs?

354
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,980
Look, no fuckin' dogs,
and that's final!

355
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,239
Why don't you tell them
what happened to the last one
we had, bob?

356
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
Diane, if you want them
to know so much,

357
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,079
why don't you
tell them?

358
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,479
I don't want
to discuss it.

359
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,399
We had a dog once.

360
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,420
His name was panda.

361
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,639
Cutest little pup
you ever did see.

362
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,439
That little guy
used to follow bob
wherever he'd go.

363
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,820
Anyway, what happened was,
the police were after us
during a raid...

364
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,100
on a drugstore
in the city.

365
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,999
Little panda got out of the car
and ran away.

366
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,639
We looked everywhere for him,
but there just wasn't
any time.

367
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,100
The heat was on us
and we had to get
out of there.

368
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,820
We thought the little guy
got hit by a car
or something.

369
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,719
But no.
Police had him.

370
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,180
Somehow they knew
he was our dog.

371
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,580
They followed him
all the way home.

372
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,900
He led them to us.

373
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,599
They put us in jail.

374
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,060
And they put
little panda to sleep.

375
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,900
For a brighter coat,

376
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,639
whiter teeth
and a more even disposition,

377
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,039
there should only be
one choice:

378
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,020
Rich gravy, no cereal,
gravy...

379
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,679
Nadine, do you have any idea
what you've done to us...

380
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,140
by just mentioning dogs
in our home?
No. What'd I just do?

381
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,479
You've no idea?
No, I don't, bob.

382
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,460
What'd I do?

383
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,079
You just put a 30-day hex
on us, that's what you did.

384
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,500
Our luck just
flew out the window
for the next 30 days.

385
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,199
We got a calendar,
so we'll know when
this hex ends?

386
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,119
What month is it,
anyway?

387
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,279
Jesus, bob.

388
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,079
You never told us
anything about
not mentioning dogs.

389
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,999
The reason nobody
mentioned dogs, Rick,

390
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,919
is because just to have
mentioned a dog...

391
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,839
would have been a hex
in itself.

392
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,239
All right, well,
now that we're
on the subject,

393
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,159
are there
any other sacred things
we're not supposed to mention...

394
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,079
that are gonna
affect our future?

395
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,519
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, there are,

396
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,500
and we might as well
discuss them right now,

397
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,380
being as we're shut down
for the next 30 days.

398
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,039
Hats, okay?
Hats.

399
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,919
If I ever see a hat
on a bed in this house,

400
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,319
man, like, you'll never
see me again.

401
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,300
I'm gone.
That makes two of us.

402
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,100
- Why a hat?
- Because that's just
the way it is, sweetie.

403
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,279
And there's mirrors.
Never look at the back side
of a mirror.

404
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,159
Because when you do,
it'll affect your future,

405
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,180
because you're looking
at yourself backwards.

406
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,359
No. You're looking
at your inner self.

407
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,340
And you don't recognize it
because you've never
seen it before.

408
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,999
Anyway, you can freeze
into motion your future,

409
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,919
and that can be
either good or bad.

410
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,799
In any case,
we don't want
to take any chances.

411
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,199
But the most
important thing...

412
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,260
is the goddamn hat.

413
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,439
Goddamn hat on the bed
is the king of them all.

414
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,319
Hell, that's worth at least,
what, 15 years bad luck?

415
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,340
Or even death.

416
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,599
And I壇 rather have death,
'cause I couldn't face
no 15-year hex.

417
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,519
Relax, honey.

418
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,439
Let's go lay down
a while.

419
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,359
You've been on the go
for days now.

420
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,340
This 30-days thing
ain't gonna kill us.

421
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,580
Don't let it
get you down, bob.

422
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,380
Sometimes bad luck
can be good luck.

423
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,559
I mean, think of
all the times we had...

424
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,399
had a flat tire
or engine trouble
or something,

425
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,900
and we got to our score late,
thinking it was bad luck,

426
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,700
only to find out
for some reason
it was good luck.

427
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,540
Know what I mean?

428
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,900
Hell, I can't
figure it out.

429
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,519
I just know,
from years
of experience,

430
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,399
the things
to look for...

431
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,340
and the signs and...

432
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,599
you know what it's like?
It's like who's ever
managing such things...

433
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,060
is saying,
"go out there
and get it.

434
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,759
"It's there
for the taking, kid.

435
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,679
"Everything's free
this week.

436
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,660
I'll let you know
when your time's up."

437
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,860
Gotta see the signs.

438
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,180
Hell. All you gotta do
is look for the signs.

439
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,119
Shit.

440
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,519
Sorry, babe.

441
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,660
Sorry about that,
babe.

442
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,500
So what's going on?

443
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,199
Look, why don't we
just go in there?

444
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,220
We plant
some stuff on 'em.
We drag 'em on in.

445
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,519
It works
all the time.

446
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,439
I'll tell you why not.

447
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,319
'Cause I don't want to get
bob Hughes on no bullshit
possession beef.

get him on unless we
catch him cold...

from a score.

450
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,620

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,559
Who is it, bob?
I don't know.

453
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,580
I thought you knew.

454
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,279
- Hi.
- Did I wake you up?

455
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,199
No, no, no.
We were awake.
No.

456
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,180
Weren't we, Rick?
Well, I don't know
what to think.

457
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,839
I saw this
sinister-looking man
with a ladder...

458
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,679
creeping around
outside my bedroom window.

459
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,039
I know that I wouldn't be
able to sleep a wink...

460
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,980
if I thought there was some
crazy sex maniac
running around.

461
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,759
Well, well, well.
Now, you just relax.

462
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,740
We'll go down there
and check it out
immediately.

463
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,039
Oh, thank you very much.
Yeah, we'll
check it out...

464
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,959
as soon
as we can.
Oh, good night.

465
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,879
Good night.

466
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,900
Good night.
Good night.

467
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,780
Good night.
Bye-bye.

468
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,620
What the hell...

469
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,500
is she doing up
at 2:00 in the morning?

470
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,980
It's gentry.

471
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,260
Yeah. I bet he followed us
when we moved.

472
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,140
That son of a bitch.

473
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,719
Yeah.

474
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,140
Well, I guess
we'll have to teach him
a little lesson, huh?

475
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,239
"The reason you can never
get bob Hughes...

476
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,740
"for possession
of narcotics is...

477
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,359
"that he has an arrangement
with the guy that lives
on the north side of him.

478
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,719
They have a line
running between
their houses..."

479
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,119
"...and bob signals the guy
when he wants the stuff.

480
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,039
"The next-door neighbor
puts it on a string,

481
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,959
"and bob pulls over
what he needs
and leaves the rest...

482
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,940
in the other house,
where you can
never find it."

483
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,740
bye, daddy.
bye-bye.

484
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,359
excuse me.
You got a second?
Yeah?

485
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,279
You live here,
right?
Yeah.

486
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,380
I live next door.
I know it's none
of my business...

487
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,220
What do you suppose
he has in that sack?

488
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,039
You think
it might be junk?

489
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,839
One thing I am positive of,
it's not his goddamn lunch.

490
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,759
About 2:00 this morning
I look out my window...

491
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,639
and sure enough,
there the guy is...
a big, ugly son of a bitch.

492
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,559
He's wearing a long,
dark raincoat
and he's standing...

493
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,060
on top of his ladder,
looking in your
upstairs windows.

494
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,799
He's got one hand
underneath his raincoat.

495
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,300
From where I was standing,
I gotta tell ya,
it looked kind of sick.

496
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,599
I'll shoot the son of a bitch.
I'll shoot the son of a bitch
right in the balls.

497
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,620
Now hang on a second,
mister.

498
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,759
You see the way
they talked to each other...

499
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,780
all the gestures
and such?

500
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,079
They've got
something going on.

501
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,940
They ain't just
casual acquaintances.
I can see that.

502
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,780
You know,
for a second there,

503
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,559
it looked like that big guy
was gonna jump on Hughes...

504
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,479
and stomp his guts out.

505
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,500
I would have liked
to seen that.

506
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,740
Okay, I know what
you guys are thinking.

507
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,959
"What's old bob
got me into this time?"
Let me tell you.

508
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,359
This is gonna be something.
You guys are gonna
love this.

509
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,239
Diane, where
you going?

510
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,159
I'm just gonna go
get my cigarettes, bob.

511
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,559
All right. Hurry up.
You're not gonna want
to miss this one.

512
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,580
Rick, where you going?
Just getting
a beer, bob.

513
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,420
All right, don't
come crying to me
when you miss out.

514
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,620
Okay, shh!
Here they come.
There's two of them.

515
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,660
Come here.
Come over here!

516
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,439
They're making their move.

517
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,460
One guy's climbing
up the ladder.

518
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,380
Oh, I hope he gets
pissed off at that man.

519
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,300
Okay.

520
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,079
The neighbor's coming
out of the house.
Holy shit.

521
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,479
He's got a shotgun!

522
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,359
Well, I値l be
a son of a bitch.

523
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,719
Show time!

524
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,740
Whoa!

525
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,620
Holy shit!

526
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,900
Bob, I want to talk to you
about what happened
last night.

527
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,639
Well, we told
the investigating officer
everything we knew.

528
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,559
There's nothing further
to add.

529
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,020
You little punk.
Halamer and trousinski...

530
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,319
know you set them up,
and I can honestly say...

531
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,759
they are anything
but happy about it.

532
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,599
Now, bob, I知 gonna make
a suggestion to you.

533
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,959
Why don't you take
a nice long drive somewhere
far away from here?

534
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,359
Wait a minute, gentry.

535
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,820
I won the goddamn war,
not you.

536
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,559
Who are you
to dictate the terms?

537
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,959
Why don't you go find
some small-town
police department...

538
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,980
where you can step
into sheriff.

539
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,900
Where all you gotta do
is worry about the usual
Saturday night drunks...

540
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,159
and kids fucking around.

541
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,180
So you think you
won the war, huh?

542
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,860
Pick him up.

543
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,479
You're just a junkie
that got one of
my officers shot.

544
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,359
And as soon as
he gets a hold of you,
everybody's gonna forget...

545
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,860
that you ever existed.

546
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,140
Let him go.

547
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,340
Little piece
of shit.

548
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,540
Let me give you
a hand up, bob.

549
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,319
Fuck you, gentry.

550
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,340
Don't forget
your clubs, pal.

551
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,740
Work on your handicap.

552
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,879
Now, don't think that gentry
was running us out of town,

553
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,860
because I could stand
the heat.

554
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,740
No, we were splitting
because things were
going all wrong.

555
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,399
Nadine's hex was
a little more powerful
than I had calculated.

556
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,799
It was time to change
the scenery,

557
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,679
which is what happened
when you went "crossroading."

558
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,559
Diane got the narcotics together
and sent them ahead by bus...

559
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,060
to depots across
the pacific northwest,

560
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,460
so we could rendezvous
with the drugs
as we needed them.

561
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,199
See, we couldn't afford
to be caught with a car
full of narcotics,

562
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,700
So we had a back-up plan
in the form of a hole...

563
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,020
punched through
the floorboard of our car.

564
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,759
When the flashing red lights
became a reality... bingo.

565
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,159
Down the hole
went the stash.

566
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,399
Something the matter,
officer?

567
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,420
Then we'd scramble
to the next rendezvous...

568
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,260
which was hopefully
within eight hours,
before the drugs wore off.

569
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,519
I'll tell you,
no construction stiff
working overtime...

570
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,919
takes more stress and strain
than we did...

571
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,420
just trying to stay high.

572
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,780
The reason we
rented this truck
is not necessarily...

573
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,079
because we needed
another vehicle.

574
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,479
But we can move easier
in a vehicle like this.

575
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,879
It's got the right
license plates on it,
so this way...

576
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,279
the average Joe
will just think we're
a couple farm boys...

577
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,679
and a prostitute,
hitting town
for a little joyride.

578
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,620
Hey!
I always wanted
to be a farmer, bob.

579
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

580
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,180
Did you guys
see that?

581
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,959
What?
The transom.

582
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,940
You guys didn't see
the open transom?

583
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,820
No.
What's a transom, bob?

584
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,580
It's all clear
in the back.

585
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,460
All right,
give me a lift,

586
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,380
then meet me
around back.
Okay.

587
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,740
Ready?
One, two, three.

588
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,039
Nadine, take these
and put it inside the truck.

589
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,540
Rick, step in here a minute.
I want you to look
at these two safes.

590
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,420
You see them over there?

591
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,220
Rick!
Let's go!

592
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,340
Shut up.

593
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,620
Christ.

594
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,060
You're finished, hophead.
You blew it.

595
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,679
Hey, babe.
You playing cards?
Who's winning?

596
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,140
What's the matter with her?
- Nothing.

597
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,540
Cocaine.

598
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,780
Holy shit.
[Jack]
What is it, bob?

599
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,700
What'd you find?

600
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,060
Powdered dilaudid,
that's what.

601
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,900
A whole, untouched,
one-eighth-ounce bottle
of powdered "d."

602
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,199
Whoo!
Hoo-hoo!

603
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,700
Should be another
partially filled one
in here somewhere.

604
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,500
See it?

605
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,279
Rick?
What, bob?

606
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,199
Do you have any idea
what this little bottle
is worth?

607
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,620
- No, bob. What's it worth?
- This here little bottle...

608
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,399
has got 840-some-odd
sixteenths,

609
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,799
and at ten dollars
a sixteenth,

610
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,719
that comes
to around $8,400...

611
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,559
of the best goddamn
pharmaceutical dope
money can buy.

612
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,439
What a find.
This here little bottle...

613
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,799
ought to last
the three of us a week.

614
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,199
I better take that.

615
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,079
Guess we must have
outrun that hex
we had on us, eh, bob?

616
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,439
Sure glad we started
crossroading.
bob?

617
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,359
Let's shoot it.

618
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,860
Be careful with this stuff.
It could kill you.

619
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,700
Diane, get a glass
of water.
Whoo!

620
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,420
[Whispering]
Slow.

621
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,580
Show you how we're gonna
hide this stuff.

622
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,260
Right up here.

623
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,279
Yeah, we'll
take the stuff,

624
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,119
and we'll cross over
a couple of these units,

625
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,620
and stash it over
somebody else's room.

626
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,300
Whoa.

627
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,460
Wow.

628
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,879
[Sniffles]
Hey.

629
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,900
Hey.

630
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,780
Come on, buck up.

631
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,580
So you blew it.
Big deal.

632
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,359
Listen, we're gonna go out
for a couple hours but...

633
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,860
We'll be back
in a little bit.

634
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,599
What did that son of a bitch
say about me?

635
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,999
He didn't say anything
about you.

636
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,399
Yeah, but he's not gonna
take me along anymore,
is he?

637
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,239
Then one day you'll all
just drop me off somewhere,

638
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,159
and you'll never come back.

639
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,439
Nadine,

640
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,319
what are you
talking about?

641
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,239
Come on, honey,
you're with me.

642
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,260
I'm not gonna
leave you anywhere.

643
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,519
- He is a goddamn hog!
- Shut up!

644
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,399
Hog! Hog!
Hey, hey, hey.
Shut up. Shut up.

645
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,319
Come on, honey.
Hog!

646
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,719
Don't do that.
Please, Nadine?

647
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,700
Now, we got a good thing
going here.

648
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,919
Why do you want
to rock the boat?

649
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,799
I just can't stand
his superior ways.

650
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,679
And all that crap
about hexes...

651
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,079
you don't believe
that stuff, do you?

652
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,479
Look, Nadine,
I don't know, okay?

653
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,839
All we have to do
is not talk about pets
in their presence...

654
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,279
and not leave any hats
on any beds.

655
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,679
Now, what's hard
about that?

656
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,559
You know, I知 just going
to prove to all of you...

657
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,580
that a hat on a bed...

658
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,879
doesn't mean anything.

659
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,799
Hey, Rick, let's go.
Come on.

660
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,260
I really wish
you hadn't done that.
Say good-bye, Rick.

661
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,820
You just go on out
with them tonight,

662
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,660
and when you come back
I値l show all of you.

663
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,500
When I come back, I don't want
to see that hat on the bed,
all right, honey?

664
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,679
You know, Nadine,
there's just no talking
to you sometimes.

665
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,660
Fuck.

666
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,119
Dr. Clayton, please come
to nurses' station three.

667
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,980
Dr. Howard...

668
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,199
Hey, Rick.
Rick! Rick!

669
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,079
Don't be too aggressive, man.

670
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,439
We're just trying
to create a diversion, okay?

671
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,980
I don't want anybody
getting hurt.
Okay, bob.

672
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,599
Okay, babe,
you all set?
Yeah.

673
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,620
Okay.

674
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,140
Prepare to die.

675
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,860
Oh, no!

676
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,540
"Demerol"!
Shit.

677
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,700
Ow!

678
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,220
This just isn't
like him.

679
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,140
Bob is like a rabbit...

680
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,919
in and out
and no nonsense.

681
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,380
That goes for a lot more
than a hospital pharmacy.

682
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,119
Dr. Brown, line 237.

683
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,959
Dr. Wendell brown,
line 237, please.

684
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,900
he was asking for you.
Ok, tell him I'll be right there.

685
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,100
Mrs. Wong to admitting.

686
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,500
Mrs. Jane Wong to admitting.

687
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,340
[Woman talking]

688
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,540
Fuck! Fuck!

689
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,639
I don't think
he's gonna come.

690
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,519
Why don't we
go back?

691
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,359
Hmm?
They got him.

692
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,719
Bastards got him.
I know it.

693
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,119
I can feel it
in my heart.

694
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,140
Dirty bastards.

695
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,340
Nadine?

696
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,420
Oh, my god.

697
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,740
Honey?
I'm home.

698
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,420
You're not gonna believe
the shit that happened
to me tonight.

699
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,260
What's going on?

700
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,519
Who put the goddamn hat
on the bed?

701
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,399
She did, bob.

702
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,940
She didn't mean
anything by it.

703
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,900
She bit it.

704
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,620
Where'd she
get the stuff?

705
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,959
She couldn't
have done this
on no two sixteenths.

706
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,940
What's she been doing,
saving it up?

707
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,620
Who gave her this?

708
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,879
What is it?
Damn!

709
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,279
She must have picked it up
off the floor of the truck...

710
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,159
when we were collecting
these bottles.

711
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,439
Conniving little bitch.

712
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,359
Bob?

713
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,799
You can't say that
about her, bob.

714
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,780
She's dead.

715
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,060
You don't say
anything bad about her.

716
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,420
Rick.

717
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,599
She beat you.

718
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,039
Your own woman...

719
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,020
beat you out of your cut
on a score.

720
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,820
She got
what she deserves.

721
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,999
Listen, man,
not only that,

722
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,500
she threw a hex on us
we'll all be lucky
to outrun, huh?

723
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,279
She left us
with an o.d.'d stiff,

724
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,599
which is paramount
to a murder beef
in this state.

725
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,100
For Christ痴 sake,
get this goddamn hat
off the bed!

726
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,180
Cold.

727
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,799
Hell, it's like trying
to raise a couple of kids...

728
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,719
when you take on
a couple like that,

729
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,079
try and teach them
to steal.

730
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,100
Know what I mean,
Diane?

731
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,719
All these kids...

732
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,639
they're all TV babies.

733
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,439
They've been watching people
killing and fucking each other
on the boob tube for so long,

734
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,799
it's all they know.

735
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,719
Hell, they think it's legal.

736
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,180
They think it's
the right thing to do.
I know, hon.

737
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,340
I'm getting real tired.

738
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,700
Poor Nadine.

739
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,980
She was just
a goddamn kid.

740
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,300
Now what?

741
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,919
Hello.
Are you Mr. Hughes?

742
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,279
Yeah.
Are you planning
on checking out today?

743
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,820
No. Why?
Well, you see, sir,

744
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,039
we have prior commitments,
in the form of a reservation...

745
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,959
for your room today.

746
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,500
Today?

747
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,239
You mean,
check out today?
I'm afraid so.

748
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,559
You see, we're having
a sheriffs' convention
in town,

749
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,020
and all these rooms have
been reserved in advance
for them 90 days ago.

750
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,079
Do you think I could
go down to the office
and talk to you in ten minutes?

751
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,060
Give me ten minutes?

752
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,159
We're gonna know
some of those guys,
I'll bet.

753
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,140
I don't believe it.
I don't fuckin'
believe it.

754
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,359
A sheriffs' convention,
no less.

755
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,340
Why couldn't it have been
a tupperware convention?

756
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,180
Better yet,
an undertakers'.

757
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,020
Excuse me.

758
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,940
Hello?

759
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,679
Anything?

760
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,599
I'm sorry, Mr. Hughes.

761
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,580
You should have let us know
you intended on staying
this long.

762
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,759
Look, I致e got a colleague
in that room,

763
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,159
and he's sick
with the mumps.

764
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,519
I'm afraid to move him.
I mean, what if they
should spread?

765
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,439
The doc said
all we need is another day.

766
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,359
He can travel another day.
Oh, come on.

767
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,860
Come on.

768
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,380
This is it, huh?
Yeah.

769
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,119
Nice place, really.
Let's go get
a cup of coffee.

770
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,220
Good.

771
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,540
Guilty! Guilty!
Lock him up. He did it.

772
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,540
Lock him up!
Guilty! Guilty!

773
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,340
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
Guilty! Guilty!

774
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,119
It's gonna be
one heck of a time...

775
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,100
gettin' her out of
that crawl space.

776
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,340
Don't know if I知 ever gonna
get my nails done now.

777
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,580
Nadine really got to you,
didn't she, bob?

778
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,319
Yeah, well,
I値l tell you what's wrong.

779
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,159
I'm afraid some big, fat cop's
gonna come rumbling through
this door any minute...

780
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,140
and say,
"get out of this room.
This is my room."

781
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,780
Diane.
Yeah?

782
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,620
I love you.

783
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,420
I love you too.

784
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,679
Hey, Diane.

785
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,700
Hmm?

786
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,980
We have that blue
garment bag...
the big one.

787
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,540
Diane?

788
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,559
Don't worry, bob.

789
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,479
We'll make it.
Yeah.

790
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,980
We always do,
don't we?

791
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,039
Oh, j.d.!
You jump like an animal.

792
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,879
Honey? Let's go, dear.
We're gonna miss our flight.

793
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,380
Hi.
Boy, you almost
scared me to death.

794
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,660
Wow.

795
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,020
What a busy day.

796
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,639
What do you say
we go up to the attic,
divide the stuff up with Rick,

797
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,039
give him the big end,
don't count him short?

798
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,919
What's going on, bob?

799
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,420
What are you
thinking about?

800
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,220
Nothing.

801
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,479
I don't know.

802
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,500
I'm thinking about, uh,

803
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,719
headin' back home,

804
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,559
gettin' in the 21-day
methadone program,
cleanin' up my hands.

805
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,580
Are you kidding?

806
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,420
No, I知 not.

807
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,780
Diane,

808
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,140
I can't do it anymore.

809
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,879
Well, I知 not goin'
on no withdrawal program.

810
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,759
So what's gonna happen
to me?

811
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,780
Why don't you come with me?

812
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,039
No thanks, buster.

813
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,919
Not a fucking word do you
mention about all this.

814
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,239
Right out of the clear,
blue sky you say you're
gonna clean up your hand.

815
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,780
And you know I can't.

816
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,919
Look, Diane,
do what you want.

817
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,380
Take whatever we got.
I only need enough
to get me home.

818
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,860
Get the shovel.

819
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,260
I'll take care of her.

820
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,180
Go back to the truck.

821
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,700
Go.

822
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,759
For all

823
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,780
we

824
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,580
know

825
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,780
this may only be a dream

826
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,660
we come

827
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,140
and go

828
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,879
like the ripples

829
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,260
on a stream

830
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,100
So love me

831
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,559
- tonight

832
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,839
Tomorrow was made
You're a liar!

833
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,199
For some
Daddy, bring the car!

834
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,079
Tomorrow may

835
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,959
never

836
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:02,279
come
[men shouting]

837
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,780
For all we know

838
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,980
[shouting continues]

839
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,759
Have you ever been on, um,

840
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,159
a maintenance or
a withdrawal program before?

841
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,319
Nah. Nah.
I see.

842
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:35,260
How long have you been
on drugs altogether?

843
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,479
All my life.

844
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,319
Then this isn't your
first time withdrawing.

845
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:48,220
No. It's my first time
withdrawing on methadone.

846
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,479
How old are you now?

847
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,399
Twenty-six.

848
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,420
Are you married?

849
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,959
Uh, yeah.

850
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,879
Where is your wife?

851
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,799
I don't know.

852
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,300
Do you have children?
No.

853
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,559
Um,

854
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,940
do you have a job?
No.

855
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,199
Do you have
a social security number?

856
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,220
No.

857
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,020
Have you ever been convicted
of a felony?

858
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,199
Yeah, a few times.
What were they?

859
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,559
What felonies
were you convicted of?

860
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,060
What do you want?
You want my whole life story?

861
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,279
Look, lady, I'm a junkie.

862
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:43,540
I like drugs.
I like the whole lifestyle,
but it just didn't pay off.

863
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,300
You know, you don't see
my kind of people.

864
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,220
'Cause my kind of people,
they don't...

865
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,519
they don't come down here
and beg dope.

866
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,980
They go out and get it,
and if they miss,
they go to jail.

867
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,279
And they kick alone
with nothing,

868
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,260
in some...
in some holding tank.

869
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,180
I'm sorry, bob.

870
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,279
I don't mean to hassle you.
All this is required.

871
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,740
I'm sorry if you think
it's unnecessary.

872
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,999
Have you ever considered
becoming a counselor...

873
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,359
and helping other addicts
with their problems?

874
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,679
Nah.
Why not?

875
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,039
Well, to begin with,

876
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,439
nobody,
and I mean, nobody...

877
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,799
can talk a junkie
out of usin'.

878
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,079
You can talk to 'em for years,
but sooner or later, they're
gonna get a hold of somethin'.

879
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,439
Maybe it's not dope.
Maybe it's booze.

880
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,420
Maybe it's glue.
Maybe it's gasoline.

881
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,300
Maybe it's a gunshot
in the head.

882
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,079
But somethin'...

883
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,479
somethin' to relieve
the pressures of
their everyday life,

884
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,380
like havin' to tie
their shoes.

885
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,799
Hawn.
You've got
some mail here.

886
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,679
Yeah, bless you.

887
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,700
Aw, you're welcome.

888
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,060
Father Murphy.

889
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,380
Hey, tom.

890
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,079
Well, well.

891
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,439
Bad bobby Hughes.

892
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,719
Imagine seeing you here
after all these years.

893
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,740
Yeah.
You live here too?

894
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,439
I have nowhere else to go.

895
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,319
There is no demand
in the priesthood...

896
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,759
for elderly drug addicts.

897
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,999
An indiscretion in 1970...
you were inside, I believe...

898
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,380
resulted in my descent
to this sorry state.

899
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,999
As a matter of fact,
I知 feeling a bit sick
right now.

900
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,020
Are you holding?

901
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,900
Nope.

902
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,740
They got me on, uh,
this 21-day thing.
Methadone.

903
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,079
Yeah.

904
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,540
What about yourself?

905
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,759
Oh, sure,
I知 on the program,

906
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,079
but sometimes I get
a little bit ahead
of my schedule.

907
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,959
You understand?

908
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,900
And sometimes I think
some junkie nurse...

909
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,220
may be stepping
on my medication,

910
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,060
but I can't be sure.

911
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,359
How about it?
You wanna score?

912
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,199
Nah.

913
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,220
But I値l keep you company.

914
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,399
This here is an artwork.

915
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,860
A work of art.
So is that.

916
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,740
More artwork.

917
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,100
Dig the pole
on that tree there.

918
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,980
Yeah,
that reminds me.
Yeah.

919
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,759
I used to know
an old croaker.

920
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,599
I think it was on that street.
Maybe it was the next street
over.
Yeah?

921
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,919
And he'd write like a major.

922
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,759
Tom knew his way around
the old neighborhoods.

923
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,159
I'd known tom since I was
an altar boy.

924
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,479
Benevolent father Murphy,
the most notorious dope fiend
on the coast.

925
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,359
When he was holdin',
he'd always share
with those who weren't.

926
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,279
He was very kind.

927
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,300
Tom was king then.
He had it all.

928
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,559
His ass was covered
in this life and the next.

929
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:00,940
I bet he shot a million bucks
in his arm.

930
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,039
Okay. Now, this is what you
call a radial-arm drill press.

931
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,399
You get the drill you want,
putting it in the holder.

932
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,799
Make sure you've got
a good grip on it.

933
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,300
That brings your drill
down to your work.

934
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,079
Position it over the hole.
That's your clutch.

935
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,999
This is your power feed.

936
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,500
This is the clutch that engages
the power feed.

937
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,380
You put that in,
and just let it drill.

938
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,460
Dorris?

939
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,380
What do you want?

940
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,260
You seen Jim?
I've seen him nowhere!

941
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,759
If you're gonna go to work
loaded, it's gonna show.

942
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,639
Being loaded is like
being drunk, you know.

943
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,039
You take a drink
in the morning, you gotta
get high in the morning.

944
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,959
Your boss is gonna see it,
and you'll get fired.

945
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,879
Then you're not makin'
that big money.

946
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,799
Then you're gonna
have to do somethin' else.

947
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,679
You're gonna have
to rob, steal, sell.

948
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,039
Um, somewhere in that
robbing and stealing,

949
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,919
you might end up killing
your best buddy over a fix.

950
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,399
You're just gonna
go down the tubes.
There's no other way around it.

951
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,279
The more you use,
the longer you use,
the further down you go.

952
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,740
You gotta find
your own bottom.

953
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,399
Yeah.
Not me. I'm tired of it.

954
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,319
I'm tired of being broke.
I'm tired of being sick.

955
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,820
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

956
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,620
Catching up
on your reading?

957
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,340
You didn't stay gone long,
bob.

958
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,319
What happened?
Nothin' happened.

959
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,340
I hear you're on
a methadone program now.

960
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,700
You don't think that's gonna
keep trousinski from
jumpin' your ass, do ya?

961
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,380
To tell you the truth,
I haven't given it
much thought.

962
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,700
You know, for once
I知 not here to hassle you.

963
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,479
You know, trousinski
lost his gold badge over
that little incident.

964
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,399
He's workin' traffic
out at the north end.

965
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,380
He's made so many
goddamn threats, he's almost
gonna have to hurt you.

966
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,900
And I don't wanna
see that happen.

967
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,180
Man, look, what can I say?
I gotta job, you know?

968
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,500
What happened out there
in the sticks, bob?
Where's Diane?

969
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,119
Well, you know how
whimsical women are.

970
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,479
She found some other dude
to chase after,
and off she went,

971
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,500
chasin' after him.

972
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,759
I find that a little hard
to believe.

973
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,180
You and Diane have been
runnin' around together
since you were little kids.

974
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,719
You know,
I hope you make out
on that job of yours.

975
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,140
I sincerely hope
that you straighten up
a little bit.

976
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,420
Take care of yourself,
bob.

977
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,239
You stupid son of a bitch!

978
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,740
Shut up!

979
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,199
My old lady's still out there
right now.

980
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,119
Yeah, forget about her.
Yeah.

981
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,519
I can't do nothin' with her.
I tried. I told her to come.

982
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,919
She didn't want to come.
She's doin' her own thing.

983
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,759
Yeah, shit.
What I was doin', I was
goin' right to the source.

984
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,599
Right to the source.
Where do they make drugs?

985
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,060
In a drugstore.

986
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,940
Yeah, if you want some money,
you go to the bank, huh?
Shit.

987
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,159
"Yeah, honey, I gotta
stop by the bank
and then the drugstore.

988
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,140
I'll be home after a while."

989
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,540
Man, what are
you cryin' for?

990
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,220
You're the one who wants
to do the drugs.

991
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,580
You gotta pay for 'em, man.
Where's my fuckin' money,
bitch?
[Panting]

992
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,279
Punk. Where the fuck
is my money?

993
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,679
Come on.
This is the third time
I had to ask you.

994
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,079
Come on.
What are you gonna say?
Say something.

995
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,060
You want me to hit you?
Say somethin'.
Hey, Dave. Hey, David!

996
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,359
What do you think
you're doin', man? Huh?

997
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,780
What do you think
you're doin'?
This kid's cryin', man.

998
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,079
So? It's business, man.
What do you care?

999
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,580
Why don't you get out of here,
and mind your own business?

1000
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,879
Because it bugs me.

1001
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,799
Hey, take a walk.
Hey, man.

1002
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,159
Come on. Goddamn!

1003
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,079
Why don't you grow up,
man? Huh?

1004
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,999
I am grown-up.

1005
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,919
Asshole! Fuck!

1006
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,319
Why didn't you
do somethin', man?

1007
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,820
What's up with you?
I thought you... fuck.

1008
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,220
Man, I知 not buying you
no lunch.

1009
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,519
You know, tom,
you told me a lot
of the old-time stories...

1010
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,319
about how you used to...

1011
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,679
stick your arm in between
the bars of the cell.

1012
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,039
The guard would come by,
and he'd fire you up
a shot of morphine.

1013
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,959
Well, they never did that
for me.

1014
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,380
Well, they don't do that
for anyone anymore.

1015
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,639
Narcotics have been...

1016
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,479
systematically scapegoated...

1017
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,500
and demonized.

1018
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,599
The idea that anyone can
use drugs and escape
a horrible fate...

1019
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,100
is anathema
to these idiots.

1020
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,319
I predict,
in the near future,

1021
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:55,599
right-wingers will use
drug hysteria...

1022
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,100
as a pretext...

1023
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:03,860
to set up an international
police apparatus.

1024
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,559
But I知 an old man,
and I may not live...

1025
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,980
to see a final solution
of the drug problem.

1026
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,599
You know what, tom?
You might have missed
your calling.

1027
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,100
You should have been
a philosopher.

1028
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,879
Well, bob, in another life,
perhaps.

1029
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,380
In another life.

1030
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,340
Who is it?

1031
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,220
Who is it?

1032
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,700
Hey.

1033
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,799
Jesus! What kind
of a dump is this?

1034
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,780
And where is the female?
You might as well trot her out.

1035
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,079
You don't ever change,
do you, Diane?

1036
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,540
Goddamn right I don't.
Why should I?

1037
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,279
Hey, I was just commenting
on how good you look. Yeah.
Yeah? I'll bet.

1038
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,679
How about a cup of tea?

1039
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,700
Yeah.
Yeah?

1040
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,020
So, how's that methadone
thing workin' out?

1041
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,239
So-so. Hey, I got a job.
Did I tell you that?

1042
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,119
No shit.

1043
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,399
Where are you workin'?

1044
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,279
Oh, just a machine shop
over on western.
Yeah?

1045
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,199
Yeah.
What do you do there?

1046
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,180
I, uh, drill holes.

1047
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,100
"Drill holes"?

1048
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,020
Yeah. I drill...

1049
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,239
I drill these holes
that, uh,
bolts fit into.

1050
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,599
Oh, yeah?
How do you like it?

1051
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,540
Well, I値l tell you the truth.
It's kind of a drag,
but it pays the rent.

1052
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,260
Then you're really serious.
You're gonna go on
with this thing.

1053
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,660
Yeah.

1054
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,980
Hey, Diane, why don't you
take your coat off
and stay a while, huh?

1055
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,820
I can't, bob.
I got people waitin' for me
out in the car.

1056
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,180
I just came up to see
how you was doin'.

1057
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,020
Here.

1058
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,900
That's from Rick
and the rest of us.

1059
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,740
Kind of thought you might need
a taste once in a while.

1060
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,319
What happened?
What made you turn around
that day?

1061
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,239
Was it me?
Did I do somethin' wrong?

1062
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,559
No, baby,
it wasn't you.

1063
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,399
It was Nadine痴 death
and the hex she threw on us
with that hat.

1064
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,900
And then I panicked
when I looked out
into that parking lot...

1065
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,679
and I saw
all those cop cars.

1066
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,599
Hell,
I knew I was dead.

1067
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,479
So, I started coppin' deuces.
I prayed like I never
prayed before.

1068
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,759
I said, "god, sun, devil,
whoever you are up there,
please have pity on me.

1069
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,679
"Please let me get
this poor girl's body...

1070
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,079
"out of this hotel room
and into the ground,

1071
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,519
"so I don't have to spend
the rest of my life in prison.

1072
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,879
"And god,
if you'll do that for me,

1073
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,239
"I'll show you my appreciation
by goin' home,

1074
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,159
"gettin' on
the methadone program,

1075
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,660
gettin' a job
and livin' a virtuous life."

1076
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,460
Well, I got out...

1077
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,820
and I promised,
so here I am.

1078
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,180
Are you gonna
stick with it forever?

1079
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,460
Well...

1080
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,719
you know, Diane,
for all the boredom
the street-life brings,

1081
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,740
it's not that bad.

1082
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,959
I mean, even this crummy
little room ain't so bad.

1083
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,359
I actually wake up
some mornings,
and I feel like...

1084
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,860
somethin' good's
gonna happen today,
you know?

1085
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:06,620
I'm a regular guy.
I got my regular job.
I got my regular room.

1086
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,460
Now I got you.

1087
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,199
Man, you're crazy, bob.

1088
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,660
You're really crazy.

1089
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,719
Diane, why don't you
go downstairs,

1090
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,639
and tell your friends
that you're gonna
spend the night?

1091
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,959
Come back,
bed down with me
for a little while.

1092
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,860
I'd like to, bob,
but I got another
old man now.

1093
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,639
I'm... I'm
Rick痴 old lady now.

1094
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,479
Ain't that a gas?
I work for Rick.

1095
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,319
There we were,
teaching that brat to steal,
and now I知 on his crew.

1096
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,780
Things sure can get
screwed around,
can't they?

1097
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,999
Yeah.
And bob, you know me.

1098
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,940
I might have been
a lot of things,
but I never was a tramp.

1099
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,300
Bob, l gotta go.

1100
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,380
Hey, Diane?

1101
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,079
It's really good
to see ya.

1102
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:56,540
I mean,
you look really good.

1103
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,340
I wish I could
win ya back.

1104
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,900
Hand it to me now!

1105
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,239
Who is it?

1106
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,260
Tom, it's bob.
Open the door.

1107
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,519
Hey.
Bob, come in.

1108
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,399
Hey, what's this?
It's a gift.
I won't be needing it.

1109
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,799
Yeah?
Yeah, I got
my new program down, so...

1110
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,780
a gift. Wow.
Knock yourself out.

1111
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:05,060
Mmm, let's just see
what's in there.

1112
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,340
Mmm. Mmm.

1113
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,700
God bless you, my son.
May you go to heaven.

1114
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,580
Now... oh, yeah.

1115
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,879
This...

1116
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,199
this is for squares.
Never touch this stuff.

1117
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,700
But this...

1118
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,940
one hundred sixteenths
of dilaudid.

1119
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,660
This should earn you
an indulgence.

1120
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,999
Where's it at, bob?

1121
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,460
- Hey, look, what do you want?
- We want your dope, man.
Where's the dope?

1122
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,300
You think if I had dope,
I'd be sittin' in this
flea trap, huh?

1123
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,079
I'm on a methadone program.
You come around me for dope?
That's a laugh.

1124
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,479
Shut up.

1125
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,359
All right, fucker man.
You want it the hard way?

1126
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,239
We're just the guys who are
gonna give it to you.

1127
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,260
Is that you, David?
Huh?

1128
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,519
You listen to me,
you little punk.

1129
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,460
I'm goin' straight, man!
I ain't fuckin' bullshittin'!
I'm goin' straight, man!

1130
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,239
You ought to try it some time.
It's good for the soul.

1131
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:32,079
Fuckin' liar!
Where is it, bob!

1132
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,999
We know this is all
a scam you're playin'.

1133
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,980
So where is it?
Where the fuck is it?

1134
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,199
There's nothing
more life affirming...

1135
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,599
than getting the shit
kicked out of ya.

1136
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,620
I knew it in my heart.

1137
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,500
You can buck the system,
but you can't buck
the dark forces that lie...

1138
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,900
hidden beneath the surface...

1139
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,780
the ones some people call
"superstitions"...

1140
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,660
howling banshees,

1141
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,020
black cats,
hats on beds,

1142
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,319
dogs and the evil eye.

1143
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,239
So, I relaxed and gave in
to the notion...

1144
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:17,559
that for the very first time
in my life, I knew exactly
what was going to happen next.

1145
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,359
Fuck!
Now I知 gonna kill
the son of a bitch!

1146
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,199
I bet you the next bastard
we catch will tell us
where it's at.

1147
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,700
- So he's tough.
- [Grunts]

1148
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,100
They ain't all tough.

1149
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,420
I say kill him.

1150
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,260
Do you hear me, bob?

1151
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,340
Come on. Let's go.

1152
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,039
Hey, great idea!

1153
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,959
Is that really necessary?

1154
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,359
No, but it was fun.

1155
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,279
So get over it.
Come on.

1156
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,300
But a party's a party.

1157
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,679
what's goin' on?
Come on.

1158
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,660
No, sir,
you can't stand here.

1159
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,980
Is he gonna make it?
Let me get him for a second.
Stand back.

1160
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:39,639
Just stay back, please.
Bob, can you hear me?

1161
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,519
Bob,
who did this to ya?

1162
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,460
Was it trousinski?

1163
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,420
All right, bob. Tell me.
Who shot ya?

1164
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,220
The hat.

1165
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,479
"The hat"?
Bob, did you say,
"the hat"?

1166
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:00,759
Tell Diane...
to look out for the hat.
Tell her.

1167
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,679
Okay.
Okay?

1168
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,180
Okay. So the hat shot you,
right, bob?
No.

1169
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,980
The TV baby shot me.

1170
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:13,780
The TV baby shot you,
but the hat was with him.
Bob, who's the hat?

1171
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,220
You gotta tell me
who the hat is,
so I can tell Diane.

1172
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,620
Uh...

1173
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,460
never mind.

1174
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,780
I'll tell her myself.

1175
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,620
We gotta get him
outta here.

1176
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,119
It's this fucking life.

1177
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,999
You never know
what's gonna happen next.

1178
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,500
Roger, 10-4.

1179
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,199
Maybe that's why
Nadine spiked herself
with the easy way out.

1180
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:21,140
And that's why Diane
keeps on goin' like she does.

1181
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,879
See, most people,

1182
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,239
they don't know how
they're gonna feel
from one minute to the next,

1183
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,359
but a dope fiend
has a pretty good idea.

1184
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,380
All you gotta do
is look at the labels
on the little bottles.

1185
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,260
You gotta know how
to read the signs.

1186
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,319
That's what the hat
on the bed was...

1187
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,199
which is why I知 not scared.

1188
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,460
I paid my debt to the hat.

1189
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,159
The irony
was fucking brilliant.

1190
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:59,060
The chicken-shit cops
were giving me an escort to
the fattest pharmacy in town.

1191
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,719
I was still alive.

1192
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,220
I hope
they can keep me alive.
