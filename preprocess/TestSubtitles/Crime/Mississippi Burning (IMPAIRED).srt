00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:33,430
#Precious Lord

3
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:41,021
#Take my hand

4
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:52,366
#Lead me on

5
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:59,122
#Let me stand

6
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:06,129
#I am tired

7
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:13,470
#I am weak

8
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:22,937
#I am worn

9
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:35,366
#Through the storm

10
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:46,503
#Through the night

11
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:57,513
#Lead me on

12
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:03,853
#Through the night

13
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:09,650
#Take my hand

14
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:16,657
#Precious Lord

15
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,582
#And lead

16
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:29,795
#Me home

17
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:36,177
#Take my hand

18
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:47,271
#Precious Lord

19
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:54,904
#And lead

20
00:02:55,362 --> 00:03:03,078
#Me home

21
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:59,912
uh-oh.

22
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:04,875
What is it?

23
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:11,340
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

24
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,845
Just pass me. Pass me.

25
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:25,521
- Is it a cop?
- I can't see.

26
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:31,485
- What the fuck are they playin' at?
- They ain't playin'. You better believe it.

27
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:45,874
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

28
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,549
OK. Hold on, you guys.

29
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:07,396
There's a truck too.

30
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:25,872
Shit. It is a cop.

31
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,834
You better stop.

32
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,297
OK. Sit tight, you guys.
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

33
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,718
All right? We'll be all right. Just relax.

34
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:18,633
Y'all think you can drive
any speed you want around here?

35
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:20,802
You had us scared to death, man.

36
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:25,264
- Don't you call me "man", Jew-boy.
- No, sir. What should I call you?

37
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,019
You don't call me nothin',
nigger-lovin' Jew-boy. You just listen.

38
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:33,231
Yes, sir.

39
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:38,820
Hell, you even startin' to smell
like a nigger, Jew-boy.

40
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:42,740
- Take it easy. We'll be all right.
- Sure you will, nigger-lover.

41
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:47,119
(cop) He's seen your face. That ain't good.
You don't want him seein' your face.

42
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:50,748
Oh, it don't make no difference no more.

43
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:52,083
(click)

44
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:58,756
- Whoa, shit! We into it now, boys.
- (three gunshots)

45
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,134
You only left me a nigger,
but at least I shot me a nigger.

46
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:04,762
(men laugh)

47
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,931
Yes, indeed.

48
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:33,957
Now listen,
you communists and niggers and Jews

49
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,669
Tell all your buddies to spread the news

50
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:40,130
Your Day of Judgment will soon be nigh

51
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:43,133
As the Lord in his wisdom
looks down from on high

52
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,804
Will his battle be lost
by mixin' the races?

53
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:51,183
We want beautiful babies,
not ones with brown faces

54
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:54,061
Never, never, never, I say

55
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:56,271
For the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay

56
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,440
#Never, never, never, I say

57
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:01,735
#Cos the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay

58
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:05,113
These Ku Kluxers are better
with lynchings than with lyrics.

59
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:10,035
Just read the file, Mr Anderson.
I can do without the cabaret.

60
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:13,246
- You don't like me much, do you, boss?
- Sure I like you.

61
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,917
I just don't share your sense of humour.

62
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,503
Sometimes that's all you got left.

63
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:22,714
- How long you been in the Bureau?
- Three years.

64
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:26,760
- Right outta college, huh?
- No. From the Justice Department.

65
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:30,180
Kennedy boy. Now I see.

66
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,100
No. I don't think you do see.

67
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:36,728
Let's get this thing straight.

68
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,315
I haven't had a pimple in years.
I shave every morning.

69
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:44,611
I even go to the bathroom by myself.
So you can quit this "boss" stuff.

70
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:48,740
I'm in charge because
I've been through this before.

71
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:53,828
- Birmingham? Montgomery?
- Oxford. I was with Meredith at Old Miss.

72
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:57,874
Oh. You got hit in the head with a brick,
so they gave you a promotion.

73
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:00,085
No. Shot in the shoulder.

74
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:07,342
- Well, at least you lived. That's important.
- Meredith lived. That's what's important.

75
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,519
What's got four eyes and can't see?

76
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:21,314
- What?
- Mississippi.

77
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,777
#Never, never, never, I say

78
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,113
#Cos the Ku Klux Klan is here to...
(laughs)

79
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,940
- Big building for a small town.
- Yeah.

80
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,905
Howdy.

81
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,231
Good morning. My name's Alan Ward.

82
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,401
I'm with the FBl.

83
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,529
Federal Bureau of lntegration?

84
00:11:55,991 --> 00:12:01,288
- In that get-up, you ain't undercover.
- We're here to see Sheriff Stuckey.

85
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:04,124
Sheriff's right busy now.

86
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,629
You'll have to wait
or come back some other time.

87
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,966
We'll wait.

88
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,145
(sighs)

89
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,231
Listen to me,
you backwoods shit-ass, you.

90
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:33,361
You got two seconds to get the sheriff out
here or I'll kick the goddamn door in. OK?

91
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:36,531
(door opens)

92
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,202
Well, hell.
Looks like we got some company.

93
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,537
Some Hoover boys come down to visit.

94
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,706
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

95
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,751
- I'm Sheriff Stuckey.
- Rupert Anderson.

96
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,712
Rupert, we've been expectin' you.

97
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:55,091
- I assume you met my deputy, Mr Pell.
- Sure did.

98
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,470
You down here to help us
solve our nigger problems?

99
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:01,806
No. It's just a missing-person case.

100
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,975
Well, come on.

101
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,687
- You gonna want your boy in on this?
- Sheriff...

102
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:11,941
I'm Special Agent Ward
and I'm in charge of this case.

103
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:16,196
We think it might be a little
more serious than missing persons.

104
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,157
I don't think so, boy.
Know what I think it is?

105
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,411
It's a publicity stunt cooked up
by that Martin Luther King fella.

106
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:26,205
(chuckles) Come on.

107
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:43,097
At around 3pm, Deputy Pell says
he arrested the three boys for speeding.

108
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,976
He held them in jail until 10pm
and then released them.

109
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,105
They drove off. He says he followed them
as far as the county line...

110
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:53,274
..and never saw them again.

111
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,612
Why didn't they make a phone call?

112
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:01,616
- Why should they?
- These boys were trained activists.

113
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,412
They're taught to check in every hour and,
if arrested, the moment they're released.

114
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:12,251
The hotel is near the jail. They could've
phoned from the lobby. It doesn't follow.

115
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,920
- (Anderson) Maybe they had a beer.
- Not these boys.

116
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:19,216
The civil rights office in Rossville started
making calls when they didn't check in.

117
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,637
The sheriff's office here said
they had no idea where the boys were.

118
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,557
First lie.

119
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:31,604
By who?
Sheriff's office or civil rights office?

120
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,898
Who would you believe?

121
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:38,319
Mr Ward, I was a sheriff in a little
Mississippi town just like this.

122
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:41,989
- Yes, I'm aware of that.
- Well, lyin' just don't come into it.

123
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:45,951
We were ten miles from Memphis,
a million miles from the rest of the world.

124
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:51,331
If a sheriff in a town like this says that's
what happened, that's what happened.

125
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:53,500
Let's go eat.

126
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,893
We're full up, honey.
Y'all wanna wait a while?

127
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,937
- Is the wait worth it?
- We're not full for nothin', sugar.

128
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:16,398
Y'all wanna look at a menu
while you wait?

129
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,317
Thank you.

130
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,737
Well, what y'all gonna do? Wait or leave?

131
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,448
We're gonna wait
cos we wanna be near you.

132
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,661
- There are some empty seats down there.
- uh, Mr Ward...

133
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,873
That's coloured down there.
Don't even think about it.

134
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:38,086
- People here are gettin' ready to leave.
- Aren't you hungry, Mr Anderson?

135
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:49,055
Good afternoon. Looks good.

136
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:03,319
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

137
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:05,655
I'm looking for some information.

138
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:12,328
- I ain't got nothin' to say to you, sir.
- Just a few questions.

139
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,669
I ain't got nothin' to say to you, sir.

140
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:44,360
The civil rights boys came to propose
setting up a voter registration clinic.

141
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:47,947
Before the locals got a chance to say yes,
the Klan burned 'em down.

142
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,201
- You give a man a vote but he can't use it.
- Yeah, that's the way it works.

143
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,370
What did their office in Rossville say?

144
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:58,332
That the boys came back here
to apologise to the congregation.

145
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,335
"Sorry you folks didn't get to vote."

146
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,047
"I suppose most of you
never knew you even had one."

147
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:07,633
"Now you got no place to go on Sunday."

148
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:13,639
Apparently, after they came back here,
they talked to some locals down the road.

149
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:18,019
- I think that's where we should start.
- Oh, they won't talk to you.

150
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,398
These people have to live here
long after we're gone.

151
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,317
They'd rather bite their tongue off
than talk to us.

152
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,528
Bureau procedure, Mr Anderson.

153
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:38,956
(Ward) The church caught fire
and you ran home. Is that correct?

154
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,041
Yes, sir.

155
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,752
And then the four white men
stopped you?

156
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,296
Yes, sir.

157
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:48,924
And these four white men
attacked your husband?

158
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,343
Yes, sir.

159
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,929
But you can't identify them.

160
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,933
No, sir.

161
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:00,644
Did you report this to the police?

162
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,230
No, sir.

163
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:06,066
But you told the civil rights boys
what happened?

164
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,569
Yes, sir.

165
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:12,281
Ma'am, did they tell you
where they were going after that?

166
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:19,246
- No, sir.
- Nothing?

167
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,415
No, sir.

168
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,752
All right. Thank you, ma'am.

169
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,838
You're welcome.

170
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:38,390
(pounding on door)

171
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,270
- Come on, boy.
- Open up.

172
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,899
- Your brother Hollis here, Fennis?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:50,443
Well, wake his ass up. We wanna see him.

174
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:52,487
- Why?
- Just wake him up, boy.

175
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:55,198
- What is it?
- There you are, nigger trash!

176
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,828
Come here, boy!

177
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,246
Hollis! Hollis!

178
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:05,250
Get your ass back here,
you fuckin' nigger!

179
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,210
Hollis! Hollis!

180
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,812
We better not catch you talkin' to the FBl.

181
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,356
Or you'll be dead, boy. Real dead.

182
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,211
You admire these kids, don't you?

183
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:52,797
Don't you?

184
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,966
I think they're bein' used.

185
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,470
They're sent here in their
Volkswagens and sneakers...

186
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:01,639
..just to get their heads cracked open.

187
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:05,518
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
they believed in what they were doing?

188
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:09,605
- Did it occur to them they'd end up dead?
- Maybe.

189
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:13,276
In Washington they sure as hell knew,
didn't they?

190
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,070
Some things are worth dying for.

191
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:21,492
Well, down here
they see things a little differently.

192
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:26,622
People down here feel
some things are worth killin' for.

193
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,170
Where does it come from, all this hatred?

194
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,926
You know, when I was a little boy,...

195
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:43,264
..there was an old Negro farmer lived
down the road from us, name of Monroe.

196
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:48,561
And he was... Well, I guess he was just
a little luckier than my daddy was.

197
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:55,359
He bought himself a mule.

198
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:00,072
That was a big deal around that town.

199
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:02,908
My daddy hated that mule.

200
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:08,497
His friends kidded him that they saw
Monroe ploughin' with his new mule...

201
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,252
..and Monroe was gonna rent
another field now that he had a mule.

202
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,048
One morning that mule
just showed up dead.

203
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:22,886
They poisoned the water.

204
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,976
After that there was never any mention
about that mule around my daddy.

205
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:37,109
One time we were drivin' past
Monroe's place and we saw it was empty.

206
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:41,405
He'd just packed up and left, I guess.
Gone up North or somethin'.

207
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,451
I looked over at my daddy's face...

208
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:50,997
..and I knew he'd done it.

209
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:53,041
And he saw that I knew.

210
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:55,210
He was ashamed.

211
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,380
I guess he was ashamed.

212
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,510
He looked at me and he said...

213
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:07,722
.."If you ain't better than a nigger,
son, who are you better than?"

214
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,935
Do you think that's an excuse?

215
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:15,730
No, it's not an excuse.
It's just a story about my daddy.

216
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:22,987
Where does that leave you?

217
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:25,156
With an old man who was so full of hate...

218
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,911
..that he didn't know that
bein' poor was what was killin' him.

219
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:40,463
Get the light! Get the light!

220
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,801
You all right?

221
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:57,188
I guess they know we're here.

222
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:05,988
(car engine starts)

223
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,788
(car drives offat speed)

224
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,893
Now you know what you're gettin' into.

225
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:39,063
I'm gonna call Washington.
I need more agents.

226
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:42,900
Would it change your mind if I say
that's exactly the wrong thing to do?

227
00:23:42,983 --> 00:23:44,360
No.

228
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:37,204
The whole place for 75 a month.
It's private. It's central. It's perfect.

229
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,499
There's room for a hundred more agents.

230
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:43,460
Two hundred, maybe.
More in the balcony.

231
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:46,713
We're just trying to find the three boys,
Mr Anderson.

232
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:49,174
I'll take all the help I can get.

233
00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:53,428
When's the show start?

234
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,860
- Who's the big shot?
- It's the Klan.

235
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,490
No pointy hats but plenty of pointy heads.

236
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,701
Let me run a check on the plates.

237
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,817
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

238
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:35,321
Anderson.
Say hello to our mayor, Mr Tilman here.

239
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,616
- How do you do, Anderson?
- Mr Mayor. Mr Barber.

240
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:45,164
Well, this looks like the place to be.
Even for me.

241
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:50,044
Yep. Nothin' like a barbershop
for jawin' your socks off.

242
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,671
Where you from, Anderson?

243
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:56,217
Thornton, Mississippi, sir.
Just a spit from Tennessee.

244
00:26:56,508 --> 00:27:00,054
Well, then you must know
how we all feel down here.

245
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:03,724
We don't take to outsiders
tellin' us how to live our lives.

246
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,435
And I'm here to tell ya,
our nigras were happy...

247
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:10,397
..till those beatnik college kids
came down here stirrin' things up.

248
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:13,817
Before that, there wasn't
anybody complainin'.

249
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,487
Nobody dared.

250
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:20,449
We got a real peaceful
community down here, Anderson.

251
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:25,245
Course, they're just like any other folks,
I reckon, when you push 'em too far.

252
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:30,209
The way I figure it,
it's like three sticks of old dynamite.

253
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:35,088
You shake it up... and we're gonna
be scrapin' bodies off the street.

254
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:40,469
I'm just here to investigate the missing
three kids, ask some questions.

255
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:42,721
If this all boiled down to gravy,...

256
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:45,974
..there wouldn't be enough
to cover a chicken-fried steak.

257
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:53,148
Them kids you're lookin' for? I'd bet you a
shiny new dime they're in Chicago now...

258
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:58,570
..drinkin' a cold beer and havin' a laugh
about the commotion they stirred up here.

259
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,614
Well, I sure hope so.

260
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:05,285
You can tell your bosses people got
the wrong idea about the South.

261
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:08,413
You know what I'm talkin' about.

262
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:12,083
Everybody runnin' around ragged,
backwards and illiterate,...

263
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:16,046
..eatin' sowbelly and corn pone
three times a day.

264
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:20,342
Simple fact is, Anderson,
we got two cultures down here.

265
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:24,220
White culture and a coloured culture.

266
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:28,725
That's the way it always has been.
That's the way it always will be.

267
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:33,438
- The rest of America don't see it that way.
- The rest of America don't mean jack shit.

268
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:35,857
You in Mississippi now.

269
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:38,568
Oh, that's for sure!

270
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,862
(baseball on radio)

271
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:44,657
- What's the score, Mr Barber?
- St Louis on top, five to nothing.

272
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:47,368
- What inning is it?
- Bottom of the seventh.

273
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:50,955
- You like baseball, Anderson?
- Yeah, I do. You know,...

274
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,629
..it's the only time when a black man
can wave a stick at a white man...

275
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:00,423
..and not start a riot.

276
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,316
Sir.

277
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,861
We checked on the plate, sir.
Clayton Townley.

278
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:25,990
Townley. Grand Wizard of
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

279
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:28,951
That's him. And we have a lead on the car.

280
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:32,788
A Choctaw on the reservation
thinks he knows where it is.

281
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,123
Good.

282
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,766
(woman)
You have an appointment next Tuesday?

283
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,935
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

284
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:24,506
Afternoon, ladies.

285
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,259
- Can I help you?
- Well, yes, you can.

286
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:31,221
I tell you, I just...
I hate the way I look. You know?

287
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:35,017
What do you think? A permanent wave,
maybe? Or a bleach job?

288
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:40,814
- That looks good. Was it done in here?
- No. Jackson.

289
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:46,528
A wig's your only hope, hon. You won't
be able to do much with that cue ball.

290
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:51,950
If you wanna ask us some questions,
this is where you'll hear it all.

291
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:54,161
Yeah, matter of fact, I do.

292
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,665
I was wonderin' who that gentleman was
that just drove in over there.

293
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:03,086
- I know that isn't President Johnson.
- His name's Townley. Clayton Townley.

294
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,923
- Are you one of them FBI gentlemen?
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

295
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:12,179
Well, I think it's a shame if those two kids
are dead. But I sure hope you find 'em.

296
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:16,558
Thank you. Actually, three kids are
missin'. There's a coloured kid also.

297
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:21,396
Do you think your people'd be down here
if it weren't for those two white boys?

298
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,648
- Maybe not, miss.
- Mrs.

299
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:27,110
Pell. Her old man's Ray Stuckey's deputy.

300
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,407
But I'm single.

301
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,845
Move out of the way.

302
00:31:56,431 --> 00:32:00,476
Move over, boy.
We'll take care of this. It's a local problem.

303
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,604
We'll handle this.
We don't need your damn help.

304
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:10,611
It ain't right havin' blood on Main Street.
How'd that look on the TV news?

305
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:14,949
- Get up.
- OK, I got him. I got him.

306
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,830
He's the kid from the diner.

307
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:24,333
Think twice before you talk to
coloured kids with an audience.

308
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:27,879
They're sending a message from
the boss in Tupelo, and you know it.

309
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:30,840
I know it, yes. Clayton Townley,
chief pointy head.

310
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:34,176
Yeah, that's right. How did you know?

311
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,637
Bureau procedure, Mr Ward.
Try it sometime.

312
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,347
We did.

313
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,933
We found the car the kids were driving.

314
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:06,542
(dog barks)

315
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:23,434
Good morning.

316
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:34,194
Good morning.

317
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:58,403
Two beer cans, a Coca-Cola bottle,
a green plastic bottle,...

318
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:04,033
..a badly burned wristwatch stopped
at 12.45, and a set of keys. No bodies.

319
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:08,538
- I want the area searched. Every inch.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:11,332
- It's a big swamp.
- Every inch, Mr Bird.

321
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,964
I guess they never left Mississippi.

322
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:21,884
They're dead. They're dead.

323
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:24,929
Mr Bird?

324
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:28,724
- Yes, sir?
- There's a telephone at the truck stop.

325
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:33,312
Get to it, get on it, and get me
a hundred more men here by morning.

326
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:35,940
- A hundred?
- A hundred.

327
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:39,443
- Bureau people, sir?
- I don't care if it's the army!

328
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:42,780
- I want this entire swamp searched!
- Yes, sir.

329
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,202
Don't do it, Mr Ward.

330
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:52,206
- You'll just start a war.
- It was a war long before we got here.

331
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:41,213
(dog barking)

332
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:53,058
Get the fuck outta here now!

333
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,850
Sir?

334
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:41,439
The sheriff's alibi is solid. He was playing
poker with his wife's brother and cousins.

335
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:45,568
- The whole time?
- For three hours. He lost $1 1 .38.

336
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:51,950
There's something else. We're having
a little trouble with the motel manager.

337
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:56,454
- What kind of trouble?
- He wants us out. We're bad for business.

338
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:58,581
Buy it.

339
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:01,209
- Sorry, sir?
- Buy it!

340
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,170
The motel.

341
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:06,965
- How high can I go?
- Whatever it takes.

342
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:33,199
Today in Jessup County, Mississippi,...

343
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:36,869
..amidst the violence of this week,
the eyes of the nation...

344
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:40,915
..are fixed on the search
for the missing civil rights workers.

345
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:46,170
I think it's all a big hoax. But if they
are in that swamp, then they asked for it.

346
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:52,259
(reporter) Naval reserves have joined FBI
agents in searching for the missing men.

347
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:57,014
I think they planned it. They're sittin' up in
New York laughin' at us Mississippi folks.

348
00:38:57,098 --> 00:39:02,186
- You think it's a hoax?
- A big hoax. They gonna find nothin'.

349
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:06,690
Civil rights leaders are optimistic
as to the young men's whereabouts.

350
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:11,362
But privately there is mounting concern
that they will ever be found alive.

351
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:14,114
They came lookin' for trouble
and found it.

352
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:18,661
This is Marek Barlbobi, Network News,
Jessup County, Mississippi.

353
00:39:20,955 --> 00:39:25,542
Tell you what I think they oughta be doin'.
Lookin' up in Canada for them boys,...

354
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:28,253
..instead of our swamps around here.

355
00:39:28,337 --> 00:39:33,884
I'll tell you somethin' else. I think it's
a stunt dreamed up by NAAC people.

356
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,887
- (reporter) NAAC people?
- NAACP.

357
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:42,059
Know what it stands for? Niggers,
Alligators, Apes, Coons and Possums.

358
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:44,853
Tell you what you got.
You got your NAACP.

359
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:48,732
You got your SNCC. You got your COFO.

360
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:53,362
You know what all that mess is?
B-u-L-L-S-H-l-T.

361
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,531
You got it?

362
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,790
(boy) One day we won't have to say
"Good morning, sir, Mr Sheriff."

363
00:40:04,873 --> 00:40:09,169
Maybe there'll come a time when
we won't have to say "Mr Stuckey".

364
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:13,757
One day there'll come a time when
we'll just say "Stuckey" or "Sheriff".

365
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,387
And one day there'll come a time when
the sheriff won't even be a white man.

366
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:31,608
Hello.

367
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:37,739
I wonder if I could ask you
a few questions.

368
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:42,243
I don't suppose you could tell me
what kind of flower these are, could you?

369
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:45,372
I been seein' 'em
all over the place here and...

370
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:49,250
Never saw such a darn pretty plant.

371
00:40:50,293 --> 00:40:52,170
They're trumpet-pitchers.

372
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:54,255
Trumpet-pitchers?

373
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:57,092
They're beautiful. They really are.

374
00:40:57,342 --> 00:41:00,720
They don't smell so good
but they're pretty.

375
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:07,101
It's nice talkin' to you.

376
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:12,190
Sorry about interruptin' your meeting
but we can't get anybody to talk to us.

377
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,400
They zip up, like my momma used to say.

378
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:19,447
People don't wanna talk to you because
they're afraid it'll get back to the law.

379
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,200
- We are the law.
- Not around here you ain't.

380
00:41:22,992 --> 00:41:29,332
We came to find out what happened to
those boys. They were here to help you.

381
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:34,253
- It ain't coloured folks you should talk to.
- Who should we talk to?

382
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:37,131
Come on, Aaron.

383
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:41,177
You should start with the sheriff's office.

384
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:45,556
- Why aren't you afraid?
- How come you ain't?

385
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,475
Aaron?

386
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:51,187
Aaron, come on, son.

387
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:08,954
Here's the pitch. Swing and a line-drive
base hit. Anotherrun is home.

388
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,920
On to the nextpitch by the ruffled
Bob Gibson. He is upset.

389
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:18,964
Ron Hunt singled to centre.
Hickman passed third...

390
00:42:19,048 --> 00:42:21,217
..and scored the Mets' second run.

391
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,969
Hunt holds on at fiirst,
and the Mets lead two to one.

392
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:26,138
(doorbell)

393
00:42:36,482 --> 00:42:40,736
Good evening, Mrs Pell. I'm Agent Ward.
This is Agent Anderson.

394
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,113
We're with the FBl.

395
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,282
Is your husband home?

396
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:47,868
We'd like to have a word with him.

397
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,621
Y'all come in, then.

398
00:42:57,127 --> 00:43:01,632
It's the FBI gentlemen, Clinton. They
wanna ask you some more questions.

399
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:04,009
You want me to put
your dinner in the oven?

400
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,222
Leave us alone.

401
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,391
Mind if I take a seat?

402
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:18,398
What's so goddamn important
you got to bother me at home?

403
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:23,320
I just wanted to run through once again
your movements on June 21st.

404
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,614
June which?

405
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:27,783
June 21st.

406
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:32,829
Deputy, we both know what day we're
talking about, so let's do this civilised.

407
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:37,375
Then you get back to your ball game
and we can get back to Washington.

408
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:50,430
Please, don't let me interrupt you.

409
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:56,728
It's just when you've heard a question
a dozen times, it gets kinda boring.

410
00:43:57,228 --> 00:43:59,522
Yeah, I guess so.

411
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:09,240
- You don't eat together?
- He works funny hours.

412
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:14,370
- You think that's odd?
- No.

413
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:16,873
No, I work funny hours myself.

414
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:22,879
I eat when I'm hungry.
He eats when he can.

415
00:44:22,962 --> 00:44:26,591
- Can I get you somethin'?
- No, no. Thanks.

416
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:28,635
This is a nice house.

417
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:31,971
- How long have you lived here?
- I was born here.

418
00:44:32,055 --> 00:44:35,725
But my father lost the house
in a poker game a long time ago.

419
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:40,688
We've been payin' rent ever since.

420
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:46,194
It's a wicked game.

421
00:44:48,696 --> 00:44:50,448
Poker.

422
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,576
Wicked.

423
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:55,620
(Ward) Mr Anderson?

424
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:01,125
It's nice talkin' to you. Guess I gotta go.

425
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:08,215
Them pork chops still any good, honey?
Bring me a beer.

426
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:10,593
(Anderson) Good night.

427
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:13,137
Let you get back to your baseball.

428
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,974
They say it's the only game
where a black man can wave a stick...

429
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:19,143
I know. I already heard that one.

430
00:45:25,149 --> 00:45:28,402
Fifty minutes of his alibi
hinges on his wife.

431
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:31,780
- You talked to her. What's she like?
- She's a nice lady.

432
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:35,534
Tell me, Mr Anderson.
How does a woman like that end up with...

433
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:39,496
With shithead in there? You know
what these small towns are like.

434
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:44,001
A girl spends all her time in high school
lookin' for the guy she's gonna marry...

435
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:46,670
..and spends the rest
of her life wonderin' why.

436
00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:49,381
Something's wrong. He's too confident.

437
00:45:49,465 --> 00:45:52,301
- Did you see the wedding photograph?
- No.

438
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:56,305
His three pals, the ushers,
had their thumbs hooked in their belts...

439
00:45:56,388 --> 00:45:59,183
..with their three fingers pointing down.

440
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:01,894
So what is that?
Some sort of Masonic thing?

441
00:46:01,977 --> 00:46:04,897
No! KKK.

442
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,405
(Pell) I know you ain't drunk.

443
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:16,658
- (drunk) I'm not drunk.
- All right. You ain't drunk.

444
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:20,245
I'm just gonna take you
where you can sleep it off.

445
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:22,414
All right. Hold up.

446
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,502
Watch your head.

447
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:26,603
Hi. uh... There was a couple of things
I needed to check with you.

448
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:31,566
- My husband's not here.
- Actually, it was you I wanted to talk to.

449
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:34,569
Me?

450
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,155
OK. You'd better come in, then.

451
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,161
Just take a minute.

452
00:47:43,244 --> 00:47:46,372
My boss, he's kind of a pain.
A college kid.

453
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:50,293
He has to dot all the i's
and cross all the t's.

454
00:47:50,376 --> 00:47:55,882
- What is it you wanted to ask me about?
- It's a time thing we're not so clear about.

455
00:47:55,965 --> 00:47:59,010
Should I put your flowers
in some water while you're here?

456
00:47:59,093 --> 00:48:01,178
Yeah. Actually they're for you.

457
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,807
They're beautiful.

458
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,018
They are pretty, aren't they?

459
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:10,021
They don't smell so nice
but they're pretty.

460
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:13,024
Can I get you anything? Some tea?

461
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,192
Yeah. Thanks.

462
00:48:30,457 --> 00:48:33,586
Oh, don't you look at that.
It's a terrible photo.

463
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:36,171
Oh, I don't know about that.

464
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:40,509
- Is this recent?
- No. I wish.

465
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:43,220
Well... this here looks recent to me.

466
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:45,889
We were married 14 years ago.

467
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:48,934
Are you kidding me? No! Come on.

468
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:52,563
- You take sugar?
- Sure do.

469
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:58,485
- You know, I grew up in a town like this.
- You were smart enough to leave.

470
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,487
Why didn't you?

471
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,656
"For better or for worse."

472
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,246
How about you? Are you married?

473
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,584
Well, I was, as I remember.

474
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:17,337
It didn't last very long. I was never home.

475
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:24,177
I guess she got fed up with... phone calls
from Miami, postcards from Des Moines.

476
00:49:24,636 --> 00:49:27,472
There was always a guy around.

477
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:31,226
Any guy that could spare the time
for a movie or a beer...

478
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,271
..or a quarter for the jukebox.

479
00:49:36,857 --> 00:49:39,276
She left.

480
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:46,783
- How about you?
- Well, you know the South, Mr Anderson.

481
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:51,913
You leave high school and marry
the first boy who makes you laugh.

482
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:54,416
Hey, your husband's quite a guy.

483
00:49:56,751 --> 00:50:02,215
You know, my boss has this thing
about an hour - 50 minutes, to be exact -

484
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,885
..that your husband says
that he was with you.

485
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:13,059
- And I guess he was.
- Guess he was.

486
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:19,065
Well, that's a pity.

487
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:24,779
That means that I don't have an excuse
for hangin' around here any more.

488
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,074
Well...

489
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,994
Thank you for the iced tea.

490
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:33,580
- Thank you for the flowers.
- Sure.

491
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:38,293
Do you know what kind they are?

492
00:50:39,627 --> 00:50:43,673
- I heard they're called trumpet-pitchers.
- Oh, that's right.

493
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:47,510
My daddy used to call 'em
ladies-from-hell because they're carn...

494
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:49,345
Carnivorous.

495
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:51,431
- That's the word?
- Yeah.

496
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:56,477
That pretty colour's the bait. Insects just
home in there and wham, they're dead,...

497
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:59,355
..even before they got their shoes off.

498
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:05,069
Maybe I should've picked something else.

499
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:07,029
Maybe.

500
00:51:15,496 --> 00:51:22,837
#Sing the wondrous love of Jesus

501
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:30,469
#Sing his mercy and his grace

502
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:39,270

503

504
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,445
(congregation sings)

505
00:51:57,621 --> 00:52:02,918
- ' ..day of rejoicing that will be
- ' That will be

506
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:11,718
#When we all see Jesus

507
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:19,893
#We'll sing and shout the victory

508
00:52:21,311 --> 00:52:25,274
(minister) May the peace and the joy
in the Holy Ghost abide with all of you...

509
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:27,484
..for now and for ever. Amen.

510
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:40,539

511
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:48,922
#When we all

512
00:52:50,924 --> 00:52:56,096

00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:08,817

00:53:16,658 --> 00:53:22,247
#See Jesus, Jesus

517
00:53:22,872 --> 00:53:27,460
#We'll sing and shout

518
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:32,006
#The victory

519
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:41,307
You already been told once, nigger.
We don't wanna have to tell you again.

520
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:45,561
You make any more trouble by flappin'
them boot-lips off to them federal men,...

521
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:50,858
.. we'll sure as hell put you in the ground,
boy, and that's without a pine box!

522
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:54,570
You understand me?

523
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:09,418
(reporter)
How are Negroes treated in Mississippi?

524
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:13,798
They're treated about fair.
About as good as they oughta be.

525
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:24,308
The niggers around here have been
treated awful bad for a long time.

526
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:37,655
I think Martin Luther King's
one of the leaders.

527
00:54:37,738 --> 00:54:40,783
I mean, J Edgar Hoover said
that he was a communist...

528
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:43,494
..and they had proof to that effect.

529
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:48,332
But I don't know that for sure. I hadn't
seen it myself, but that's what they say.

530
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:04,014
Hey, you really wanna find that nigger?

531
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:09,520
They say we've got to eat together and
use the same bathroom as the niggers.

532
00:55:09,603 --> 00:55:12,940
And that's awful hard
for some Mississippi folks to do.

533
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:18,904
They're not like us. They don't take baths.
They stink, they... they're nasty,...

534
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,615
..they're just not like white folks.

535
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:29,957
What do you think has happened
to the three boys?

536
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,125
Dead.

537
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,128
Just as dead as they can be.

538
00:55:35,587 --> 00:55:37,673
It feels so good.

539
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:42,678
- Is she asleep? ls she?
- Yeah.

540
00:55:43,637 --> 00:55:47,140
Oh, my Lord. I'm sorry I woke you up.

541
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:53,522
- Bye, hon. I'll be a couple of hours.
- All right.

542
00:55:53,605 --> 00:55:56,483
Well, Mary, is that your Betsy's kid?

543
00:55:56,566 --> 00:56:00,237
Yeah.
She's growin' up real quick, ain't she?

544
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:12,248
Tuesday'll be just fine on those, Mary.

545
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:19,547
Funny.

546
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:23,718
Their kids are so cute.

547
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:32,519
Is that thing back on me again?

548
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:36,147
If the entire Secret Service
couldn't protect the president,...

549
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:39,567
..how in hell are we supposed
to protect a few nigras?

550
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:45,323
It ain't nothin' but a bunch of lowlife white
trash drinkin' too much cheap alcohol.

551
00:56:45,406 --> 00:56:50,286
More like paint thinner and snake juice,
because this state's as dry as a martini,...

552
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,789
..and we got the alcoholics to prove it.

553
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:57,251
Give me a little room here.
Excuse me, Bob.

554
00:56:59,629 --> 00:57:01,964
- Is this OK?
- Your name, please?

555
00:57:02,048 --> 00:57:04,801
Clayton Townley. Local businessman.

556
00:57:04,884 --> 00:57:09,222
Are you, sir, a spokesman for
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan?

557
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:12,308
I told you. I'm a businessman.

558
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,937
I'm also a Mississippian.
And an American.

559
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,357
And I am sick and tired
of the way many of us Mississippians...

560
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,985
..are havin' our views distorted
by your newspapers and on TV.

561
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:25,154
So let's get this straight.

562
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:29,033
We do not accept Jews
because they reject Christ.

563
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:34,455
Their control of the international banking
cartels are at the root of communism.

564
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:38,042
We do not accept Papists
because they bow to a Roman dictator.

565
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:42,254
We do not accept Turks, Mongols,
Tartars, Orientals nor Negroes...

566
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:45,716
..because we're here to protect
Anglo-Saxon democracy...

567
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,428
- ..and the American way.
- Thank you, sir.

568
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,056
(men laughing)

569
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:55,809
Lefty, you are livin' proof
that cousins shouldn't fuck.

570
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,978
(laughter)

571
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:02,066
What I was tryin' to say...
there's this coloured boy.

572
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:05,778
He wants to play football
for Bear Bryant over at Alabama.

573
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:09,073
So Bear says
"I'm gonna give you a tryout."

574
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,492
What's he gonna run with? A watermelon?

575
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,204
He's gonna keep on runnin' too.

576
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:18,457
"OK, boy" he says.
"You get down there on one goal line."

577
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,462
He puts a whole team on the other goal
line. He throws the boy the ball and says...

578
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:32,596
- Are you open?
- You got to be a member to drink here.

579
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:35,766
A member?

580
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,935
A member of what?

581
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,898
A member of the social club.

582
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:46,610
I thought you'd just buy me a beer.

583
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:49,738
Give him a beer, Frank.

584
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:56,328
Nice to be back in a dry county again.

585
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,372
When I was sheriff,
half of my take-home pay...

586
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:02,709
..was from collectin' taxes
on illegal jukes like this.

587
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,669
Probably works the same here.

588
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:08,715
I would think you'd haul in a tidy penny
here, winkin' at the bootleggers.

589
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,134
I wouldn't know nothin' about that.

590
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:14,554
Yeah... A tidy penny.

591
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:21,269
- Got anything stronger than this, Deputy?
- No. No, we ain't.

592
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,313
Oh?

593
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:28,902
You know, in Thornton, Mississippi,
there's a joy-juice still in every yard.

594
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:33,198
All you need is just some corn
and sugar and a pot to boil it in.

595
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:37,243
I was tryin' to fingerprint
this old boy once.

596
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,954
He'd had his hand
in the mash barrel all his life.

597
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:43,208
There was no skin at all on there.
No prints.

598
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:46,753
We ain't interested in your
good ol' Mississippi boy stories.

599
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:49,088
You ain't from here no more.

600
00:59:50,673 --> 00:59:55,470
- Why'd you leave, anyway?
- I just wanted a change of scenery.

601
00:59:58,222 --> 01:00:01,434
The grits started leavin'
a bad taste in my mouth.

602
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:04,729
Well, if that's how you feel about it,
Mr FBI Man,...

603
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:10,693
..why don't you get back to your commie,
nigger-lovin' bosses up North?

604
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:13,404
You must not know my boss - Mr Hoover.

605
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:17,200
He's not too fond of commies.
He'd be on your side there.

606
01:00:17,283 --> 01:00:21,245
I don't give two shits whose side
your Mr Hoover's on, boy.

607
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:26,542
All I know is we got 5,000 niggers in this
county who ain't registered to vote yet.

608
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:29,462
And, as far as I'm concerned,
they never will.

609
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:35,551
So tell your stiff suits up in Washington,
DC, they ain't gonna change us one bit.

610
01:00:36,135 --> 01:00:40,431
unless it's over my dead body.
Or a lot of dead niggers.

611
01:00:44,393 --> 01:00:47,521
You'd kill, Frank?
ls that what you're sayin'?

612
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:52,109
I wouldn't give it no more thought
than wringin' a cat's neck.

613
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:55,863
And there ain't a court in Mississippi
that'd convict me for it.

614
01:00:55,946 --> 01:00:58,032
How about you, Deputy?

615
01:00:58,115 --> 01:01:02,244
- How are you with wringin' necks, huh?
- Just keep pushin' me, Hoover boy.

616
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:04,705
You get this straight, you cornhole fucker.

617
01:01:04,788 --> 01:01:10,044
Tell your queer-ass bosses they'll never
find them civil rightsters down here.

618
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:14,381
So you might as well pack your bags
and head up North where you belong.

619
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:16,508
(cries out in pain)

620
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:19,011
You get this straight, shitkicker.

621
01:01:19,094 --> 01:01:22,306
Don't you go mistakin' me
for some whole other body.

622
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:25,517
Your brain's in your dick
if you think we'll just fade away.

623
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:28,770
We're gonna be here
till this thing's finished.

624
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:33,025
How about you, Deputy?

625
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,153
Is that gun just for show?

626
01:01:36,236 --> 01:01:39,615
Or do you get to shoot people
once in a while?

627
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:49,624
Thanks for the beer.

628
01:01:55,005 --> 01:02:01,511
Ask them ifthey want to help save this
country from the onslaught ofintegration.

629
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:06,266
You know the system: they want to throw
white children and coloured children...

630
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:09,186
..into the melting pot ofintegration,...

631
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:15,692
..out ofwhich will come a conglomerated,
mulatto, mongrel class ofpeople!

632
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:19,112
Both races will be destroyed
in such a movement.

633
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:24,409
I, for one, under God will die
before I'll yield one inch...

634
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:27,120
..to that kind ofa movement in America.

635
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,583
Do you know the trouble you've caused?

636
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:36,421
They've been on the radio all day,
talkin' about FBI intimidation.

637
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:40,008
We're not thugs, Mr Anderson.
We're gonna do this thing my way.

638
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:44,929
- I know. Bureau procedure.
- Why were you at the beauty parlour?

639
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:48,850
If that was Bureau business, I wanna
know about it. If not, I won't allow it.

640
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:51,436
- Do you understand me?!
- Get in here!

641
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,609
You know your problem? You don't know
when to speak and when to shut up!

642
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:00,278
That makes you a fool!

643
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:03,698
Mrs Pell won't say anything
her husband doesn't want her to.

644
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,867
And I'm not gonna choke it out of her!

645
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,620
This can of worms
only opens from the inside.

646
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:17,503
I know that.

647

- Hey, now!

661
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:51,680
Just passin' by. Just sayin' hello.
You're not out watchin' the parade?

662
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:57,644
How come you don't ask me questions?
Everybody's been talked to 'cept me.

663
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:04,151
Why don't you send some of them
good-lookin' FBI boys to talk to me?

664
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:08,655
Sorry about the intrusion.
I was at the hardware store and...

665
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,616
- Pecan?
- I'm sick of pecans.

(crowd continues shouting)

669
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,617
How'd you find out about this?

670
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,037
Bureau procedure, Mr Ward.

671
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,301
Sheriff Stuckey.

672
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,012
(Anderson) He got his phone call.

673
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,351
Wonder who else was called.

674
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,272
Where you goin', boy?

675
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,858
Go on. Get outta here.

676
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,835
Here they come.

677
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:57,680
- Come on. Let's go.
- We'll wait until they go back inside.

678
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,683
Get him!

679
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,689
Get him into the goddamn truck!

680
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,900
(Ward) Get inside, you sons of bitches.

681
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,113
- Let's go!
- Wait until they go back inside!

682
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:22,037
Come on, Ward. Let's go. Come on!

683
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,665
Go on!

684
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,067
(level-crossing bell)

685
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,824
(train hoots)

686
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:33,525
- Turn left!
- How do you know?

687
01:08:33,608 --> 01:08:36,027
I don't. Just turn left.

688
01:08:39,155 --> 01:08:41,491
There's the truck.

689
01:08:41,574 --> 01:08:43,868
Go up that little road there.

690
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:49,749
Stop, stop.

691
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:12,397
- (groans)
- (truck drives offat speed)

692
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:15,316
(two gunshots)

693
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:26,577
What's wrong with these people?

694
01:09:36,045 --> 01:09:41,300
(Ward) Mrs Walker, I know this is difficult
for you, but I really need your help.

695
01:09:41,384 --> 01:09:45,054
If you could just persuade
your son to press charges,...

696
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:48,641
..then we could pick up
the deputy at least, right away.

697
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:51,185
He won't talk to no one.

698
01:09:51,268 --> 01:09:55,106
- And it won't do no good anyway.
- I promise you, it will.

699
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:57,566
Leave him alone.

700
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,944
Maybe then they'll let us alone.

701
01:10:12,498 --> 01:10:18,671
If this is a pattern, I guess at least
we know what happened on June 21st.

702
01:10:18,754 --> 01:10:22,258
Pell stopped the three boys
for speeding at three o'clock.

703
01:10:22,341 --> 01:10:25,552
He held them in jail until
the Klan could get organised.

704
01:10:25,636 --> 01:10:30,641
Then he released 'em at 10.30. By that
time, his buddies were ready and waiting.

705
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:33,644
No. Pell went with 'em that night.
I'm sure of it.

706
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,229
Do you think he'll crack?

707
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:38,357
Down here they say
rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.

708
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:51,245
(Ward) Did you release
the three civil rights workers...

709
01:10:51,328 --> 01:10:54,998
..into the hands of the Klan
on the night of June 21st?

710
01:10:55,082 --> 01:10:56,208
No.

711
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,336
- Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?
- No.

712
01:10:59,878 --> 01:11:03,590
- Have you ever been a member?
- No.

713
01:11:03,674 --> 01:11:06,760
Are you familiar with
the term Grand Cyclops?

714
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:08,512
I've heard of it.

715
01:11:08,595 --> 01:11:12,432
Were you in fact the Grand Cyclops
of the East Mississippi Klavern...

716
01:11:12,516 --> 01:11:16,019
..of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
for the past three years?

717
01:11:16,103 --> 01:11:20,232
Objection. My client's already told you,
he's not even a member of the Klan.

718
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:25,320
Objection? This is just an interview, sir.
There's really no need to be so formal.

719
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:31,952
Well, if this is just an interview, I guess
I don't have to stay here. I got work to do.

720
01:11:34,037 --> 01:11:38,541
- I guess you do too, don't you?
- Yes, sir. You can be sure that we'll do it.

721
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,252
Good luck.

722
01:11:42,212 --> 01:11:46,966
Y'all get enough to indict me,
you know where to find me.

723
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:50,970
- How'd it go?
- Fine. Just fine.

724
01:11:51,054 --> 01:11:53,598
Don't you worry about a goddamn thing.

725
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:56,684
Are you about to be indicted?

726
01:11:56,768 --> 01:11:59,729
Does the FBI have evidence
against the sheriff's office?

727
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:03,733
- Are you cooperating with them?
- We're cooperatin'. We have all along.

728
01:12:03,817 --> 01:12:05,777
There's not one iota of proof.

729
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,906
Could you not do that, please?
Sir, do not do that, please.

730
01:12:11,241 --> 01:12:14,452
You've already been told once!
Get the fuck outta here!

731
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:16,746
(screaming)

732
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:20,458
Do we have to tell you 2,000 times?
Go back where you belong!

733
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,670
Get outta my face!

734
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:26,881
Get on outta here and leave us alone!
Leave us alone!

735
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,968
Go on home where you belong, boy!
You're gonna get hurt!

736
01:12:33,429 --> 01:12:36,724
Mr Ward, this is gettin' to be
about as much as we can take.

737
01:12:36,808 --> 01:12:39,685
- I cannot register a stronger complaint.
- Not now, sir.

738
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:44,565
Now, just a minute. I resent your
public pursuit of my sheriff's department.

739
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:48,319
You have made every effort to
implicate them in these disappearances.

740
01:12:48,402 --> 01:12:53,240
Your slimy innuendoes are not evidence
that they were connected with any crime.

741
01:12:53,324 --> 01:12:56,202
We're trying to get to the truth.
We're frustrated too.

742
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:59,664
Any jackass can point a finger,
but that ain't evidence.

743
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:03,918
us old cotton-choppers are still
stupid enough to believe in democracy.

744
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:08,631
- We know our rights under the law!
- You know somethin', all right.

745
01:13:08,714 --> 01:13:13,803
- I'd bet a cotton-choppin' dollar on that.
- You're gettin' so far up my nose,...

746
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:16,847
..l'm beginnin' to feel
your boots on my chin.

747
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:19,808
And I'm tellin' you one more time,
Mr Apple Red.

748
01:13:19,892 --> 01:13:24,521
A couple of crazies in bedsheets dancin'
round the countryside scarin' Negroes...

749
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:27,608
..is not the fault of the entire
state of Mississippi!

750
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:33,322
There are three dead kids and a lot of
scared people because of your sheriff.

751
01:13:33,405 --> 01:13:39,161
- So get used to havin' us around.
- Get used to my boots on your chin too.

752
01:13:39,244 --> 01:13:41,330
And you people better back off.

753
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:47,419
Goddamn FBl. Who do they think they are,
comin' to my part of the country...

754
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:50,923
- Do you have a statement, Mr Mayor?
- Goddamn right I have.

755
01:13:51,006 --> 01:13:53,800
For a moment there, Mr Anderson,...

756
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:57,012
..it sounded like we were
both on the same side.

757
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:27,417
- Are you all right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

758
01:14:27,501 --> 01:14:30,754
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks. I will.

759
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:27,393
(vehicle approaches)

760
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:57,006
Momma! Come quick!

761
01:16:13,564 --> 01:16:16,692
There's no sign of him, sir.
He's long gone.

762
01:16:16,776 --> 01:16:20,571
His mother lives across the street.
She won't even answer the door.

763
01:16:20,654 --> 01:16:24,241
I want the whole area covered.
Someone must have seen something.

764
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:26,577
- They won't talk to us.
- Get going, Mr Bird.

765
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,455
If they won't talk to us, shake it out of 'em.

766
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,252
(Bird) Let's go. Every house. Come on.

767
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:44,094
What?

768
01:16:44,178 --> 01:16:49,892
All these white guys chasin' around with
their notebooks will get you nowhere.

769
01:16:49,975 --> 01:16:52,686
OK. What would you do?

770
01:16:57,941 --> 01:17:00,444
It's OK to be afraid.

771
01:17:08,243 --> 01:17:12,414
Go on, Willie. Tell 'em what you saw.

772
01:17:18,628 --> 01:17:20,714
(Ward whistles)

773
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:49,117
(judge) The defendants will rise.

774
01:17:51,995 --> 01:17:55,123
In this country a man's home is his castle.

775
01:17:56,416 --> 01:18:00,962
That is one of the principles
by which this community survives.

776
01:18:01,046 --> 01:18:04,174
You men have done violence
to that principle.

777
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:07,343
But I want you to know
that the court understands...

778
01:18:07,427 --> 01:18:11,931
..that the crimes you have committed
have been, to some extent at least,...

779
01:18:12,015 --> 01:18:15,810
..brought about by... outside influences.

780
01:18:15,894 --> 01:18:17,979
(murmuring)

781
01:18:24,694 --> 01:18:27,822
Outsiders have come
into Jessup County...

782
01:18:27,905 --> 01:18:32,243
..and they've been
people of low morality,...

783
01:18:32,327 --> 01:18:34,912
..and unhygienic.

784
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:38,583
And their presence here
has provoked a lot of people.

785
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,710
(murmuring)

786
01:18:41,294 --> 01:18:43,463
So the court understands,...

787
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:47,216
..without condoning them, mind you,...

788
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,428
..that the crimes to which
you men have pled guilty...

789
01:18:50,511 --> 01:18:56,017
..were, to some extent at least,
provoked by these outside influences.

790
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:02,940
So, with all this,
I'm gonna make your punishment light.

791
01:19:03,941 --> 01:19:08,529
I'm gonna sentence you each
to five years' imprisonment.

792
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,160
But I'm gonna suspend these sentences.

793
01:19:14,243 --> 01:19:16,328
(cheering)

794
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:51,405
You can't go in there, sir.

795
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:53,574
FBl. Let us through.

796
01:19:53,657 --> 01:19:56,076
I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there.

797
01:20:01,498 --> 01:20:03,584
Sheriff?

798
01:20:06,795 --> 01:20:09,214
Y'all really started somethin' this time.

799
01:20:09,298 --> 01:20:11,842
Move these cars.
I wanna go in and talk to them.

800
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:15,387
- You've gone as far as you're gonna go.
- We can handle this.

801
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:18,390
Just some crazy coloureds
tearin' up their own assholes.

802
01:20:18,473 --> 01:20:20,559
Local problem.

803
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:40,954
Look at those flames, Mr Ward. That's
why they sent you down here, wasn't it?

804
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,000
It would've happened anyway
and you know it.

805
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:49,796
If I was a Negro,
I'd probably think the same way they do.

806
01:20:50,255 --> 01:20:54,426
If you were a Negro,
nobody'd give a damn what you thought.

807
01:21:01,683 --> 01:21:03,768
(neighing)

808
01:21:51,357 --> 01:21:55,945
Aaron! Take your momma, grandmomma
and the children out the back door.

809
01:21:56,028 --> 01:22:00,408
When you hit the road, keep goin'.
You understand? Keep goin', son.

810
01:22:02,034 --> 01:22:04,412
Nathan! Come on, Nathan. Get up!

811
01:22:04,495 --> 01:22:07,623
Get up, Nathan, now! Come on!
Get out of the bed!

812
01:22:07,707 --> 01:22:12,211
- (Nathan) What's happening?
- Momma! Come on, Momma.

813
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,966
Come on, y'all.

814
01:22:17,758 --> 01:22:20,511
Come on, Grandma. Let's go!

815
01:22:20,594 --> 01:22:23,723
(' "Try Jesus" by Vesta Williams)

#All ye who labour

817
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:41,699
Who's there? If you're in there,
come on out! You hear?

818
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,702
I ain't takin' this shit no more!

Everything's OK, Papa.

826
01:23:52,018 --> 01:23:54,104
Momma and the girls are fine.

827
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:57,691
They just cracked your head some.
You just keep on breathin'.

828
01:23:57,774 --> 01:23:59,943
Don't you go dyin' on me now.

829
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:02,237
You hear me?

830
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:05,490
You gonna be just fine.

831
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:37,522
You know, cows won't run away. No one
knows why. They're just stupid, I guess.

832
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:43,236
They just stand there until
their bellies swell up and they pop.

833
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:46,114
They have relatives in Detroit.

834
01:24:46,906 --> 01:24:50,451
- Are they gonna go?
- I didn't give 'em any choice.

835
01:24:51,994 --> 01:24:55,123
(Anderson) At least we know who did this.

836
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:58,042
- We did.
- Well, don't fret. It's progress.

837
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:02,547
20 years ago they'd have
strung 'em up for stealin' a watermelon.

838
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:06,050
I don't understand you, Mr Anderson.
Not at all.

839
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:09,929
Let's get somethin' straight, all right?

840
01:25:10,012 --> 01:25:14,141
This thing was fucked up the moment
we turned it into a show for the newsmen.

841
01:25:14,225 --> 01:25:16,852
The moment those three kids
disappeared, it was news.

842
01:25:16,936 --> 01:25:21,273
The moment the three civil rights
workers disappeared, it was news.

843
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:24,777
To me they're just kids.
They're still missin'.

844
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:29,407
What's missing... is the 50 minutes
Pell said he was with his wife.

845
01:25:33,244 --> 01:25:35,329
OK.

846
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:53,889
I love Mississippi.

847
01:26:04,691 --> 01:26:06,485
They...

848
01:26:06,568 --> 01:26:08,821
They hate Mississippi.

849
01:26:09,655 --> 01:26:13,450
They hate us because
we present a shining example...

850
01:26:13,534 --> 01:26:16,787
..of successful segregation.

851
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:21,416
These Northern students,
with their atheist, communist bosses,...

852
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,671
..that have come into our community
this summer with the wish to destroy it,...

853
01:26:25,754 --> 01:26:29,383
..this week have taken a terrible blow.

854
01:26:30,217 --> 01:26:33,929
This week their cause has been crippled.

855
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:38,809
This week all of these federal policemen
you see out here pryin' into our lives,...

856
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:40,852
..violatin' our civil liberties,...

857
01:26:40,936 --> 01:26:43,772
..have learned that they are
powerless against us...

858
01:26:43,855 --> 01:26:49,402
..if every single Anglo-Saxon
Christian one of us stands together!

859
01:26:54,741 --> 01:26:55,951
This week...

860
01:26:57,452 --> 01:26:59,829
- Ward?
- We have company, sir.

861
01:27:00,997 --> 01:27:03,333
Why are you here?
This is a political meeting.

862
01:27:03,416 --> 01:27:07,671
- Doesn't smell that way to me, Deputy.
- It's a political meeting, Hoover boy.

863
01:27:07,754 --> 01:27:13,343
Oh, it looks like a political meeting
but smells more like Klan to me,...

864
01:27:13,426 --> 01:27:16,721
..with or without the Halloween costumes.

865
01:27:17,472 --> 01:27:19,182
Gentlemen.

866
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:22,894
In the courts of Mississippi,
they have been reminded...

867
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:26,231
..that they cannot by force
turn our communities...

868
01:27:26,314 --> 01:27:28,817
..into replicas of theircommunities.

869
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:33,363
Communities in which Negroes run riot,
unrestrained and unpunished,...

870
01:27:33,446 --> 01:27:37,784
..as they do this summer in the streets
of Harlem, or in the streets of Oakland,...

871
01:27:37,867 --> 01:27:40,036
..or in the streets of Chicago!

872
01:28:48,646 --> 01:28:50,731
(knocks)

873
01:29:01,283 --> 01:29:03,577
Can I come in?

874
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:14,213
It's not good for you to be here.

875
01:29:14,296 --> 01:29:17,007
- Why?
- It's ugly.

876
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:20,219
This whole thing is so ugly.

877
01:29:21,261 --> 01:29:25,015
Have you any idea what it's like
to live with all this?

878
01:29:25,891 --> 01:29:30,479
People look at us...
and only see bigots and racists.

879
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:35,859
Hatred isn't something you're born with.

880
01:29:35,943 --> 01:29:38,028
It gets taught.

881
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:43,742
At school they said segregation
is what it said in the Bible.

882
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:48,997
Genesis 9, verse 27.

883
01:29:52,167 --> 01:29:57,088
At seven years of age, you get
told it enough times, you believe it.

884
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:01,218
You believe the hatred.

885
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:05,972
You live it. You breathe it.

886
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:10,185
You marry it.

887
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:43,176
My husband drove
one of the cars that night.

888
01:30:43,259 --> 01:30:46,679
- Shh.
- That's what you wanna hear, isn't it?

889
01:30:48,598 --> 01:30:53,728
(sobbing) The bodies are buried
on the Roberts farm, in an earthen dam.

890
01:31:12,246 --> 01:31:13,915
Sir!

891
01:31:26,636 --> 01:31:28,971
Take a break, Mr Bird.

892
01:31:29,055 --> 01:31:31,766
Put some handkerchiefs around your face.

893
01:31:35,644 --> 01:31:37,730
(Bird retches)

894
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:47,156
Bring that here.

895
01:32:01,587 --> 01:32:05,090
The bodies of the three civil rights
workers were found today...

896
01:32:05,174 --> 01:32:07,551
..at an undisclosed grave.

897
01:32:08,969 --> 01:32:13,515
Neither the FBI nor the sheriff's
department will comment on the case.

898
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:16,351
The bodies were brought
to Jessup County Hospital.

899
01:32:16,435 --> 01:32:18,937
Officials here also refused comment.

900
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:23,358
There is speculation that an autopsy
will be performed later tonight.

901
01:32:25,486 --> 01:32:28,363
OK, keep it open. We're comin' through.

902
01:32:28,447 --> 01:32:31,116
Come on, open it up.

903
01:32:32,242 --> 01:32:34,161
Hold it back.

904
01:32:54,056 --> 01:32:56,933
Clinton,
you got problems at home to tend to.

905
01:32:57,017 --> 01:32:58,560
What do you mean?

906
01:32:58,643 --> 01:33:02,314
I mean pull your head
out of your ass and get home!

907
01:33:02,397 --> 01:33:06,902
"I, Vincent Thompson, am the
cheddar-cheese champion ofthe world."

908
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:13,533
"In international competition with 42 other
entries, my cheddar won fiirstprize...

909
01:33:13,617 --> 01:33:17,412
..based on flavour, texture,
appearance and colour."

910
01:33:22,334 --> 01:33:26,004
Hey, Clinton.
I didn't expect you home so early.

911
01:33:27,255 --> 01:33:29,424
Hi, Frank.

912
01:33:40,059 --> 01:33:42,353
No, don't. I'm sorry.

913
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:47,901
(punching)

914
01:33:47,984 --> 01:33:50,403
(Mrs Pell moans)

915
01:33:56,117 --> 01:33:58,202
Sir.

916
01:34:00,288 --> 01:34:02,373
Say again?

917
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:05,793
I'll be right there.

918
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:12,925
- Mr Bird.
- Yes, sir?

919
01:34:13,009 --> 01:34:15,094
Get five men and meet me outside.

920
01:34:17,472 --> 01:34:20,600
- Where's Anderson?
- He's at the motel, sir.

921
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:29,358
You two take the front door. If anyone
tries to get past you, break 'em down.

922
01:34:29,442 --> 01:34:32,403
You two take the door on the corridor.
Mr Bird?

923
01:34:34,113 --> 01:34:38,117
OK. Go get Anderson. Bring him here.

924
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:42,997
Don't tell him why.
Don't tell him anything. Just get him here.

925
01:34:58,429 --> 01:35:01,140
(footsteps)

926
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,530
Mr Anderson. Stop!

927
01:35:16,613 --> 01:35:18,282
- Mr Anderson!
- Go to hell.

928
01:35:18,365 --> 01:35:21,910
I'm telling you to stop and
I mean it. We're not killers.

929
01:35:21,994 --> 01:35:26,081
- It's the difference between them and us.
- No, between them and you!

930
01:35:26,165 --> 01:35:28,542
- You're no more like them than I am.
- Wrong.

931
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:32,212
What do you care what I do to a bastard
hidin' behind a sheriff's badge?

932
01:35:32,296 --> 01:35:35,424
- You have the whole world to change!
- And I'm changin' it.

933
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:39,094
- You're as arrogant as you are stupid!
- You're changin' it too.

934
01:35:39,177 --> 01:35:41,179
I'll make some changes right now!

935
01:35:41,263 --> 01:35:45,642
Don't mess this up just because
you like foolin' around with witnesses.

936
01:35:55,485 --> 01:35:57,696
A gun don't mean shit unless you use it.

937
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:01,908
- I'll kill you now if you don't listen to me.
- Fuck you.

938
01:36:01,992 --> 01:36:04,077
Let me go. Let me go.

939
01:36:06,413 --> 01:36:10,834
- We'll go after all of 'em, together.
- You wouldn't know how!

940
01:36:10,917 --> 01:36:13,545
- You'll teach me.
- You don't have the guts.

941
01:36:13,628 --> 01:36:16,840
Not only do I have the guts,
I have the authority.

942
01:36:16,923 --> 01:36:19,009
What is that supposed to mean?

943
01:36:19,092 --> 01:36:24,264
New rules. We nail 'em any way we can.
Even your way.

944
01:36:24,347 --> 01:36:27,267
Is this you talkin' or
some guy pullin' your strings?

945
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:29,394
Both.

946
01:36:29,477 --> 01:36:31,563
- We do it my way.
- Your way.

947
01:36:31,688 --> 01:36:34,357
- With my people!
- Whatever it takes.

948
01:36:36,234 --> 01:36:38,111
OK.

949
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,244
Gimme a minute.

950
01:36:53,918 --> 01:36:56,880
- You think he would've shot me?
- Oh, yes, sir.

951
01:36:58,089 --> 01:37:00,633
He's a ballsy little bastard, isn't he?

952
01:37:08,683 --> 01:37:11,227
They want me to say "Let us not forget...

953
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:16,357
..that two white boys also died
helping Negroes help themselves."

954
01:37:19,485 --> 01:37:24,866
They want me to say "We mourn with
the mothers of these two white boys."

955
01:37:24,949 --> 01:37:27,493
(congregation murmurs)

956
01:37:28,035 --> 01:37:32,415
But the state of Mississippi
won't even allow these white boys...

957
01:37:32,498 --> 01:37:36,043
..to be buried in the same
cemetery as this Negro boy.

958
01:37:38,796 --> 01:37:43,092
I say I have no more love to give.

959
01:37:43,175 --> 01:37:46,262
I have only angerin my heart today,...

960
01:37:46,345 --> 01:37:49,932
..and I want you to be angry with me!

961
01:37:50,015 --> 01:37:52,560
Now, I am sick and I am tired,...

962
01:37:52,643 --> 01:37:55,896
..and I want you to be
sick and tired with me!

963
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,234
I... I... I am sick and tired
ofgoing to the funerals...

964
01:38:00,317 --> 01:38:04,071
..ofblack men who have been
murdered by white men!

965
01:38:04,155 --> 01:38:08,158
I... I am sick and tired
ofthe people ofthis country...

966
01:38:08,242 --> 01:38:12,288
..who continue to allow
these things to happen!

967
01:38:12,371 --> 01:38:17,042
What is an "inalienable right"
ifyou are a Negro?

968
01:38:17,126 --> 01:38:20,546
What does it mean,
"equal treatment under the law"?

969
01:38:20,629 --> 01:38:25,259
What does it mean,
"Iiberty andjustice forall"?

970
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,554
Now I say to these people:

971
01:38:28,637 --> 01:38:34,518
Look at the face ofthis young man
and you will see the face ofa black man.

972
01:38:34,601 --> 01:38:38,814
But, ifyou look at the bloodshed, it is red.
It is like yours!

973
01:38:38,897 --> 01:38:41,316
It isjust like yours!

974
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:13,241
You...

975
01:40:15,868 --> 01:40:17,954
I'm gonna tell you a story.

976
01:40:19,789 --> 01:40:25,086
A young kid named Homer Wilkes
lives about 30 miles north of here.

977
01:40:25,169 --> 01:40:30,758
He'd just taken his girlfriend home
and was walkin' back along the road...

978
01:40:30,842 --> 01:40:33,177
..when a car pulled up.

979
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:36,013
Three white boys took him for a ride.

980
01:40:40,059 --> 01:40:41,727
Now...

981
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:45,481
..he hadn't done anything,...

982
01:40:47,191 --> 01:40:49,276
..except...

983
01:40:50,194 --> 01:40:52,279
..be a Negro.

984
01:40:55,032 --> 01:40:57,326
And they took him to a shack.

985
01:40:57,952 --> 01:41:00,663
A shack like... Iike this one.

986
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:04,708
And they took out a razor blade,...

987
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:08,587
..a regular old razor blade, like this one,...

988
01:41:10,881 --> 01:41:14,009
..and they pulled down his pants...

989
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:19,515
..and they spread his legs...

990
01:41:20,975 --> 01:41:23,936
..and they sliced off his scrotum.

991
01:41:26,897 --> 01:41:28,982
Put it in a coffee cup.

992
01:41:33,946 --> 01:41:39,868
And do you know how much you bleed
when somebody cuts off your balls?

993
01:41:39,952 --> 01:41:42,037
Huh?!

994
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:50,379
When they found Homer, he looked like
he'd been dipped in blood up to his waist.

995
01:41:50,462 --> 01:41:53,882
He was barely alive when
they got him to the hospital.

996
01:41:53,966 --> 01:41:56,510
He can hardly walk now.

997
01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:08,772
Mayor, we know you know...

998
01:42:08,855 --> 01:42:13,026
..who was there when those three
civil rights boys was murdered.

999
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:15,654
We know you know
who pulled the trigger.

1000
01:42:17,989 --> 01:42:20,200
(grunts)

1001
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:24,204
Is there somethin' you wanna say to me?

1002
01:42:30,835 --> 01:42:32,921
(Anderson) OK!

1003
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:41,429
- Is he with the Bureau?
- Yeah. He's kind of a specialist.

1004
01:42:41,513 --> 01:42:44,849
- You're sure the mayor won't talk?
- No, they'd kill him!

1005
01:42:44,933 --> 01:42:47,602
All right. What do you have?

1006
01:42:47,685 --> 01:42:51,564
There were three cars and seven men.
Pell and Bailey did the killing.

1007
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,734
- Sheriff Stuckey?
- He was too smart to be there.

1008
01:42:54,818 --> 01:42:57,487
- So Pell pulled the trigger for him.
- And Townley?

1009
01:42:57,570 --> 01:43:01,533
It was his idea. Grand Dragons,
they don't get their hands dirty.

1010
01:43:01,616 --> 01:43:05,161
The whole thing, huh? Bullet by bullet.

1011
01:43:06,621 --> 01:43:13,211
I don't suppose you're interested in words
like "coercion" or "hearsay" or "duress".

1012
01:43:13,294 --> 01:43:15,588
This is no good in court.

1013
01:43:15,672 --> 01:43:19,550
We're not in court, Mr Ward.
We'll never get 'em on murder anyway.

1014
01:43:19,634 --> 01:43:23,513
That's a state charge.
These hayseeds will never prosecute.

1015
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:26,808
- I know that!
- We've got to get 'em in federal court!

1016
01:43:26,891 --> 01:43:31,020
- Violation of civil rights!
- Remember whose rights you're violatin'!

1017
01:43:31,104 --> 01:43:35,024
- Don't put me on your perch, Mr Ward!
- Don't drag me into your gutter!

1018
01:43:35,107 --> 01:43:38,110
These people crawled out of a sewer,
Mr Ward!

1019
01:43:38,194 --> 01:43:40,905
And maybe the gutter's
where we should be!

1020
01:43:46,619 --> 01:43:48,704
Thank you.

1021
01:44:12,269 --> 01:44:14,355
This better be important.

1022
01:44:22,821 --> 01:44:25,324
Who the hell called this meeting?

1023
01:44:27,952 --> 01:44:31,246
- We thought you did.
- Of this group? Are you stupid?

1024
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:34,041
You didn't call this? Shit.

1025
01:44:34,124 --> 01:44:37,294
- If you didn't call this, who the fuck did?
- Shut up.

1026
01:44:37,378 --> 01:44:42,216
Is this some kind of bullshit setup?
Ray, are you sure you didn't call this?

1027
01:44:42,299 --> 01:44:46,595
Cos I got a note from my wife
and it said it was from you and Clinton.

1028
01:44:46,678 --> 01:44:49,056
Lester, shut up!

1029
01:44:50,724 --> 01:44:55,062
Now,
we're all gonna walk straight outta here...

1030
01:44:55,145 --> 01:44:57,231
..and say nothing.

1031
01:44:57,564 --> 01:44:59,650
That means nothin', Lester.

1032
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:02,653
- First one who opens his mouth is dead.
- Shut up.

1033
01:45:03,779 --> 01:45:05,739
Hey, Clinton.

1034
01:45:09,493 --> 01:45:10,535
Clinton.

1035
01:45:14,664 --> 01:45:18,794
Looks like the rattlesnakes
are startin' to commit suicide.

1036
01:45:46,279 --> 01:45:48,365
Hi, Lester.

1037
01:45:53,286 --> 01:45:56,331
We'll give you that ride home.

1038
01:45:56,915 --> 01:45:58,708
What?

1039
01:45:58,792 --> 01:46:02,754
Well, I know you said 4.30
but we're runnin' a little late, so...

1040
01:46:02,837 --> 01:46:05,548
- I'll meet you in the car.
- You're cracked.

1041
01:46:07,675 --> 01:46:09,761
Do you have change of a 20?

1042
01:46:10,803 --> 01:46:12,889
Sure.

1043
01:46:18,061 --> 01:46:20,063
Get in the car, Lester.

1044
01:46:20,146 --> 01:46:24,192
Or you'll have a hard time pickin'
your nose once I've closed this drawer.

1045
01:46:28,029 --> 01:46:32,492
Lester, you could make it a lot easier on
yourself by goin' on the record right now.

1046
01:46:32,575 --> 01:46:37,705
I ain't got nothin' to say.
You barkin' up the wrong tree, mister.

1047
01:46:38,748 --> 01:46:42,585
Lester, I gotta tell you somethin'.
We got you cold.

1048
01:46:42,668 --> 01:46:45,546
Your buddies have already talked.

1049
01:46:46,297 --> 01:46:48,382
You're lyin'.

1050
01:46:53,137 --> 01:46:59,185
You're in a lot of trouble. We know you
drove the second vehicle, the green truck.

1051
01:46:59,268 --> 01:47:02,897
And your buddy says...
Refresh my memory here, Mr Bird.

1052
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:06,650
"Lester Cowens kicked the Negro
twice in the face and then shot him."

1053
01:47:06,734 --> 01:47:10,112
- That's a goddamn lie.
- No, it's true. What else, Mr Bird?

1054
01:47:10,196 --> 01:47:15,242
"Lester Cowens said 'They only left me
a nigger, but at least I shot me a nigger."'

1055
01:47:17,703 --> 01:47:21,874
- I didn't kill him. I shot him in the ass.
- We know that.

1056
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,962
He was already dead by the time you shot
him. But your buddy sees it differently.

1057
01:47:27,046 --> 01:47:31,926
Your buddy tells it that you killed the kid.
You either go on the record right now...

1058
01:47:32,009 --> 01:47:36,597
..or it's gonna be your ass
we're talkin' about, not just a black kid's!

1059
01:47:50,194 --> 01:47:54,031
Think about it, Lester.
Come on out of there.

1060
01:47:55,908 --> 01:47:57,993
Come on out.

1061
01:48:41,203 --> 01:48:43,288
This is tricky.

1062
01:48:44,164 --> 01:48:46,875
They make it look so easy, don't they?

1063
01:48:48,835 --> 01:48:51,421
I got a question for you, Clinton.

1064
01:48:52,505 --> 01:48:55,633
You don't mind if I call you Clinton,
do you?

1065
01:48:55,717 --> 01:48:58,219
I feel like I know you so well.

1066
01:49:00,638 --> 01:49:04,184
The way we have it,
on the night of the murders...

1067
01:49:04,267 --> 01:49:07,979
..you made a short speech as the
bulldozer buried the kids in the dam.

1068
01:49:08,438 --> 01:49:10,273
How does Lester tell it?

1069
01:49:10,356 --> 01:49:15,486
"Mississippi will be proud of you.
You've struck a blow for the white man."

1070
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:18,740
Is that what you said, Clinton? Hm?

1071
01:49:19,157 --> 01:49:21,701
Is that what you said?

1072
01:49:21,784 --> 01:49:23,661
It must've been you...

1073
01:49:23,745 --> 01:49:28,041
..because Clayton Townley and
Ray Stuckey were too smart to be there.

1074
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:34,005
And you was too stupid to think
anybody'd remember what you said.

1075
01:49:34,088 --> 01:49:36,382
But old Lester, he got a good memory.

1076
01:49:38,342 --> 01:49:40,428
(grunt)

1077
01:49:41,095 --> 01:49:44,765
(Anderson) I'm sorry.
I haven't done this for a long time.

1078
01:49:45,266 --> 01:49:50,229
Did you make a speech the night that
you beat up your wife, Clinton? Huh?

1079
01:49:50,646 --> 01:49:52,815
Did ya?

1080
01:49:52,899 --> 01:49:56,068
Did you strike a blow
for the white man that night?

1081
01:49:56,152 --> 01:49:58,404
(door closes)

1082
01:50:00,615 --> 01:50:03,409
You got a stupid smile.
You know that, Pell?

1083
01:50:03,492 --> 01:50:06,579
Can you see it? Huh? Good!

1084
01:50:07,455 --> 01:50:12,126
Did you smile when the bulldozer
ran over the black kid's body? Did ya?!

1085
01:50:16,338 --> 01:50:19,884
Did you smile when the bodies
were covered over? Did ya?!

1086
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:22,887
Get up here. Come on. Get up!

1087
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:26,140
Did you smile that same stupid smile,
huh?!

1088
01:50:26,223 --> 01:50:28,142
Did ya?! You...

1089
01:50:28,726 --> 01:50:30,811
(crashing from inside)

1090
01:50:33,063 --> 01:50:36,900
Did ya smile, Pell? Did ya smile?!

1091
01:50:36,984 --> 01:50:39,486
Huh?! Did ya?!

1092
01:50:44,825 --> 01:50:47,202
Make no mistake about it, Deputy.

1093
01:50:47,286 --> 01:50:53,542
I'll cut your fuckin' head off and not give
a shit how it reads in the report sheet.

1094
01:51:08,807 --> 01:51:10,893
(door closes)

1095
01:51:15,647 --> 01:51:17,733
One more bite. One more bite.

1096
01:51:18,859 --> 01:51:21,361
One more bite, darlin'. One more bite.

1097
01:51:35,542 --> 01:51:38,128
(baby crying)

1098
01:51:38,378 --> 01:51:42,340
- Shit, Lester! What the fuck is goin' on?!
- Shut up!

1099
01:51:42,424 --> 01:51:46,261
Get in the bedroom and lock the door!
And stay away from the windows!

1100
01:51:57,522 --> 01:51:59,399
Shit.

1101
01:53:03,588 --> 01:53:06,132
Please. Please! I didn't say a thing!

1102
01:53:06,215 --> 01:53:10,344
I swear! It's a setup! I didn't say nothin'!
I didn't say nothin'!

1103
01:53:11,387 --> 01:53:16,058
Nothin'! I didn't say nothin'!
I didn't say nothin'!

1104
01:53:23,524 --> 01:53:25,985
I didn't say nothin'!

1105
01:53:36,078 --> 01:53:37,204
(coughing)

1106
01:53:37,288 --> 01:53:39,373
(gunshots)

1107
01:53:46,005 --> 01:53:49,341
You're lucky we've been
watchin' your ass, Lester.

1108
01:53:51,885 --> 01:53:57,641
If you go on the record, Mr Cowens,
we'll give you protection. If not...

1109
01:53:57,725 --> 01:54:01,186
If not, they're gonna kill you anyway.

1110
01:54:01,562 --> 01:54:04,773
Oh. You need a toilet, Lester.

1111
01:54:29,923 --> 01:54:32,008
We really had him goin', huh?

1112
01:55:16,386 --> 01:55:19,013
We'll take care of the check, Mr Swilley.

1113
01:55:43,454 --> 01:55:46,457
Well, I suppose I'll... be back for supper.

1114
01:55:55,967 --> 01:55:58,469
Button up, Wesley.

1115
01:57:13,794 --> 01:57:16,255
Why did he do it?

1116
01:57:16,338 --> 01:57:20,509
He wasn't even in on it. Wasn't even Klan.

1117
01:57:21,635 --> 01:57:23,929
Mr Bird, he was guilty.

1118
01:57:24,846 --> 01:57:29,935
Anyone's guilty who watches this happen
and pretends it isn't.

1119
01:57:30,018 --> 01:57:33,188
No. He was guilty all right.

1120
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:37,442
Just as guilty as the fanatics
who pulled the trigger.

1121
01:57:39,569 --> 01:57:40,779
Maybe we all are.

1122
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:37,418
Hello!

1123
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:40,588
Yeah.

1124
01:58:46,511 --> 01:58:51,140
I just missed you at the hospital.
They said you'd gone home.

1125
01:58:52,016 --> 01:58:54,644
What's left of it.

1126
01:58:55,561 --> 01:58:58,689
- I'm real sorry.
- So am l.

1127
01:59:00,108 --> 01:59:03,236
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1128
01:59:05,947 --> 01:59:09,367
- Where will you go?
- I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm stayin'.

1129
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:12,036
This is my home. Born here.

1130
01:59:13,579 --> 01:59:15,665
Probably die here.

1131
01:59:19,168 --> 01:59:23,297
If I wanted to leave,
I would've done it a long time ago.

1132
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:25,675
Things'll work out.

1133
01:59:25,758 --> 01:59:29,929
There's enough good people around here
know what I did was right.

1134
01:59:30,012 --> 01:59:34,183
And enough ladies
like the way I fix their hair.

1135
01:59:48,989 --> 01:59:50,783
Hey.

1136
01:59:52,117 --> 01:59:54,703
If you're ever in Des Moines,...

1137
01:59:54,787 --> 01:59:56,872
..don't send me a postcard.

1138
01:59:57,539 --> 01:59:59,625
OK.

1139
02:00:07,549 --> 02:00:12,763
#We cannot see

1140
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:16,266
#In the future

1141
02:00:16,725 --> 02:00:21,104
#No, no, no, no, no

1142
02:00:22,147 --> 02:00:25,275
#And it's hard

1143
02:00:25,901 --> 02:00:29,238
#To smile

1144
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:32,866
#Through trials

1145
02:00:34,284 --> 02:00:41,291
#No, we cannot see

1146

#Every pitfall

1147
02:00:48,799 --> 02:00:51,885

1148
02:00:52,761 --> 02:00:55,889

1149
02:00:56,473 --> 02:00:59,059

1150
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:02,687
#Oh, Lord

1151

1152
02:01:09,569 --> 02:01:13,698

1157
02:01:32,133 --> 02:01:33,968

1158
02:01:34,052 --> 02:01:37,263
#He's able

1159
02:01:37,347 --> 02:01:40,058
#He could carry your load

1160
02:01:40,141 --> 02:01:46,814
#And he could see way down the road

1161
02:01:46,898 --> 02:01:49,942
#Walk on

1162
02:01:50,026 --> 02:01:52,070
(singing continues)

1163

1164
02:01:56,783 --> 02:01:58,868
Yeah.
