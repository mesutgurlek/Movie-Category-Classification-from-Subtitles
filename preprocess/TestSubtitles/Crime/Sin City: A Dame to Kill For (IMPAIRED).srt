1
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:39,948
Metal screams...

2
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,711
something hit me
square in the chest...

3
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:46,388
there's no up or down...

4
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:48,354
I don't weigh a thing...

5
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:53,315
I don't remember a thing.

6
00:00:55,797 --> 00:01:00,534
Arr...this doesn't look good at all,
I must have done something again.

7
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:02,716
Wish I can remember what.

8
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,339
How did I get here, what have I done, and why...

9
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:09,322
I must have forgotten my medicine.

10
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:13,112
I got a condition. It's bad to forget your medicine

11
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,219
when you got a condition.

12
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:18,113
Caught myself a bullet,
the wound is fresh.

13
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:20,088
Maybe an hour old?

14
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:22,727
I can't remember how I got it.

15
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:26,613
For the life of me,
I can't remember.

16
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,389
The Projects...

17
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,258
ugly as ever.

18
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,287
What the hell am I doing here?

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,256
Put the pieces together.

20
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,191
Remember.

21
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,993
It's Saturday...

22
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,691
So I must have started the night at Kadie's Joint...

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,752
just another Saturday night...

24
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:48,954
Me and all the other losers
like me...

25
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,876
Sucking back the sauce, drooling like fools, over Nancy....

26
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:57,246
I wasn't in the mood,
even watching Nancy couldn't cheer me up.

27
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:59,291
I get that way sometimes.

28
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:03,114
Empty in the gut, hollow in that lonely place

29
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:07,045
and wishing I had an
excuse to break somebody's face.

30
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:12,619
It was just another Saturday night.

31
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,493
I was wondering what I was gonna do with myself,

32
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,452
when I smelled something awful.

33
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:21,425
Burning hair.

34
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:25,326
Burning meat.

35
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:30,983
Like this poor old guy
didn't have it bad enough already.

36
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:35,615
Damn frat' boys!
Damn rich spoiled brats!

37
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:39,596
Leave him be.

38
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:42,487
Crawl back into your bottle, Bernini boy!

39
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,522
Why did he call me "Bernie"?

40
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,160
At least I know they're bad guys.

41
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,288
Nothing wrong with
killing a bunch of them.

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,018
Hell, it's practically my civic duty.

43
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:59,914
Oh, these wormy little twits.
I hate these guys.

44
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,798
God just help my friends.

45
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:08,381
They made a run for it. I did  what
any good citizen would do.

46
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,362
Go to hell!

47
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:16,162
What the hell!

48
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:18,196
What the hell!

49
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,029
What the hell!

50
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,625
That's when I get my idea.

51
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,618
If they got back to the university out in Sacred Oaks

52
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:32,398
I'd never catch them.

53
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,458
I bang them around
like a hockey puck,

54
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,228
cut them off at every turn.

55
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:42,019
I left them no choice but to
head over the hill, to The Projects.

56
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,767
I can just turn my back
and leave them here.

57
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:47,730
My old neighbors will
take care of them but I couldn't.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,560
What the hell, why should they have all the fun!

59
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,267
The Projects...

60
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,163
I was born here.

61
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,063
My old neighborhood.

62
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,736
Ted, he's a dead man!

63
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:13,626
Tell you what,
I'm gonna get you a  good shot.

64
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:15,728
And hes a dead man!

65
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:19,632
My old neighbors.

66
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,397
They let me know they're watching.

67
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,496
I remind them who I am.

68
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,169
I tell them what to do.

69
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,595
No, no please, please,
I got money.

70
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,631
I got a trust fund, I can pay.

71
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,503
You'll pay...

72
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:54,167
Before you shot me, you called me "Bernie",

73
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,069
why did you call me "Bernie"?

74
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:58,929
Bernini, its a brand name.

75
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:02,566
That coat you're wearing, it's a Bernini.

76
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,664
Thanks for clearing that up, kid.

77
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,439
Knife!

78
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,303
Bernini, huh?

79
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:17,202
That one fine coat it is...

80
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,129
somebody must have
spent a fortune on it.

81
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:22,104
I wonder who.

82
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:26,852
And while I'm at it, where
the heck did I get these gloves?

83
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:30,726
I can't remember
for the life of me.

84
00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:34,440
<i>[police siren blaring]</i>

85
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,781
Poker...

86
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,542
savage power...

87
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,635
in gentleman's hands.

88
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,540
It's a good game!

89
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:12,262
Now, who wants to play?

90
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:19,064
Sin City is where you
go in with your eyes open

91
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:22,073
or you don't come out at all.

92
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:26,734
But the city is
like a woman or a casino.

93
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,542
Somebody's gonna win

94
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:31,543
and it's gonna be me.

95
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,368
It's the kind of place
your father doesn't want to talk about.

96
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:41,210
But where I come from...

97
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,968
father is a thing no one seems to be able to find.

98
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:58,311
I was feeling lucky

99
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:02,997
<i>I had won money in joints all over town.
I finally made it to Kadie's</i>

100
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:06,244
<i>Where the real score is.</i>

101
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,752
<i>What happened to the show?</i>

102
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,377
Have a trick, stranger?

103
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,115
- Heads or tails?
- Head.

104
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,115
That's a trick.

105
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,108
That won't get you anywhere.

106
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,446
Follow the shiny object.

107
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,283
Where'd you come from handsome?

108
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:54,078
Do me a favor, blow on this.

109
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,118
Does lady luck have a name?

110
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,792
Marcie.

111
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:07,583
Lucky man!

112
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:09,481
Every time ma'am, where's the real action ?

113
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,582
Baby, you don't want to know.

114
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,482
I do want to know.

115
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,351
Whatever you say, boss.

116
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:18,138
Back at the bar, it's your funeral.
He'll eat you alive back there.

117
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,180
I'm pretty tough to chew.

118
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,659
Kiss it this time.

119
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
- Hey Marcie, you want to go make some real money?
- Um...hmm, yeah.

120
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,217
I'll check.

121
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:51,786
Goodnight.

122
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,621
I'll play.

123
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:04,191
Who's the slicker?

124
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:07,143
I busted this one
for crabs at Josie's once.

125
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,085
Play on, it's okay.

126
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,648
Whatever you do kid,
don't win too much.

127
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:19,688
I never lose.

128
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:23,456
What's with bringing
a fair lady here?

129
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,324
That's my good-luck-charm.

130
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,418
Besides, i intend on making a pretty nice dime tonight.

131
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,385
Gotta have someone
to spend it on, right?

132
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,014
Silvio, let our young friend
here do the honors.

133
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:46,528
Cut.

134
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,527
Woo...

135
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,456
This boy's good.

136
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:04,683
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy!

137
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,656
Nancy, Nancy!

138
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,651
And the dealer will take two.

139
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:12,596
One hundred.

140
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,330
<i>I'll play.</i>

141
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:22,190
<i>I'm out.</i>

142
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,658
- I fold.
- I'm done.

143
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,355
How dumb are you feeling now, boy?

144
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,227
Pretty dumb.

145
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:13,079
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy...

146
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,118
Well senator, I'm ready for your worst.

147
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,755
Boy, you don't even want to
dream about my worst.

148
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:23,348
No, I don't imagine I do. That's why
I'm gonna let you just flatten
your ass right now and we can call it a night.

149
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:28,288
Sure, it is a fair game
played by honorable men.

150
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,391
I'm gonna raise you 300.

151
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:33,196
Easy, kid.

152
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,094
You got any idea
what you're up against?

153
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,802
Looks to me I'm up against a man.

154
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,158
You're up against a Roark.

155
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,734
Yeah I was born here, senator.
I know who you are.

156
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,691
We all die here sooner or later.

157
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:48,394
I'm gonna raise you another 500.

158
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,364
I like this kid.

159
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,394
I like him a lot!

160
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:56,265
I'm gonna call you.

161
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,560
You won't be needing
anything for cab fare, will you?

162
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,360
Now that's as fine a hand
as you'll ever have friend.

163
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,126
Just keep in mind
what hands are made out of.

164
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:18,301
Will do.

165
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,201
Hey!

166
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:25,658
Get your ass outta here, run like hell,
you might still have a chance.

167
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,486
No, I can't miss tomorrow night's game,
not any more than you can, officer.

168
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:32,521
Besides, I aready promised
Marcie a night on the town.

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
I can't protect you.

170
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,297
Then why are you a cop?

171
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:49,130
Where are we going, Johnny?

172
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,733
Everywhere.

173
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:58,035
One of these days
she'll pull the trigger

174
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,765
and then there's nothing I can do.

175
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:03,735
There's nothing I can do now.

176
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,602
All I can do is ask...

177
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,254
<i>...listen, don't,
don't avenge me, Nancy.</i>

178
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,338
<i>It'll be the death of you.</i>

179
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:18,239
<i>I can't help.</i>

180
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,205
<i>I can't watch.</i>

181
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,740
Death is just like life in Sin City.

182
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,780
There's nothing you can do

183
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,567
and love doesn't conquer anything at all.

184
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:33,734
<i>Good luck, Nancy.</i>

185
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,440
<i>Live while your alive.</i>

186
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,337
<i>Just try, sweetheart.</i>

187
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:44,137
We made Sin City history.

188
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,134
Hit every hot spot in town.

189
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:49,708
I blow through almost as much cash
as I make at the table

190
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:54,567
The trouble starts when
I try to use my credit cards.

191
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,472
I'm sure there must be some mistake.

192
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:58,639
We'll be happy to extend your
line of credit.

193
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:00,603
How can all of em go bad on the same night ?

194
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:03,273
It's not like you don't have cash.

195
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:05,469
That's not the point, come on.

196
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:08,178
We gotta get you home.

197
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:13,780
Something comes up behind us.

198
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,063
It smells all wrong.

199
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:20,642
This will slow us down.

200
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,433
You get to the side, Marcie.
I gotta break some bone.

201
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:27,308
What are you talking about, you silly.

202
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:28,438
You just stay right there.

203
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:31,138
Gentleman, listen. I think I know what this is about,

204
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,203
I want you to know you'll have
no resistance from me

205
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,099
But that black jack you got in your hand
could split somebody's skull open.

206
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,443
What the hell was that all about?

207
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:56,204
You stay out of sight now,
you'll be safe in Old Town.

208
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:59,242
Meet me at the 3 Sheets Hotel.

209
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,144
Room 166.

210
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,173
6...what?

211
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,515
Let's get this over with.

212
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,175
I enjoy too much wealth.

213
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:31,010
You made a fool of me, boy.

214
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:32,808
Right in front of the wrong people.

215
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,575
You took your chances like
we all did and you lost!

216
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,496
You have any idea how easy
I kill little snots like you.

217
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:50,167
Now, let's see about that winning hand.

218
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:54,716
Powerful men watched
what happened at that table.

219
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,671
I need them to know
the price of defiance.

220
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,573
Power is a...fragile thing.

221
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:04,608
It tolerates no threat.

222
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:13,155
Defiance must be met with
an example of the wages of defiance.

223
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,480
You'd be smart to kill me now.

224
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,113
I'll do far worse
than kill you, boy

225
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,278
What you havent counted/have encountered, boy,

226
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,214
is power.

227
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:05,569
Everytime the wind blows cold and wet the thing that was your hand, now clutches your leg in
arthritic agony.

228
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,994
Whenever it rains, you'll remember me

229
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,646
You'll remember me, all the time,

230
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,479
my son.

231
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:20,372
Oh yeah, I know who you are.

232
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:25,101
I knew you were one of mine
the minute I saw you. Family resemblance, my boy.

233
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:27,054
But I don't give a damn.

234
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,071
I only have one real son and
he's already rest in peace.

235
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:31,826
And he couldve been president.

236
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,782
Did you really think...

237
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,614
that I was going to claim you?

238
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:45,050
He beat me, Roark.

239
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,017
but when I get back,

240
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:50,678
it'll be a whole different game.

241
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:01,118
It's another hot night.

242
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:05,069
Dry and windless, the kind that
makes people do sweaty,

243
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,052
secret things,

244
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:09,086
things worth money to me.

245
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:10,794
This is the last time, Sally.

246
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,719
This has gotta be the last time.

247
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,588
<i>You always say that.</i>

248
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,520
I mean it this time!

249
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,444
<i>She glides out of her coat
like it was Christmas wrapping.</i>

250
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:21,484
<i>playing it for all it's worth</i>

251
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,357
<i>and it's worth plenty.</i>

252
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:26,150
- This is the end for us.
- The end for us?

253
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:27,289
It's my wife.

254
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,114
She's asking all kinds of questions.
She suspects something.

255
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,687
She'll sue and she'll
get everything. Everything!

256
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:36,748
Everything you worked so hard for.

257
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,527
I worked my butt off.

258
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:41,517
I built my business up
out of nothing.

259
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:42,561
Nothing.

260
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,551
Nobody appreciates you,
do they, Joey?

261
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:47,352
Not the way you deserve.

262
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:49,421
Nobody.

263
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:54,041
My employees would be out on the street if it wasn't for me.
Not my wife who I found on the street!

264
00:20:54,231 --> 00:20:57,656
- The jewels and that mansion you bought her.
- Your wearing all those clothes that I got her!

265
00:20:57,832 --> 00:20:59,815
With my money! My hard-earned money!

266
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,795
I think you're so strong.

267
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,521
You're damn right about that.

268
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,386
Do I get any credit? They just
take and take and take!

269
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:11,421
One of these days I'm gonna
fire the whole pack of women.

270
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,323
I'm gonna show them who's boss!

271
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,160
Show me, Joey.

272
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:17,153
Show me who's boss.

273
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:34,388
It's all over pretty quickly.

274
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:38,221
I get everything I need.

275
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,980
The sad thing is some
of the composition is pretty good.

276
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,863
You make me feel like a woman.

277
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,118
I know it sounds corny but it's true.

278
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:47,835
I love you, baby.

279
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,725
You know I love you

280
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,594
Even though you lie to me.

281
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,425
My wrist hurts, Joey

282
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:57,388
Can you can go get the key,
it's just in my purse.

283
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:00,254
You don't have any idea
how much I've sacrificed.

284
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:02,194
What are you doing, Joey?

285
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:06,941
It's tearing me up how much
I love you and what I gotta do

286
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:09,799
but I worked too hard

287
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:12,024
<i>and Lori will get everything</i>

288
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,568
and I can't let that happen.
I don't have any choice.

289
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:15,790
It's all her fault.

290
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,629
Joey please...

291
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,496
I won't tell anyone, I swear.

292
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,424
I know you don't wanna talk.

293
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:22,562
I know that!

294
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:24,299
<i>but you're only human.</i>

295
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:25,427
<i>Lori is gonna find out about you</i>

296
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:31,648
<i>if she doesn't know already and
she's gonna offer you a lot of money, my money.
And she's gonna  give it to you
to bring me down!</i>

297
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:34,120
<i>- I'll go away!
- Who's gonna pay for the ticket?</i>

298
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,765
<i>That ticket and God knows what else!</i>

299
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:42,535
Then the apartment, the clothes, the car. You're gonna suck me dry and you'll never, ever stop!

300
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:45,555
No, please no!

301
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:52,390
Kill him!

302
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,826
Nobody is killing anybody,

303
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:03,835
not while I'm around.

304
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:14,228
Then can I have a ride?

305
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,359
<i>I grab the key and uncuff her.</i>

306
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:21,016
<i>She gives him a goodbye that will still hurt like hell when he comes to.</i>

307
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,723
<i>I leave the slob handcuffed to
the bed for housekeeping to find.</i>

308
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,652
<i>I take Ridando over the hill toward Old Town.</i>

309
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:34,597
Thanks for my life, man.

310
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:38,386
<i>Sally blends into the sea of flesh that is Old Town.</i>

311
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:41,230
<i>They all come back.</i>

312
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,192
<i>The damn Old Town memories, drunken mornings and sweaty sex and stupid bloody brawls</i>

313
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:50,498
<i>and that thing I did.</i>

314
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,497
<i>You can't just pick and choose.</i>

315
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:55,359
<i>You can't take the good
without the bad,</i>

316
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:59,219
<i>not once you let the monster out.</i>

317
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:01,264
<i>I can't let it out. Never again.</i>

318
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:06,918
<i>I drive 10 blocks out of my way and stop for gas I don't need,</i>

319
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,766
<i>avoiding the worst of this job.</i>

320
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,686
<i>My employer, the wife.</i>

321
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:17,362
<i>This one's got a lawyer
to pay the tab, so it's easier.</i>

322
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:20,263
Please leave by the servant's exit.

323
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,117
<i>The Mustang shudders, begging to cut loose and show what it can do.</i>

324
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,094
<i>It wants to take me all the way</i>

325
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:32,843
<i>I don't let it.</i>

326
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:39,444
<i>I think about all the ways I've screwed up and what I'd give for one clear chance to wipe the slate clean.</i>

327
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:44,455
<i>I'd give anything, just to cut loose,</i>

328
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,236
<i>just to feel the fire,</i>

329
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,236
<i>one more time.</i>

330
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:58,064
<i>Never lose control,</i>

331
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,808
<i>not for a second.</i>

332
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:03,497
<i>Never let the monster out.</i>

333
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:05,601
<i>Remember when you did.</i>

334
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:09,432
<i>Remember what you did.</i>

335
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,739
Yeah?

336
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,603
Dwight, is that you?

337
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:30,507
Ava.

338
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,339
I'm sorry to call.

339
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,334
I know I've got no right

340
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,471
but I need to see you,

341
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,277
<i>tonight.</i>

342
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:40,202
<i>Please Dwight, don't hang up, please.</i>

343
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:42,138
She keeps talking.

344
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:44,775
Like an idiot, I keep listening.

345
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,748
Ava.

346
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,873
Damn.

347
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,537
I should tell her to go to hell.

348
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:54,466
Instead I show up 20 minutes early.

349
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:56,597
What the hell does she want with me now?

350
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:01,321
You can't drive 2 blocks in Sin City without coming across a saloon.

351
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:04,171
The bad kind.

352
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:06,109
<i>Why here, Ava?</i>

353
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,096
<i>With you everything always
had to be first class.</i>

354
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:11,669
And when I couldn't foot the bill,

355
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:15,430
you sure as hell found somebody who could.

356
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:20,192
I ordered up a ginger ale and stared at it for the better part of an hour.

357
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:21,408
She's late,

358
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,274
like she always was

359
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,173
<i>and like always,</i>

360
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,074
<i>she is worth the wait..</i>

361
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:45,279
Dwight.

362
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,207
How long has it been?

363
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:49,109
4 years?

364
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,168
Yeah, that sounds about right.

365
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:52,854
Have a seat.

366
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,139
So many times I wanted to call you.

367
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:16,783
I found myself thinking about you.

368
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:17,857
Constantly.

369
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,680
I got places to go, how about
you just tell me what you want.

370
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:21,746
Don't be cold.

371
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,675
I don't think I could stand that right now.

372
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:27,442
I must still mean something to you.

373
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:29,506
You came here, you must have cared.

374
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:31,380
Sure.

375
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:33,374
You called and I came running.

376
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:36,237
You still got that much of a hold on me, maybe you always will

377
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:39,137
but I got no reason at all
to be nice to you.

378
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,112
I guess I deserve that.

379
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:43,078
Let's not screw around.

380
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,715
I'm here.

381
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:45,747
I'm listening.

382
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,709
Just tell me what the hell it is you want?

383
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:52,301
There's only one thing I want from you, I want it so desperately that I could scream.

384
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,244
I want you to forgive me.

385
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:57,372
So you've got a conscience afterall.

386
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,219
Fine.

387
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,305
I forgive you, you got your wish.

388
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:03,179
Now go home,

389
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:04,822
sleep tight.

390
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,854
You're right about me.

391
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:11,738
I'm a selfish slut who threw away the only man she ever loved.

392
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,777
But I was wrong.

393
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:15,454
Good one.

394
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,572
I was born at night but
it wasn't last night.

395
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm in hell, Dwight.

396
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:21,284
It's worse than you can imagine.

397
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:22,414
You made your bed, sleep in it!

398
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:25,146
- Forgive me, darling, I beg you.
- No!

399
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:28,111
- I love you.
- No!

400
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,554
No!

401
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,534
You do that again, I swear to hell I'll kill you.

402
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:46,302
If you can't forgive me,
then please remember me.

403
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,235
They say you never die as long as somebody remembers you.

404
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:53,109
What the devil are you talking about?

405
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:54,793
Mrs. Lord.

406
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:57,741
The weather is inclement,
the neighbourhood is bad

407
00:28:57,891 --> 00:29:01,572
and your present company...is low.

408
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,615
You're due at home, Mrs. Lord.

409
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:09,436
- I'd say that's up to Mrs. Lord.
- This is none of your concern, sir.

410
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:12,215
Any physical contest between us

411
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,316
Would have one outcome.

412
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:18,008
Hey buddy, is that dickhead giving you a hard time?

413
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:20,144
You want me to break him down for you?

414
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,082
I got nothing going on tonight.

415
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,515
That would be an interesting contest.

416
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:26,746
It's not his fight.

417
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:29,513
Never mind Dwight, it's too late.

418
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:30,651
I'll go with him.

419
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:33,417
Too late for what, Ava?

420
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:35,285
For everything.

421
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,115
Just remember me, my love.

422
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,316
Remember me.

423
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,791
You have business tonight, Mrs. Lord,

424
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,811
unpleasant business.

425
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:49,552
I don't care anymore.

426
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,412
<i>The night air hasn't got any colder,</i>

427
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:02,185
it just feels that way.

428
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:05,976
Buddy, I don't mean to poke my nose
right where it don't belong but

429
00:30:06,228 --> 00:30:09,013
that there, is a dame to kill for.

430
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,541
Ava...damn!

431
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,449
Night turns to day and then it's night again

432
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,485
and there's no where to hide.

433
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:22,318
She isn't worth a moment's thought

434
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,444
and I can't get her out of my head.

435
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:27,344
What am I doing smoking?

436
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:30,150
Where did I get these cigarettes?

437
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,691
It's Ava making you crazy.

438
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:37,720
All over again.

439
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:41,416
Never let the monster out.

440
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:45,372
Shake her off, whatever she's in for, she deserves it

441
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:47,419
but I have to know what's wrong.

442
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:52,309
It's a couple hours of drive out to Sacred Oaks.

443
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,751
It shouldn't take too much effort to get to the bottom of this.

444
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:00,039
Just a simple job of breaking and entering,

445
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:05,381
punishable by up to 5 years in the slammer even if I don't kill anybody.

446
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:19,644
I wind up seeing a lot more of Ava than I bargained for.

447
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:39,050
<i>She seems perfectly goddamn fine.</i>

448
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:40,834
<i>Not roughed up,</i>

449
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:44,678
<i>just the rich man's wife she always intended to be.</i>

450
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:50,622
I'm a damn fool.

451
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:52,591
Freeze! Pervert!.

452
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:10,556
Let me through, Manute.

453
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:16,624
I'm sorry, Dwight.

454
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:25,123
An atom bomb goes off between my legs.

455
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:29,121
A freight train barrows into my jaw.

456
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:35,488
I've taken a beating before but never like this.

457
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,357
Never like this.

458
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,386
<i>The sounds go wet.</i>

459
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:44,062
Maybe he keeps hitting me.

460
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,227
I don't know...

461
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:46,873
<i>...I'm gone.</i>

462
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:50,692
<i>Gone to that place where there's no pain or thought.</i>

463
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,727
I wake up in mid air.

464
00:32:56,705 --> 00:33:00,512
The pavement rushes up to give me a big sloppy kiss.

465
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,093
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

466
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,093
Door to door service.

467
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,796
Then I spot my Mustang,

468
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,826
which makes no sense.

469
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:20,563
Why would they return my car?

470
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
Get out of here.

471
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:40,671
No.

472
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:44,689
Put your clothes back on and get out of here, now!

473
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:47,566
No.

474
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:52,317
You had your chance. I would've stayed away but you came for me.

475
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:55,197
You still want me

476
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:57,229
and I'm yours, now!

477
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:59,102
Tonight!

478
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:01,127
Get out of my life once and for all

479
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:03,796
or I'll bash your teeth in.

480
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,830
If you can't love me,

481
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:08,766
hate me.

482
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,636
If you can't forgive me,

483
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:12,537
punish me.

484
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,259
Make me hurt, like I've hurt you.

485
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:29,584
I call her every foul name there is.
She makes my name sound like music,

486
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:34,424
like a chant to some dark god.

487
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:36,595
She's slippery with sweat.

488
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:39,397
Before long, my hatred is spent.

489
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:46,080
But she won't let go. She kisses me and coaxes me

490
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:49,161
and the fire grows again.

491
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:53,048
I say all the things I swore I'd never say again.

492
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,842
She owns me.

493
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:56,769
Body and soul.

494
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:03,404
Tell me everything.

495
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:07,264
Manute, the man who beat you.

496
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,299
He's a specialist in inflicting pain.

497
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:13,772
Hideous pain in all the places
you just gave him joy.

498
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,792
That's sick, it's crazy.

499
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:22,419
Damien, my husband, he talks and talks and watches.

500
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,635
It's worse each time.

501
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,298
It's getting closer to his final sick climax.

502
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:31,231
He says it'll be very ugly before  I die.

503
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:34,302
Ava, you're not gonna die.

504
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,135
You're coming with me.

505
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,909
It's hopeless.

506
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,702
He lets me run away,
Even laughs about it.

507
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:48,502
Doesn't care where I go,
what I do.

508
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:51,431
He knows Manute will
always find me.

509
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:55,305
Isn't that right, Manute?

510
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:59,994
Madam, Mr Lord would require
that you be disciplined.

511
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:02,166
No, wait, Dwight, don't fight him!

512
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:03,850
He'll kill you!

513
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:04,940
He's not human.

514
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:09,573
I punch a vault door, it doesn't fall down.

515
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,573
So I punch it again.

516
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:21,304
A wrecking ball hits me square in the chest.

517
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,196
Mrs. Lord, your clothes.

518
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,774
We have an appointment.

519
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,870
They can't take her away from me.

520
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,545
Not this time.

521
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,606
I know exactly what to do.

522
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,276
I know exactly where to go.

523
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:50,138
Now here's a girl with protection.

524
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:52,169
She maybe showing off everything she's got

525
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:57,704
but Nancy's the safest gal in the world.

526
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:02,524
Make a grab for Nancy and you're up against 300 pounds of iron

527
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,544
that goes by the name of...

528
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,347
...Marv.

529
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:24,581
Marv.

530
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,328
Dwight, mighty good to see you here.

531
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:31,377
What can I do you for?

532
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:33,379
I need your help.

533
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:37,135
It's bad and it's gonna be
up against a lot of guns.

534
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:40,853
Count me in.

535
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,905
I could use a change of pace.

536
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,677
We finished off the bottle

537
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:48,636
but it's liquid darkness that filled us both.

538
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:52,436
When I'm sure he's had enough to make him good and dangerous,

539
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:54,414
I tell him about Ava

540
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:57,307
and his eyes go killer red.

541
00:37:57,422 --> 00:38:02,093
I know he's willing to die for me if that's what it takes.

542
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,243
So I'm using him, so what?

543
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,755
So he breaks the faces I want him to break instead of

544
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,809
somebody's elses.

545
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:15,324
So he helps me get Ava back in my arms again instead of sleeping it off in a slum house or gutter.

546
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:17,606
His life isn't worth a damn anyway.

547
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:20,474
If I don't get him killed, the world will,

548
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:22,284
one way or another.

549
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:24,340
I want you to leave that thing in the car.

550
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,217
Nobody's getting killed tonight.

551
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:30,035
Oh come on Dwight, you aint no fun at all.

552
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:34,808
We split up at the gate.

553
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:44,275
It doesn't take Marv long to get their attention.

554
00:38:57,893 --> 00:39:00,612
You're the slug that freaked my friend out?

555
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:03,677
Shall we?

556
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:48,512
Oh, I gotta have my hand wrapped one of these days.

557
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,282
I'll find the truth about Ava

558
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:59,177
and what's happening to her now.

559
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:03,509
He'll tell me. I'll get it out of him.

560
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:06,649
Damien Lord.

561
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:12,415
Where is she?

562
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:15,256
What have you done with her?

563
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:19,075
Have you come to take her away from all this?

564
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:23,815
And what is all this in her present stories?

565
00:40:23,997 --> 00:40:28,573
I haven't the slightest notion what nonsense my wife has told you

566
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:30,556
nor do I care.

567
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:33,447
It's all lie.

568
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,381
Stay away from the desk.

569
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:41,237
The woman is pathological.

570
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,826
You have been deceived.

571
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:04,423
What did it feel like?

572
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:06,259
What?

573
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:08,285
Murdering an innocent man.

574
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:10,820
I just want to know what it felt like.

575
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:12,148
It must've been beautiful.

576
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,664
What are you talking about, innocence?

577
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,655
I knew I could count on you.

578
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,678
Sex always made you stupid, ready to believe anything.

579
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:23,163
You've just made me a very rich woman.

580
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:26,393
Do me one last favor, lover.

581
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:30,149
Stay still long enough for me to blow your brains out.

582
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:35,800
I'm not much of a shot

583
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:39,659
- but I'll do my best.
- Ava...

584
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:43,552
I planned it and you fell for it.

585
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:47,350
This is the last time I'm ever gonna need anything from a man.

586
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:51,246
The last time I make my living on my back.

587
00:41:52,368 --> 00:41:56,112
- Manute never hurt you...
- He wouldn't dare!

588
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:58,221
<i>- You're insane.
- No, Dwight.</i>

589
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:01,693
A crazy person would be anyone who believes me

590
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:03,788
and that would be you.

591
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:08,480
If I kissed you now, Dwight,
would you still believe it was... love?

592
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,653
No...

593
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,326
Ava...

594
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:35,463
Damn.

595
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:40,178
Hey, I handled that big slug just like I promised.
I didn't kill him, I didn't even cripple him.

596
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:43,354
6 months in traction, that's all, tops.

597
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,902
I took an eye out of him though.

598
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:49,188
Listen, before you say anything.

599
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:51,767
I know I was supposed to take the Mustang to make my getaway

600
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:54,623
but when I saw this beauty here sitting there, you know

601
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,452
the key in the ignition and everything, I couldn't pass a chance on it.

602
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:03,297
<i>Pull over!</i>

603
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:08,127
You know they only made a couple dozen of these beauties.

604
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,936
I saw a movie about it once.

605
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:13,053
Oh, here I'm, jabbering and you're leaking all over the place.

606
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,728
I'll get you to a guy I know.

607
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:20,526
He's good with bullets and uh,
he don't ask no questions.

608
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:22,498
Get me to Old Town.

609
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:25,551
Let me level with you, pal.
You ain't gonna make it to Old Town.

610
00:43:25,674 --> 00:43:27,466
I'll make it.

611
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:31,285
I got too much I've got to do
to let myself die.

612
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:35,132
Old Town.

613
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:40,707
He left a lot of blood, Mrs. Lord.

614
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:42,697
He won't get far.

615
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,628
You said you knew him.

616
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,565
The killer's name is Dwight.

617
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,530
Dwight MCcarthy.

618
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:51,434
You know him in what sense?

619
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:52,854
Well, we dated once.

620
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:57,608
I'm sorry, lieutenant. You've been so very patient with me.

621
00:43:57,942 --> 00:44:01,687
You and I barely met but already...
I feel I can trust you.

622
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:03,732
You can trust me.

623
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:08,624
We were together for a while a few years ago.

624
00:44:09,575 --> 00:44:11,464
It went badly.

625
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:13,336
He went insane.

626
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,227
He started imagining things,
accusing me of things.

627
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,906
He followed me wherever I went.

628
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,826
Recently, he broke into this very property.

629
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:23,800
Did he beat you?

630
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:26,702
When he drank.

631
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:29,532
- He drank a lot.
- You stayed with this nutcase?

632
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:36,999
- You'll be surprised how much a woman can take.
- You were terrified.

633
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,263
It was Damien who took me away.

634
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:48,897
He was so...gentle and sure.
I suppose I'm a woman who needs...protection.

635
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:50,910
He made me feel safe

636
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,627
but then, Dwight, he found me somehow.

637
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:58,490
He started calling me late at night, making awful threats.

638
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:02,563
And now Damien is dead

639
00:45:02,712 --> 00:45:04,536
and I'm alone.

640
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:07,364
Oh please, lieutenant.

641
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,235
Call me Mort.

642
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:16,234
Nothing like a widow in need of comfort.

643
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,138
I got a stiffy just watchin' her.

644
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:25,382
- Man, she's prime.
- Just drop it, Bob.
- You don't pass up a chance like that.
What's the point of being a Sin City cop if you don't get the perks?

645
00:45:25,714 --> 00:45:26,898
We're married men, Bob.

646
00:45:27,646 --> 00:45:29,439
I don't care what you are.

647
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:32,137
Just take a look at that babe!

648
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:34,136
That's enough, Bob.

649
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:41,802
This doesn't look good.

650
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:51,434
One squad car still chases us.

651
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,403
Must be a rookie driving.

652
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:58,122
His buddy should've told him the girls of Old Town have laws all their own

653
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:01,165
and they don't take kindly to cops.

654
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:05,744
Oh, you're a genius, girl.

655
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,576
Here we are, pal.

656
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:40,228
All of a sudden this doesn't look like the brightest idea you ever had.

657
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:45,321
You have 10 seconds to tell us what you're doing bringing cops to Old Town.

658
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:48,208
Here's the problem.

659
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:50,168
I don't fight girls.

660
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:51,948
Gail!

661
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,604
<i>- It's me.
- Dwight.</i>

662
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:59,574
What have they done to you?

663
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:02,405
The cork screw stamps me square in the chest

664
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,510
and twists.

665
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:08,244
Get Molly!

666
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,175
Get everybody.

667
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:27,574
It's about time.

668
00:47:29,522 --> 00:47:32,273
<i>- Hello?
- Mrs. Lord.</i>

669
00:47:32,422 --> 00:47:36,228
Lieutenant...Mort. You're so kind to call.

670
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:38,117
I hope I didn't wake you.

671
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,910
No, I wasn't sleeping. I haven't slept at all.

672
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:44,733
I'm jumping at every sound, just knowing he's still out there.

673
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:48,539
I guess I'm not a very strong person.

674
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:51,539
<i>And me in this house all alone.</i>

675
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:53,511
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, Mrs Lord.

676
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:56,279
<i> You're having a very understandable reaction.</i>

677
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:58,246
Is there any thing at all I can do for you?

678
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:01,105
I know it's a bad thing to
think of you the way I do.

679
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:04,169
It's...inconvenient

680
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:07,747
but whoever loved, love not at first sight?

681
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:11,640
I thought about you since I saw you.

682
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,646
I'm thinking about you now.

683
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:17,509
<i>Were you thinking about me?</i>

684
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:19,420
Yes.

685
00:48:19,457 --> 00:48:21,409
I hate myself for saying this but

686
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:26,067
I just don't know if I could
bear to be alone tonight.

687
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:51,281
<i>My heart beats.</i>

688
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,847
<i>I take in the rich burnt smell of coffee.</i>

689
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:02,471
<i>Gail! She's reason enough to open my eyes.</i>

690
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:03,714
Can you hear me, Dwight?

691
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,478
The cops want you bad, Dwight.

692
00:49:07,592 --> 00:49:09,385
Really bad.

693
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:11,319
Don't worry.

694
00:49:11,427 --> 00:49:13,250
We'll fix you up

695
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,929
and when we do,

696
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:16,914
when you're all better,

697
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:19,850
I'll deck you for leaving in the first place!

698
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:21,850
I told you, you'd be back.

699
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,753
I told you.

700
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,487
You belong here.

701
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:27,651
Jerk!

702
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,410
I thought there was another world out there.

703
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:34,216
I thought I could be a part of it.

704
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,350
There's only Sin City.

705
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,925
Molly said you're ready to leave.

706
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:43,507
No, I'm staying.

707
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:44,713
Wrong answer.

708
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:46,202
Miho.

709
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:49,135
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

710
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,511
If she recognizes me,
she doesn't let it show.

711
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:54,380
Oh, you picked the
wrong neighborhood for your hideout.

712
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:57,120
Alive or dead, you're leaving.

713
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:59,118
I'm staying.

714
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:04,760
I don't think he can feel it, Miho.

715
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:06,687
Give it a twist.

716
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:13,458
You won't give with anymore lip about staying here, Miho will have to...exhale.

717
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,441
And that heart Molly worked so hard
to fix will just pop like a grape.

718
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:19,357
He's staying.

719
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:21,352
And if you're going to kill him,

720
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,862
you better kill me too,

721
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:26,175
even though he doesn't feel the same way about me.

722
00:50:26,964 --> 00:50:28,788
He's the only man I've ever loved.

723
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:32,514
<i>They all seem to be waiting
for the other shoe to drop</i>

724
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,786
<i>Gail drops it.</i>

725
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,585
It was dark in that alley, Miho.

726
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:40,441
When you were 15, you killed three of the thugs.

727
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,282
But the last two had the drop on you.

728
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:46,126
You were dead,

729
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:48,223
until someone appeared.

730
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:51,175
You never got a good look
at the man who saved you.

731
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,758
Take a look now.

732
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,422
I get more time

733
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:04,451
and more surgery.

734
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:09,275
Listen, there's only one person
that has anything to gain from snuffing Damien Lord

735
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,186
and you're too busy banging the broad to bring her in for questioning!

736
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:13,292
You don't know her.

737
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:17,655
You don't know anything about her
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you use that kind of language when you talk about her.

738
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:18,956
You're in love with her!

739
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:20,792
You stupid schmuck!

740
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:24,452
It's one thing to poke a babe on the side but you can't even think straight.

741
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:26,457
Shut the hell up!

742
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:28,590
I know what I'm doing.

743
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:31,418
I guess I should've told you everything.

744
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:34,322
You're damn right you should've.

745
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:39,157
He raped me.

746
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:42,795
He almost killed me.

747
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,632
That son of a bitch!

748
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:47,520
I thought I could reason with him but

749
00:51:47,736 --> 00:51:49,656
he was worse than ever.

750
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:51,592
His hands at my throat,

751
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:57,111
strangling me while he did what he needed to do.

752
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:03,763
He will kill me, kill me, kill me...

753
00:52:03,937 --> 00:52:04,897
I have only you.

754
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:05,898
I love you, Mort.

755
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:06,962
Keep me safe.

756
00:52:07,203 --> 00:52:10,723
Keep me, keep me, keep me...

757
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,498
Ava Lord.

758
00:52:14,604 --> 00:52:16,620
For once you missed my heart.

759
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:19,359
I'm healing quickly, Ava.

760
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,421
I'll be coming for you soon.

761
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:28,157
You know where he is and
you won't do a damn thing about it!

762
00:52:28,304 --> 00:52:30,832
You don't know what you're asking.

763
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:34,714
We have to wait for Old Town to give him up, it's the only way.

764
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:36,727
You're a Sin City cop.

765
00:52:36,806 --> 00:52:39,493
You've got a badge and a gun.
You've got power.

766
00:52:39,604 --> 00:52:40,564
Use it!

767
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:45,159
If you ever want to
have this woman again,

768
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:48,122
be a man. If you're a man...

769
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:49,908
kill him!

770
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,597
Don't move.

771
00:52:59,707 --> 00:53:01,563
McCarthy...

772
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,559
...you never tortured her.

773
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,556
<i>You two cooked that up.
You were her lover.</i>

774
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:08,432
You were a fool.

775
00:53:08,506 --> 00:53:11,290
The goddess takes no lover.

776
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,904
The goddess makes slaves of men.

777
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,184
<i>In an instant, she can see through the heart of you</i>

778
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:19,667
and transform to your deepest desire.

779
00:53:19,973 --> 00:53:22,790
To Damien Lord, she was the princess bride.

780
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,492
To you, a damsel in distress.

781
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:28,530
She devoured all of you.

782
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:30,560
You cannot defeat the goddess.

783
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:33,463
She cannot die.

784
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:36,197
You're as crazy as she is.

785
00:53:36,307 --> 00:53:41,107
If you were as rotten as her, I'd blow your brains out right now but I'm trying to be careful about who I kill

786
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:43,932
and all you did was pound the crap out of me.

787
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,602
You already paid an eye for that.

788
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:48,662
I'm letting you go with a warning.

789
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,733
Stay in bed.

790
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,400
Don't go back to work

791
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:56,361
and don't get in my way.

792
00:53:56,476 --> 00:53:58,460
<i>No, Ava, you're no goddess.</i>

793
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:00,334
<i>You're a witch.</i>

794
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:02,168
<i>A predator.</i>

795
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:05,090
<i>Maybe I only got what I deserved
but what about the others?</i>

796
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,162
<i>Good men driven mad.</i>

797
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:08,844
You really lost it.

798
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:10,704
Bad enough you leave your wife for that skank.

799
00:54:10,811 --> 00:54:12,667
You watch what you call her,
you son of a bitch.

800
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:14,599
Your throwing away your career.

801
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,662
Now you commit suicide,
you stupid shit!

802
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:20,623
I know what I'm doing, I'm going to Old Town and I'm going to nail this guy once and for all.

803
00:54:20,812 --> 00:54:23,596
If I have to go it alone, I will.

804
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:27,262
Do me a favor, turn the car around and you go back to the station.

805
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:28,435
You gotta come clean with the captain.

806
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:31,301
I'm a cop. I'm doing my job.

807
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,302
You've gotta ditch that dame!

808
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,306
That's enough!

809
00:54:34,944 --> 00:54:35,969
You won't talk about Ava!

810
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:37,908
Somebody's gotta set you straight.

811
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:39,899
You've gotta forget about
that stupid whore!

812
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:42,732
Turn the car around
or I'm turning you in!

813
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,574
I warned you.

814
00:54:44,778 --> 00:54:49,451
Everyday, I warned you
but you keep asking for it!

815
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:53,295
You're asking for it!
Well, here it is, pal!

816
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:55,173
Mort, No!

817
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,472
<i>A witch,</i>

818
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,242
<i>a predator,</i>

819
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:21,266
<i>destroying lives.</i>

820
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:23,847
<i>Sometimes for power,</i>

821
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,771
<i>sometimes for profit,</i>

822
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,700
<i>sometimes...for sport.</i>

823
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:31,732
<i>But now you're locked away in your mansion.</i>

824
00:55:31,848 --> 00:55:34,664
<i>A bird of prey in a guilded cage.</i>

825
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:36,801
<i>Are you ready to do something stupid?</i>

826
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:41,159
I'm so happy you chose to attend my little party Wallenquist.

827
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,698
Your invitation surprised me, Mrs. Lord.

828
00:55:44,848 --> 00:55:47,664
Your husband had no criminal associations.

829
00:55:47,816 --> 00:55:49,640
Believe me, I tried.

830
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,604
May I speak truthfully, Mr. Wallenquist?

831
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,442
Please.

832
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:55,437
Old Town is a thorn in your sight.

833
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:57,341
Indeed it is.

834
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,201
All those profits
in the hands of whores.

835
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,813
Surely you've wanted to put them in their place.

836
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:05,735
Make some adjustment
to the balance of power.

837
00:56:05,883 --> 00:56:07,866
Show them who rules Sin City.

838
00:56:07,983 --> 00:56:11,470
You have limited influence on me, Mrs. Lord.

839
00:56:11,683 --> 00:56:13,507
I haven't been doing so very badly.

840
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:17,360
But those two policemen, that was an embarassing blunder.

841
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:22,200
Yes, I'm out of my league.

842
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:26,132
I need a stronger, more experienced hand.

843
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:29,133
I need all enterprises joined...

844
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:35,492
in matrimony, with the experties and iron fist of a rich Wallenquist.

845
00:56:35,785 --> 00:56:39,593
What you need is the corpse of Dwight Mccarthy

846
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:44,391
and a suicide note which he confesses to the murder of Damien Lord.

847
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:48,200
And you need to show those
Old Town bitches who's boss.

848
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:50,880
Indeed, I do.

849
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:53,845
<i>There's a specialist in Texas.</i>

850
00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:55,906
<i>I could have him on a train tomorrow.</i>

851
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,716
<i>I'll brief him myself.</i>

852
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:00,539
<i>He'll be on your doorstep at midnight.</i>

853
00:57:00,653 --> 00:57:02,573
<i>And I'll be yours forever.</i>

854
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,606
<i>Pray for your soul, Ava.</i>

855
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,399
<i>This won't be his last to visit Sin City.</i>

856
00:57:09,454 --> 00:57:11,181
Good evening, Mr. Kelvar.

857
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:14,205
- I'll take your bag.
- Nobody touches my gear.

858
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:17,874
And I got somebody picking me up who's one hell of a lot cuter than you.

859
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:24,737
It was our understanding
that you would travel alone.

860
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:27,448
I'm full of surprises.

861
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,400
Shuffle that bootie
over to the shotgun side doll.

862
00:57:31,555 --> 00:57:32,547
I'm driving.

863
00:57:34,455 --> 00:57:37,175
- How about you?
- Mrs. Lord may not be pleased.

864
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:40,169
She's the one with the problem. I can always get back on the train.

865
00:57:58,456 --> 00:58:00,216
Wait here.

866
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,261
<i>Hurry back!</i>

867
00:58:02,457 --> 00:58:08,601
You know I get impatient. You know I get a little crazy when I get impatient.

868
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:13,537
Kruger, watch this woman.

869
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:17,649
Jacoby,

870
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:20,443
If this man moves, kill him.

871
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:27,055
Strictly  business.
My compliments to your surgeon,
Mr. McCarthy. Remarkable transformation...

872
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:30,883
But you still have the eyes,

873
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:33,712
the eyes of a dead man.

874
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,676
I hate being left alone.

875
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:45,290
When I'm alone, it makes me want to do all kinds of crazy things.

876
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:51,169
No woman should be left alone with a man like you.

877
00:58:52,992 --> 00:58:54,848
Do you want me...

878
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:58,641
To do something we shouldn't?

879
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,745
My lips are sealed.

880
00:59:05,661 --> 00:59:08,444
There's something I need in the trunk.

881
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:20,110
Bear witness.

882
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:25,773
Mrs. Lord, the specialist has arrived.

883
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:30,411
<i>The bathing thing with her was never about bathing.</i>

884
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:35,170
<i>It was always theater, or maybe it was retail.</i>

885
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:38,845
You can't make a sale without showing the goods.

886
00:59:38,994 --> 00:59:41,138
It's McCarthy.

887
01:00:10,864 --> 01:00:15,344
Do you mind if I say that you're twice the man I thought you were?

888
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:17,389
You're a warrior,

889
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,387
a killer.

890
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:25,033
You're everything I want of a man but I can never get the honesty out of you.

891
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:27,185
You could've been eveything that I needed.

892
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:30,814
You still could be, you're a new man!.

893
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:36,636
Remember what she did.
Remember what she is.

894
01:00:37,631 --> 01:00:39,616
Wait for your opening.

895
01:00:39,698 --> 01:00:43,315
Wait for Gail to do her bit.

896
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:46,419
When you're immune to me,
I'll let you know.

897
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:50,240
Step back Mistress, let me kill him.

898
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:53,859
Please...

899
01:00:54,899 --> 01:00:56,723
...do.

900
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:17,317
Six shots, without a single head wound.

901
01:02:29,905 --> 01:02:32,688
Then it all gets down
to speed and luck.

902
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:45,449
Her eyes are wet and full of love.

903
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:03,693
I never dream,

904
01:03:03,806 --> 01:03:06,590
you're everything I've ever wanted,

905
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:09,397
everything I need...

906
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:12,420
...you and me, forever.

907
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,973
It's over.

908
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:21,644
Pain has set you free. You're not good anymore, Dwight. You're more like me.

909
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,895
Be like me.

910
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:29,512
Let the old Dwight go.
Let it go, this old face.

911
01:03:29,774 --> 01:03:33,294
She pulls close and I've got to look.

912
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:37,314
And all I want is to be lost in the sight and sound and smell of her.

913
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:41,158
- I can't think straight.
- We can be free.

914
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:47,512
- We can be happy, together, forever.
- No...

915
01:03:47,896 --> 01:03:50,871
Her kiss is a promise of paradise.

916
01:03:56,609 --> 01:04:00,417
- Dwight...
- The gun barks and bucks in my hand.

917
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:06,863
Life leaves Ava, with a sigh.

918
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:14,620
Sirens climb the hill , we'll take the backroads,

919
01:04:14,877 --> 01:04:17,532
the old bootlegged roads,

920
01:04:17,643 --> 01:04:19,532
They'll never catch us

921
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:22,561
I'm going home.

922
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:43,550
A walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything.

923
01:04:46,644 --> 01:04:49,429
I was told I could find a man here by the name of Mr.Kroenig.

924
01:04:54,013 --> 01:04:55,966
That's doctor Kroenig.

925
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:58,199
to you.

926
01:04:58,279 --> 01:04:59,785
Yes, sir.

927
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:07,305
License or no license, these hands still got what it takes once I'm prepped.

928
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:10,569
How much you got?

929
01:05:14,379 --> 01:05:18,123
Forty bucks you got?
Forty bucks worth you get!

930
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:31,532
Steady as a rock...

931
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:35,168
...once I'm prepped.

932
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,463
Forty bucks got you that bullet.

933
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:03,152
but that hand of yours,
a lot of bones need help.

934
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:07,798
I'll give you an hour,
for your shoes.

935
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:09,841
Take them.

936
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:20,294
I did my best to think about winning, revenge.

937
01:06:21,485 --> 01:06:27,724
The old man must have liked popsicles, he uses the sticks for splints. He licks them first.

938
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:38,420
Not so much of a goddamn thank.
Generosity dont count for shit in this day
and age!

939
01:06:40,718 --> 01:06:42,542
Quite a job he did on me, Roark.

940
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:44,605
Even my shoes.

941
01:06:45,486 --> 01:06:47,469
There's nothing more you can take,

942
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,346
except...

943
01:06:49,453 --> 01:06:52,845
Marcie, the girl.

944
01:06:53,285 --> 01:06:54,950
Oh my Christ.

945
01:06:57,086 --> 01:06:58,782
Marcie.

946
01:06:59,887 --> 01:07:02,735
Oh, Marcie, you weren't a part of this.

947
01:07:02,854 --> 01:07:06,342
You were just there to
throw them off their game.

948
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,441
What have I dragged you into?

949
01:07:10,587 --> 01:07:14,843
This has turned into one long, bad night.

950
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:19,266
The windows not locked.

951
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:22,876
Never a good sign.

952
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:26,810
Not in Sin City.

953
01:07:29,721 --> 01:07:31,577
Look who decided to show up.

954
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:34,380
Give the man a hand.

955
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:39,923
Give the man another hand.

956
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:50,536
Run penniless, friendless and forgotten.

957
01:07:51,722 --> 01:07:54,507
You really be better off dead, Johnny.

958
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:05,239
But I like you just the way you are.

959
01:08:12,858 --> 01:08:14,649
I got cocky.

960
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,509
I got cocky and I got Marcie dead.

961
01:08:18,457 --> 01:08:20,281
Damn it, Johnny.

962
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:22,309
Hate yourself when you get the time.

963
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:25,310
Think about tonight's game.

964
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,823
That's all that matters now.

965
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:32,566
And all you need is money, just one lousy buck would be enough to get you started.

966
01:08:44,392 --> 01:08:45,449
Hello, ma'am.

967
01:08:45,525 --> 01:08:49,141
I don't have the money to pay but could I ask you for a glass of water?

968
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,316
Yeah.

969
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,856
Time's are tough all over.

970
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,852
Thank you.

971
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,520
What's with the hand?

972
01:09:04,594 --> 01:09:06,481
I beat the wrong guy at cards.

973
01:09:06,594 --> 01:09:08,385
Tough break.

974
01:09:10,427 --> 01:09:12,027
Thank you very much.

975
01:09:12,393 --> 01:09:14,217
Just a second, you.

976
01:09:15,927 --> 01:09:20,696
You don't stink of anything I don't like and you kinda remind me of an old boyfriend, okay?

977
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,547
This won't take you very far.

978
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,212
Sweetheart, it's going to
take me to the moon.

979
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:37,242
Sin City, you never know.

980
01:09:40,295 --> 01:09:42,792
Don't spend it all in one place.

981
01:09:50,796 --> 01:09:54,380
Hey, handsome, what are you gonna do with all that?

982
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,289
I'm going to kill Roark.

983
01:09:57,395 --> 01:10:00,180
That Roark there, don't die easy.

984
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,281
I just might surprise you.

985
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:11,615
Looks like something happened to your game hand, son.

986
01:10:23,498 --> 01:10:25,225
I fold.

987
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:27,186
What's wrong, hotshot?

988
01:10:27,297 --> 01:10:29,955
Not good without that lady luck
you brought here last time?

989
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,694
I'll be fine.

990
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:35,782
<i>- I'm done.
- I'm out.</i>

991
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,324
I need three.

992
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:51,994
<i>Dealer takes two.</i>

993
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:54,209
<i>- Check.
- Check.</i>

994
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:56,890
I bet a hundred.

995
01:10:58,833 --> 01:10:59,889
Shit!

996
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,628
Fold.

997
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,120
Just not the same without your game hand, is it?

998
01:11:23,002 --> 01:11:25,561
I'm ambidextrous.

999
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:27,660
<i>Cut.</i>

1000
01:11:34,601 --> 01:11:36,265
<i>Check.</i>

1001
01:11:36,368 --> 01:11:37,296
<i>Check.</i>

1002
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,358
Five hundred.

1003
01:11:39,401 --> 01:11:40,939
<i>I'm in.</i>

1004
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:47,693
I'll raise you...

1005
01:11:48,936 --> 01:11:50,728
...five hundred more.

1006
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,526
<i>- I fold.
- I'm done.</i>

1007
01:11:58,903 --> 01:12:01,462
<i>- Here is your five more, pretty boy.
- Shit!</i>

1008
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:08,716
I favored your mother, she was a whore, not a very good one.

1009
01:12:09,837 --> 01:12:10,989
She was an angel.

1010
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:13,827
I'm all in.

1011
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,263
Call.

1012
01:12:37,005 --> 01:12:38,765
Four aces.

1013
01:12:45,673 --> 01:12:47,529
See, I told you, I never lose.

1014
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:51,363
I beat you,

1015
01:12:51,472 --> 01:12:54,897
twice, that means I'm better than you are

1016
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,223
and everybody knows it

1017
01:12:56,272 --> 01:12:58,866
'cause I beat you again every time somebody tells that story

1018
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,758
and they'll all say they won't tell it but they will.

1019
01:13:01,907 --> 01:13:07,315
That's the story that will be told again and again until you're dead and long after you're dead.

1020
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,532
I beat you forever.

1021
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:13,326
And they all know what happens when you do.

1022
01:13:14,342 --> 01:13:16,037
Say hello to your mama.

1023
01:13:16,307 --> 01:13:18,291
She always was a stupid bitch.

1024
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:25,825
<i>Power is as power does.</i>

1025
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:30,621
If i could give any young man advice, it would be this, wear a rubber.

1026
01:13:30,808 --> 01:13:34,360
Now take out that trash,
let's get back to the game!

1027
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:56,528
JOHN HARTIGAN

1028
01:13:57,743 --> 01:14:01,327
I can't lose you, not again.

1029
01:14:01,511 --> 01:14:03,398
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1030
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:13,691
<i>All this time, she..was right there.</i>

1031
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:15,798
<i>Dancing in the club where you play poker.</i>

1032
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:19,654
<i>You gotta have been looking for a chance to put this one through the ringer, senator.</i>

1033
01:14:21,745 --> 01:14:24,433
Nancy Callahan.

1034
01:14:26,612 --> 01:14:30,163
My son, Ethan was killed because of her.

1035
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:34,823
It's been 4 years now and still, she's planting flowers at Hartigan's grave.

1036
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:37,766
She's showing gratitude from the looks of it to the cop.

1037
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:39,767
Gratitude to the cop,

1038
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:42,534
who ripped your son to pieces.

1039
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:46,530
Hartigan turned my son into a freak.

1040
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:50,231
Now, completely as a freak

1041
01:14:50,413 --> 01:14:52,301
but I hardly blame the young lady for...

1042
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,404
...obsession.

1043
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,336
It's nothing more than a little fluff sorrow.

1044
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:57,847
It might not be that simple.

1045
01:14:58,346 --> 01:15:01,835
Somehow she got her hands on Hartigan's old pistol.

1046
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,628
She hits the range every night just before work.

1047
01:15:09,747 --> 01:15:11,603
She's become quite a good shot.

1048
01:15:11,714 --> 01:15:16,129
And I can only imagine whose face she sees on that target.

1049
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:19,210
I'm listening.

1050
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,226
She's been acting kinda crazy sometimes, at work.

1051
01:15:22,349 --> 01:15:25,547
She's drinking, just for the past few weeks.

1052
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:27,638
She never drank before.

1053
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:33,364
It's all like, she's building up to something.

1054
01:15:35,048 --> 01:15:37,896
Maybe, building her...nerve.

1055
01:15:38,349 --> 01:15:40,781
That will be all, lieutenant.

1056
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:43,763
This little bitch is turning me on.

1057
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:53,305
This place stinks.

1058
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,982
I never use to notice.

1059
01:15:56,449 --> 01:15:58,401
not when I danced.

1060
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,834
Now I smell everything.

1061
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:05,740
I see it all.

1062
01:16:06,017 --> 01:16:09,537
Every damn thing.

1063
01:16:09,718 --> 01:16:11,606
I know exactly where I am.

1064
01:16:11,684 --> 01:16:13,669
I know exactly what I am.

1065
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:17,271
I don't use the stripper logic anymore,

1066
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:20,427
that they're losers and I'm not.

1067
01:16:21,317 --> 01:16:25,157
It was when I couldn't shoot at him
that I realized I was dead,

1068
01:16:25,985 --> 01:16:29,697
that I wasn't a woman with a plan.

1069
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:34,733
I was just a drunk...

1070
01:16:46,485 --> 01:16:49,269
I give them what they want

1071
01:16:54,814 --> 01:16:57,119
and I get the hell outta there.

1072
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:21,004
<i>You shot him in the gut.</i>

1073
01:17:27,622 --> 01:17:33,157
<i>...rotten town, it soots anybody it touches.</i>

1074
01:17:33,387 --> 01:17:39,052
it is a rotten town
but it can't corrupt its soil.

1075
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:44,835
It's soil to you, John Hartigan.

1076
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:50,594
Put that bottle down, Nancy.
You've had enough.

1077
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:59,021
They made you lie to me,
you're not even here right now.

1078
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:04,903
- You said you'd never leave me.
- I never left you.

1079
01:18:05,124 --> 01:18:07,780
I never would.

1080
01:18:07,924 --> 01:18:09,780
Never.

1081
01:18:09,858 --> 01:18:14,626
You're not even here right now.
You're dead!

1082
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:18,536
You blew your brains out.

1083
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:25,221
You stuck a gun in your mouth
and you blew your brains out.

1084
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:31,931
I had my reasons, there was no way out.

1085
01:18:32,325 --> 01:18:35,813
I hate you!

1086
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:42,493
- You swore you'd always love me.
- And I always will.

1087
01:18:42,692 --> 01:18:49,253
<i>No one has ever really guessed what hell is.
It's watching the people you love...</i>

1088
01:18:49,526 --> 01:18:52,918
<i>...in pain.</i>

1089
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:03,505
You're the only man I ever loved

1090
01:19:03,894 --> 01:19:07,445
and you left me alone.

1091
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:17,907
You never thought I'd stand a chance with that goddamn son of Roark.

1092
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:20,918
You didn't believe in me.

1093
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:27,592
You didn't think a little piece of ass like me could take down the most powerful man in the state.

1094
01:19:33,629 --> 01:19:37,277
Maybe I'll prove both of you wrong.

1095
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:46,752
Maybe I'll go crazy.

1096
01:19:51,696 --> 01:19:56,336
- Crazy is sounding pretty good right now.
- I love you, Nancy.

1097
01:20:11,898 --> 01:20:19,322
<i>You little slut!
Your gonna scream before you die.</i>

1098
01:20:21,565 --> 01:20:24,413
You're out of your mind...

1099
01:20:24,598 --> 01:20:31,062
I appreciate the obsession
but you've got nothing...

1100
01:20:31,366 --> 01:20:37,638
You could've killed me 50 times
if you had the nerve but you don't.

1101
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:43,486
You're nothing...

1102
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:50,225
You'll scream,
just like my boy wanted you to...

1103
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,953
Darling, where have you been and
what have you done to your beautiful hair?

1104
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:16,846
Don't worry, those bastards are
getting what they want.

1105
01:21:17,068 --> 01:21:19,852
They always get what they want.

1106
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:47,582
This is great, isn't it?
What's up with you?

1107
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:01,110
Something's wrong, I'm out of here.

1108
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:17,370
Oh, what a place, it's getting nasty,
I'm taking a hike.

1109
01:22:41,605 --> 01:22:44,453
<i>Your beautiful Nancy, Don't do this to yourself.</i>

1110
01:22:45,672 --> 01:22:49,352
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

1111
01:22:52,373 --> 01:22:56,757
If a man did that to you,
I'd tear him to pieces.

1112
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:02,480
Lieutenant Hartigan,
you just gave me a great idea.

1113
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:11,421
No baby, Nancy...

1114
01:23:40,341 --> 01:23:43,863
Just give me a damn name.

1115
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:51,725
Roark.

1116
01:23:58,543 --> 01:24:02,383
Roark has lots of thugs,
we need tools.

1117
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:09,861
Looks like trouble.

1118
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:15,661
Looks like Christmas.

1119
01:24:22,512 --> 01:24:25,326
We're ripping this place a new asshole.

1120
01:24:25,443 --> 01:24:28,901
Move or die!

1121
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:19,905
I hope you don't mind me saying this, but...

1122
01:25:20,848 --> 01:25:22,832
you look hot.

1123
01:25:51,616 --> 01:25:54,433
There's no reason to leave anybody alive.

1124
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:59,223
Nobody's innocent.
We can't leave anybody alive to talk.

1125
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:04,762
Don't go soft on me, kid.
Don't leave anybody breathing.

1126
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:10,591
I won't. I'll work the perimeter
and nail the guards.

1127
01:26:10,784 --> 01:26:14,496
Baby, you're a natural.
I'll work the inside.

1128
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:17,438
How will I know when you're in?

1129
01:26:17,551 --> 01:26:20,399
You'll have a pretty good idea.

1130
01:28:31,027 --> 01:28:33,778
Damn thing misfired on me.

1131
01:28:33,927 --> 01:28:38,663
I nearly got them all but this
piece of shit over here, he came up on me.

1132
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:43,404
This piece of crap...
I think I'm almost done.

1133
01:28:43,593 --> 01:28:45,577
Here.

1134
01:28:45,692 --> 01:28:48,445
Take a seat.

1135
01:28:54,327 --> 01:28:56,983
You're a peach.

1136
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:04,610
I got this.

1137
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:27,784
You clever, clever little whore.

1138
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:31,544
I can't believe you made it this far.

1139
01:29:33,695 --> 01:29:37,408
Your Hartigan blew my son's pecker off.

1140
01:29:37,629 --> 01:29:42,910
So...where shall I shoot you next?

1141
01:29:45,096 --> 01:29:48,744
That tight little belly of yours?

1142
01:29:48,997 --> 01:29:55,365
I'm holding a gun on you, young lady.
The rules are, you pretend there's
a chance that I won't shoot you.

1143
01:30:05,363 --> 01:30:08,980
I told you, you would scream before you die.

1144
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:12,789
I owe it to my son.

1145
01:30:14,965 --> 01:30:24,368
Frankly, between you and me,
I finally accepted that...Ethan is not...presidential material.

1146
01:30:25,464 --> 01:30:29,946
I had a hard time buying him
an election in an insane asylum.

1147
01:30:33,133 --> 01:30:36,813
but he was my son, honey.

1148
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,748
He was my son.

1149
01:30:41,934 --> 01:30:48,205
And now, he's going to hear you scream.

1150
01:30:51,432 --> 01:30:54,281
Scream...

1151
01:31:21,401 --> 01:31:24,922
This is for John Hartigan, fucker!

1152
01:31:27,969 --> 01:31:33,217
This rotten town, it soils everybody...
