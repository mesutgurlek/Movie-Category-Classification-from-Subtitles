170
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,709
You were never around for me. Fine.

171
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,379
I have no plans to be around for you.

172
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,882
Kate....

173
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,218
Wait a minute. Wait.

174
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,804
You're lying, aren't you?

175
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,430
No.

176
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,976
Are you active again?
Is that why you're here now?

177
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,395
No.

178
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,273
I don't believe you.

179
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,570
Oh, Christ!

180
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,613
Father, what have you done?

181
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,299
Christy Sullivan?

182
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,550
EXAMINER:
Wife of Walter.

183
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,928
Most likely came home,
stumbled onto a burglary.

184
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,640
Some burglary.
I wish my carpets were this clean.

185
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,018
I couldn't find a single
decent fingerprint.

186
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,438
-Are you serious, Laura?
-It's like Mary Poppins was here.

187
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,856
Where's Mr. Sullivan?

188
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,107
Sorry, Seth.

189
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,986
The entire Sullivan household went
to Barbados two days ago.

190
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,655
Thanks for your support.

191
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,866
Oh, no, wait. It gets worse.

192
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,576
The shots came from here.

193
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,621
If she stumbled on a burglary,
she should've been here.

194
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,956
But she was killed
exactly where she is.

195
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,876
See, the blood patterns indicate that.

196
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,004
What is she doing here?

197
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:04,137
Looks like someone sat here,
but I couldn't find any prints.

198
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,558
So you think old man Sullivan
holed up in this chair...

199
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,810
...and watched his wife perform?

200
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,730
God, I hope not.

201
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,858
For his sake.
You know, he's such a great man.

202
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,611
Be careful digging that out.

203
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,863
Looks like he tried to strangle her.

204
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,408
Then he went to the door
to shoot her from behind?

205
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,662
He also inspected her vagina.

206
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,958
He did what?

207
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,417
Why?

208
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,087
Maybe he didn't remember
that he did her.

209
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,760
A strong burglar with a weak mind.

210
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,888
Obviously, it's another
open-and-shut case.

things off for the Cougars.

The kick.... Nice kick.

215
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,443
Kirby, back to receive,
takes the ball at the 12-yard line.

216
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,445
He's got a wedge in front of him.

217

-One man to beat.

I took the staff,
always do this time of year.

Your wife didn't come with you.

236
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,395
Well, she was.

237
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,230
Had it all planned.

238
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,566
But you know women.

239

She changed her mind.

240
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,907
I'd been married
to my Rebecca for 47 years.

241
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,618
When she died...

242
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,789
...I decided I never wanted
that pain again.

243
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,751
One thing I knew about Christy...

244
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,463
...she was going to outlive me.

I think that's enough for today.

Sir, I have to ask you about the vault.

247
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,973
You mean, the contents
of the vault, of course.

248
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,812
Sandy, you go on.

-No, really.

I'm all right.
You go on to the reception.

Obviously, I can't make it.

I'm sure everyone will understand.

253
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,201
You don't mean the contents.

No.

255
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,537
You mean the chair.

256
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,249
You must ask about the chair.

257

Yes, sir. I do.

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,087
Why? Are they connected?

259
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,634
Someone may have been sitting in it
and may have been involved in the murder.

260

I have the deepest respect for you.
I'm sorry to have to do this.

I promise you, none of this
will make my highlight reel.

Well, I hoped I could satisfy her.

263
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,816
But, you know...

264
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,110
...she had needs.

265
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,072
She didn't want to go behind my back.

266
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,409
She suggested the chair.

267
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,163
She hoped I might get
to like sitting there.

268
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,040
I didn't.

269

00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,574
I agree.

332
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,660
I apologize for my behavior.
Won't happen again.

333
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,413
Consider it a blip on the screen.

334
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,957
As far as I'm concerned,
that's all he is too.

335
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,503
He could be a little more than that, Alan.

336
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,046
He saw.

337
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:44,383
He saw nothing. He saw a drunk woman
who liked rough sex too much.

338
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,428
He's a burglar.
Who's gonna believe him?

339
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,765
After all, it's not as if
he has any evidence or anything.

340
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,380
ALAN [ON RECORDING]: He's a burglar.
Who's gonna believe him?

341
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,591
After all, it's not as if
he has any evidence or anything.

342

[TEAKETTLE WHISTLES]

343
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,703
Boy, you always did
disappear good, Luther.

344
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,206
What you're trying to say is
I have a weak face, right?

345
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,292
No, I'm saying you're lucky is all.

346
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,879
Some of my customers,
no matter what I do, they still stand out.

347
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,131
How many passports you want?

348
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,467
Four ought to do the trick.

349
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,429
You want different looks, matching
international driver's licenses.

350
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,223
Since it's you, I'll throw in
some dummy credit cards.

351
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,601
How are the rugs I made you
holding up?

352
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,604
Good. The mustaches
and the beards also.

353
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,523
Well, we try to give quality
for our money.

354
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,777
You leaving the country for permanent?

355
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,904
That could be, yeah.

356
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:15,701
Does it matter where you've been?
I hate doing Asian passport stamps.

357
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,286
No. Make it European.

358
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,707
Caribbean in the wintertime.
How long is all this gonna take?

359
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,670
It usually takes some time.
For you, I'll rush it.

360
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,340
You were always dependable, Valerie.

361
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,759
Listen, Luther...

362
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,261
...I don't wanna know what you're into.

363
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,557
I do, but I'm not gonna ask you.
But leaving the country forever....

364
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,351
What is it?

365
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,145
I just never figured you for a runner.

366
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,983
Thirty percent of my runners
kill themselves within five years.

367
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,905
Right now, five years
doesn't sound too bad.

368
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,783
Take care.

369
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,661
See you.

370
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,998
SETH:
Okay, see if this makes any sense.

371
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,291
I am Christy Sullivan.

372
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,253
I come in the bedroom
and I surprise a burglar.

373
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:12,216
Okay. Okay, now you're the burglar
coming out of the vault being surprised.

374
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,552
Gold star. I draw my gun. Boom.

375
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,596
Then why bother to strangle her
when you could just shoot?

376
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,225
Why do I bother to strip her
and put her clothes back on?

377
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,102
There, I can help you out.

378
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,939
You used to be a dry cleaner
and you love beautiful clothes.

379
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,692
Thanks a lot.
And you dress her because....

380
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:34,321
She was a good customer and you didn't
want her embarrassed when police came.

381
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,743
She had a 0.21 blood-alcohol level.
Not that that makes any difference.

382
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,536
She didn't drive.

383
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,123
The chauffeurs, they keep
exact mileage on these cars.

384
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,417
They haven't been driven
since they went to Barbados.

385
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,545
I checked every cab and limo service
in the area. Nobody knows a thing.

386
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,007
Somebody drove her home. Who?

387
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,967
Why haven't they come forward?

388
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,845
Maybe because whoever drove her
home killed her.

389
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,684
Maybe. I love this case.

390
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,019
REPAIRMAN:
Lieutenant?

391
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,105
Sorry to bother you,
but the phone problems?

392
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,024
-I just took care of them.
-Thank you.

393
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,693
Just part of the job.

394
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:17,281
I hate people who say that.
It's not part-- It is your fucking job.

395
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,867
Remember the bullet hole in the wall?

396
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,160
-Yeah.
-Guess what.

397
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,578
No slug.

398
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,582
Why take a slug out of the wall
when there's one stuck in her head?

399
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,751
Different from the one in her body?

400
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,505
Two different guns means two burglars.

401
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,756
Two guys broke in?

402
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,217
They both went out the window?
Bullshit.

403
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,305
By the way, why did he or they
go out the window in the first place...

404
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:45,351
...when he or they got in by breaking
a zillion-dollar security system?

405
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,977
OFFICER: Hey, Seth.
-Yeah?

406
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,855
Bill Burton from the Secret Service
in the parking lot.

407
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,984
Thanks, Bob.
What's he doing in the parking lot?

408
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,702
BILL:
Bill Burton. Hi.

409
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,705
Hi. Seth Frank.
To what do I owe the honor?

410
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,457
I know you must be going crazy...

411
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,544
...but the boss is very interested
about your progress.

412
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,587
Maybe we could help each other out.

413
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,464
What do you have in mind?

414
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,300
Well, you know how close
he and Sullivan are.

415
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,718
Right.

416
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:26,267
The minute anything breaks,
if you call me, I'd tell the president.

417
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,853
He'd be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan.

418
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,479
-It'd mean a lot to him.
-Okay.

419
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,816
Any red tape you want cut, done.

420
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,735
Here's my numbers.

421
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,363
Any leads?

422
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,740
We're still trying to figure out
what happened.

423
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,994
-I love playing Sherlock Holmes.
-You guys do that?

424
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,997
I was a state trooper
before the government got me.

425
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,207
Wait. You're that Bill Burton?

426
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,503
-I was younger and dumber then.
-I was younger. I'm dumber now.

427
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,338
Keep in touch.

428
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,576
SULLIVAN:
My chef makes them especially for me.

429
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,454
I promise you, they're sinful.

430
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,582
McCARTY:
You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan.

431
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,336
SULLIVAN:
This is a new arena for me.

432
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,590
But from what I'm told,
you have a flawless reputation.

433
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,010
Which is why I need to employ you,
Mr. McCarty.

434
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,220
Understood.

435
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,473
I don't know who it is I'm after yet.

436
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,225
Until I do...

437
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,936
...you'll have to wait in Washington
for instructions.

438
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,398
Afraid that's out of the question.

439
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,360
Mine is not creative work.

440
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,238
I only do it because I enjoy
living beyond my means.

441
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,490
I can't afford to just sit around.

442
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,787
My father died
when I was 10 years old.

443
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,165
He was a miner.
He died of lung disease.

444
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,502
I became rich at 25.

445
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:20,172
The first thing I did was buy
that mine, close it down...

446
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,551
...and give every miner
$50,000 to retire on.

447
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,432
You will wait in Washington,
Mr. McCarty.

448
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,979
And I will put
1 million dollars' expenses...

449
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,231
...in a Swiss bank of your choosing.

450
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,858
And when the time comes...

451
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,528
...2 million dollars a bullet.

452
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,782
You are a salesman, sir.

453
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,704
Selling sin is easy.

454
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,838
LAURA: Who is he?
-It's Luther Whitney...

455
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,549
...one of the great thieves of the world.

456
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,760
I've been going nuts.
I was up all night.

457
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,515
I remembered your notion
how maybe it was two burglars.

458
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,227
Around dawn, I thought,
"What if it's not two burglars...

459
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,605
...but just one guy trying
to make it look like two?"

460
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,526
I called my buddy at the Bureau.
They keep track.

461
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,488
There's only half a dozen guys alive
who could've pulled off the Sullivan job.

462
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,365
I've been tracing all six.

463
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,617
Whitney's the only guy that lives here.

464
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:35,372
-So why is it I never heard of him?
-He hasn't been arrested in 30 years.

465
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,375
So, what's this? His graduation
picture from Harvard?

466
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,628
That's ancient history.
He was just a punk, part of a gang.

467
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,380
Three-time loser.

468
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,090
Since he got out last the last time...

469
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,134
...no one's touched him.

470
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:52,306
When something big comes up,
they question him, but nothing ever sticks.

471
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,101
Oh, Seth. We can make this stick.

472
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,395
I bet you this is our guy.

473
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:01,357
He's a local.
You can't ask for anything more.

474
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,151
Yeah, well, we got a problem.

475
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,486
What?

476
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,697
He hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.

477
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:10,991
Korea.

478
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,659
So what? He's a veteran.

479
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,121
Not just a veteran,
he's a wounded veteran.

480
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,207
I got his war record here.

481
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,586
Battles, commendations,
decorations up the kazoo.

482
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,589
He lives alone on his disability.

483
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,092
That's what he says anyway.

484
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,388
But I just don't see this guy as a killer.
He's just a great thief.

485
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,307
And besides, I don't do war heroes.

486
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,272
LUTHER:
Boy, you must be smart.

487
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,066
Pardon me?

488
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,154
It usually takes you guys
a week to get to me.

489
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,032
Oh, Seth Frank.

490
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:37,453
I recognize your picture
from the newspaper.

491
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,329
Luther Whitney.

492
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,623
Nice to meet you.

493
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,668
LUTHER:
Would you like a signed confession now...

494
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,212
...or would you like to have
a little coffee first?

495
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:52,259
SETH: Before I send you away for life,
I should probably check out your alibi.

496
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,263
I was watching a football game
with an old friend of mine, Red Bransford.

497
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,724
He owns a saloon here in town.

498
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,477
You can ask me about the game.

499
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,520
I could be lying.

500
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,231
You been following the case?

501
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,649
Yeah, I have.

502
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,776
I love true crime.

503
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,780
FBI says there's only a few guys
who could have handled this job.

504
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,450
I got a list here. You're on it.

505
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,535
How I wish it were true.

506
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,166
This person, they go in the front door...

507
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,503
...and out a window, and down a rope
in the middle of the night?

508
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:33,759
Now, if I could do something like that,
I'd be the star of my AARP meetings.

509
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,972
-What's that? The American--
-Association of Retired Persons.

510
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,769
Luther, why was this so difficult?

511
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,147
You want me to help you
solve your case?

512
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,024
Just looking for insight.

513
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,651
How would you--?

514
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,029
Scratch that.
How would one go about it?

515
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,698
What kind of person
should I be looking for?

516
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,537
Well, except for the rope trick,
an older person, like me.

517
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,372
Because?

518
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,874
Well, you need patience.

519
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,419
The secret is research, research
and research. I've read that.

520
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,421
What kind of research?

521
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,718
Well, from what I saw on the tube,
this is a rather large home.

522
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,346
Must be an architectural office.

523
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,599
You'd go to the library,
go through public records...

524
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,311
...find out where that architectural
office is and break in.

525
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,065
And then you xerox the plans
and get them back by morning.

526
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,276
Why not just steal them?

527
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,112
Anyone can break into an office,
but breaking in...

528
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,615
...without having people know
you were there, that's the trick.

529
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,326
Then there's the general contractor.

530
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,037
And then there's the security company.

531
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:49,209
Do you realize the skill of breaking
the security of a security company?

532
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,170
I don't know how those guys do it.

533
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,341
Why go to all that trouble, Luther?

534
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,929
There's a vault in the house.
There must be a secret way into it.

535
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,181
Yeah, there was.
That's what I don't get.

536
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,142
How do you mean?

537
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,645
This guy obviously did
the research you're talking about.

538
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,731
So why does he take a crowbar...

539
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,192
...to open up this vault when
there's a clicker sitting right there?

540
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,402
A clicker?

541
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,655
Well, a gizmo, like a VCR remote.

542
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,452
Sounds amazing to me.

543
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,623
Must've been a lot
of valuables in that vault.

544
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,087
Close to 5 million total value.

545
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,507
Is that funny?

546
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,968
Why do I feel like
you're trying to surprise me?

547
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,511
I was trying to surprise you.

548
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,680
LUTHER: Thank you.
WAITRESS: You're welcome.

549
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,434
There you go again.

550
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,774
Would the burglar use a disguise?

551
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,567
Yeah, he might.

552
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,029
You gotta get with the program
if you're gonna catch this guy.

553
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,075
It is a guy, we think, anyway.
Some sort of a loner? Weirdo?

554
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,618
Maybe like you.

555
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,331
Well, I'd be the perfect
prototype, actually.

556
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,126
Except you see a person's face around
long enough and put things together.

557
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,463
That's why these top guys
have disguises.

558
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,092
Some of them, I even understand,
become makeup experts...

559
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,302
...hire wigmakers and things like that.

560
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,013
Why don't you go on
about the wigmakers?

561
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,015
Well, I would.

562
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,559
I've gotta go have
my pacemaker checked.

563
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,229
It's been so exciting talking to you.

564
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,400
A, you don't have a pacemaker.
And B, I'll be back tomorrow.

565
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,404
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

566
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,991
Goodbye.

567
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,082
Pacemaker, my ass.

568
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,895
Oh, Katie.

569
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,607
You gotta start eating
better than this, darling.

570
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,071
ALAN: I'm having this
press conference here...

571
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,242
...because it is here,
at this courthouse...

572
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,622
...that Christine Sullivan's killer
will be tried for his crime.

573
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,167
As you know, I came from
an impoverished family...

574
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,545
...in an impoverished town.

575
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,423
We lived with our doors...

576
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,300
...unlocked.

577
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,845
We all lock our doors now.

578
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,807
-That's not what concerns me.
-A ginger ale.

579
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,309
We are also locking our hearts.

580
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,977
And could you turn that off?

581
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,188
-That is the sadness.
-In a second.

582
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,606
That...

583
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,191
...is the loss.

584
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,778
We are locking our hearts
to the cries of the weary.

585
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,447
We are locking our hearts...

586
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,116
...to the poor and their pain.

587
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,452
Sisters and brothers...

588
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,372
...we are locking our hearts
to ourselves.

589
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,127
Turn it back on.

590
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,922
-But you just said--
-I know, but turn it on.

591
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:13,390
We feel that savagery and violence
must be allowed a place at table.

592
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,559
That is wrong. That is not America.

593
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,144
I shall fight that battle.

594
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,938
Dear friend...

595
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,023
...old friend...

596
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,237
...we shall fight that battle.

597
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,327
Who can explain the ways of chance?

598
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,247
If we had not met...

599
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,749
...I would not be president today.

600
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,211
If Christine had not taken ill...

601
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,423
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

602
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,759
Walter, you've been like a father to me.

603
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,433
I would give the world
to lessen your pain.

604
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,159
Thank you.

605
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,997
You heartless whore.

606
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,377
I'm not about to run from you.

607
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:31,593
Thomas Jefferson used
the Green Room as a dining room.

608
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,012
The walls are covered with green silk...

609
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,140
...just as they were
when James Monroe was president.

610
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,685
Many valuable objects
and paintings in this room.

611
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,812
We'll be moving on to the Blue Room.

612
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,233
James Hoban built
the Blue Room as an oval...

613
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,819
...to please President Washington.

614
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,989
During the holidays,
the chandelier is removed...

615
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,701
...and the White House Christmas tree
stands in the middle of the room.

616
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,372
The view from the window
includes the Jefferson Memorial.

617
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,958
We'll be moving on to the Red Room.

618
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,547
The walls of the Red Room
are covered with red silk.

619
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:13,343
Many musical gatherings took place here
back in the 19th century.

620
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:18,306
He was in the building.
He took a guided tour.

621
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,940
I've never dealt with blackmail before.

622
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:30,902
BILL: He doesn't want money.
-Oh, you're a mind reader too now.

623
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,613
No, I just looked on the back.

624
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,740
See?

625
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,659
"I don't want money."

626
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,537
This guy sure has the guts of a burglar.
Wish we had him.

627
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,580
Finished your recruiting speech?

628
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,918
Because I'd like to know
how I handle this.

629
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,462
Like you handled the letter opener?

630
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,221
Gee, Bill...

631
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,102
...that could be construed as criticism.

632
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,064
You really want me for an enemy?

633
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,776
Ms. Russell, I should've called the police
that night but I was weak.

634
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,779
You convinced me to stay silent.
I regret that.

635
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,823
Know this:

636
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,827
Every time I see your face,
I wanna rip your throat out.

637
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,502
Fine.

638
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,090
You win the pissing contest.

639
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,687
What do I do?

640
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,147
Nothing.

641
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:52,859
Because he's making a terrible mistake.
He thinks he has time. He doesn't.

642
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,862
Seth Frank's too good.

He was in jail. When he got out,
my mother and I went to live by ourselves.

I thought he was gonna kill her.

01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:18,084
When you went after my little girl,
that was entirely unacceptable.

965
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:21,879
Mercy.

966
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,467
I'm fresh out.

967
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,020
Daddy?

968
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,401
Go to sleep, darling.

969
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:17,101
Oh, Jesus!

970
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:20,771
Just one question.

971
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:24,984
Did Walter Sullivan say
why Christy didn't go to Barbados?

972
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:28,154
Just that she changed her mind.

973
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:31,032
You know who did it, don't you?

974
01:45:32,909 --> 01:45:35,870
So will you. Check your phones.

975
01:45:41,918 --> 01:45:43,586
MAN:
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.

976
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:06,692
You're taking a shortcut, Tommy?

977
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:12,782
I'm your substitute driver tonight,
Mr. Sullivan.

978
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:16,494
Don't worry about Tommy.
He's just fine.

979
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,038
Very unusual.

980
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:21,540
What do I call you?

981
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:24,043
Luther, sir.

982
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:29,173
And are you familiar with
how to get to my townhouse, Luther?

983
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:31,133
Oh, yes, sir.

984
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,386
I know where all your houses are.

985
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:35,721
I'm the man who robbed you.

986
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:41,477
You're the man who tried to kill me.

987
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:45,731
I'm sorry I missed.

988
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:49,902
I believe in the Old Testament, sir.

989
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:52,863
There's nothing wrong with
an eye for an eye...

990
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:54,824
...when a terrible deed has been done.

991
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,326
A deed such as yours.

992
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,538
LUTHER: Yeah. Well, you'd like to
believe that, wouldn't you?

993
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:03,249
That'd be simple for you to believe that.

994
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,751
What do you think I have to gain
by being here?

995
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,087
I have no idea.

996
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:09,964
You going to rob me again?

997
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,675
Oh, I don't need your money,
Mr. Sullivan.

998
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:15,344
Did you check your vault lately?

999
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:18,055
I put everything back.

1000
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:23,060
I'm afraid we're a little late
for an attempt at leniency.

1001
01:47:27,315 --> 01:47:29,733
A lot of crap's coming down tonight, sir.

1002
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,652
You wanna be a player or not?

1003
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,447
You wanna know what happened that night
or don't you?

1004
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:36,407
Because I was there.

1005
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:38,451
I want to know.

1006
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:41,454
You think you can stand
hearing about it?

1007
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:44,039
How he beat her, tried to strangle her?

1008
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:46,000
You really wanna know about that?

1009
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,795
I could walk through fire.

1010
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:53,507
I was in the vault when they came in.

1011
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,384
They were drunk.

1012
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,052
He started knocking her around.

1013
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,138
She fought back.

1014
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:01,307
He started getting really rough.

1015
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:03,517
She tried to defend herself.

1016
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,603
Well, he started screaming...

1017
01:48:05,812 --> 01:48:08,481
...sniveling simp he is.

1018
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:10,316
Who else was in my house?

1019
01:48:10,525 --> 01:48:13,235
Secret Service.
They're the ones who shot her.

1020
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,070
Nonsense.

1021
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:18,032
Gloria Russell,
she handled the cover-up.

1022
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,325
Stop this!

1023
01:48:19,784 --> 01:48:21,410
Don't you wanna know who it was?

1024
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,786
It was you.

1025
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:27,041
Come on, Mr. Sullivan.
We're too old to bullshit each other.

1026
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:28,876
Who was it, then?

1027
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:30,586
You know.

1028
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,757
Don't shake your head at me.

1029
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:41,931
When you're alone and your rage takes over
and you want revenge...

1030
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,600
...what face do you put
with your enemy?

1031
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,907
Stop the car!

1032
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,784
No, we're going straight ahead.

1033
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:03,869
No.

1034
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:05,579
This is too terrible.

1035
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:07,540
Yes, it is.

1036
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:14,004
I know about Alan's reputation
as a philanderer...

1037
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:17,049
...but he'd never dream of betraying me.

1038
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,346
I gave him the presidency.

1039
01:49:23,139 --> 01:49:24,765
Remember that press conference?

1040
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:27,393
Where he put his arm
around you and said...

1041
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:31,522
...if Christy hadn't been sick,
she'd have been in Barbados with you?

1042
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:34,066
Well, how the hell did he know
she was sick?

1043
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:36,569
You didn't tell anyone.

1044
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,154
It's because she told him that night.
I was there.

1045
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:41,365
I was right there watching.

1046
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,660
That's not real proof.

1047
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:48,581
Well, maybe this is, then.

1048
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:56,297
You could've stolen this.

1049
01:49:57,757 --> 01:49:59,091
I did steal it.

1050
01:49:59,342 --> 01:50:02,803
But that's not my blood on there
and that's not my prints.

1051
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,207
Mr. Sullivan.

1052
01:50:48,016 --> 01:50:50,601
I did love her, you know.

1053
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:13,290
SETH:
Jeez, Burton.

1054
01:51:59,879 --> 01:52:03,757
Is he working late? I don't have
an appointment but I would like to see him.

1055
01:52:04,008 --> 01:52:06,260
You don't need an appointment,
Mr. Sullivan.

1056
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:20,607
Let's go, Ms. Russell.

1057
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:04,568
Walter.

1058
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:05,778
Come in.

1059
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,701
MALE NEWSCASTER: We interrupt
this program with a breaking story...

1060
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:15,204
...one that is shocking
the nation and the world.

1061
01:53:15,371 --> 01:53:18,165
Information is just coming out
of the White House about a tragedy...

1062
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,000
...that's taken place within the hour.

1063
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:22,085
We go now to our
White House correspondent.

1064
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:24,087
Diane, what can you tell us?

1065
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:28,717
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
Sources say Sullivan...

1066
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,136
...had seen President Richmond tonight.

1067
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:34,473
That was for an unscheduled
private meeting.

1068
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:46,777
You're still here.

1069
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,114
I'm still here.

1070
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:03,460
ALAN:
--I would not be president.

1071
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:08,048
If Christine had not taken ill...

1072
01:54:08,716 --> 01:54:11,385
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

1073
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,683
Walter, you've been like a father to me.

1074
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:20,727
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: This is the
president's most recent news conference...

1075
01:54:20,937 --> 01:54:22,771
...where he clearly outlined...

1076
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,816
...his loyalty to philanthropist
and dear friend Walter Sullivan.

1077
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:29,194
Sullivan's wife was murdered.
The president vowed to find the killer.

1078
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:33,490
Again, Sullivan had a meeting with the
president. Unknown what they discussed.

1079
01:54:33,741 --> 01:54:36,118
We go now to the White House
for a live interview.

1080
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:40,706
Mr. Sullivan, have you no idea why
the president would take his own life?

1081
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:46,420
SULLIVAN: I know he's been feeling
the pressure of office more than ever lately.

1082
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:48,964
He talked about it a great deal.

1083
01:54:49,215 --> 01:54:51,258
But why would he stab himself?

1084
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,681
That's a question that will
haunt me forever.

1085
01:55:00,685 --> 01:55:03,770
Of course I tried to stop him.

1086
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:06,690
Alan...

1087
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:08,734
...was like a son to me.

1088
01:55:53,237 --> 01:55:55,030
Was that Seth?

1089
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:01,662
I think he'd like to come over
for supper when you get well.

1090
01:56:08,586 --> 01:56:10,462
You don't have to fuss.

1091
01:56:10,672 --> 01:56:11,922
I know.

1092
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,888
Am I gonna be all right?

1093
01:56:21,474 --> 01:56:22,766
Yeah.

1094
01:56:23,893 --> 01:56:26,019
We're gonna be just fine.

1095
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,841
