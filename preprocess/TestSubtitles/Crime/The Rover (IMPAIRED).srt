He's waiting for me.

327
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,076
He's not waiting for you.

328
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,148
Yes, he is.

329
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,049
No, he's not.

330
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,887
I'll tell you
what God's given you.

331
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,490
He's put a bullet in you.

332
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,796
And he's abandoned you out here to me,
who feels nothing for you.

333
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:46,035
I couldn't give a fuck
if you die tomorrow.

334
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:48,971
God gave you a brother
who's not waiting for you.

335
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:53,142
He gave you a brother who's not
even thinking about you right now.

336
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:59,448
Just because you and him came
out of the same woman's hole.

337
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,022
The only thing that
means anything right now

338
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:09,559
is that I'm here
and he's not.

339
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,967
Your brother
left you to die.

340
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,169
That's what people do.

341
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:27,076
You don't learn to fight,
your death's gonna come real soon.

<i>ain't there no more.</i>

367
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,488
And all the roads
are bad now anyways

368
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,390
so you can't
drive fast on 'em.

369
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,966
She said about
eight or nine hours.

370
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,635
She wasn't sure if
it was eight or nine.

371
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,004
She seemed a bit
confused about it.

372
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,374
And why would he
still be there?

373
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,980
He had to wait two
weeks for someone.

374
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:29,685
There's a man there he's got to meet,
it's gonna take two weeks.

375
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,755
You know this?
Or this is what he told you?

376
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,724
Huh?

377
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,561
Your brother
can't be trusted.

378
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,663
Is this something
that you know

379
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,699
or is this something
that he told you?

380
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,174
Both those things.

381
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,855
You work in the mines?

382
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,758
No.

383
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,062
What do you do then?

384
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,669
I was a farmer.
And now I'm here.

385
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,776
Then how come you learned
how to shoot so good?

386
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,211
You was in the army?

387
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,828
When I was a little kid
I grew up on a farm.

388
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,499
We had these neighbors,
real old man and lady, Verna and Clarry,

389
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,733
they's brother and sister.

390
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:55,604
And they lived on this land
that's all overgrown,

391
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:59,241
like you couldn't even tell what they farmed,
so overgrown.

392
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,711
And Clarry had
these eight tractors,

393
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,546
and none of them
worked properly,

394
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:06,682
so every morning
he'd roll each one

395
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,917
down the hill till
he got one of them started

396
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:12,488
and then use that one to tow all the others back up.
(CHUCKLING)

397
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,724
He did that every day.

398
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,062
And when they died, their family,
who we'd never met before,

399
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:22,865
came around,
cleared out their house

400
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,101
and they found all this...

401
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,638
They found all this
weird stuff in there.

402
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,574
Like...

403
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,011
Like 50 therm...

404
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:41,917
Thermionic radio valves.

405
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:46,522
Like them real old valves
they used in old radios.

406
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,158
And pyramid of pumpkins.

407
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:55,631
And about 5,000 of these little sticks about this long.

408
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,800
And each wrapped
up in newspaper

409
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,870
and tied up at the ends
with baling twine.

410
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,079
Why are you telling me this?

411
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,051
I just remembered it.

412
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,820
It interested me.

413
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,827
Not everything has
to be about something.

You shouldn't.

But I can't.

418
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,036
You shouldn't stop
thinking about her.

419
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:15,243
You should never stop thinking
about a life you've taken.

420

pay for taking it.

No.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER

What are you
gonna do with me?

445
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,137
You're going to Sydney.

446
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,242
Why don't you just shoot me?

447
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,318
Why don't you do it?

That's what
everyone else is doing.

Tells Sydney there's a reason to
keep paying us what they pay us.

450
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,133
If we just shot every idiot
we wanted to shoot,

451
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:40,468
then pretty soon
they'd start to wonder

452
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,971
what the fuck
we're doing out here.

453
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,110
See, personally
I don't care about you.

454
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,612
I don't care if
you get to Sydney and

455
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,247
they let you off or
you bribe your way out

or whatever the fuck they do
down there these days.

457
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,151
I don't give a fuck.

458
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,154
I'm doing this for me.

459
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,223
You're doing
what for you?

460
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,330
You're doing what for you?

461
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,271
I murdered my wife.

462
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:23,478
I watched him put his fingers
inside her and I killed 'em both.

463
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,580
No one ever came after me.

464
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,116
Ten years ago.

465
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,254
I never had
to explain myself.

466
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,060
I never had to lie to anyone.
I never had to run and hide.

467
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,130
I just buried 'em in
a hole and I went home.

468
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,699
No one ever came after me.

469
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,270
And that hurt me more than getting my heart broken.

470
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,242
Knowing it didn't matter.

471
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:02,384
Knowing you can do something like
that and no one comes after you.

472
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:09,624
You do a thing like I did,
that should really mean something.

473
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,196
But it just
doesn't matter anymore.

474
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,536
Well, champ.

475
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,676
Thing you did in Abo town is the
one thing that does matter to us.

476
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:35,316
Now you can do all the lying and confessing you'd like.

477
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:40,288
What feeling do you have when
you wake up in the morning?

478
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,825
When your feet
touch the floor?

479
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,263
Or before that,
when you're lying there

480
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:50,565
thinking about your
feet hitting the floor.

481
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,802
What does that
feel like for you?

482
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,674
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

483
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,776
No, mate. I don't.

484
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:07,348
No, mate.
