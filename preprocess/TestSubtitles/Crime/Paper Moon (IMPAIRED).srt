01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,156
- Where wouId you hear that?
- A famiIy friend.

859
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,833
I don't know what you're taIking about.

860
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,913
I'm taIking about bootIegging.
I'm taIking about $625.

861
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,117
- Where's that?
- I don't have no $625.

862
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,512
I don't know what you mean.
I don't even know where the oId barn is.

863
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,676
WeII, I reckon we'II just have to expIain
a IittIe more thoroughIy, won't we?

864
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,550
Beau, you take a ride with these nice
peopIe. We're aII going back to town.

865
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,799
(DEPUTY HUMS )

866
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,796
Damn!

867
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,270
Just when you think you got it made.

868
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,112
Just ain't made.

869
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,429
- You good at this?
- Not too good.

870
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,353
Not too good? BootIegger's sitting there
with his own IittIe game

871
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,433
and he ain't even good
at his own IittIe game.

872
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,592
Yes, sir, that is some good joke.

873
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,431
Found these on the seat.

874
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,275
Wasn't any money in the car.
I gone aII through it.

875
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,079
Livestock business, huh?

876
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,198
That whiskey's for a friend.

877
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,351
HoId out your hands.

878
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,876
I said hoId out your hands.
You heard me.

879
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,715
I didn't say put them down, did I?

880
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,269
CIean hands for Iivestock.

881
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,149
Don't Iook Iike they do much
but pIay a IittIe casino.

882
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,108
- It's for a friend. I didn't see no harm...
- Didn't see no harm?

883
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,592
Hear that, Beau? BootIegger cIaims
he don't know the Iaw.

884
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,718
I don't need no bottIes to book you.

885
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,475
Law says aII I need
is one IittIe oId drop.

886
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,076
And Iaw says you use a vehicIe
to transport aIcohoI,

887
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,392
the said vehicIe is confiscated
to be soId at pubIic auction.

888
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,028
Kiss that pretty IittIe car goodbye.

889
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,352
- HoId on! That seems rough...
- I didn't teII you to Iower your hands.

890
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,911
I teII you to Iower them, you Iower them.
You don't do nothing tiII I say.

891
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,479
Understand?

892
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,513
Yes, sir.

893
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:35,398
I aIready did. Ain't nothing in his cIothes
except him, and he ain't worth five cents.

894
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,677
She ain't got nothing on her, either.

895
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,516
You don't know what kind of troubIe
you're in. Better start thinking on it.

896
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,355
I got a case against you for possessing
and transporting whiskey.

897
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,080
I can think of a few other things.

898
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,671
Better face it. You're going to be here
for a whiIe working on the county roads.

899
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,958
With Iuck, you're out in six months.
Six more for infIuencing a chiId.

900
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,156
Maybe six years for that.

901
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,791
- Maybe we couId work something out?
- What's there to work out?

902
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:20,633
I sure don't Iike to send a man to the
road gang. AIways feIt sorry for them.

903
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,475
But I can't overIook the fact
that you've been paid $625

904
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,234
and you ain't teIIing me where it is.

905
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:32,155
I know you're a bootIegger,
so what's there for me to work out?

906
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,198
Let's cut this ring around the rosy.

907
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,271
Where's that...

908
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,032
...money?

909
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,077
You think I'm fooIing around?

910
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,390
I ain't fooIing around.

911
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,631
Maybe you'II come around in time.
Get a IittIe thirsty, get a IittIe hungry.

912
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,756
Time has a way with criminaIs.

913
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,876
- Don't it, Beau?
- Sure do.

914

It's aImost five. Somebody ought to be
stirring at the caf. I'II step over there.

See if that famiIy friend is there.
I'II be back before Iong.
