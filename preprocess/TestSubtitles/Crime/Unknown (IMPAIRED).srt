A few more minutes

01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:08,373
and you would <i>h</i>ave gone
into full arrest, never woken up.

944
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,079
My memory-

945
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:16,750
T<i>h</i>e <i>h</i>uman body can endure
significant trauma, DFetective.

946
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:20,158
For better or for worse,

Can I trouble you

I don't smoke.

And if I were?
