42
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,320
<i>- You're kidding.
- Hey, this couch falls out.</i>

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
<i>This is the worst apartment
I've ever seen.</i>

45

There's cable TV, everything.</i>

55
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,200
<i>- Except it's worse.
- It's not to your liking? Sorry.</i>

56
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,720
<i>"Not to my liking"...</i>

57
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
<i>is the understatement of all time.</i>

58
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,960
<i>- There's cable TV.
- Yeah, I know, you said that already.</i>

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,680
<i>I got Starz and Showtime,
and I was in fucking lockdown.</i>

60
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,200
<i>I need to wash up.</i>

61
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
<i>Can I use the commode
for like two seconds?</i>

62
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,560
<i>- Sure.
- Thank you.</i>

63
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240

64
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,920

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360

68
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,880
<i>Yeah.</i>

69
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,280
<i>Good, I've been dreaming
about their coffee.</i>

70
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,760
<i>Yeah, I could use a cup right now.</i>

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
<i>We could do whatever you want, Val.</i>

72
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
<i>It's your day.</i>

73
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

74
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
<i>Yeah.</i>

75
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,680
<i>Feel like partying?</i>

76
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,160
<i>- Cause I could fucking party right now.
- No, I don't feel like partying.</i>

77
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,600
<i>So, what then?</i>

78
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,800
<i>I don't know what to tell you, Val.
I do the same thing everyday, I paint...</i>

79
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,200
<i>the sunrise, watch the cable TV,
try to eat right, relax, go to bed.</i>

80
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,680
<i>Nothing earth-shattering.</i>

81
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,720
<i>How's, uh, your daughter. How's Jessica?</i>

82
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,400
<i>She doesn't want me to find her.</i>

83
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,640
<i>- And?
- I did anyway, she's working...</i>

84
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,000
<i>Minneapolis.</i>

85
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,840
<i>Oh, yeah? Didn't she have a kid?
Your granddaughter?</i>

86
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,000
<i>She did... does.</i>

87
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>What's she up to?</i>

88
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>I couldn't find her.</i>

89
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>I kept in touch with some people.</i>

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
<i>What people?</i>

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,360
<i>Well, what people do you think?</i>

92
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,280
<i>Friends.</i>

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
<i>High, low places.</i>

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,880
<i>Friends who would be...</i>

95
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
<i>amenable to us having our comeback.</i>

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240

98
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,600
<i>Another subject.</i>

99
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
<i>I could really fucking party.</i>

100
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,480
<i>- You know what I'm saying?

102
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,160

103
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,800

111
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
<i>Oh, she couldn't take the cold,
so she set up shop in Florida, Boca.</i>

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
<i>- You look like her.
- Yeah?</i>

113

<i>- Have a seat. Relax, relax.
- Thanks. Yeah.</i>

129
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
<i>Fixed the place up.</i>

130
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,960
<i>- It's the same, but different.
- Huh.</i>

131
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,080

151
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,720
<i>- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
- We'll be back.</i>

152
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
<i>What are you smiling at?</i>

153
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
<i>- You find it funny? Is this funny?
- Nuh... nuh... no, no, I just...</i>

154
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
<i>Do you have anything
that are good to help my friend out?</i>

155
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
<i>Boner pills?</i>

156
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,440
<i>Oh, we've... we ran out of boner pills.</i>

157
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>Is this a first for you?</i>

158
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,960
<i>- It's okay.
- We'll come back.</i>

159
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,080
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

160
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,960
<i>- Just keep smiling.
- We'll be back.</i>

161
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
<i>I'll settle up with you.</i>

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,720
<i>Guys, if you get back before seven,
I'll give you the "Early Bird Special."</i>

163
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,520
<i>- Now I thought you said you're retired.
- Uh-huh.</i>

164
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,200
<i>But some tools...</i>

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
<i>you hate to give up.</i>

166
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600
<i>Yeah. I could've done that with my dick.</i>

167
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
<i>Come on in. That's why we're here.</i>

168
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
<i>- Oh, that was just plain cruel.
- I'm sorry.</i>

169
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,320
<i>Remember that time you threw that Greek
out of the hotel window?</i>

170
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,840
<i>I do.</i>

171
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,520
<i>Fell straight on to a street meat vendor</i>

172
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,360
<i>I felt bad about that part.</i>

173
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,280
<i>Oh, this is definitely
a violation of my parole.</i>

174
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,280
<i>It's OK, I need to fill
my Nexium prescription anyway.</i>

175
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
<i>- What's Nexium?
- It's for my ulcer.</i>

176
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,880
<i>So, what are we looking for?</i>

177
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,800
<i>Ah, this.</i>

178
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,160
<i>What is that?</i>

179
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,280
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Oh...</i>

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,640
<i>You're only supposed to take one.</i>

181
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,520
<i>I wanna make sure.</i>

182
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
<i>So, we... we... done here?</i>

183
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,520
<i>No, I need some Perindopril.</i>

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,240
<i>What?</i>

185
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,000
<i>And some...</i>

186
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,920
<i>Ooh, Latanoprost.
My co-pay is insane on this one.</i>

187
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,720
<i>And, uh, ooh, Aldactone for hypertension</i>

188
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,080
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

189
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
<i>How much shit are you on?</i>

190
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
<i>A lot.</i>

191
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,960
<i>So how long does this take
to get the pipes working?</i>

192
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,120
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

193
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,760
<i>So what are we gonna do while we wait?</i>

194
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,880
<i>Three Andrew Jacksons say I, uh,
run this table.</i>

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
<i>But, uh, you don't have any money.</i>

196
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,960
<i>What does that mean?</i>

197
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,680
<i>You spot me.</i>

198
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,960
<i>But, uh, that would be
robbing Peter to pay Paul.</i>

199
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,400
<i>"Each one must give
as he has decided in his heart,"</i>

200
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,560
<i>- "not reluctantly or under compulsion."
- Uh-huh, Corinthians.</i>

201
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,040
<i>- Chapter nine, verse seven.
- I love Corinthians.</i>

202
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,920
<i>OK, um, let's do the five.</i>

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,920
<i>- Oh, it's on now.
- Oh, wait, let me get out of your way.</i>

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,680
<i>Go ahead, stay in my way then.</i>

205
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,920
<i>- Oh!
- See?</i>

206
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,440
<i>Keep it.</i>

207
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,160
<i>- Thank you.
- It's yours.</i>

208
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
<i>Oh, you gave me a nice thing here.</i>

209
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
<i>- Too easy, but I'm gonna take it.
- Oh, it is easy.</i>

210
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,280
<i>- Hello!
- Oh!</i>

211
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,920
<i>- That was not fair.
- No, it wasn't.</i>

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,800
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

213
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,520
<i>What?</i>

214
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>Mount Everest just moved into my pants.</i>

215
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,080
<i>So...</i>

216
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
<i>all systems go?</i>

217
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,720
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

218
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
<i>I'm so fucking hard...</i>

219
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
<i>I could cut a diamond.</i>

220
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,600
<i>- You shouldn't have taken so many.
- Oh, fuck that.</i>

221
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,400
<i>My old friend.</i>

222
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,960
<i>- Are you ready, Val?
- Ooh, ah, whoa...</i>

223
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,360
<i>You don't know. I never been more ready.</i>

224
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,440
<i>- Let us go.
- Oh, yes.</i>

225
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,920
<i>Come on.</i>

226
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,520
<i>Next smile you see,
will be on Oxana's face.</i>

227
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,000
<i>He's my only son.</i>

228
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,520
<i>- Aw...
- I'm coming in to use the phone, OK?</i>

229
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,360
<i>Paul, where's my
fucking Kung Pao Chicken?</i>

230
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,960
<i>- It's on it's way. You got a call.
- Fuck my ass. Gimme the phone.</i>

231
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,080
<i>Claphands here.</i>

232
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,160
<i>It's Doc.</i>

233
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,760
<i>Would the package be delivered on time?</i>

234
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,040
<i>I can't do what I said I would do.</i>

235
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
<i>Well then, if you</i>

236
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,080
<i>can't deliver the package,</i>

237
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,480
<i>then you won't be
a friend of mine any longer.</i>

238
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,520
<i>Do I need to become more explicit here?</i>

239
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,800
<i>No.</i>

240
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,760
<i>No.</i>

241
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
<i>I didn't think so.</i>

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,920
<i>How long do I have?</i>

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,640
<i>What do you mean "how long do you have"?</i>

244
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,560
<i>To deliver the package.</i>

245
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,880
<i>How long do I have?</i>

246
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,440
<i>I don't fucking believe this shit.</i>

247
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,880
<i>Do I have dementia? Paul, who's
the President of the United States?</i>

248
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,600
<i>- Um...
- Shut the fuck up!</i>

249
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
<i>You have until morning.</i>

250
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,880
<i>What, like ten,
or later, like brunch time?</i>

251
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,880
<i>This is like talking to Conchita my maid</i>

252
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,880
<i>Kill him by 10 o'clock in the AM,
or you're dead too.</i>

253
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
<i>Motherfucker shoots my only son!</i>

254
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,640
<i>The only reason I've let you live
was for this. We clear?</i>

255
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,240
<i>- We're clear.
- Then good night.</i>

256
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,360
<i>Wendy, Wendy.</i>

257
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,480
<i>Doc.</i>

258
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,080
<i>- Everything all right?
- No, but thank you for asking.</i>

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,840
<i>Bet you're the type of man who wouldn't
let a lady drink by herself, huh?</i>

260
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,120
<i>Of course not.</i>

261
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,680
<i>Just a pfft taste.</i>

262
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,360
<i>This is good stuff.</i>

263
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,960
<i>Ah...</i>

264
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,400
<i>Doc, my mother always told me to do the
best with what you have, where you are.</i>

265
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,240
<i>Your mother was something.</i>

266
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,520
<i>Oh... Ah...</i>

267
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,920
<i>So, did everything work this time,
Valentine?</i>

268
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,480
<i>Four times. It worked. I coulda
gone again, but she's all worn out.</i>

269
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,120
<i>- Good for you.
- Come on, let's blow this pop stand.</i>

270
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,000
<i>Wendy, for everything, thank you.</i>

271
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,120
<i>Hope we find peace, Doc.</i>

272
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,320
<i>- Me too.
- I feel so ready to party.</i>

273
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
<i>Bye, Smiley.</i>

274
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,160
<i>Those girls look like they wanna party.</i>

275
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,000
<i>- Why embarrass yourself?
- Ah...</i>

276
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,280
<i>Embarrass myself?</i>

277
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>We're doing a battle of the balls. This
goes up and down like a fucking yo-yo.</i>

278
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,880
<i>Pray for me.</i>

279
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,320
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>

280
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,840
<i>Whaddya say, whaddya know?</i>

281
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,880
<i>It's me, Jack-a-Mo.</i>

282
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,080
<i>Shouldn't you be in bed?</i>

283
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,600
<i>In bed?</i>

284
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
<i>Baby...</i>

285
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,360
<i>I got a python in my pants...</i>

286
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,240
<i>harder than the Rock of Gibral...</i>

287
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
<i>Don't talk to me.</i>

288
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,040
<i>- Can we go home now?
- Oh, no. Definitely not now.</i>

289
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,960
<i>We don't go home.</i>

290
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,240
<i>We're just gettin' started, buddy.</i>

291
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,560
<i>I need uh, 20 bucks. I'll be right back.</i>

292
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,240
<i>- What are you doing, Val?
- Just give it to me, I'm not asking.</i>

293
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,120
<i>Yeah.</i>

294
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,560
<i>Hey, hey, can you help a brother out?</i>

295
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,720
<i>What's happening?</i>

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>I want you to play
something a lil' different.</i>

297
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,440
<i>You know, like when music was still
music, when it had a lil' soul.</i>

298
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,320
<i>- Ah, ya talking old school.
- Old school, yeah.</i>

299
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
<i>Right, yeah, there's not much call
for old school around here.</i>

300
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,680

<i>Remember that?</i>

453
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,720
<i>I felt like I was flying.
I remember you catching me.</i>

454
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,400
<i>Remember that? I'm glad.</i>

455
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,600
<i>How'd... Oh, help. Have mercy.</i>

456
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,120
<i>You were in jail, right?</i>

457
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,280
<i>- Yeah, s-so what?
- What'd you do?</i>

458
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,440
<i>I'm supposed to answer that? Fuck, I-I-I
got like no blood in my brain any more.</i>

459
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,080
<i>- He had some bad luck is all.
- Oh, yeah, well, I know all about that.</i>

460
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
<i>- Excuse me.
- Yup.</i>

461
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,200
<i>- Take a quick look.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

462
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,680
<i>- How many pills did he take?
- A fistful.</i>

463
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,560
<i>- I see.
- Are you a real doctor?</i>

464
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,640
<i>Are you a real patient?
Is that a real penis?</i>

465
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,880
<i>Mr. Valentine, you have
what is called vein-induced priapism.</i>

466
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,840
<i>Now, I can give you some blood thinners
to open things up a bit, but, uh...</i>

467
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
<i>old blood's gotta be removed,
in order for fresh blood to flow in.</i>

468
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,720
<i>- Removed in what way, removed?
- What's he talk...</i>

469
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,920
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, fuck me.</i>

470
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
<i>OK, let's relax.</i>

471
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
<i>What is this? Where are you going, Doc?
Where are you going?</i>

472
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
<i>I'm outta here.</i>

473
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,160
<i>- Oh, no, what are you doing?
- I'll be... I'll be in the waiting room</i>

474
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,520
<i>Look at me, breathe.</i>

475
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,920
<i>- Maybe I partied a lil' too hard.
- Maybe a little.</i>

476
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,200
<i>I don't have, uh...</i>

477
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,520
<i>health insurance.</i>

478
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,400
<i>- I paid the bill.
- OK.</i>

479
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
<i>So who's gonna do it?</i>

480
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,120
<i>- Do what?
- You know what.</i>

481
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,640
<i>I don't.</i>

482
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,440
<i>Let's just drop
the "welcome home" thing, OK? I know.</i>

483
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,480
<i>- Hey there, Doc.
- Hey, Alex.</i>

484
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,760
<i>- Who's your friend?
- This is my best friend...</i>

485
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,160
<i>Valentine. Alex,
he just got back from a long trip.</i>

486
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,680
<i>Well, how was your trip, Valentine?</i>

487
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,280
<i>Oh it was... um, I'm just glad I'm back,
and I don't answer to the name Valentine</i>

488
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,480
<i>- My friends call me Val.
- OK, well, then I'll call you Val, Val.</i>

489
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,880
<i>- Well, then we're friends.
- Yeah, you can never have enough.</i>

490
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,160
<i>- Yeah, you're right, there.
- Doc and I, well, we've been friends</i>

491
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,080
<i>- for a while now, haven't we?
- We have.</i>

492
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>I remember the very first time
he walked in here.</i>

493
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,280
<i>- You remember that?
- Sure I do.</i>

494
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,920
<i>I hate to break up this "remembering
the more wistful times", but...</i>

495
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,520
<i>- I'm-I'm a little on the peckish side.
- Sure, what'll it be tonight, fellas?</i>

496
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,840
<i>- Uh, a tea and lemon, please.
- OK.</i>

497
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,960
<i>Uh, I'll have the Surf n' Turf...</i>

498
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,440
<i>and a Root Beer Float.</i>

499
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,120
<i>All right,
how do you like your steak done, Val?</i>

500
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,640
<i>Bloody.</i>

501
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
<i>- Coming right up.
- Yeah.</i>

502
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,720
<i>- Enjoy your dinner, Ernie.
- Can I have a little more?</i>

503
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
<i>Is she always so sweet?</i>

504
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,040
<i>Every day I walk outta here,
I'm always better.</i>

505
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,200
<i>Yeah.</i>

506
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,080
<i>So who's gonna do it?</i>

507
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,160
<i>I don't know.</i>

508
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,680
<i>- It's you, isn't it.
- I don't know.</i>

509
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,760
<i>It's you. Come on, just say it. It's you</i>

510
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,400
<i>Whaddya think this is here, I'm gonna
blame you for anything? A job is a job.</i>

511
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,640
<i>If the roles were reversed,
I'd do it in a heartbeat.</i>

512
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,320
<i>Come on, man, say it's you!</i>

513
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,080
<i>It's me.</i>

514
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,920
<i>Claphands.</i>

515
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,560
<i>He's got a mean streak in him, no?</i>

516
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,200
<i>- Bit of an understatement.
- Yeah.</i>

517
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,240
<i>Meanest, most vindictive motherfucker...</i>

518
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,680
<i>outside the Devil himself.</i>

519
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,960
<i>First couple of years I was inside...</i>

520
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,600
<i>I had my head on a swivel, you know,
I was looking here, looking there.</i>

521
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,440
<i>What the fuck is gonna happen,
and when is it gonna happen?</i>

522
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
<i>Is it gonna happen in the laundry room,</i>

523
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,400
<i>on the yard, or am I gonna get it
in the fucking cafetaria?</i>

524
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,280
<i>That's-that's all I thought about,
and then I understood somethin'.</i>

525
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,600
<i>He's gonna make me...</i>

526
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,360
<i>serve every single day of my sentence.</i>

527
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,400
<i>So, it would end up just like this.</i>

528
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,280
<i>So, how were you gonna do it?</i>

529
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,880
<i>In my apartment, while you're asleep.</i>

530
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,400
<i>You see?</i>

531
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,400
<i>Thats got no flavor, thats got no style.</i>

532
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,880
<i>Come on, what is that?</i>

533
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,200
<i>While I'm asleep.</i>

534
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,280
<i>How do you think I should do it?</i>

535
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,560
<i>I don't.</i>

536
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,040
<i>There's the rub.</i>

537
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,200
<i>He put his son on the job.</i>

538
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,840
<i>This was a bad idea.</i>

539
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,040
<i>OK, fine, I'm not gonna ask questions.</i>

540
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,960
<i>First sign of trouble...</i>

541
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,040
<i>the kid panics,
starts shooting everywhere...</i>

542
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,960
<i>catches my bullet...</i>

543
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,880
<i>in the crossfire.</i>

544
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,120
<i>- Could've been anybody's.
- I was there, I know.</i>

545
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,560
<i>This was an accident.</i>

546
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,040
<i>How's it my fault?</i>

547
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,720
<i>I'm a fucking stand-up guy,
I took the fall for everyone.</i>

548
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
<i>You did, I know that.</i>

549
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,800
<i>And they pressed me.
I didn't say a word, not a fucking word.</i>

550
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,840
<i>And...</i>

551
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,920
<i>this is what it comes to.</i>

552
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,320
<i>When did Claphands give you this job?</i>

553
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,480
<i>The day...</i>

554
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,000
<i>you went in.</i>

555
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,560
<i>- For 28 years, he was sittin' on you.
- Yes.</i>

556
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,200
<i>Now, that is fucked.</i>

557
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,240
<i>Here's your tea, Doc.</i>

558
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,360
<i>Root Beer Float for you.</i>

559
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,880
<i>And that's the Surf n' Turf.</i>

560
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,840
<i>Alex, can I say that...</i>

561
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,880
<i>this is the best Surf n' Turf
I've seen in all my travels.</i>

562
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,640
<i>Yeah?</i>

563
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>- Can I say that?
- That's very kind of you to say, Val.</i>

564
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,720
<i>- Are you OK, Doc?
- Yeah.</i>

565
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,600
<i>So when are you gonna do it?</i>

566
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,840
<i>By ten this morning, it has to be done.</i>

567
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,360
<i>OK.</i>

568
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,600
<i>Oh, nope, this doesn't work.
What time is it now?</i>

569
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,840
<i>1:17 in the AM.</i>

570
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,920
<i>That's-that's about nine hours.</i>

571
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,960
<i>Yeah.</i>

572
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,680
<i>Let's get in the car.</i>

573
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,760
<i>Hey, man, let's... Why don't we
skedaddle down the road a bit.</i>

574
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,760
<i>I wanna walk off this, uh...</i>

575
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,640
<i>Surf n' Turf with a Root
Beer Float, you know...</i>

576
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,560
<i>my digestion.</i>

577
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,120
<i>Sure.</i>

578
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,920
<i>So, what are my options now?</i>

579
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,440
<i>You could run.</i>

580
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,520
<i>They'd find me.</i>

581
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
<i>You might buy some time.</i>

582
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,120
<i>- But if I run...
- What?</i>

583
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,160
<i>You're not gonna have
any friends any more.</i>

584
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,480
<i>True, but...</i>

585
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,880
<i>You'd have a head start at least.</i>

586
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,920
<i>Ah... better this way.</i>

587
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,960
<i>- How's it better?
- It's better because...</i>

588
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,400
<i>- then I can say goodbye.
- I don't want you to say goodbye.</i>

589
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,920
<i>Well, what do you want me to say then?</i>

590
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,520
<i>I have to say goodbye.
There's nothing left for me to say.</i>

591
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,160
<i>Hold up.</i>

592
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,640
<i>- Something has presented itself.
- What?</i>

593
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,360
<i>What?</i>

594
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,760
<i>What kind of a big, beautiful...</i>

595
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,360
<i>- beast of a car is this?
- Val, no.</i>

596
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,400
<i>I think she's lonely.
I think she wants us to take her out.</i>

597
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,720
<i>On a date.</i>

598
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,960
<i>This car belongs to the Jargoniew
brothers. I happen to know them.</i>

599
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,040
<i>A-a-and that's supposed to
mean somethin' to me?</i>

600
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,560
<i>Nobody messes with these guys.</i>

601
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,760
<i>These are the type of guys,
take yer kidneys out, not even sell them</i>

602
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,640
<i>If we only had a coat hanger, right?</i>

603
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,200
<i>You can't open a car</i>

604
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
<i>- with a coat hanger any more, Val.
- Says who?</i>

605
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
<i>Says the people who make cars.</i>

606
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,960
<i>What kinda asshole
keeps a car like this open?</i>

607
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,040
<i>These guys don't worry about
somebody stealing their car, Val.</i>

608
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,360
<i>They better start.</i>

609
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,800
<i>- Come on.
- These guys, I'm telling you...</i>

610
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,680
<i>These morons even left the key.</i>

611
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,960
<i>What the...
where does this fucking key go?</i>

612
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,680
<i>This is not a good idea, Val.</i>

613
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,360
<i>Yeah, well, my life
is full of "not good ideas."</i>

614
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>How do you start it, you know how?</i>

615
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,640
<i>- They make cars differently these days.
- Yeah, so you know how to do it?</i>

616
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,960
<i>- Put your foot on the brake.
- Yeah.</i>

617
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,880
<i>- And press that button.
- This button?</i>

618
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,840
<i>See?</i>

619
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,720
<i>- Holy shit, fuck.
- Whoa...</i>

620
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,840
<i>Where to?</i>

621
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,320
<i>Where to? Whaddya think?</i>

622
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,920
<i>- Our friend needs rescuing.
- Yes.</i>

623
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,480
<i>Whoa... I don't ever wanna end up
in one of these places.</i>

624
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,440
<i>Me too.</i>

625
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,680
<i>- Hey, excuse me.
- Yeah?</i>

626
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,520
<i>Would you happen to know
where Richard Hirsch's room is?</i>

627
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,320
<i>- I like Hirsch. Are you his friends?
- Yeah, the best.</i>

628
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,240
<i>His room is...</i>

629
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,080
<i>down at the end of the hall,
and to your left.</i>

630
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,800
<i>Thanks a bunch.</i>

631
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,840
<i>- Hey, are you here to rescue him?
- How'd you know?</i>

632
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,280
<i>I wish somebody would come and rescue me</i>

633
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,400
<i>We all do, honey.</i>

634
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,600
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

635
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,560
<i>- I feel like I'm dreaming.
- Hirsch.</i>

636
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,960
<i>You're still here. We're all still here.
You fucking guys, its like the old days.</i>

637
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,720
<i>So?</i>

638
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,960
<i>Get me the fuck outta here.</i>

639
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
<i>- Get me outta here.
- Here.</i>

640
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,000
<i>- Yeah.
- Ah...</i>

641
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,120
<i>Wait a second, let me get a hit.</i>

642
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,160
<i>Let's escape.</i>

643
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,720
<i>You want us to bring that?</i>

644
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,400
<i>- Nada, let's roll.
- You better get dressed.</i>

645
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,720
<i>Oh, man, the sweet taste of freedom.</i>

646
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,400
<i>We got a ride?</i>

647
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,760
<i>This is it.</i>

648
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,480
<i>- Huh?
- Right here.</i>

649
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>Oh, man.</i>

650
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,480
<i>You get to drive it.</i>

651
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
<i>- Oh-ho.
- OK.</i>

652
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,760
<i>Oop... Ah...</i>

653
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,480
<i>- There's no leg room here.
- Yeah.</i>

654
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
<i>Tight back here, I just banged my head.</i>

655
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,840
<i>The hell with your leg room.
I'm 6' 2", let's go.</i>

656
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,120
<i>- Ey.
- The situation is not ideal.</i>

657
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,760
<i>- You're a master.
- Yeah, I was.</i>

658
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,480
<i>- You are.
- I was.</i>

659
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,160
<i>- You don't forget that stuff.
- You're a master, Hirsch.</i>

660
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,800
<i>Four minutes ago,
you were sittin' in a dying house.</i>

661
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,800
<i>Now you're sittin' in this beast
of a car, you know. The situation's OK.</i>

662
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,720
<i>Is that right? Gimme the key.</i>

663
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,840
<i>There's no key.</i>

664
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,720
<i>- Don't fuck around, gimme the key.
- It's new. It's a button.</i>

665
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,880
<i>- And it's automatic.
- You push the button.</i>

666
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,000
<i>- A button?
- It's computers.</i>

667
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,360
<i>- Is it here?
- Yeah.</i>

668
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,600
<i>You put-put your foot on the brake
at the same time.</i>

669
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,520
<i>- All right.
- OK?</i>

670
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,880
<i>- Yeah.
- Can we go now?</i>

671
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,760
<i>Well, it's a million dials here.
I never saw this before.</i>

672
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,240
<i>Man, this is like the future.</i>

673
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,480
<i>Oh-ho!</i>

674
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,920
<i>Very nice.</i>

675
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,120
<i>So, Hirsch...</i>

676
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,760
<i>Whaddya been doing
since the last time I saw you.</i>

677
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,040
<i>Grieving, mostly.</i>

678
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,080
<i>- Ah, me too.
- A different kind, I guess.</i>

679
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,280
<i>Hey, I'm sorry for your loss.
Sorry about Julie.</i>

680
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,560
<i>Well you know, she was in a lot of pain.</i>

681
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,840
<i>- Yup.
- Uh... Whaddya say.</i>

682
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,000
<i>So how's your health?</i>

683
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,880
<i>Well, they took something out of me
a couple of months ago.</i>

684
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,840
<i>What'd they take out?</i>

685
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,120
<i>I don't know. I didn't ask.
It's none of business.</i>

686
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,600
<i>But I'm a little more streamlined now,
a little more aerodynamic.</i>

687
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,080
<i>- Which way is the highway?
- Not the highway, Hirsch.</i>

688
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,200
<i>Which way is the highway?
I'm not gonna ask again.</i>

689
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
<i>- Go left.
- Go left, young man.</i>

690
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,000
<i>- Go left!
- Yo!</i>

691
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,560
<i>- So I got into gardening.
- Where? In the joint?</i>

692
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah, Julie was into that.</i>

693
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,040
<i>- No, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

694
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,320
<i>I got quite a little green thumb, fellas</i>

695
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
<i>- I'm not surprised.
- Whoa!</i>

696
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,720
<i>I knew a guy got out, committed a crime,</i>

697
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,160
<i>in order to get back in, so he could see
how his garden was going.</i>

698
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,480
<i>Sounds like you loved it too.</i>

699
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,320
<i>Loved it? I love it. I mean, I still do.</i>

700
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,160
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

701
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,440
<i>"Uh-oh" what?</i>

702
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,480
<i>- Don't worry, I can lose 'em.
- I got paroled today.</i>

703
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,880
<i>We're driving in a stolen car,
and I imagine you're carrying a weapon.</i>

704
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,840
<i>I am.</i>

705
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
<i>- So?
- So...</i>

706
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,000
<i>I'm already fucked five ways to Sunday.</i>

707
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,160
<i>Let's rumble!</i>

708
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,880
<i>We got two of them.</i>

709
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,200
<i>I can see, I can see.</i>

710
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,160
<i>Hirsch, remember the time
in that shitbox car, with the Chinaman?</i>

711
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,320
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

712
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,000
<i>I think you should do that again.</i>

713
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,120
<i>- You do, huh?
- I do.</i>

714
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,240
<i>Hey, Hirsch, nice driving, by the way.</i>

715
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,360
<i>- Thanks.
- I mean, you still got it, buddy.</i>

716
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,840
<i>- Yeah, I do, don't I?
- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

717
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,440
<i>- That was intense. I got a rush.
- Hey, I threw up in my mouth.</i>

718
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,560
<i>So when'd you get out, Val?</i>

719
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,080
<i>Today.</i>

720
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,240
<i>- Today?
- Yeah.</i>

721
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,720
<i>- Get the hell outta here.
- No, yeah, ask Doc.</i>

722
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,880
<i>- No kidding.
- Yeah.</i>

723
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,160
<i>- We got sprung on the same day.
- It's nice you can share that.</i>

724
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,240
<i>- 28 years.
- 28 fucking years.</i>

725
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,240
<i>You did your time like a man, Val.
You're a stand-up all the way.</i>

726
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,120
<i>Well, you know,
you and Doc would have done the same.</i>

727
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,640
<i>Well, I would like to think so.</i>

728
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,480
<i>It's possible, either way is possible,
but you did it, Val.</i>

729
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,360
<i>True. I can't believe...</i>

730
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,280
<i>you guys didn't work together...</i>

731
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,240
<i>- all this time.
- Nope.</i>

732
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,760
<i>No, no, no,
Claphands retired us, that was that.</i>

733
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,880
<i>And it was.</i>

734
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,120
<i>He can't forgive himself,
so everybody else has gotta pay.</i>

735
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
<i>So whaddya wanna do now you're out, Val?</i>

736
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,120
<i>I always wanted to finish high school.</i>

737
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,360
<i>Learn more about the human condition.</i>

738
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,080
<i>How about you, Hirsch?</i>

739
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,120
<i>Is there anything in this life,
that you haven't done...</i>

740
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,000
<i>that
you would like to have a chance to do?</i>

741
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,120
<i>Two girls at the same time.</i>

742
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,520
<i>- That's very doable, no, Doc?
- Yeah, done and done.</i>

743
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,480
<i>Back so soon?</i>

744
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,280
<i>One more time,
you get the free coffee mug.</i>

745
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,960
<i>Wendy, we'd like you to meet
our associate, Richard Hirsch.</i>

746
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,920
<i>How're you doin'?</i>

747
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,040
<i>Hullo.</i>

748
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,040
<i>He's looking for, what is known
in French, as the "mÃ©nage Ã  trois."</i>

749
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,760
<i>Shi--t.</i>

750
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,200
<i>Oxana's the only one working, uh...</i>

751
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,080
<i>Irena fell down the stairs.</i>

752
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,640
<i>Oh, what about you?</i>

753
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,680
<i>Who, me?</i>

754
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,480
<i>No... I don't do it for money. I just...</i>

755
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,840
<i>Well, we won't pay ya.</i>

756
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,160
<i>Oh...</i>

757
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,480
<i>Excuse me, uh, what's your name?</i>

758
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,000
<i>Wendy.</i>

759
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,840
<i>...you're gonna have
the greatest experience of your life...</i>

760
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
<i>up to you whether you wanna experience..</i>

761
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,120
<i>...to me and that big a deal.</i>

762
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,520
<i>- Do you promise?
- I swear to God.</i>

763
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,160
<i>OK.</i>

764
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,080
<i>But it costs triple!</i>

765
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,600
<i>- Shouldn't it be double?
- Yeah, it should.</i>

766
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,680
<i>Doc, if you please.</i>

767
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,000
<i>I guess.</i>

768
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,720
<i>Oxana.</i>

769
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,520
<i>Go easy on him, girls.</i>

770
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,600
<i>If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't believe it.</i>

771
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,920
<i>He would pump it up on a vacuum cleaner.</i>

772
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,640
<i>Yeah?</i>

773
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,760
<i>He said, every day he would just...</i>

774
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,040
<i>whatever he did,
he watched TV, he listened to the radio.</i>

775
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,120
<i>Now, he would atta... you know,
the attachment on a vacuum cleaner.</i>

776
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,280
<i>Now,
what do you call the thing that they...</i>

777
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,200
<i>- It's a nozzle.
- The nozzle.</i>

778
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,240
<i>Yeah, but it's like, for taking
the stuff off the corners of the couch.</i>

779
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,160
<i>- I mean why do you put your dick in it.
- It doesn't matter because</i>

780
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,160
<i>it stretched his dick, and his dick
kept getting bigger and bigger.</i>

781
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,760
<i>There's other ways. There's a
Chinese thing I heard about. It's a jar.</i>

782
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,960
<i>They put bees in it. You put it
on your schlong. The bees bite yer dick.</i>

783
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,120
<i>- Hello.
- It-it gets all swollen, huge.</i>

784
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,040
<i>Yeah, but, uh, where do you put it?</i>

785
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,120
<i>I don't know. It's good for show anyway.</i>

786
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,040
<i>Well, that makes so much sense.</i>

787
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,920
<i>Hirsch has been up there a long time.</i>

788
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,640
<i>Well, good for him.</i>

789
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,040
<i>Whoa, here he comes!</i>

790
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,720
<i>So...</i>

791
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,800
<i>- pipes still workin'?
- You could put it that way.</i>

792
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,600
<i>OK. Jesus, that's enough.</i>

793
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,480
<i>I do not know the
English word for what I feel.</i>

794
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,720
<i>- "Surprised"?
- I think it's called "lust," darling.</i>

795
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,040
<i>- "Love." That is close enough.
- Good, OK.</i>

796
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,160
<i>- I didn't know you had it in ya.
- I did.</i>

797
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,680
<i>Hirsch...</i>

798
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,600
<i>Hello. Oh...</i>

799
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,080
<i>OK. All right.</i>

800
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,000
<i>It's like a gum commercial.</i>

801
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,440
<i>- You've ruined me for any other man.
- It's OK, you'll get over it.</i>

802
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,760
<i>Call me.</i>

803
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,120
<i>- Bye.
- Thank you.</i>

804
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,680
<i>Hey, Hirsch...</i>

805
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
<i>Who knew you were a freak in bed.</i>

806
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,520
<i>Huh?</i>

807
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,760
<i>Wow, ya gotta feel great, no?</i>

808
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,440
<i>- I don't feel that great.
- Why the fuck not?</i>

809
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,240
<i>I-I never went out on my wife before,
it makes me feel like a piece of shit.</i>

810
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,920
<i>Hirschey, for Christ's sakes,
she been dead for ages.</i>

811
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,400
<i>We were married for 40 fuckin' years!
You don't get over that in five minutes.</i>

812
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,400

<i>Hirsch, listen,
you're gonna have to give me your pants.</i>

844
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,520
<i>Why?</i>

845
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,200
<i>Because she's naked.
She's gonna need somethin' to wear.</i>

846
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,120
<i>I'm not giving her my pants.
End of story.</i>

847
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,800
<i>Come on, she's got no clothes on.
Give her your pants.</i>

848
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,320
<i>You wanna give her some pants?
Give her your pants.</i>

849
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
<i>No, I'm not gonna give her my pants.</i>

850
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,320
<i>I gave her my jacket. My pants are
important to me. Gimme, give, come on.</i>

851
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,440
<i>What makes you the arbiter
of whose pants are important,</i>

852
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,760
<i>and whose pants are not important?</i>

853
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,840
<i>You don't need pants.
You sit in the car driving. What the...</i>

854
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,760
<i>- How the fuck you need pants to drive?
- I don't need pants?</i>

855
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,880
<i>I gotta go out and walk around.
Come on, give...</i>

856
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,160
<i>I'm not giving her my fucking pants!
End of story.</i>

857
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,520
<i>- OK. So, that's your final offer?
- I'm not making any offers.</i>

858
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,960
<i>OK, plan B... Doc!</i>

859
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,520
<i>Song, how're you doing?
Do you sell women's clothing here?</i>

860
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,200
<i>Do it look like it?</i>

861
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,400
<i>My friend just asked you a question,
a polite question.</i>

862
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,480
<i>Could you give him a polite answer?</i>

863
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,720
<i>Ay, hijo chaqueta. You no hear so good,
old man, or you just stupid?</i>

864
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,320
<i>- See that?
- Hey, your jab still looks pretty good.</i>

865
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,480
<i>- You think so?
- Yeah.</i>

866
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,600
<i>I thought I...
I didn't get my hips into it.</i>

867
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,880
<i>No, no, no, it had a nice snap to it.</i>

868
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,000
<i>Thanks for saying so.</i>

869
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,920
<i>He's OK.</i>

870
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,160
<i>- You need anything?
- Just my bill.</i>

871
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,680
<i>I think we should know
certain things about her.</i>

872
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,280
<i>Here she comes.</i>

873
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,600
<i>Hey, look at that, clothes fit.</i>

874
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,360
<i>- Feeling better?
- A little. Starvin'.</i>

875
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,920
<i>Ahem, so, Sylvia, why don't we, uh,
continue where we left off?</i>

876
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
<i>So I was standing, waiting for a cab.</i>

877
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,560
<i>This car pulls up. Nice car. Nice smile.
Asked me if I needed a ride.</i>

878
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,880
<i>I was late, so I said, "Sure."</i>

879
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,560
<i>Wow, you know, you shouldn't
accept rides from strangers.</i>

880
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,400
<i>- Go fuck yourself, all right?
- Hoo, ah, OK.</i>

881
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,080
<i>"Go fuck yerself," I like this girl.</i>

882
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,760
<i>There was another guy in the backseat
who I didn't see.</i>

883
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,440
<i>He tied me up, took me to this warehouse</i>

884
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,880
<i>There were two other guys there.
They were just laughing, whatever.</i>

885
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,680
<i>Pretty soon, I was naked, and, uh,
figure out the rest.</i>

886
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,760
<i>- So you never saw these guys before.
- Never.</i>

887
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,240
<i>What do you think,
I put myself in the trunk?</i>

888
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,560
<i>How's everybody doing over here?</i>

889
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,880
<i>Good, thank you, Alex.</i>

890
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
<i>Doc, I didn't know
you had so many friends.</i>

891
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,160
<i>Me too.</i>

892
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,280
<i>Well, let me know
if I can get you anything else.</i>

893
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,400
<i>I'm fine, thanks.</i>

894
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,120
<i>Anyway, I passed out for a while, and um</i>

895
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,560
<i>woke up naked in the trunk of a car.</i>

896
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,560
<i>Now I'm sittin' here with you three with
a friggin' Korean janitor outfit on.</i>

897
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,800
<i>I had a dog named Sylvia.</i>

898
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,400
<i>I loved that dog.
I think about her every day.</i>

899
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,480
<i>There's so goddamned much I wanna forget</i>

900
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,840
<i>Where was this warehouse?</i>

901
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,120
<i>Show me where you found the car,
and I'll show you the place.</i>

902
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,520
<i>We stole the car on Rodney Street,
belongs to the Jargoniew brothers.</i>

903
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,000
<i>Total degenerate lowlifes.</i>

904
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,120
<i>Animals.</i>

905
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
<i>Maybe we could do somethin'
about this situation.</i>

906
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,760
<i>So what do you guys wanna do about it?</i>

907
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,560
<i>What, you're gonna fuck 'em up
with a pair of pliers?</i>

908
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,280
<i>It's only the beginning.</i>

909
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,240
<i>- Holy shit. Who are you guys?
- Remember that?</i>

910
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,240
<i>- Oh, my baby, I've missed you.
- Mr. Hirsch...</i>

911
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,520
<i>- Remember me? I do this.
- Uh-huh.</i>

912
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,720
<i>- What time is it?
- I don't know. What time is it?</i>

913
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,840
<i>It's time...</i>

914
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,560
<i>to kick ass...</i>

915
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,880
<i>or chew gum.</i>

916
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,440
<i>And guess what?</i>

917
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,480
<i>I'm all outta gum.</i>

918
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,440
<i>- Hey, Val...
- Yeah.</i>

919
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,360
<i>It's like the old days, isn't it?</i>

920
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,360
<i>- No, it's better.
- Yeah, why?</i>

921
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,200
<i>Because this time, we can appreciate it.</i>

922
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,240
<i>- Yeah, that's right. That's the reason.
- See you soon.</i>

923
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,560
<i>I'll be right here.</i>

924
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,720
<i>- Yeah, OK, you see the place...
- Mm-hmm.</i>

925
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,360
<i>You tell us, and then you take off, OK?</i>

926
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,760
<i>We're just three people, walking
down the street, nothing suspicious.</i>

927
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,720
<i>This is it.</i>

928
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,040
<i>Around the corner.</i>

929
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,400
<i>OK, you need to go home now, Sylvia.</i>

930
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,040
<i>- No, I wanna watch.
- Oh, no, honey, nobody watches us work.</i>

931
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,880
<i>Besides, there may be
five or six guys in there, you know.</i>

932
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,920
<i>Just the two of us. It may not turn out
the way we would hope.</i>

933
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,560
<i>- All right, so what? I-I can help.
- Go home, get some rest.</i>

934
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,680
<i>- No.
- We can't know...</i>

935
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,800
<i>- what's on the other side of that door.
- No... No.</i>

936
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,200
<i>- I don't think she's gonna listen.
- No, she seems, uh, firm about it.</i>

937
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,480
<i>- She's not gonna leave.
- Listen, honey...</i>

938
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,480
<i>Why don't you wait here
about 10 minutes, and then come on in.</i>

939
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,720
<i>Why are you doing this for me?</i>

940
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,200
<i>I don't understand the question.</i>

941
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,080
<i>You don't even know me.</i>

942
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,240
<i>It's true,
but I know ya, at the same time.</i>

943
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,840
<i>- Makes me sick, what they did to you.
- They're fuckin' animals.</i>

944
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,920
<i>- There used to be consequences.
- Exactly.</i>

945
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,720
<i>They think they can do things like this
to people, and get away with it.</i>

946
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
<i>Well, we're the fuckin' consequences.</i>

947
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,640
<i>And now for my next trick...</i>

948
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,240
<i>Gimme those picks.</i>

949
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,560
<i>It's probably open.</i>

950
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,200
<i>You're right.</i>

951
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,800
<i>Hey, fellas, what's going on?</i>

952
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,880
<i>- Fuck did you get in here?
- We're friends of Sylvia.</i>

953
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,720
<i>Yeah, you remember Sylvia.
The naked girl you put in your trunk.</i>

954
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,920
<i>The fuck you know about... trunk!</i>

955
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,360
<i>All right...</i>

956
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,880
<i>Anybody else wanna get shot?</i>

957
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,320
<i>OK.</i>

958
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,800
<i>Remember, fellas...</i>

959
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,080
<i>You reap what you sow.</i>

960
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,040
<i>Yes, I'd like to report
a large cache of weapons and drugs.</i>

961
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,360
<i>What's the address here?</i>

962
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,600
<i>- It's Rodney Street.
- I know that. What-what number?</i>

963
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,680
<i>Oh, what's your number here?</i>

964
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,920
<i>I asked you a question.</i>

965
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,800
<i>- Go fuck yerself.
- Ooh...</i>

966
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,080
<i>I didn't hear the number.</i>

967
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,680
<i>- 172.
- 172.</i>

968
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,720
<i>172 Rodney.
Thank you so much. Have a great night.</i>

969
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,840
<i>You're your own worst fucking enemy.</i>

970
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,720
<i>Oh... oh, dear.</i>

971
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,440
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

972
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,480
<i>Good evening, gentlemen.</i>

973
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,400
<i>Remember her?</i>

974
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,920
<i>Belle of the ball.</i>

975
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,560
<i>I think it's time for us to exit.</i>

976
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,280
<i>Stage left.</i>

977
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,480
<i>- OK, Sylvie...
- Yeah?</i>

978
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,200
<i>You know, you got about eight minutes
before the cops call.</i>

979
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:11,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

980
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,480
<i>Good luck!</i>

981
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,320
<i>- Good luck, fellas.
- Enjoy.</i>

982
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,160
<i>You guys like the ballet, don't you?</i>

983
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
<i>"The Nutcracker" was my favorite.</i>

984
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,120
<i>Owwwww!</i>

985
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,000
<i>Here. Here's your gun back.</i>

986
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,400
<i>- Ahhhhh!
- I got blood all over my jacket.</i>

987
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,160
<i>Look at this.</i>

988
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,080
<i>You can wash them.</i>

989
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,520
<i>You use the biological stuff.</i>

990
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,600
<i>- It takes the stains right out.
- What the fuck is that, biological?</i>

991
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
<i>I'm telling you,
it'll take that stain right out.</i>

992
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,120
<i>No, you can't get these stains out,
no matter how many times you wash 'em.</i>

993
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,120
<i>A blood stain stays in.
You can't get this fucking stuff out.</i>

994
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,760
<i>We'll get you a new suit.</i>

995
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,080
<i>- A new suit?
- Yeah.</i>

996
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,960
<i>That's a different conversation.</i>

997
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,200
<i>What's going on here?</i>

998
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,920
<i>What's this?</i>

999
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,360
<i>Hey!</i>

1000
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,000
<i>- It's always somethin', ain't it?
- Yeah.</i>

1001
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,800
<i>- He got his last wish.
- Yeah.</i>

1002
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,320
<i>- We got to work together again.
- Yeah, we got to work together again.</i>

1003
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,520
<i>So...</i>

1004
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,920
<i>I think we should bury him.</i>

1005
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,920
<i>Hirsch.</i>

1006
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,360
<i>- Uh, you know where Nina Hirsch works?
- I think she's over there.</i>

1007
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,320
<i>- Hey, Nina, remember us?
- Sure. How's your pecker?</i>

1008
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,560
<i>It's all right.
Uh, listen, uh, your dad's dead.</i>

1009
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,680
<i>- What?
- We're sorry.</i>

1010
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,120
<i>But, how do you know he's dead?</i>

1011
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,520
<i>Well, we-we-we took him for a night out
is all, and well, you know, he died.</i>

1012
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,440
<i>Where is he?</i>

1013
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,880
<i>He's outside in a stolen sports car,
in the front seat.</i>

1014
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,440
<i>- See?
- He's still warm.</i>

1015
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,680
<i>It didn't happen, uh,
more than 30 minutes ago.</i>

1016
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,160
<i>- What were you guys doing?
- Having fun just like old times.</i>

1017
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,920
<i>- He went out with a bang.
- Is there a family plot or something?</i>

1018
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,960
<i>We thought we should bury him.</i>

1019
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,880
<i>You... you wanna bury him now?</i>

1020
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,760
<i>Tonight?</i>

1021
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,600
<i>Well, for us, it's gotta be tonight.</i>

1022
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,240
<i>They won't miss this.</i>

1023
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,680
<i>Give it to you, Hirsch.</i>

1024
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,160
<i>Here you go, my boy.</i>

1025
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,880
<i>I think Hirsch will be glad
to be next to your mother.</i>

1026
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,280
<i>He bought this plot when I was four.</i>

1027
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,800
<i>He told me...</i>

1028
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,920
<i>"Darlin', just come visit me from time
to time. Let me know how it's going."</i>

1029
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,320
<i>Dad, it's going OK.</i>

1030
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:13,640
<i>You taught me that the best thing
a person could be is of some use.</i>

1031
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,400
<i>You were of so much use to me.</i>

1032
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,160
<i>Always.</i>

1033
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,600
<i>Val, we should say something too.</i>

1034
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,640
<i>Would you do it.
I'm not good at stuff like this.</i>

1035
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:38,760
<i>Yeah.</i>

1036
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,240
<i>OK, I could do it.</i>

1037
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,520
<i>Uh, Hirsch was a good friend.</i>

1038
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,440
<i>I remember one time, uh,
we robbed this liquor store.</i>

1039
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,480
<i>And, he ran over a dog.</i>

1040
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,680
<i>He cried for two days over that dog.</i>

1041
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,440
<i>Anyway, he will be missed...</i>

1042
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,880
<i>by so many of us that God left behind.</i>

1043
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,240
<i>He was a witness to our lives.</i>

1044
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,920
<i>Not many of those left.</i>

1045
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,720
<i>So there's one less person on this earth</i>

1046
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,480
<i>who knows our name,
who remembers our childhood.</i>

1047
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,160
<i>Who shared in each moment as it passed.</i>

1048
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,960
<i>You know, they say, we die twice.</i>

1049
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,760
<i>Once, when the breath leaves our body,
and once...</i>

1050
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,240
<i>when the last person we know
says our name.</i>

1051
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,280
<i>And then...</i>

1052
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,840
<i>Hirsch's life will be forgotten,
like all the other poor...</i>

1053
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,200
<i>fucks that ever had the glory of livin'.</i>

1054
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,040
<i>Amen.</i>

1055
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,520
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

1056
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,000
<i>- What?
- Nothing. That was really good.</i>

1057
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,320
<i>It was good?</i>

1058
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,120
<i>- Best I ever heard.
- You think so?</i>

1059
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,240
<i>- Really good, bro.
- Fuck you.</i>

1060
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,040
<i>- Thank you, Valentine.
- Uh yeah well, it was nothing. I just..</i>

1061
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,520
<i>No, Valentine, listen to me...</i>

1062
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,960
<i>- Thank you.
- It's OK.</i>

1063
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,880
<i>Thank you.</i>

1064
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,800
<i>Good night.</i>

1065
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,440
<i>- Nothing you could say about that.
- Nah.</i>

1066
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:06,080
<i>So, uh... you gonna do my eulogy?</i>

1067
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,960
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

1068
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,520
<i>How much time I got left?</i>

1069
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,520
<i>Four hours, about.</i>

1070
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,680
<i>Well, I could use a steak. You hungry?</i>

1071
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,840
<i>- Yeah.
- Let's go.</i>

1072
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,880
<i>And after breakfast,
we'll get you a new suit.</i>

1073
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:54,200
<i>Then you can shoot me in the head,
so it doesn't fuck up my suit.</i>

1074
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,520
<i>That's right. I shoot you in the head.</i>

1075
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,400
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

1076
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,240
<i>Look at this. My car is still here.</i>

1077
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,080
<i>What, are you surprised?</i>

1078
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,800
<i>Who's gonna wanna take that
piece of shit?</i>

1079
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,160
<i>- Well, good morning, fellas.
- Hi, Alex.</i>

1080
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,840
<i>Now, are you two up early,
or are you going to bed late?</i>

1081
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,960
<i>And what's going on here
with all this dirt?</i>

1082
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,280
<i>- Yeah, well, you know...
- Gardenin'.</i>

1083
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,360
<i>We've been doing a spot of
late night gardenin'.</i>

1084
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,040
<i>- Huh.
- Oh, yeah, you should try it some time.</i>

1085
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,440
<i>Boy, you look at you, young lady. You're
pulling a long shift tonight, huh?</i>

1086
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,360
<i>Yeah, I don't sleep.</i>

1087
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,240
<i>I sort of like being awake when
everyone else is sleeping, you know?</i>

1088
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,400
<i>Gives me a sense of, um...</i>

1089
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,320
<i>- Being alive.
- Yes.</i>

1090
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,560
<i>- I know the feeling, believe me.
- OK, so, what'll it be, Doc?</i>

1091
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,240
<i>- Uh, two eggs over easy.
- Of course.</i>

1092
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:50,600
<i>And I will have a steak, waffles, uh,
Greek omelet, Greek salad, banana malt.</i>

1093
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,040
<i>- And another steak, and a coffee.
- And a coffee.</i>

1094
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,200
<i>- Oh, and a muffin.
- And a muffin.</i>

1095
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,680
<i>- If you don't mind.
- I don't mind.</i>

1096
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,640
<i>- You are a very hungry man, Val.
- Uh, I'm leaving on a long trip.</i>

1097
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,080
<i>Oh, just when
we're gettin' to know each other.</i>

1098
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,000
<i>Uh, yeah, ain't that too bad.</i>

1099
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,880
<i>- Hmm, I'll put that order right in.
- Yeah.</i>

1100
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,960
<i>I'm gonna take a wild guess here,</i>

1101
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,800
<i>but Alex, the waitress,
is your granddaughter, no?</i>

1102
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,880
<i>Yes.</i>

1103
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,080
<i>- You gotta tell her.
- I'm going to.</i>

1104
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,520
<i>Oh, yeah? Why haven't you told already?</i>

1105
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,640
<i>- I can't.
- How come?</i>

1106
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,000
<i>You can.</i>

1107
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,920
<i>Believe me.</i>

1108
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,880
<i>- The truth will set you free, brother.
- OK, but not today.</i>

1109
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,640
<i>- Then when?
- Tomorrow.</i>

1110
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:48,160
<i>- Tomorrow. You promise?
- Tomorrow, tell her everything.</i>

1111
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,600
<i>OK, tomorrow.</i>

1112
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,480
<i>My last meal.</i>

1113
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,920
<i>Yeah.</i>

1114
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,400
<i>- Don't go sentimental on me now.
- Excuse me.</i>

1115
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,680
<i>- Here you go.
- Yeah.</i>

1116
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,200
<i>Thank you.</i>

1117
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,840
<i>- So, Val...
- So, Alex...</i>

1118
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,160
<i>Do you mind if I sit?</i>

1119
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,040
<i>No, go ahead, please.</i>

1120
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,480
<i>So Doc comes in here
every morning, you know?</i>

1121
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,240
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1122
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,360
<i>And he always orders
the same exact thing.</i>

1123
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,640
<i>Oh, the tyranny of habit.</i>

1124
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,880
<i>It's me.</i>

1125
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,240
<i>Is it done?</i>

1126
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,520
<i>What is he like?</i>

1127
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,800
<i>I can't help but wonder about
most of my customers, but...</i>

1128
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,200
<i>- I wonder about him the most.
- Well, I don't know, you know...</i>

1129
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,280
<i>What do you, uh,
what do you imagine he's like?</i>

1130
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,240
<i>Please, mercy, is all I'm saying, mercy.
I know it was your only son. I know what</i>

1131
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,360
<i>that must be like, but...</i>

1132
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,880
<i>Please? Please?</i>

1133
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,240
<i>Please bring back my only son!
See how far "please" gets you!</i>

1134
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,320
<i>We're all out of mercy here.</i>

1135
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,280
<i>Why?</i>

1136
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,680
<i>He'll be dead soon enough. Just give him
a few more years. What's the difference?</i>

1137
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,520
<i>- What is the fucking difference?
- How's Alex, fuckface?</i>

1138
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,640
<i>What?</i>

1139
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,560
<i>Alex. You know who I'm talking about.</i>

1140
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,800
<i>I betcha my left nut,
you can see the bitch right this second.</i>

1141
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,600
<i>It would be a fucking shame
to see such a young honey get into</i>

1142
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:53,000
<i>an awful accident. Fuckin' waste, yeah?</i>

1143
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,040
<i>- You wouldn't.
- Oh, really?</i>

1144
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,920
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1145
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,160
<i>I imagine he's a man who knows
what it's like to be alone.</i>

1146
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
<i>To live life with a lot of regret.</i>

1147
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,280
<i>And, that maybe he comes here every day
just to be around other people.</i>

1148
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,120
<i>Even if it's only for a half an hour,
just, just to be around people.</i>

1149
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,080
<i>That's right. That's exactly right.
Sometimes...</i>

1150
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,880
<i>what we imagine
and the world aren't different things.</i>

1151
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,960
<i>Sometimes they're the same, exact thing.</i>

1152
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,200
<i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>

1153
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,160
<i>Finish this fucknut,
or accidents can, and will happen.</i>

1154
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,800
<i>I think your food is ready. You know,
I wish we could've talked more, Val.</i>

1155
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,520
<i>Me too.
It was nice sittin' here with you.</i>

1156
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,480
<i>Yeah, it was.</i>

1157
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,920
<i>Is this church open?</i>

1158
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,000
<i>Church is always open.</i>

1159
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:43,880
<i>Yeah?</i>

1160
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,080
<i>So, you start or do I start, I-I forgot.</i>

1161
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,680
<i>- Uh, you do.
- I do. Right, OK, so, um...</i>

1162
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,280
<i>- forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
- How long since your last confession?</i>

1163
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,080
<i>Um, 60 years, give or take a few.</i>

1164
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,000
<i>OK.</i>

1165
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,040
<i>Now, confess each and every serious sin
that separates you from Christ.</i>

1166
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,920
<i>Oh, no, no, or we'd be here forever.</i>

1167
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,760
<i>Father, can we just deal
with what happened today.</i>

1168
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,240
<i>So far...</i>

1169
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,040
<i>I shot a guy in the kneecap,
and one in the arm.</i>

1170
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,960
<i>I, uh...</i>

1171
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,560
<i>stole a bunch of prescription drugs,
and a sweet-ass car.</i>

1172
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,480
<i>Punched a Korean store clerk
in the face, and took his clothes.</i>

1173
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,200
<i>And fucked a Russian hooker, four times.</i>

1174
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,280
<i>That was all...</i>

1175
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,560
<i>- today?
- Uh...</i>

1176
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,840
<i>since noon yesterday, yeah.</i>

1177
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,120
<i>But I did some good things too, Father.
I-I, uh...</i>

1178
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,160
<i>I buried a friend. I, uh...</i>

1179
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,920
<i>helped this young woman
take her life back, and, uh...</i>

1180
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,120
<i>I eased my best friend's pain.</i>
