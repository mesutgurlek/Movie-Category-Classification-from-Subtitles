corridor of this building.

00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,425
Why don't you go get one?

160
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:13,929
Okay. I'll just
fill out a req form...

161
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,263
You're not listening.

162
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:16,806
Just go get one.

163
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:18,641
Those req forms
are for bureaucrats.

164

Actually, get two.
That dinosaur on my desk
is useless to me.

165
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:31,236
Agent Hanssen,
my name is Eric.

166
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:33,613
No, your name
is "clerk."

167
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,618
My name is "sir" or "boss,"
if you can manage.

168
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:40,161
Yes, sir.

169
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:42,580
And if I ever catch you
in my office again,

173
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,213
I ordered ours a month ago.

Sir?

175

Sir, you could fall.

00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,562
(MOCKINGLY)
I won't fall.

177
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm very coordinated.

Trying to re-route
a phone line to get
Internet access.

00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,114
I can get an IT guy in here
to do that for you, sir.

180
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,997
My Lord, you are as dumb as
a bag of hammers, aren't you?

181
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,710
Yes, let's bring in
an IT guy,

182
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,837
making $35,000 a year,

183
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,882
and give him access
to hard drives

184
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,718
that a foreign agent
would pay millions for.

185
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,389
We're supposed to be
protecting the Bureau
from electronic infiltration.

186
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,063
So, what kind of
sites do you like?

187
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:44,608
On the Internet.
Are there sites...
Why?

188
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,609
I don't know, just...

189
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,862
I've never seen anyone
stand on top of their desk
to get online before.

190
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,492
Do you pray the rosary
every day?

191
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,286
Hmm?

192
00:15:56,327 --> 00:16:00,248
Your file says
you prepped at Gonzaga,
with the Jesuits.

193
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:01,666
That's right. I did.

194
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,920
So, do you pray
the rosary every day?

195
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:08,338
Not every day, no.

196
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:10,173
You should.

197
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:14,511
You still want

These are the greatest
pens in the world.

200
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,396
I would never write
with anything else.

201
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:31,651
Sure.

202
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,530
I won Boy Scout merit
badges in every category
except riflery.

203
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,491
I haven't been to confession
since high school.

204
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:40,535
There are several words
I constantly misspell.

205
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,037
My favorite drink
is a vodka tonic.

206

And I'm the only male
in the last four
generations of my family

who hasn't served
in the military.

What is your drink then?

209
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:52,462
Gin?

210
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,547
Scotch.

211
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:59,886
It's against Bureau policy
for an agent to consume
alcohol, even off-duty.

212
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,054
Did you know that?
Yes, I did.

213
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:05,808
Because an FBI agent
is never off-duty.

214

That comes from
Director Freeh.

She likes to know she can

She a Catholic girl?

221
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,951
No. Sort of a lapsed
Protestant, actually.

222
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,537
She's East German.

223
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,664
Big fan of Christmas
plays, though.

224

about that, won't we?

you transfer into something
with a higher profile?

Because I never cared
about making headlines.

Okay, help us.
What do we do?

300
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:30,619
First, we drop ACS,
which is a relic.

301

There's not nearly
enough bandwidth.

302

That's why
you've got agents

who still keep
sensitive information
in cardboard boxes.

Start with Linux A-B servers,
which puts us into Red Hat.

IP routers
throughout the building.

Dynamic IP addresses
to hide the system using
the Invicta prototype.

Would it be easier
if I sent this in a memo?

Yes, it would.
Fine. On your desk
in the morning.

with the appropriate
systems managers
at the CIA, DIA, NSA,

and the intel agencies
of each armed service.

Yes, sir.

00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:20,790
They're all
ahead of us on IT.
We have to study them.

317
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:24,793
Would you mind if we
book those appointments
through me, Bob?

318
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,628
What for?

319
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:28,213
Just protocol.

320
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,590
Of course.

321
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,217
And then we switch
offices, right?

322
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,177
Sure.

323
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:37,388
Perfect.
We're fighting crime
with 19th-century technology,

324
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,390
and he's worried
about protocol.

325
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:42,685
Set up those meetings.
Leave it up to him,
they'll never happen.

326
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:43,769
Sir?

327
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:46,063
That was turf protection
you were just watching
in there.

328
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:48,982
Didn't you spot it?
Organizational arrogance.

329
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:51,568
"No, we don't want to learn
anything from the CIA.

330
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:53,153
"We want the CIA
answering to us."

331
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:57,198
You know what's going on
behind that door?

332
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,449
No, sir.

333
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,536
Analysts looking
for a spy inside the
intelligence community.

334
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:04,079
Highest clearance.

335
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:07,249
But there aren't any
CIA officers in there.
You know why?

336
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:10,377
Because it's a CIA officer
we're trying to build
a case against.

337
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,255
Now, could the mole be
someone from the Bureau
and not the CIA?

338
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:15,298
Of course.

339
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,050
Are we actively pursuing
that possibility?

340
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,259
Of course not.

341
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,845
'Cause we're the Bureau,
and the Bureau knows all.

342
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:32,439
Cooperation is
counter-operational.
And that's the mentality.

343
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:35,692
Of course, the enemies
of this country
aren't so picky.

344
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,820
They'll work with anyone
who shares their hatred of us.

345
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:41,864
Bureau hasn't learned
that lesson yet.

346
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:54,334
He keeps some paintings
in a conference room on 8.

347
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,835
I want you to get
one of them for me.

348
00:25:56,794 --> 00:26:00,047
Sir?
It's two men on a boat.
I want it.

349
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:04,093
What? You mean Agent Garces?
These are his paintings.

350
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,886
Stop thinking
like a clerk.

351
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,638
They're sitting
in storage.

352
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,474
It's two guys on a boat.

353
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:16,229
BURROUGHS: Okay.
Where was Hanssen
on March 7, 1991?

354
00:26:16,312 --> 00:26:19,482
The file has him
making a drop at Ellis
at 6:30 p.m.

355
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:27,072
He badged in at 8:27 a.m.
Badged out at 12:45.

356
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:29,825
Badged back in at 1:45,

357
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,369
and badged out again at 5:36.

358
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:35,955
Okay. Let's take a look
at August 12, 1993.

359
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:45,506
You know why the Soviet
Empire collapsed?

360
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:49,718
"Good morning"?

361
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,803
I made a career
studying them.

362
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:53,972
They were smarter
than us.

363
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,558
More devious,
more determined.

364
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:00,144
So why did they fail?

365
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:04,899
Godlessness.

366
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,443
Atheism.

367
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,031
I'm on my way
to morning Mass.

368
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,824
You do remember
what Mass is, yes?

369
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:18,369
The Jesuits at Gonzaga
taught you that much,
didn't they?

370
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:20,163
Sir, my grandfather
was a deacon.

371
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:24,959
Well, congratulations.

372
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:28,670
Now it's time
to join the varsity.

373
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:36,427
I saw a woman from
Planned Parenthood
on television this morning.

374
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:40,348
A lesbian, naturally.
Defending gay marriage.

375
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,310
I almost ripped the cable
out of the wall.

376
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,354
Bet she was
wearing pants, huh?

377
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:56,696
Will your children
be Jesuit-taught,
as you were?

378
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:01,576
I don't know yet.
That conversation's
still a few years away.

379
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:03,202
It shouldn't be.

380
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:04,537
Sir, I'm GS-11.

381
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:06,538
We need a second salary
before we can start having...

382
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,041
What is money
compared with
the blessings of family?

383
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,417
Tell me.

384
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:13,670
My wife was the one...
Good to see you, Bob.

385
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,383
It was my wife
who first brought me here.

386
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:19,425
Bonnie.

387
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:23,971
I was a Lutheran when we met,
and not much of one.

388
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:26,682
She saved my life.

389
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,017
Come.

390
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,479
We attend St. Catherine's
on Sundays.

391
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:21,482
It's a traditional
Latin service,

392
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,192
then a big
family lunch after.

393
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,653
You think Juliana
might like that?

394
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:29,615
I don't know. Maybe.

395
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:33,201

Was that your wife?

400
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:54,346
No one else
even has this number.

401
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:59,809
Well, perhaps
you should give her a call.
It might be important.

402
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,646
No, it's okay.
It can wait.

<i>it isn't to discuss
what's on Oprah</i>

405
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,203
It means I need
to speak with you.

406
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:23,247
Did you pick me
because I was Catholic?

407
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,373
I'm sorry?

408
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,793
Did you think
he would trust me
because I was Catholic?

409
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,212
Jesus, Eric.

410
00:30:32,172 --> 00:30:34,758
We picked you
because of your facility
with computers.

411
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:35,967
We thought it would
impress him.

Uh-huh.

413
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,303
We also thought
he might like
that 50-page proposal

414
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,681
you've been pushing
all over the Bureau.

he got his hands
on a copy, right?

416
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,059
So?

417
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,769
You got pages for me?

418

We're going to be
searching his car.

419
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:56,236
It'll involve you
keeping him out of the office
for a few hours.

472
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:59,042
More than I ought to.

473
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:05,047
Oh! Shoot.
Almost forgot.

474
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:07,091
I have something for you.

475
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,260
It's everything I could get
on Parkinson's.

476
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,179
Downloaded it
last night.

477
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:16,391
Been quite a bit of progress
in the last few years.

478
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:18,351
Didn't know
if you were up on it.

479
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:20,645
Is there someone
in your family
who has Parkinson's?

480
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,271
No. No, thank God.

481
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:31,947
You know, sir, I think
you're misunderstood.

482
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,531
Oh? By whom?

483
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:37,493
By whoever gives out
window offices, for one.

484
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,789
Oh, that's all right.

485
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:45,626
I think I made
too much fuss of all that.

486
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,465
I'll be gone so soon anyway,
what good would a window
do me now?

487
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:55,468
Fifty-seven in two months,
that's mandatory retirement.

488
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:56,803
(DOG BARKING)

489
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:07,187
No, it's fine.

490
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:08,981
It's time.

491
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:12,817
I could stay there
another hundred years,

492
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,778
and still just be
an afterthought.

493
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:19,949
The perks go to the guys
who play the game,

494
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:21,993
the ones who politick.

495
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:29,333
I knew a long time ago
I didn't have
the stomach for that.

496
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:36,881
But I'll get my portrait
on that 25-year wall, right?

497
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:39,801
Now, that's something.

498
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:44,054
Doesn't really matter
much, does it?

499
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:48,559
The judgments of other men?

500
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,691
I know what I've done.

501
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:28,303
What's the trouble?
I want to see
what you got on this guy.

502
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:32,516
Come again?
His Internet postings,
the e-mails.

503
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,725
Your case.

504
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,686
Why?
Because I don't think
you have one.

505
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:42,274
I can read you in.
I'm authorized to do that.

506
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,027
But it would only put you
at greater risk.
Of what?

507
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,236
What the hell
is all this?

508
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,572
The guy doesn't drink,
doesn't tell dirty jokes.

509
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:52,075
Goes to church every day,
his wife loves him,
so do his grandkids.

510
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,868
And why the hell
would you hand
a new division

511

to a guy who's retiring
in two months,

00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,372
especially if he's
under investigation?

You through?

514
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,208
You know, I think
this whole thing
is cooked.

515
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,251
I think he keeps
shooting his mouth off
about the Bureau

516
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:03,627
and nobody knows
what to do with him,

517
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:05,963
so we tag him as
a deviant and run him
out of the building.

518
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:07,256
It's bullshit.

519
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:09,216

it's Kenneth Starr
all over again,

looking for the blue dress.

521

You've come to
admire him, I see.

522
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:19,142
Yes.

523
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:20,768
Respect him?

524
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,186
Yes.

525
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,564
Well, that was
inevitable.

526
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,817
For our purposes,
it was sort of necessary.

527
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:32,237
But he's a traitor, Eric.

528
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:37,158
He started spying
for the Russians,
we think, in 1985.

529
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:44,039
He's given them
military secrets,
intelligence secrets.

530
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,292
He gave them our
Continuity of Government
Program,

531
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:49,002
which told them
where the President
would be taken

532
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,088
during a nuclear
or terrorist attack.

533
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:55,050
And the Vice President.
And the Congress.
And the Cabinet.

534
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,637
The damage he's done
to the U.S. Government
is in the billions.

535
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,597
But that's just
the money part.

536
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,641
He's also
given up lives.

Irrelevant, but true.

552
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,316

No.

then went home.

No.

He does a lot of things,

Why don't we just
arrest him?
Can't do that.

587

He knows the names
and locations of every source
we've ever turned.

Sir.

591
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:01,470
Director wants him

That would give you

Don't you think

See you, Dean.
Thanks for coming in, Rich.

00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,363
Yeah.
You're driving him?

599
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,739
Yeah.
Good.

600
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:24,033
We need him out of the office
for at least three hours.

601
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,285
That's when we'll be

Okay.

00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,997
How long will it take you
to download the data card
off his Palm Pilot?

603
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,958
Twenty, 30 minutes,
depending on the level
of encryption.

604
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,752
But you can't.
He never lets it
out of his sight.

605
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,548
Assuming we can separate him
from it, 20 to 30 minutes.

606
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:41,841
Okay.

607
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:50,474
What's this?

608
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:52,184
You want to be
read in, right?

609
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:57,021
Wait.

610
00:42:58,231 --> 00:43:00,149
What if he's smarter
than I am?

611
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:06,321
I've never misread anybody
this badly before.

612
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:09,908
Except maybe you.

613
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:15,580
A couple of years ago,

614
00:43:16,748 --> 00:43:19,750
the Bureau put together
a task force.

615
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,505
Lots of assets
had been disappearing.

616
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:29,509
Sources like Motorin,
Martynov. Dozens of them,
vanishing.

617
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:34,180
So this task force was
formed to find the mole
who was giving them up.

618
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:38,017
Our best analysts poring
over data for years
looking for the guy,

619
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:40,978
and they could never
quite find him.

620
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,358
Guess who we put in charge
of the task force?

621
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:53,365
He was smarter

Actually,
I can live with that part.

623

It's the idea
that my entire career
has been a waste of time,

624
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:04,959
that's the part I hate.

all been paid to do,

Hi.

You're back.

657
00:46:08,572 --> 00:46:11,450
Boss. When did you
get here?

658
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,493
BONNIE: Very disappointed
in you, young man.

Leaving your bride all alone

Not good, Eric.
Where were you?

661
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,460
My mother fell.
I had to go see her.

662

Oh.

663
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:25,629
Did she break anything?

664
00:46:25,754 --> 00:46:28,131
No. Just
bumped her head.

665
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:30,384
That's awful.
Yeah.

666
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:32,594
Write down their address
for me, would you?

667
00:46:32,886 --> 00:46:34,304
I'd like to send
some flowers.

That's very kind
of you, boss.

We couldn't reach you
on your pager.

On your hip 24l7,
right?

671
00:46:42,812 --> 00:46:44,688
Yeah, I know.
The battery died.

672
00:46:45,064 --> 00:46:47,024
Sorry, honey.
I should have called.
It's okay.

673
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:51,027
Juliana was just telling us
what it was like to grow up

Oh, yeah?

It piques my curiosity,

Bonnie, you really
didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

It's just leftovers.

I guess I just couldn't
stand the thought

681
00:47:10,003 --> 00:47:13,590
of you two ordering
from that Peking Wall
place again.

682

Even Chinese people
can't eat Chinese
every night, Eric.

683
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:22,306
Besides, how is this
tiny thing going to give you
a house full of babies,

684
00:47:22,348 --> 00:47:24,725
if you don't put some
protein in her diet?

685
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:33,400
Would you like
to say grace, Eric?

Sweetheart?

687
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,664
I'm sorry, Jule.
I didn't invite them,
obviously.

688

But they thought
it would be okay, Eric.

You have to have boundaries,
even with a boss.

And what was that
bullshit about your mom
bumping her head?

691
00:47:58,339 --> 00:47:59,882
It's complicated.

all day, Eric.

It's like you're someone else

Maybe you want me
to be someone else, too.

Maybe you want me to be
Bonnie or something.

705

Knock it off, Jule.

706
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,511
No, that'd be easier
for you, wouldn't it?

If I were more of an FBI
kind of wife, like she is.

you been out here?

Did I ever
quit anything?
Yeah.

Nothing.
He just shrugged.

He knew I was scared,

Hi.

1245
01:32:58,272 --> 01:32:59,398
Is everything okay?

1246
01:33:00,024 --> 01:33:01,108
Yeah.

1247
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:13,078
Everything's fine.

1248
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,626
I'm sorry.

1249
01:33:31,219 --> 01:33:33,263
PLESAC: Can I give you
some advice, Bob?

1250
01:33:38,101 --> 01:33:39,810
I've been in
on a few of these now.

1252

Aldrich Ames.

1253
01:33:44,356 --> 01:33:46,275
It goes a lot easier
if you cooperate.

1254
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:47,818
On you.

1255
01:33:48,443 --> 01:33:49,528
On your family.

1256
01:33:49,611 --> 01:33:53,114
(CHUCKLES) You really
ought to do an overhaul
on your GPS units, Dean.

1257
01:33:53,698 --> 01:33:56,659
They throw off
a signal burst
through the radio.

1258
01:33:57,118 --> 01:33:58,661
I heard it coming
through mine for weeks.

1259
01:33:58,744 --> 01:34:01,288
Even if all you give them
is why you did it,

1260
01:34:01,831 --> 01:34:03,374
it buys you some goodwill.

1261
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:06,418
Well, that's what
Ames did at first.

1262
01:34:07,252 --> 01:34:08,337
Just gave up
the why.

1263
01:34:08,378 --> 01:34:10,505
That mustn't have
taken long.

1264
01:34:13,216 --> 01:34:15,593
All Ames cared about
was the money.

1265
01:34:16,552 --> 01:34:18,721
Why else would he
have done it?

1266
01:34:19,263 --> 01:34:21,515
It's not so hard
to guess, is it?

1267
01:34:22,308 --> 01:34:24,310
Considering the human ego.

1268
01:34:28,313 --> 01:34:32,484
Can you imagine,
sitting in a room with a
bunch of your colleagues,

1269
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:37,071
everybody trying to guess
the identity of a mole

1270
01:34:37,322 --> 01:34:40,283
and all the while,
it's you they're after,

1271
01:34:41,117 --> 01:34:43,202
you they're looking for?

1272
01:34:45,037 --> 01:34:46,121
That must be

1273
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:48,665
very satisfying,
wouldn't you think?

1274
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:54,087
Or maybe
he considered himself
a patriot.

1275
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:57,256
Maybe he saw it
as his duty

1276
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:59,800
to show us how lax
our security was.

1277
01:34:59,842 --> 01:35:01,927
We can't rule that out
as a possibility.

1278
01:35:02,178 --> 01:35:03,137
Or maybe he...

1279
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,397
Oh, what good does
speculating do? He spied.

1280
01:35:17,442 --> 01:35:18,568
The why

1281
01:35:19,527 --> 01:35:21,112
doesn't mean a thing.

1282
01:35:22,113 --> 01:35:23,405
Does it?

1283
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:26,283
No, I guess
it doesn't.

Yeah.

1289
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,625
Funny about those things.

1290
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,545
He thanked the CIA, and
the U.S. Attorney's office,

1291
01:36:25,421 --> 01:36:27,422
and the Council for
Intelligence Policy,

1292
01:36:27,506 --> 01:36:30,801
but he couldn't thank the guy
we put behind that desk.

1293
01:36:31,426 --> 01:36:33,261
I didn't expect him to.

1294
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,390
I'm headed over
to the field office.

1295
01:36:37,473 --> 01:36:40,434
We still have
two Russian IO's
unaccounted for.

1296
01:36:40,685 --> 01:36:43,062
That mean you won't be
headed over there with me?

1297
01:36:44,188 --> 01:36:45,939
I thought I'd
go home instead.

1298
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:51,027
You're going to make
agent, Eric. It's set now.

1299
01:36:51,278 --> 01:36:52,612
Isn't that
what you wanted?

1300
01:36:52,988 --> 01:36:53,905
It was.

1301
01:36:54,614 --> 01:36:58,659
Until you came over
to my apartment and saw
the TV dinners and no cat?

1302
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,911
No.

1303
01:37:00,036 --> 01:37:02,246
Most of our agents
are married, you know.

1304
01:37:02,746 --> 01:37:04,790
All their spouses get used
to the life eventually.

So will Juliana.

1306
01:37:09,002 --> 01:37:10,545
I don't think
I want her to.

1307
01:37:14,257 --> 01:37:15,216
Oh.

1308
01:37:17,635 --> 01:37:19,178
That's different.

1309
01:37:21,055 --> 01:37:22,098
Yeah.

what you did here, right?

That was the worst spy
in American history
you brought down.

1312

Now you're just
gonna walk away?

1313
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,069
Can you think
of a better time
to walk away?

1314
01:37:36,152 --> 01:37:37,403
Nope.

1315
01:37:40,323 --> 01:37:41,449
So...

1316
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,419
You think it'd be
okay if I...

1317
01:37:55,378 --> 01:37:57,171
Oh, I'd say
you earned it.
