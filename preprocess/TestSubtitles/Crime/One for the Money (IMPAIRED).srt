00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:08,297
and some <i>stunad</i> comes along in a car
and breaks his leg that God gave him.

302
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:12,676
Then maybe you can stand on my stoop
and tell me you understand.

303
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,763
Okay, but maybe I could just give you
my number, you know and...

304
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,350
A gun? Jesus,
what is this world coming to?

305
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:24,187
Does your mother know
that you're carrying a gun, Stephanie Plum?

306
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,695
That went well.

<i>The only other person who wants to find
Joe Morelli more than I do...</i>

309
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,661
- Hey, Eddie, what's up?
<i>- ...is my old friend, Eddie Gazarra.</i>

310
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,246
I like the new office.

311
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,873
You're moving up in the world, Eddie.
Good for you.

312
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,209
We both know why you called,
so just get to the point.

313
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,503
The point is, I was on the receiving end
of a baffling phone call,

314
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,921
which I am trying to understand.

315
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,550
Hey! That's going to leave a water mark.

316
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,928
It's laminated, Eddie.
It's like watering a fake plant. Relax.

317
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,598
Maybe I'd relax better...
Would you please get off my desk?

318
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,727
Maybe I'd relax better
if I didn't get a call from my wife.

319
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,979
- Shirley the whiner?
- Hey, hey, hey.

320
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,440
That's my wife and your cousin,

321
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,442
who herself got a call from Lucille Plum.

322
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,653
Vinnie's wife?
You people gotta stop gossiping.

323
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,321
What is wrong with everybody?

324
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,656
What's wrong is we're worried.

325
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,115
You shouldn't be anywhere near
the Morelli thing.

326
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,242
Hey, I have as much right to go after
Morelli as anybody.

327
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,911
You don't know anything about the case.

328
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,038
I know the victim's name is Ziggy Kuleska.

329
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,207
I know he was shot by an off-duty Morelli.

330
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,376
I know the judge posted
bail at half a mill,

331
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,294
and I know Vinnie decided to
put the money up, thinking,

332
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,504
"Joe, he's not gonna screw me."

333
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,923
Wrong. He skips and, as of yesterday,

334
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,676
Morelli was holed up on the third floor
of the Gold Cup factory

335
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,135
with access to a borrowed car.

336
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,137
So now he's probably long gone.

337
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,431
- Proud of yourself?
- Very.

338
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,600
And I know he used a personal weapon.

339
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,435
Hydra-Shok with a .45.

340
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,896
Goes in like a BB out like a potato.

341
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,649
So, that's what I got.

342
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,276
- You're going after him, aren't you?
- Damn skippy.

343
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,120
This is Morelli's statement.
Merry Christmas and you're welcome.

344
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,126
That's Carmen Sanchez.
She's a working girl, mostly Stark Street.

345
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,003
- Says she called him for help.
- Yeah, Morelli got to her apartment,

346
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,755
says Ziggy fired on him first.

347
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,881
He's claiming self-defense.

348
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,675
Trouble is, Carmen's not around
to corroborate.

349
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,552
Says there was another guy there.

350
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,970
Yeah, we can't find him either.

351
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,305
And there's zero evidence
Ziggy ever had a gun.

352
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:23,765
It looks bad.

353
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,603
Okay, this'll work.

354
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,189
Hookers, they always know something.

355
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,941
Can you spare a dime?

356
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,902
She looks like my parole officer.

357
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,654
I don't know. She's ain't coming...

358
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,697
- Hell.
- Here she comes.

359
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,490
No. Now don't go pretend
to be on the phone.

360
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,117
Answer your damn phone. Answer.

361
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,079
Yeah. Anyway, you'd see how fast the
laws would be changed if I was president.

362
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,499
If I was the president, I'd be like,
"This is some change you can believe in."

00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,008
- Excuse me.
- I'm on the phone.

367
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,554
- I'm looking for a girl.
- No. You need to keep it moving.

368
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,432
Yeah, we're strictly dickly,
but good luck, though.

369
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,517
No, no, I mean...

370
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,772
I'm looking for this girl.
Do you know her? Carmen Sanchez?

371
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,857
- Okay, bye.
- Goodbye. Bye.

372
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,360
Finally, somebody gives a shit
about Carmen.

373
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,113
I need to talk to her about Joe Morelli.

374
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,325
You want to talk about a cop?
Look where you're at.

375
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,787
It's important. I really
need to talk to him.

376
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,582
- Girl. He got you knocked up.
- No.

377
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,542
Well, I can't help you with the cop,

378
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:36,087
but you want to know shit about Carmen,
talk to the boyfriend.

379
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:40,717
Yeah! You better not be thinking about
asking her to go for a ride.

380
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,011
You ask me. This is my corner, son.

381
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,638
Who's her boyfriend?

382
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,724
Benito Ramirez. Stark Street Gym.

383
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,937
Just like that?
Giving out details to the white girl?

384
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,899
No, no, no. It's good.
I'm good. I promise. Trust me.

385
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,196
Thank you. This gym right here? Thank you.

386
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,366
What did you do that for?

387
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,410
The girl was blocking my sign.

388
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,423
Come on. Come on. Give it all you got, man.

389
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,343
When I fought, we used brass knuckles
and baseball bats,

390
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,887
not these padded gloves, you nancies.

391
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,266
Hey, Girl Scout, what happened?
You lose your troop?

392
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,103
Jimmy Alpha, proprietor.
Single, Libra. How can I be of help?

393
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,313
Stephanie Plum, recovery agent.

394
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,899
A bounty hunter, huh?

395
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,278
The quicker picker-upper.

396
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,491
Hey, Shawn! Shawn! One, one, elbow.
Come on, harder, harder.

397
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,493
I've seen harder hits
at a sweet 16 pillow fight.

398
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,746
Is there somewhere else
we could go to talk?

399
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,125
Yeah, sure.

400
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,503
Too much testosterone for you, Officer?

401
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,882
No. Not an officer. Not a cop.

402
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:08,430
So, Mr. Alpha, I'm going after a guy
named Joe Morelli.

403
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,891
Well, I don't know him. That's the truth.

404
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,851
Actually, Joe is not the
guy I'm looking for.

405
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,352
Yeah, but that's what you just said.

406
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,146
How can I help you if you're not
being honest with me?

407
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,191
- He killed a guy named Ziggy Kuleska.
- Ziggy Kuleska.

408
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,319
You know, when I first met him,

409
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,987
I didn't know which name
to make fun of first.

410
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,489
What a ridiculous name, huh?
What a dirt bag.

411
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,825
He tried to horn in on
one of my deals with a fighter.

412
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,244
- Benito Ramirez?
- Yeah, Benito.

413
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,414
I took in Benito when he was just a kid,
14 years old.

414
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,667
I gave him all my time, made sure
he ate right, gave him a place to crash.

415
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,545
Well, I'm looking for Benito's girlfriend,
Carmen Sanchez.

416
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,340
All right. First, you're looking for
Morelli, then you're looking for Benito,

417
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,507
and now you're looking for Carmen.

418
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,718
If you're trying to confuse me,
you're doing a great job of it.

419
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,261
Just pick one.

420
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,513
Carmen.

421
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,558
Look, can I be honest with you?

422
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,394
Sometimes I don't even know
what to do with Benito.

423
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,729
You know what I mean?

424
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,899
Look, I wish I could be more help to you,
but I gotta go.

425
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:06,404
You know, I'd drop this if I were you,
because these guys got a taste for violence,

426
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,865
which I personally don't condone,
but what are you gonna do?

427
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,033
You know what I mean?

428
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,125
Mr. Ramirez?

429
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,171
Get up.

430
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,343
- Who are you?
- I need to ask you a few questions.

431
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,388
Then you need to step into my office.

432
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,061
Does he need help?

433
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,903
My name is Stephanie Plum.
I'm a bond-recovery agent.

434
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,905
Pretty fancy title.

435
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,075
Wow! That's quite a grip.

436
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,329
Jimmy Alpha told me to talk to you.

437
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,918
You need me to beat the shit
out of somebody?

438
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,714
No. Thank you.
That's a very nice offer, though.

439
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,299
I'm trying to find Carmen Sanchez.

440
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,844
Then we have a lot to talk about. Let's go.

441
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,892
- Okay.
- What's your problem?

442
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,936
You know what? I'm supposed to
be meeting Sergeant Gazarra

443
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,605
down at the station,
so I'm just going to get going.

444
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,861
If you keep lying to me,
I'll cut you up and sell you for parts.

- Oh, God!

448
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,472
- What the hell were you doing?
- Looking for you.

449
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,892
Yeah, well, congratulations, you found me.
You also blew my cover.

450
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,979
You got to stop grabbing at me.

451
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,023
- Knock it off!
- Jesus Christ!

452
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,817
I am so close to blowing your head off
right now, you don't even know.

453
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,529
And who would blame me?
You shot an unarmed man, you skipped bail.

454
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,491
Why are you still moving?

455
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,825
'Cause I don't think you're gonna shoot me.

456
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,535
Think again, Morelli.

457
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,663
I don't have to.

458
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,083
You could've shot Ramirez back there,
but what did you do?

459
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,418
You hit him with your pocketbook.

460
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,504
I, on the other hand,
have not provoked you in any way.

461
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,881
As far as you're concerned,
I am always provoked.

462
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:33,885
All right, correction.
I have not provoked you recently, right?

463
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,721
Steph. Come on, will you?

464
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,100
Would you please not shoot me? It's me.

465
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,185
Would you please not shoot me?

466
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,522
Fine.

467
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,525
- Will you come into custody then?
- No.

468
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,778
- You're a lunatic.
- God damn it, Joe! You owe me.

469
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,280
I owe you? How do you figure?
I saved your ass back there.

470
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,533
Saved my ass? I was fine.
I had it handled.

471
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,909
The guy's been charged
with rape three times,

472
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,286
and all three times he walked,
because the vics disappear.

473
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,498
- Yes. So consider your ass saved.
- You're watching Ramirez? Why?

474
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,708
You kidding me?

475
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,545
I gave you my gun. Come on.
Give me something.

476
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,884
- I'll give you something.
- Give me something I can use.

477
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,597
All right, you got one question
because I feel sorry for you.

478
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,266
Hurry up, make it good.

479
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,894
Who's Carmen?

480
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,689
- She's my informant.
- And?

481
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,066
And, in exchange for information,
I protect her.

482
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,735
I need to know what happened.
I owe her that.

483
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:37,407
I think Ramirez made her disappear.
I had been watching from across the street

484
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,576
trying to get a read on it,
until you came along

485
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,369
and I had to blow the whole place up.

486
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,830
Here, don't monkey around with that.

487

That sweatshirt makes you look
like the Unabomber.

Yeah, what can I say? I'm a wanted man.

489

Hey! Keep your voice down.

492
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,440
Hey, so I gave you one question
back there, right?

493
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,692
How come you didn't ask if I'm innocent?

494
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,614

I sold him a plasma for the Super Bowl.

there's two barrels back there by the door.

1238
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,533
One's heavy, so use a dolly, roll it,
