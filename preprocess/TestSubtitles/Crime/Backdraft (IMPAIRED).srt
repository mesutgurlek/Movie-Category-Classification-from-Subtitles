00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:47,546
Explosion lit him up so bright,
left his shadow on the wall.

787
00:58:47,634 --> 00:58:50,865
Still shy about rolling up
your sleeves, Shadow?

788
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:52,825
Show him your stomach.

789
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:57,271
The funny thing
about firemen,

790
00:58:57,314 --> 00:58:59,544
night and day,
they're always firemen.

791
00:58:59,594 --> 00:59:02,984
[ Guard ] Ronald Bartel.

792
00:59:03,074 --> 00:59:06,384
All right, the parole board
has received...

793
00:59:06,434 --> 00:59:08,664
Mr. Bartel's fitness report,

794
00:59:08,714 --> 00:59:13,310
his l.D. 44,
endorsement from his section warden.

795
00:59:13,394 --> 00:59:15,271
Dr. Norris?

796
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:17,549
As supervising psychiatrist,
l would describe...

797
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:20,068
Mr. Bartel's
progress as remarkable.

798
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:22,065
Taking into account
his disability and the six years...

799
00:59:22,114 --> 00:59:25,186
he's already served,
l recommend a parole.

800
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:27,549
Mr. Bartel,

801
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:29,949
do you regret your crimes?

802
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:34,027
Yes, and--

803
00:59:34,114 --> 00:59:38,824
and l'm aware
of the pain that l have caused.

804
00:59:38,914 --> 00:59:41,269
lf released, will you
commit these crimes again?

805
00:59:41,314 --> 00:59:43,225
No. No, l won't.

806
00:59:43,274 --> 00:59:46,425
Do you consider yourself
ready for society?

807
00:59:46,474 --> 00:59:48,351
Yes, l do.

808
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:52,427
Yeah, right, Ronald.
You're ready, all right.

809
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,982
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

810
00:59:55,074 --> 00:59:58,066
- Shadow.
- Remember this?

811
00:59:58,114 --> 01:00:00,184
Remember this, Ronald?

812
01:00:00,274 --> 01:00:02,265
- Remember who it belonged to?
- Mm-hmm.

813
01:00:02,314 --> 01:00:04,669
What did you do to
that little girl?

814
01:00:04,714 --> 01:00:07,387
lt's not fair, Shadow.

815
01:00:07,474 --> 01:00:09,749
What did you do
to that little girl?

816
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:22,670
l burned her.

817
01:00:22,754 --> 01:00:24,665
You burned her.

818
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:29,071
What do you do to
old ladies, Ronald?

819
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:31,145
Burn them.

820
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:33,748
And what about the world, Ronald?

821
01:00:33,794 --> 01:00:36,354
What would you like
to do with the whole world?

822
01:00:36,394 --> 01:00:41,024
Burn it all.
[ Laughing ]

823
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:52,112
See ya next year, Ronald.

824
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:21,025
[ Screams ]

825
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:30,590
[ Lieutenant ] We figured the body's
the owner, some guy named Cosgrove.

826
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:33,632
Weird blast, though,
like that other guy...

827
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:35,710
who went through
the windshield of his own car.

828
01:01:35,794 --> 01:01:38,866
Explosion blew out the flame
before the engine got here.

829
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:42,509
Good for us;
not too good for him.

830
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:55,629
Bring the toolbox.

831
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:03,384
Tim, get the hot spots.

832
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:07,063
You in the cheap seats,
watch it.

833
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:09,427
There's Brian.

834
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:12,864
Well, let's go.

835
01:02:12,954 --> 01:02:16,185
[ Rimgale ] Hey, McCaffrey,
need a special invitation? Come on.

836
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,189
Charge the line, Axe.

837
01:02:21,994 --> 01:02:25,987
- What do you want me to do with this?
- Shhh.

838
01:02:26,074 --> 01:02:28,747
We got heavy smoke stains
observed in entry room.

839
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:31,109
[ Rimgale ] Smoke demarcation line
is very low.

840
01:02:31,194 --> 01:02:34,470
Fire never got hot enough
here to cook the soot off.

841
01:02:36,874 --> 01:02:40,184
Come on, you sneaky
little son-of-a-bitch.

842
01:02:40,274 --> 01:02:43,630
Come on. Tell me
where you came from.

843
01:02:43,714 --> 01:02:46,069
Point me where you started.

844
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:48,184
Come on.

845
01:02:52,354 --> 01:02:54,743
Burn indicators distended
toward northern wall.

846
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:58,668
Less soot here, more heat.

847
01:02:58,754 --> 01:03:00,824
Lack of discoloration
in shattered glass...

848
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:03,348
indicates slow burn
before explosion.

849
01:03:06,194 --> 01:03:08,628
There's some little
dead rat critters here.

850
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:14,551
Fire originated in this room.
Took its time.

851
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,471
Hung out.

852
01:03:16,514 --> 01:03:20,587
The air ran out. lt couldn't breathe.
lt was snuffed.

853
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:23,188
But it wasn't dead.

854
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:25,788
Must have been all that
trapped heat lying low,

855
01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:28,951
waiting for some sucker
to give it one big gulp of air.

856
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:31,872
Another backdraft.

857
01:03:37,754 --> 01:03:42,430
This is our point of origin.
Let me have a crowbar.

858
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:49,586
No sign of accelerants.

859
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:56,023
Well, if it's arson,
somebody figured a new way to hide it.

860
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:02,389
[ Ricco ]
Okay, we got Alan Seagrave...

861
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:05,904
and Donald Cosgrove.

862
01:04:05,954 --> 01:04:07,831
Both deaths due
to close encounters...

863
01:04:07,874 --> 01:04:11,230
with stationary objects.

864
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,147
We have an office door for Cosgrove...

865
01:04:14,234 --> 01:04:16,350
and, oh, an '87 Porsche for Seagrave.

866
01:04:16,434 --> 01:04:20,143
No nonrelevant traumas.

867
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:23,903
No significant
blood toxicology.

868
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:27,987
Attitude of both trajectories
are consistent with explosion.

869
01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:31,146
They ran the residue you scraped
from both front doors.

870
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,032
lt's a combination of plumber's putty
and rayophene gum.

871
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:35,991
lt burns almost completely
away when you light it.

872
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:37,945
- So it was on both doors?
- Yeah.

873
01:04:38,034 --> 01:04:41,390
Something else l want to show you.
You're gonna have to help me.

874
01:04:41,474 --> 01:04:44,705
McCaffrey, why don't you
come over and help us?

875
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:47,228
No, l don't think so.
Not in my contract.

876
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:49,469
l just rewrote your contract.

877
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:51,863
Come on over and help us.

878
01:04:54,634 --> 01:04:58,343
- Anyway, we're gonna have to lift him.
- Great.

879
01:04:58,434 --> 01:05:01,904
Christ, he's not gonna sell
you insurance. Just lift him up.

880
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,349
Hold on.

881
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:08,584
You see that patch
of shirt right there?

882
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:10,551
We wondered about
the discoloration.

883
01:05:10,594 --> 01:05:12,983
So l scraped a piece off
and ran a spectro on it.

884
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:16,953
On a lucky shot,
they picked up traces of something.

885
01:05:16,994 --> 01:05:18,905
What was it?

886
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:21,422
Ah, trychtichlorate.

887
01:05:21,474 --> 01:05:23,704
[ Ricco ] Nobody around here
ever heard of it.

888
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:26,262
[ Rimgale ] Yeah, trychtichlorate.
lt eats magnesium.

889
01:05:26,314 --> 01:05:28,589
lt's an absorption catalyst
used in toxic waste accidents.

890
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,234
lt's rare. They stopped making it
a couple of years ago.

891
01:05:31,314 --> 01:05:34,624
We figured it got in his clothes
in a gas state from the fire.

892
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:36,545
What was it doing
in the fire?

893
01:05:36,634 --> 01:05:39,148
That's your job. Okay!

894
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:42,590
[ Gurgling ]

895
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:47,544
[ Helen ] Stephen, what--
What are you doing here?

896
01:05:47,634 --> 01:05:50,068
Just fixin' my roof.

897
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:53,789
You've gotta stop just showing
up on the roof like this.

898
01:05:53,874 --> 01:05:56,547
Look, l just-- l wanted to,
l don't know, not exactly...

899
01:05:56,634 --> 01:05:58,590
apologize for the other night,
especially since...

900
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:00,505
- l don't remember much.
- You remember.

901
01:06:00,594 --> 01:06:03,586
Yeah, l know. l just wanted to say,
l don't know, something.

902
01:06:03,674 --> 01:06:06,905
The great communicator.

903
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:17,828
So what's going on, Stephen?

904
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:22,584
You only bang on the roof
when you got something on your mind.

905
01:06:22,634 --> 01:06:24,909
How's Brian doing?

906
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:29,704
- He's out. He quit.
- He just up and quit for no reason?

907
01:06:29,794 --> 01:06:32,388
l don't care what you heard, Helen,
l treated him better...

908
01:06:32,474 --> 01:06:34,829
than any other probie l ever had.
All right?

909
01:06:34,914 --> 01:06:36,905
He probably
hates my guts...

910
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,383
but at least he finally
took a look in the mirror.

911
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:42,307
So once again, Stephen's right
and somebody else is wrong.

912
01:06:42,394 --> 01:06:44,225
You always gotta be right.

913
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:46,589
- That's such bullshit.
- Yeah? Why?

914
01:06:46,634 --> 01:06:49,671
Because l'm the first
to admit it when l'm wrong.

915
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:51,585
Yeah?
How often does that happen?

916
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,630
ln a fire? Never!

917
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:58,748
He would have
bought it, Helen.

918
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:02,224
l'm telling ya, maybe not today,
maybe not next year;

919
01:07:02,274 --> 01:07:05,630
but it would have happened.
All right? He's my brother.

920
01:07:05,674 --> 01:07:07,551
l couldn't just--

921
01:07:07,634 --> 01:07:10,102
You just couldn't
live with that.

922
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:17,065
McCaffrey.

923
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:22,111
Yeah?

924
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:25,990
Take the top off.

925
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:31,147
Holy shit!

926
01:07:31,234 --> 01:07:34,112
That's it.
That's it.

927
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:37,510
Son-of-a-bitch! This guy is different.
He don't love fire.

928
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:38,788
- Who?
- The killer.

929
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:41,547
He used magnesium to make
it look like an accident.

930
01:07:41,634 --> 01:07:43,306
l got it after
we went to see Ronald.

931
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:45,624
Torchers want to fry
the whole goddamn world.

932
01:07:45,714 --> 01:07:48,990
But the fires that killed those guys
never burned up that much.

933
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:52,623
The trychtichlorate hid the magnesium
in the plug, but it burned slow.

934
01:07:52,674 --> 01:07:54,710
And he made
his burns backdrafts.

935
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:58,224
- But he killed these guys.
- Could have killed everybody.

936
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,346
Backdraft blew out the flame.
That's it. That's the reason.

937
01:08:01,434 --> 01:08:05,393
- What reason?
- Why backdrafts.

938
01:08:05,474 --> 01:08:07,385
Whoever fried
Seagrave and Cosgrove...

939
01:08:07,434 --> 01:08:10,107
went to a hell of a lot of trouble
to make sure they died by fire.

940
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:12,349
They also made sure that
the fire blew itself out.

941

01:21:53,754 --> 01:21:55,346
Fire.

1096
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:14,110
lt's a living thing, Brian.

1097
01:22:14,154 --> 01:22:17,544
lt breathes, it eats,

1098
01:22:17,634 --> 01:22:19,545
and it hates.

1099
01:22:19,594 --> 01:22:22,984
The only way to beat it...

1100
01:22:23,074 --> 01:22:25,463
is to think like it;

1101
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:28,671
to know this flame will spread
this way across the door...

1102
01:22:28,754 --> 01:22:30,585
and up across the ceiling;

1103
01:22:30,674 --> 01:22:32,983
not because of the physics
of flammable liquids,

1104
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,747
but because it wants to.

1105
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:40,146
Some guys, fire owns 'em.
Makes 'em fight it on its level.

1106
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:43,664
But the only way to truly kill it...

1107
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:47,753
is to love it a little,
just like Ronald.

1108
01:23:03,234 --> 01:23:05,748
- Hi.
- Hi.

1109
01:23:05,794 --> 01:23:09,867
- l heard your friend's gonna be okay.
- Thanks.

1110
01:23:09,954 --> 01:23:11,945
We checked and your boss
was partners...

1111
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:14,912
with all the murder victims
in a company called Lakeside Dynamics.

1112
01:23:14,994 --> 01:23:18,430
He's keeping that a secret.
l wanna know why.

1113
01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:26,551
- l don't know anything about that.
- You might be able to find out.

1114
01:23:26,594 --> 01:23:30,109
- Get me his files.
- Do you know what you're asking?

1115
01:23:30,154 --> 01:23:31,428
Yeah.

1116
01:23:31,514 --> 01:23:34,711
Four years ago l was punching
a cash register.

1117
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:37,188
Two years ago, Marty Swayzak
didn't even know my name.

1118
01:23:37,274 --> 01:23:39,105
l was bringing
the guy coffee.

1119
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:41,628
l practically run
that office now.

1120
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:45,110
And Marty--
He believes in me.

1121
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:47,588
l just don't--

1122
01:23:49,594 --> 01:23:51,425
You're asking me to
throw that all away.

1123
01:23:51,514 --> 01:23:53,903
Your boss is a liar.

1124
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:18,108
Stephen?

1125
01:24:18,194 --> 01:24:21,869
l'm sorry, Helen.
l just couldn't sleep.

1126
01:24:25,154 --> 01:24:27,714
Well, what's wrong?

1127
01:24:27,794 --> 01:24:30,627
lt used to be real clear.

1128
01:24:30,714 --> 01:24:32,545
When l was a kid,

1129
01:24:34,834 --> 01:24:38,270
what meant most to me
about this job was...

1130
01:24:38,354 --> 01:24:40,663
no ''ifs.''

1131
01:24:40,714 --> 01:24:44,024
Somebody called
the fire department, we came.

1132
01:24:44,074 --> 01:24:46,747
We just showed up.

1133
01:24:50,954 --> 01:24:53,752
Those guys, they just don't know
how much l love 'em.

1134
01:24:59,674 --> 01:25:02,507
You don't leave people hangin'.

1135
01:25:05,794 --> 01:25:08,752
lt holds everything up,
doesn't it?

1136
01:25:08,834 --> 01:25:11,712
Loyalty.

1137
01:25:11,794 --> 01:25:13,705
l don't get it.

1138
01:25:13,794 --> 01:25:17,548
''Till death do us part.''
lsn't that what you heard, Helen?

1139
01:25:17,634 --> 01:25:20,785
You go, we go.
lt's all the same...

1140
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:22,790
piece of shit without that,
isn't it?

1141
01:25:22,874 --> 01:25:26,992
lt's the end of everything.

1142
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:35,346
l'm sorry l came.

1143
01:25:37,434 --> 01:25:40,312
There's just nobody
l can talk to.

1144
01:25:47,154 --> 01:25:50,112
l really miss you.

1145
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:37,470
[ Stephen ] You sure you really want
to put grape jelly in the eggs?

1146
01:26:37,514 --> 01:26:40,950
Yeah, it's part of my formula.
lt's an experiment.

1147
01:26:40,994 --> 01:26:42,905
- lt's an experiment?
- Yeah.

1148
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:44,831
Let's get these eggs going.

1149
01:26:44,874 --> 01:26:46,865
- Hey, l want to do that.
- Can you do it?

1150
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:50,668
That's good.

1151
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:55,347
l'll put that in the formula.

1152
01:26:55,394 --> 01:26:57,430
- You gonna leave the shells?
- Yeah.

1153
01:26:57,474 --> 01:27:00,466
- They're part of the formula?
- Yeah.

1154
01:27:00,514 --> 01:27:03,870
l guess you know
what you're doing.

1155
01:27:03,914 --> 01:27:07,623
- l know what l'm doing.
- Uh-oh.

1156
01:27:07,714 --> 01:27:09,545
Mom!

1157
01:27:09,634 --> 01:27:12,148
l didn't know
you'd be up so early.

1158
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:15,664
Mom, go back to bed.
We're making you breakfast in bed.

1159
01:27:21,314 --> 01:27:23,874
- Stephen, can l talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

1160
01:27:23,954 --> 01:27:26,422
You keep going there.
You're doing good.

1161
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,351
He knows what he's doin'.

1162
01:27:28,394 --> 01:27:32,626
He told me he likes those piano lessons
you got him taking.

1163
01:27:32,674 --> 01:27:36,269
lt's just l don't want
to confuse him, you know.

1164
01:27:36,354 --> 01:27:40,233
l knew who you were
when we got married.

1165
01:27:40,314 --> 01:27:42,430
l knew how you did things.

1166
01:27:44,834 --> 01:27:46,665
And--

1167
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:51,024
l mean, you haven't--

1168
01:27:51,074 --> 01:27:53,190
l just can't anymore.

1169
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:56,232
l just-- you know,

1170
01:27:56,314 --> 01:28:00,353
l gotta worry about Sean.

1171
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:03,232
- Yeah.
- l mean, you're the best.

1172
01:28:03,274 --> 01:28:05,549
You really are.

1173
01:28:05,634 --> 01:28:09,468
But the chances
that you take just--

1174
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:14,422
You scare me now.

1175
01:28:22,354 --> 01:28:24,390
Sean.

1176
01:28:24,474 --> 01:28:27,034
Listen, l, uh--

1177
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:28,985
l blew it.

1178
01:28:29,034 --> 01:28:31,548
l forgot that
l gotta work this morning.

1179
01:28:31,634 --> 01:28:34,432
So, um--

1180
01:28:34,514 --> 01:28:37,312
That's all right.
We'll just do it again next Saturday.

1181
01:28:37,394 --> 01:28:40,067
- All right?
- Mom's crying.

1182
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,666
The latest polls came in, Marty.

1183
01:29:01,274 --> 01:29:03,105
Marty?

1184
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,791
Jesus Christ, Marty.

1185
01:29:13,834 --> 01:29:17,304
What's going on?

1186
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:20,591
We have a city planners
meeting in 15 minutes.

1187
01:29:20,674 --> 01:29:23,586
Marty.

1188
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:32,993
You've gotta level with me, Marty.

1189
01:29:33,074 --> 01:29:36,862
ls there something about
these deaths you're not telling me?

1190
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:40,985
No.

1191
01:30:03,474 --> 01:30:06,750
- What's this?
- Just take it.

1192
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:27,787
Rimgale's gonna wanna
talk to Swayzak about this.

1193
01:30:30,034 --> 01:30:31,547
l'm sorry.

1194
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,633
- That's a dumb thing to say.
- You're right.

1195
01:30:39,594 --> 01:30:41,789
Good-bye, Brian.

1196
01:30:47,394 --> 01:30:49,862
What the hell you do
with this thing?

1197
01:30:49,954 --> 01:30:52,024
What do you mean?
l drove it, Joe.

1198
01:30:52,074 --> 01:30:54,907
This is a copy of Swayzak's report
that we know is bullshit;

1199
01:30:54,954 --> 01:30:57,946
but we could never argue with
the numbers because they're airtight.

1200
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,713
This file she gave you
proves it's phoney.

1201
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:04,104
l checked on the firm that recommended
the cuts to Swayzak's task force.

1202
01:31:04,194 --> 01:31:06,424
They've done exactly one job,
a manpower study.

1203
01:31:06,514 --> 01:31:09,312
l checked further and it's not even
a company. No employees... nothing.

1204
01:31:09,394 --> 01:31:12,830
- Just a P.O. box.
- l wonder who wrote that report.

1205
01:31:12,914 --> 01:31:15,951
- Someone who knows how to work numbers.
- Exactly.

1206
01:31:16,034 --> 01:31:19,549
Like a bunch of
dead financial wizards.

1207
01:31:19,594 --> 01:31:23,269
- Seagrave, Holcomb, Cosgrove--
- And Swayzak.

1208
01:31:23,354 --> 01:31:26,346
Why did he go through
this trouble to cut firehouses?

1209
01:31:26,434 --> 01:31:29,710
When a firehouse closes, Swayzak
converts it into a community center.

1210
01:31:29,794 --> 01:31:32,308
- That's sweet.
- Lakeside Dynamics, remember them?

1211
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:34,584
They get all
the expensive construction work.

1212
01:31:34,634 --> 01:31:36,943
l'm telling you,
this is a total scam.

1213
01:31:36,994 --> 01:31:40,031
These guys were
making a ton of money.

1214
01:31:40,114 --> 01:31:43,948
lt's time we had a little talk
with Mr. Swayzak. Let's go.

1215
01:32:02,754 --> 01:32:04,984
Mr. Swayzak?

1216
01:32:09,794 --> 01:32:11,864
Gas. Check in there.

1217
01:32:14,474 --> 01:32:17,546
[ Hissing ]

1218
01:32:29,634 --> 01:32:31,465
Aaah!

1219
01:32:33,474 --> 01:32:36,546
[ Screaming ]

1220
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:56,625
Come on. Come on!

1221
01:33:11,354 --> 01:33:14,312
- Let's go. Come on!
- [ Coughing ]

1222
01:33:36,034 --> 01:33:40,710
- [ Coughing ]
- Hey, kid.

1223
01:33:40,794 --> 01:33:44,025
l think l've got
a problem here.

1224
01:33:49,474 --> 01:33:53,672
ls it true that you were rescued
by the fire department's arson team?

1225
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:56,348
That's quite a bunch
of guys, huh?

1226
01:33:58,554 --> 01:34:01,591
l'm so goddamn helpless here.

1227
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:03,904
l can't do a fucking thing.

1228
01:34:03,954 --> 01:34:07,105
[ Sighs ]

1229
01:34:07,154 --> 01:34:11,352
- What do you want me to do?
- l've been lying here thinkin'.

1230
01:34:11,434 --> 01:34:16,144
For hours... thinkin'
and thinkin' and thinkin'.

1231
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:19,749
We're close.
We're close.

1232
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:21,665
But we're not lookin'
in the right place,

1233
01:34:21,754 --> 01:34:23,585
not in the right place.

1234
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:31,710
So, you've come to pick
Ronald's brains...

1235
01:34:31,754 --> 01:34:35,827
because nobody knows
the animal like Ronald.

1236
01:34:42,474 --> 01:34:45,113
lt must've looked like
it was going to be...

1237
01:34:45,194 --> 01:34:48,743
a medium deal, didn't it,
when your father bought it?

1238
01:34:48,834 --> 01:34:51,064
What?

1239
01:34:51,114 --> 01:34:56,586
Did you watch him when he made
that ballsy jump and saved--

1240
01:34:56,674 --> 01:34:58,744
l didn't come to talk
about my father.

1241
01:34:59,754 --> 01:35:04,874
l sent away for a copy of that ''Life''
with your picture on the cover.

1242
01:35:04,954 --> 01:35:07,229
lt's a collectible.

1243
01:35:07,274 --> 01:35:10,266
- Who's doing this, Ronald?
- Wrong question.

1244
01:35:10,314 --> 01:35:12,669
Who isn't?

1245
01:35:12,714 --> 01:35:14,750
lt isn't a spark, is it?
Because there isn't enough damage...

1246
01:35:14,794 --> 01:35:17,069
and he wouldn't
have had any fun.

1247
01:35:17,154 --> 01:35:20,829
lt isn't an insurance pro
because there isn't any profit.
