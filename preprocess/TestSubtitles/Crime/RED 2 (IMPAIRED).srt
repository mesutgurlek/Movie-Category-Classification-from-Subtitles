He was a rock star
of conceptual mass killing.

Right and wrong.

any more than right or wrong.

Oh, good.

What?

799
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:49,599
I knew she would play him
like a banjo at
an Ozark hoedown.

00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,334
So I have the key.

Style is the only
constant in life, Frank.

We didn't come to Paris
on vacation.

807
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:32,475
Oh. Shopping's what I thought
you did in Paris

808
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:34,477
with your boyfriend's money

809

while you're waiting for him

810
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,347
to wake up
from being taken down

811
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:42,652
by his skanky, slutty,
Russian biatch ex-girlfriend.

812
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:45,254
So thanks. Thanks.

813
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,356
Thanks for the compliment
for the fur.

814
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,659
For telling me that
I look nice in my dress.

815
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,394
It makes me feel really good.

And it makes me feel
very loving towards you also.

doing this to me?

We can get a taxi over here.

Frank, listen,
I gotta tell you something.

820
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:07,276
You have to start to learn
to share your feelings

00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,245
to evolve your relationship.

BAILEY: Hey, Frankie,
I'm over here.

983
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,940
I found it. It was
in my pocket the whole time.

984
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:07,175
I couldn't find
my damn pipe, though.
But here it is.

985
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:10,045
Sorry, my dear,
what was the question
you asked me?

986
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,147
Do you remember Nightshade?

987
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,650
Vaguely. It was some kind of
a bomb, I believe.

988
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,852
Dr. Bailey, people
are looking for that weapon.

989
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,654
People who want to use it.

990
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:19,988
Oh, dear. Yes,
I do understand, of course.

991
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,290
Believe you me.

992
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,125
But you know,
I made many things

993
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,660
for the Americans and

994
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,795
Nightshade turned out to be
a bit of a nightmare.

995
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,163
It was quite different.

996
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,831
Turned out to be
too dangerous.

997
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,867
So naturally, they had to
lock me up in this place.

998
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,602
And after what they did to me,
I think it's perfectly natural

999
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:34,970

1012
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,277
I just heard
from my source at MI6

1013
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:17,779
that Edward Bailey's alive

That's not possible.
