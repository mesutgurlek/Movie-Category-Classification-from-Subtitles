See if anybody at the DA could help out
with this. I tried to call you.

632
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,020
- Day and night. No reply.
- You tried to call me. Really?

633
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,940
Yeah. Look, I forgot. I don't know.

634
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,740
Look, all know is the next thing...

635
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,900
Shasta's missing, Wolfmann's gone
and, uh... Glen Charlock's dead.

636
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,220
Bjornsen seems to think
you're as good a suspect as any.

You been talking to Bigfoot about me?

Doc, please.

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,500
Besides, maybe you did it.
Has that crossed your mind?

641
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,620
- Maybe you just forgot?
- What? Did do what?

642
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,020
Killed Glen Charlock.

643
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,580
- Kill him?
- Yeah.

What?

00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,740
How would I forget something like that?

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,220
- Grass, and who knows what else.
- I'm only a light smoker.

- How many joints have you had today?
- Check the logbook.

Can't remember?

I don't see how my smoking has any link
to the Wolfmann-Charlock-Shasta case.

No?

Then how come Miss Hepworth
dismantled your relationship?

652
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,189
She had other fish to fry.

- Mm.

The next day, a known prison acquaintance
of his, Glen Charlock, is slain...

Yeah. Well, have you talked
to Bigfoot Bjornsen about this?

He's real intelligent
about this kind of shit.

676

Mr. Bjornsen's antipathy
at the federal level is well known.

if you're so focused
on the Black Panthers...

then what's with your interest
in Mickey Wolfmann?

with federal housing money?

Are you figuring Mickey's kidnapping
is a Black Panther operation?

692

They put the snatch on Mickey,
trying to prove a political point...

693
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,182
or maybe a nice shot
at some ransom money?

Maybe you've thought of putting that forward
as a cover story for whatever did happen.

most of them have gone off

The thing I wanted to see you about...

769
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,020
I was wondering
if you could check on people.

A lady and a little girl.

771
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,460
See if they're okay,
without bringing me into it.

772
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,900
It's down in Torrance.
Just see if they're still living there.

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,380
See what's in the driveway.

774

Unless you believe
information is money...

779
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,940
in which case,
I could ask you something.

780

Bearing in mind that either
I don't know...

781
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,511
or it's my ass if I tell you...

- A big schooner, somebody said.

786
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,545
Brings stuff in and out of the country,
but no one wants to talk about it.

00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,585

She has a tendency to show up here

806
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,340
no running lights...

People back off, change the subject
and get real creepy.

810
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,946
The owners are listed
as a consortium in the Bahamas.

811
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,780
Her real name isn't really
the Golden Fang.

812
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,060
She was originally a fishing boat
named Preserved.

813
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,980
Then after World War II,
she was bought by Burke Stodger.

814
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,380
Burke Stodger. Burke Stodger the actor?
.45-Caliber Kissoff Burke Stodger?

What?

817
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,700
He gets blacklisted because of his politics
and branded a communist.

818
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,260
So he takes the boat,
splits the country...

819
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,420
which is where
your Bermuda Triangle comes in.

820

in beer batter?

824

Mm, I'll take the jellyfish teriyaki
croquettes and the eel Trovatore, please.

So Burke's blacklisted, takes the boat,
splits the country.

833
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,060
Somewhere between San Pedro and Papeete,
the boat disappears...

- You dig?
- Mm-hm.

837

The Preserved is in
the opposite ocean, off of Cuba...

838
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,060
and Burke Stodger on the front page
of the Daily Variety...

839

his return to pictures...

Man, they removed any traces
of soul that she once had.

845

Mickey Wolfmann was seen taking
the Golden Fang out for a three-hour tour.

941
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,900
MAN 2 [ON TV]: He's identified as unemployed
UCLA student Rick Doppel.

942
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,420
- DOC: Who?
- PENNY: Oh, Doppler? That's no hippie.

943
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,224
That's Chucky.

944
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,500
Yeah? Is it a friend of yours?

945
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,900
MAN 2: Secret Service
took the man for questioning...

946
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,420
Everybody knows Chucky.

947
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,306
If he's not at the Hall of Justice,
he's down at the Glass House.

948
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,910
A snitch?

949
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,380
An informant, please.

950
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,980
And he only works with the Red Squad.

951
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,381
Whoa. So, what's he...? Why is he screaming
and yelling like that at Nixon again?

952
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,580
Now that he's been on TV,
he has instant and wide credibility.

953
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,023
Police can infiltrate him
into any group they want to.

954
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,703
Bastards.

955
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,306
- Do you love me?
- Any group.

956
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,500
SORTILÈGE: Hmm...

957
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,660
A snitch. A spy. A weasel.

958
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,220
And dang...

959
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:53,340
if it ain't a resurrected tenor sax player,
working undercover.

960
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,100
But for who?

961
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,220
These patriotic pals of President Nixon
called Vigilant California?

962
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,900
Some other unseen hand?

963
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,980
DOC: Now, who am I again?

964
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,020
COY: You're the photographer.

965
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,900
- DOC: And the name of the magazine is...?
- COY: Stone Turntable.

966
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,100
DOC: Mm-hm.

967
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,980
SORTILÈGE: Coy's band, The Boards, were
currently renting a place in Topanga Canyon...

968
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,020
from a bass player turned
record company executive...

969
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,180
which trend watchers took as further
evidence of the end of Hollywood...

970
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,304
if not the world, as they had known it.

971
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,660
Doc and Denis hadn't dropped acid
for years in this town...

972
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,220
without picking up
some kind of extrasensory chops.

973
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,700
And truth was, since crossing
the doorsill of this place...

974
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,827
they couldn't help noticing
what you would call an atmosphere.

975
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,386
DOC: Thank you.

976
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,740
Ooh.

977
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,380
What are you doing here?

978
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,340
I drove up with Bambi.
She heard Spotted Dick were here...

979
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,980
so I had to come along
and keep her out of trouble.

980
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,100
She's possessed. She's got
Spotted Dick posters on the walls...

981
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,380
sheets and pillow cases,
T-shirts, souvenir roach clips.

982
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,180
All right, she's keen on the Dick.

983
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,140
It's 24 hours a day.
She's got Spotted Dick albums on stereo.

984
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,380
Okay, yeah, now listen.

985
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,860
I'm looking for that guy that I met
at Club Asiatique the other night.

986
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,700
- He's here.
- Yeah? Where?

987
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,426
- He's in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

988
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,900
Hey, before you leave.
Can I get a ride with you?

989
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,500
- This place is freaking me out.
- Mm...

990
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,940
Okay.

991
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,100
Good evening, Larry Sportello,
Stone Turntable magazine.

992
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,305
- Smedley, Spotted Dick, keyboards.
- Mm-hm.

993
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,620
SORTILÈGE: Was it possible
that at every gathering...

994
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:48,340
Concert, peace rally,
love-in, be-in and freak-in...

995
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,900
here, up North, back East, wherever.

996
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,020
...some dark crews
had been busy all along...

997
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,220
reclaiming the music,
the resistance to power...

998
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,300
the sexual desire
from epic to everyday...

999
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,461
all they could sweep up,
for the ancient forces of greed and fear.

1000
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,464
"Gee, " he thought, "I don't know."

1001
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,701
Hey.

1002
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,711
DOC: Hi.

1003
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,580
Hi there. Remember me, Larry Sportello?

1004
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,980
Stone Turntable magazine?

1005
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,821
You, um... asked me
to, uh... look into that, um...

1006
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,940
vehicle.

1007
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,746
- What?
- The vehicle?

1008
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,220
Yeah, what was the make and model
that you looked at again?

1009
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,140
You were asking
about that older type VW...

1010
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,060
with the hearts and blue birds and...

1011
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,540
Any replacement parts?

1012
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,900
None I could see.

1013
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,260
What about street legal?

1014
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,540
Was it any hassles with registration?

1015
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,664
Didn't seem to be any...

1016
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,820
- You saw Hope?
- Yeah, for a minute.

1017
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,460
She's okay.

1018
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,660
Looks like she's been staying clean too.

1019
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,100
How'd she do it?

1020
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,740
I don't know. She's, uh...
back teaching is all she said.

1021
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,700
You know, public health,
drug awareness, something like that.

1022
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,340
- Where?
- Where? I don't know.

1023
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,190
She didn't say.

1024
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,100
It doesn't matter.

1025
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,220
No way I could ever go back to them.

1026
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,740
All right, man.
Look, you can't go back to them?

1027
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,540
Who? Because what? Why?

1028
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,420
Because it would be my ass
and my family's too.

1029
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,980
It's like a gang. It's like once
you're in, you're in for life.

1030
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,820
Did you know that when you signed up?

1031
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,620
All I knew was we couldn't do each other
any good staying together.

1032
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,340
The baby looked like shit,
getting worse every day.

1033
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,260
We were just getting fucked up
and sitting there and saying:

1034
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,020
"Well, we gotta do something.

1035
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,190
You're dragging us down, and..."

1036
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,380
Listen, I'm not asking you
to give away any secrets here.

1037
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,551
But I think I saw you on the tube
at a rally for Nixon.

1038
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,220
And your question is,
which side am I on?

1039
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,751
Yes.

1040
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,300
Well, you know,
these people here have money.

1041
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,100
It's not like those Bible freaks that go up
and down the beach, like, screaming at you.

1042
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,580
They really wanna help.

1043
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,860
I thought it was something good
to do for my country.

1044
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,420
Stupid as that sounds.

1045
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,500
But what I really found out was...

1046
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,580
they just wanna, like, use us
and keep the membership in line.

Suppose your mom was on smack.

1050
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,620
My mom?

1051
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,780
Yeah, what would you do?

1052
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,302
- You know, wouldn't you try to help her?
- Yeah. I think...

1053
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,500
Are you saying that the U.S.
is somebody's mom?

1054
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,460
And she's, um... strung out?

1055
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,500
- I'm trying to...
- On what?

1056
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,660
On sending people off to die
in jungles for no reason.

1057
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,420
Something wrong and suicidal about that
that she can't stop.

1058
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,620
Mm...

1059
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,860
And Vigilant California, or whoever it is
you're working for, wouldn't buy that?

01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,110
I don't belong here, man.

I do get the feeling
you'd rather be someplace else.

Yeah. Back where I was would be nice.

Doc remembered dimly
a story from long past.

1111

A rumor about a partner of Bigfoot's...

who'd been shot and killed
a while back in the line of duty.

01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,148
Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, DDS...

1400
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,224
has perpetrated his last root canal,
I'm afraid.

1401
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,740
Hablo inglés, man.
What's that...? He's dead?

1402
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,780
They found him
next to a trampoline in Bel Air...

1403
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,940
with a fatal neck injury.

1404
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:27,580
So far no witnesses,
no motives, no suspects...

1405
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,827
apart from you.

1406
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,300
Mm, not me. Why me?

1407
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,580
You were observed in Blatnoyd's company.

1408
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,900
Both of you riding in a vehicle
full of drug-crazed hippies.

1409
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,020
DOC: Yeah, well, you know...

1410
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,980
the owner of that vehicle...

1411
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,260
is a very well-respected, um... you know,
lawyer down in Palos Verdes.

1412
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,060
And his daughter was driving.
She offered me a ride.

1413
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,340
And cops didn't even give her a ticket.

1414
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,140
DOC: You know, Blatnoyd
was her friend, not mine.

1415
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,340
Go to bed.

1416
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,861
I'm working. Why am I gonna go to bed?

1417
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,020
I think it's time
we had one of our chats.

1418
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,551
Uh...

1419
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,511
All right. Yup.

1420
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,741
So with this Coy Harlingen matter...

1421
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,100
on the face of it...

1422
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,460
it's one more OD,
one less junkie, case cleared.

1423
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,867
And on the not face of it?

1424
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,102
Why, what do we have here?

1425
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,300
Why don't you pick a card?

1426
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,020
Any card.

1427
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,660
These are field interrogation reports.

1428
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,140
See if you find anything
that looks familiar.

1429
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,229
Card tricks.

1430
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,551
No.

1431
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,225
Mm.

1432
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,300
Puck Beaverton.

1433
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,980
Excellent choice.
One of Mickey Wolfmann's bodyguards.

1434
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,540
Interesting fellow, I hear.

1435
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:56,060
Sheriff's people ran into him
at the Venice home...

1436
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,140
of the dealer that sold Harlingen
the smack that killed him.

1437
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,700
Or didn't kill him.

1438
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,180
Wait, so, what was Puck doing
at Coy's dealer's place?

1439
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,380
The interesting thing
about this overdose...

1440
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,740
is that Leonard James Loosemeat
a.k.a. El Drano...

1441
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,140
was known for this 3 percent product...

1442
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,708
yet the report says what killed him
was pure China White Number Four.

1443
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,220
Like, from the whole-seller?
Whoever's bringing it in?

1444
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,140
I seem to recall that some years ago,
just before he went into Folsom...

1445
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,186
Beaverton used to work
for this loan shark...

1446
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,340
Adrian Prussia.

1447
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,747
Fucking zoinks! I know Adrian Prussia.

1448
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,940
I know him from my skip-tracing days.

1449
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:39,747
He's a bad man. Used a baseball bat.
You know, he's sick.

1450
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,580
And Coy's dealer, El Drano...

1451
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,784
also happened
to be Prussia's steady customer.

1452
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,386
So maybe Puck was there
on Adrian's behalf.

1453
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,390
What do you think?

1454
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,380
I think you and Adrian have a history
you're not sharing with me.

1455

MAN: Got it, lieutenant!

1457
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,102
You got it, lieutenant.

1458
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,540
Pancakes aren't quite as good as my mother's,
but what I really go for here is the respect.

1459
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,020
Respect.

1460
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,666
You didn't get enough of that
from your mom.

1461
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,780
You probably imagine that I have a lot
of status up in Robbery-Homicide.

1462
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,631
I mean, who could blame you
for thinking that.

1463
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,463
The reality, however...

1464
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,186
no Cielo Drive for Bigfoot.

1465
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,506
No TV movie rights
or book deals for Bigfoot.

1466
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,946
I mean, even the extra work
is drying up.

God help us all.

Dentists on trampolines.

1469
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,780
You know, Dr. Blatnoyd
had puncture wounds on his throat...

1470
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,980
consistent with bites
from canines of a midsize wild animal.

1471
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,180
That's what the coroner told me!

1472
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,860
Swallow that!

1473
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,301
Listen, that's mighty weird, Bigfoot.

1474
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,380
Okay? Because Blatnoyd
was a partner in a tax dodge...

1475
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,982
that calls itself
The Golden Fang Enterprises.

1476
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,220
You didn't happen to get the... SID to test
those neck punctures for gold or nothing?

1477
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,540
I shouldn't think there'd be much trace.

1478
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:33,020
Gold is all but chemically inactive, as you
might have learned in chemistry class...

1479
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,383
if you hadn't been ditching all the time
to score dope, Sportello.

Every contact leaves traces.

1481
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,900
It would sure be ironic,
is all I'm saying...

1482
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,020
if Blatnoyd was bit to death
by a golden fang...

1483
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,820
or, like, even better,
like, two golden fangs?

1484
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,460
I don't see why any of this
would be material.

1485
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,300
Because it's the Golden Fang.

1486
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,060
- It's the decedent's tax shelter. So, what?
- No, man, it's not a tax shelter.

1487
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:01,221
It's something,
Bigfoot, man, much more, more vast.

This wouldn't be just more
of your paranoid hippie bullshit, would it?

1490
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,260
Look, have the lab check
for traces of copper.

1491
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,180
Not the kind that goes stumbling all over
the crime scene contaminating evidence.

1492
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,620
More like copper the metal.

1493
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,180
You see, gold teeth are never made
with pure gold.

1494
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,100
Dentists like to alloy it with copper.

1495
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,740
If you hadn't ditched forensics class to go steal
hubcaps to plant on some innocent hippie...

1496
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,749
you might have known that.

1497
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,551
Oh, you feel like
a cop almost, don't you?

01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,020
Chryskylodon?

1504
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,063
"Animal tooth."

1505
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,940
Ancient Indian word, Sortilège?
It means "serenity."

1506
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,980
I minored in the Classics.
It's not Indian, it's Ancient Greek.

1507
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,662
It means "animal tooth
made out of gold."
