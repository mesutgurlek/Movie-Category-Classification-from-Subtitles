and incredibly stupid!

[Laughter]

484
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,121
Mummy...
Paul and I have decided

485
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,391
that Charles and Deborah
are going to have a baby,

486
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,796
an heir to the throne
of Borovnia.

487
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,596
What a splendid idea.

488
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,398
We're calling him
Diello.

489
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,168
Well, that's
a good dramatic name.

490
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,471
Paul thought it up.

491
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:17,004
Aren't you clever?
Hmm.

492
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,414
There... all done.

493
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,021
[Laughter]

494
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,649
Oh, look at you two...

495
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,716
A couple
of Borovnian Princesses

496
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,762
[Laughing]
If ever I saw them.

497
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,991
[Both laugh]

498
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,556

499

and my... foster daughter.

[Both sigh]

501
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,836
Hilda,
I can't find that letter

502
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,436
from the High Commission.

503
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,914
They want
our passport numbers.

504
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,917
Are you going abroad,
Daddy?

505
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,284
Your father's attending
a university conference
in England, darling.

506
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,380
We'll only be gone
for a few weeks.

507
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,585
You're not going,
are you, Mummy?

508
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,458
Well, yes,
l-I thought I might.

509
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,327
It's, uh, a long time

510
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,525
for your father and I
to be apart.

511
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,764
But I should go, too.

512
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,270
Darling,
you've got school.

513
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,806
You've only
just settled in.

514
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,569
B-But...

515
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,770
Who's coming
to the shops?

516
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,040
Me! I'm coming!

517
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,912
I need some cigarettes.

518
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,010
Put on your shoes,
Jonathon!

519

549
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,291
Pauline; Today
Juliet and I discovered

550
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,428
the key to the Fourth World.

551
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,099
We have had it
in our possession

552
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,801
for about six months,

553
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,639
but we only realized it

554
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,441
on the day
of the death of Christ.

555
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,506
We saw a gateway
through the clouds.

556
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,746
Everything
was full of peace and bliss.

557
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,120
We then realized
we had the key.

558
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,592
We now know we're not genii,
as we thought.

559
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,494
We have an extra part
of our brain

560
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,590
that can appreciate
the Fourth World.

561
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,862
Only about 10 people have it.

562
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,394
When we die, we will go
to the Fourth World,

563
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,567
but meanwhile,
on two days every year,

564
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,110
we may use the key

565
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,011
and look into
that beautiful world

566
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,175
which we have been lucky enough
to be allowed to know of

567
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,344
on this day
of finding the key

568
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,356
to the way
through the clouds.

569
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,393
Ughhhhhh!

570
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,190
Push!

Mnhhhhhh!

00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,768
Oh, God!

It's a boy!

00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,910
Oh!

578
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,639

580
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,479
We have a son and heir.

581
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:24,578
[Sighs deeply]
I shall call him Diello!

582
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:28,455
Oh, you're
such an incredible woman!

583
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,860
I couldn't have done it
without you, Charles.

584
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,728
The empress Deborah

585
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,825
has the most enormous
difficulty

586
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,335
fending off her husband,

587
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,530
who tries
to have his way with her

588
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,073
morning, noon, and night.

However...

594
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,010
the queen's biggest problem

595
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,486
is her renegade child, Diello,
who has proven to be

596
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,216
an uncontrollable
little blighter

597
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,884

whenever the fancy takes him!

No, Mrs. Stevens.

602
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,398
I suppose you think it
witty and clever

603
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,868
to mock the royal family,

604
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,667
to poke fun at the queen
and the empire

605

It's not rubbish!

why you are so upset,

it has to be the Windsors!

they had found out today

that Juliet has tuberculosis
on one lung.

I nearly fainted
when I heard.

I had a terrible job
not to cry.

1290
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,925
She requires a warm climate.

1291
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,330
Dr. Hulme,
let's make an effort

1292
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,664
to avoid
a public embarrassment.

1293
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:17,331
You have until the end of the
year to find a new position.

1294
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,272
Hilda;
Bill, it's not right.

1295

[Bill laughs]

1296

It's not right.

1297
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,005
- When?
- Not now!

1298
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,017

01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,876

[Footsteps approaching]

Is she still in there?

1308
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,747
Come on, Yvonne.
You've had enough time.

1309
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,420
- [Knocking]
- Yvonne!

1310
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:15,554
Yes, yes, yes.

1311
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,861
You open up this door
right now.

1312
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,925
I'm bloody dressing
as fast as I can,
for God's sake.

1313
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,164
Open this door!

1314
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,400
Pauline; Mother gave me
a fearful lecture

1315
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,239
along the usual strain.

1316
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,404
I rang Deborah immediately,

1317
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,812
as I had to tell
someone sympathetic...

1318
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,645
how I loathed Mother.

1319

[No audio]

1320
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,737
Mother told me
I could not go to llam again

1321
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:00,536
until I was 8 stone
and more cheerful.

1322
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:03,237
All week I have looked forward
to going to llam,

1323
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,574
and now this.

1324
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,910
She is most unreasonable.

1325
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,815
I also overheard her making
insulting remarks

1326
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,318
about Mrs. Hulme.

1327
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,116
I was livid.

1328
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:17,249
I am very glad, because
the Hulmes sympathize with me,

1329
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:21,695
and it is nice to feel that
adults realize what Mother is.

1330
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:25,359
Dr. Hulme is going to do
something about it, I think.

[Coughs]

Why could not Mother die?

1333
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:34,372
Dozens of people are dying
all the time... thousands.

1334
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,276
So why not Mother?

are you talking about?

I've brought him a cup of tea.

Juliet?

Don't try and fob me off.

about us.

Until other arrangements
can be made,

to come into the lounge

to have penetrated my mind.

It is so incredible.
Poor Father.

1389
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:56,770
Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind
and understanding.

1390
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,779
He said we must tell him
everything

about our going to America.

1392

He was both hope-giving
and depressing.

1393
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,779
We talked for a long time,

1394
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:10,291
and Deborah and I were near
tears by the time it was over.

1395
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,925
What is to be the future now?

1396
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:18,592
We may all be going to Italy
and dozens of other places,

1397
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,259
or not at all.

1398
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:22,929
None of us know where we are,

1399
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,838
and a good deal depends on
chance.

1400
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:35,449
Dr. Hulme is the noblest

1401

and most wonderful person
I have ever known of.

Your mother and I
have talked things over,

and we've made some decisions.

1406
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,278
I'm resigning
from the university,

1407
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:07,747
and I'll be taking up a position
back in England.

But, Daddy, you can't just
leave me here with Mother.

if you accompany your father.

Hilda;
That chest of yours isn't
getting any better.

just what you need.

They want me to live
with them.

You're not going
anywhere.

You're 15 years old,

You have to let me go!

1430
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:20,587
We'll talk about this
when you've calmed down.

1431
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,247
Pauline;
I felt thoroughly depressed

1432
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:26,920
and even quite seriously
considered committing suicide.

1433
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:30,829
Life seemed so much
not worth the living

1434
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,890
and death such an easy way out.

1435
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,799
Love, you can still write
to each other.

1436
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,309
Anger against Mother boiled up
inside me,

1437
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:45,972
as it is she who is one of
the main obstacles in my path.

1438
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,483
Suddenly a means of
ridding myself of this obstacle

1439
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,485
occurred to me.

1440
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:55,182
If she were to die...

1441
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,020
Official; I cannot begin
to attempt to measure

1442
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,290
the inestimable value
of Dr. Hulme's contributions

1443
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:05,459
to Canterbury College,
both social and official.

1444
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,971
We wish both him and Mrs. Hulme
all the best for the future.

1445
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:13,371
[Applause]

1446
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,875
Juliet; Everything's
going to be okay, Gina.

1447
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:29,151
Mr. Perry promised to give me

01:31:58,479 --> 01:31:59,741
Deborah rang,

1609
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:03,079
and we decided to use
a rock and a stocking

1610
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,742
rather than a sandbag.

1611
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:07,049
We discussed the murder fully.

1612
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:08,418
I feel very keyed up,

1613
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:10,616
as though I were
planning a surprise party.

1614
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,285
Mother has fallen in
with everything beautifully,

1615
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:17,058
and the happy event is to
take place tomorrow afternoon.

1616
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,656
Next time I write
in this diary,

1617
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:21,395
Mother will be dead.

1618
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:23,403
How odd...

1619
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:25,564
yet how pleasing.
