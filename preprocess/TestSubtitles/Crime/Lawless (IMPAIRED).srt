<i>my eldest brother, Howard,

- Morning, Forrest.
HOWARD: - Pure corn whiskey.

Hey you, come on now,
you don't want to do this.

Why don't you put that knife away,
take you and your friends on home?

93

Listen here, mister.

We got no way of
understanding this world.

99
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,871
We got about as much sense of it
as a bird flying in the sky.

There is a lot that bird don't know.

the world is happening to him
all the same.

103

What I'm trying to say is...

104

it is changing.

111
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,567
Just caught me off guard is all.

You still good to drive?

113
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,985

HOWARD: - Oh, whatever you say,

114
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,701

All right, Jack, come on,
we gotta go set up over here.

117
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,204
HOWARD: Thank you.

118
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,623

MAN: All right, then.

120
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,764
Are you gonna talk to Forrest about
taking some of me and Cricket's liquor?

121
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,517
- We're working on somethin' big.
- What do you mean talk to him?

122
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,098
About letting us in, Howard.

123
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,104
Not with that damn popskull shit
you been cooking up.

124
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,265
- We're still perfecting it.
- Perfecting it, my ass,

125
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,026
Jack, that shit
ain't fit to slop hogs.

126
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,108
Forrest don't want you involved, is all.

127
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,272
JACK: Why is that?

128
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,607
'Cause he don't think you got the grit.

129
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,993
Gimme another jar, Jack. Huh?

130
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,327
JACK: You might wanna slow down some,
Howard. We're trying to sell this stuff.

131
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,209
- Who is that?
HOWARD: - She's one of them crazies

132
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,291
from that church at Burnt Chimney.

133
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,174
Her daddy over there,
he's gonna be the preacher.

134
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,885
You wanna get yourself a crowbar, Jack,
if you wanna get inside of her.

135
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,142
(laughing) She don't
look that crazy.

136
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,723
Her daddy don't look too happy, neither.

137
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,306

138
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,646
FORREST: All right, now.

139
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,358
Jack, go on and
take this around the back.

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,147
Store whatever's left in the shed.

141
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,442
You too, Howard.
(whistles)

142

HOWARD: - Come on, Jack.
JACK: - Yeah.

143
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,873
Are you Forrest Bondurant?

144
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,005
Um...

145
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,921
I'm Maggie Beaufort.

146
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,980
They say in town you're looking for
someone to help out 'round the place.

147
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,027
(clears throat)
- Is that position still vacant?

148
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,442
Forgive me for asking, but, um...

149
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,696
...what does a lady like you...

150
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,581
...want here?

151
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,834
The city can grind a girl down.

152
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,918
Gets to a point where you start
looking for somewhere quiet.

153
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,209
(Howard laughing)

154
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,087
Damn.

155
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,969
MAGGIE: Well, Mr. Bondurant...

156
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,276
...do I get the job?

157
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
(mumbles)

158
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,766
(tires screeching)

159
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,943
(tires screech)

160
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,337
(quietly) Quick. Quick.

161
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,918
(chatter)

162
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,677
(car tires screech in distance)

163
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,809
(vehicle approaching)
(car horn honking)

164
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,560
(cocks gun)

165
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,491
(groans)

166
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,051
Hey!

167
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,466
Cricket!

168
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,221
Hey!

169
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,308
- Hey!
(shouts)

170
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,144
You ain't never gonna believe
what I just seen.

171
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,528
Floyd Banner shoot the tires
out of a goddamn ATU car

172
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,780
right smack in the middle of
town with a goddamn Tommy gun.

173
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,030
- Floyd Banner?
- Floyd Banner.

174
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,819
Oh, hey, look here. In the middle
of all that, I was thinking about you.

175
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,245
Got you one of these shell cases, Cricket.

176
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,576
- Oh, thanks, Jack!
- Yeah.

177
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,578
Figured we could put holes in it,
you know.

178
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,285
Put a chain through it, hang it around
our necks for luck or something.

179
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,545
(exhales) Floyd Banner.
He looked like he had direction, vision.

180
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,087
You got smoke coming out the cabin.

181
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,890
JACK: Jesus Christ, Cricket.

182
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,972
(grunts, coughs)

183
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,262
- This gonna work?
- Naturally,

184
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,602
I'm still messing with
the recipe, of course.

185
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,808
And with this set-up through the pipes,

186
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,852
no one'll even know it's down here.

187
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,068
(pipes groaning)

188
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,204
The man tucks away his bottle,
out he goes.

189
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,251
Well... Partner, I don't know if
that's the stupidest thing I ever seen

190
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,415
or you're some kind
of damn genius.

191
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,303
- Ooh.
- Mm-hm.

192
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,095
FORREST: Did Jimmy pay us?

193
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,355
HOWARD: - Yup.
FORREST: - He did?

194
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,075
HOWARD: Thank you.

195
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,000
(groans)

196
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,128
MAN: Hi, Forrest.

197
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,515
This here's the new Special Deputy.

198
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,683
He's been brought in
from the city to help us out.

199
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,979
You know, make sure things go smooth.

200
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,692
What things might they be?

201
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,114
(chuckles)

202
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,820
Sorry, something amuse you?

203
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,621
My name is Charlie Rakes,
I'm from Chicago.

204
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,208
That damn brother of yours,
is he somewhere about?

205
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:41,668
Who's in the car?

206
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,221
That there's the new
Commonwealth's Attorney, Mason Wardell.

207
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,601
He wants to work it out so everybody
gets to do some business.

208
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,357
SHERIFF: Henry,
go see what Mr. Wardell wants.

209
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,620
Pete, who the hell is this son of a bitch?

210
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,537
Me? I'm the one who's going to make
your life real difficult from now on

211
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,125
if you don't toe the line, country boy.

212
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,759
Don't you ever touch me again.

213
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:28,014
(laughing)
- All right, all right.

214
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,596
Forrest, it already settled.

215
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,102
The whole county's gonna
get on board eventually.

216
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,435
Start at $20 a week, $30 a load

217
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,565
and that gets you free passage
throughout the whole county.

218
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,523
- No one'll bother you.
- Don't nobody bother me now.

219
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:47,025
Mr. Wardell, he'd like a jar
of your finest apple brandy.

220
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,534
That be all right?

221
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,838
(low groan)

222
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,895
Can I help you, son?

223
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,521
Yeah.

224
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,479
You send your clown
with the bow tie around here again,

225
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,815
and I guarantee you'll personally
pull a cleaver out of his fucking skull.

226
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,275
You understand me?

227
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,073
PETE: You're gonna regret this, Forrest.

228
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,329
RAKES: He's already regretting it,
he's just too ignorant to know it yet.

229
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,488
Go on, go inside now.

230
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,453
(chuckling)

231
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,545
You thinking of drawing on me?

232
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,650
(train whistle in distance)

233
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,994
Say your piece, Jimmy.
I got a business to run.

234
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,123
JIMMY: All right, Forrest.
Now we got a chance

235
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,580
to make a good stack of money
here while the getting is good.

236
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,711
But for things to run smooth,

237
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,293
you got to grease the tracks.

238
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,879
Yeah, I hear what
you're saying, Jimmy, and...

239
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,930
...we go back a long way, so I'm not
gonna make a big deal out of this,

240
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,507
but, uh...

241
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,097
...I'm a Bondurant.

242
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,145
And we don't lay down for nobody.

243
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,902
<i>We'll continue to operate
free and clear here, as always.</i>

244
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,858
Me, I'll never pay no money
to no Mason Wardell

245
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,367
or the next damn bloodsucker
come after him.

246
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,904
I never have, I never will.

247
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,749
I'm sorry you feel that way,
Forrest.

248
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,878
Jimmy, do you have something
that you really wanna say to me?

249
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,626
You can't do it
the old way no more.

250
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,757
I remember there was a time
you had some balls, Jimmy.

251
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,293
(chuckles)

252
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,427
(indistinct chatter)

253
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,014
Well, I guess we'll see what happens.
(clears throat)

254
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,427
Gentlemen.

255
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,647
PETE: Look, Deputy, we've got
something of a problem here.

256
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,363
It's Special Deputy, and
I don't see a problem at all.

257
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,737
I hear these mountain boys
have got, uh...

258
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,951
...injun blood in them.

259
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,914
Cherokee. This would explain
why they're a little...

260
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,579
...animalistic in their nature.

261
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,965
I don't rightly understand
what you mean.

262
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,215
But there's a feeling around
these parts that Forrest Bondurant

263
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,471
is different than other folks.

264
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,966
- Different?
- Indestructible.

265
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,805
(chuckles)
Do you mean "immortal"?

266
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,973
(high-pitched chuckle)

267
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,397
Shit. You fucking hicks are
a sideshow unto yourselves.

268
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,911
Sheriff, you have any idea

269
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,368
what a Thompson submachine gun
does to "immortal"?

270
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,502
Well, this ain't Chicago.
You can't just shoot him.

271
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,504
Do that, people around here
will string us up from a tree.

272
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,881
Do I look stupid to you?

273
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,799
I've been brought in to do a job.

274
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,592
And I know just who to start with.

275
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,138
You know something?

276
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,396
I don't much like you.

277
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,483
Yeah, well, not many do.

278
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,170
HOWARD: - Gimme some of that.
MAN: - Yeah, it's good.

279
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,094
I could run them blockades.

280
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,096
(chuckling)

281
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,014
- You? A blockader? Shit.
JACK: - What do you mean "shit"?

282
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,524
Danny, I can drive a damn sight
better than you can.

283
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,651
Just not in the shitcan we got.

284
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,780
Oh, yeah? Well, Forrest,
he don't wanna hear about it.

285
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,613
Yeah, well...
the hell with Forrest.

286
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,028
I'm sick of being his house dog.

287
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,497
You gonna tell him that?
Or you want me to do that, too?

288
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,460
(coughing)

289
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,132
HOWARD: You all right there, Jack?

290
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,885
Shut up, Howard.

291
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,920
Forrest ain't got no aspirations.

292
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,966
He still sleeps on a mattress on the floor
like a fucking Chinaman.

293
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,807
You might wanna watch your mouth there,
little brother.

294
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,473
(laughing)
- Fuck off, Howard.

295
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,104
- Oh, come on.
- Stop. Stop.

296
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,686
It's... (laughing)

297
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,150
Where are you going with that stuff?

298
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,984
Church.

299
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,620
HOWARD: Hell, you better take
it easy on that jar then!

300
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,906
(laughing)

301
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,085
(people singing in distance,
indistinct)

302
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,675
(indistinct singing continues)

303
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,106
(indistinct singing continues)

304
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,547
<i>♪ He gave a peace</i>

305
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,385
<i>♪ Of the world ♪</i>

306
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,061
Let us pray.

307
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,683
If any man loved the world,

308
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,477
the love of the Father
is not in him.

309
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,031
For all that is in the world,

310
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,990
the lust of the flesh
and the lust of the eyes

311
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,154
and the pride of life

312
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,746
is not of the Father,
but is of the world.

313
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,876
(woman coughing)

314
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,127
Amen.

315
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,210
Thirty-nine, top.

316
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,926
(people vocalizing)

317
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,103
(people singing, indistinct)

318
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,988
(coughing, gagging)

319
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,501
(coughing)

320
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,225
Too much rust
in the tank, maybe.

321
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,854
(vehicle approaching)

322
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,532
- Or lead.
(car door closes)

323
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,587
Mind if I come in?

324
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,252
Don't expect no biscuits
coming out around here.

325
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,302
- Who's that?
- Aunt Winnie.

326
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,726
Why don't you tell Aunt Winnie
this is not a social visit.

327
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,728
Well, I ain't sure
that'll do no good, sir.

328
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,106
She ain't right in the head.

329
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,863
Three things you gotta tell us, son.

330
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,071
Where's the still, where's the
liquor and where's the money?

331
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,664
(Sighs)

332
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,618
JACK: He don't have it.

333
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,289
Now who might you be?

334
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,173
That there is Jack Bondurant.

335
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,337
Well, I'll be damned.

336
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,723
I was told I'd find you here.

337
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,392
And look...

338
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,972
...here you are.

339
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,268
Go find the still,
leave us alone.

340
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,448
So, the runt of the litter.

341
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,960
- You boys don't get it, do you?
(screen door shuts)

342
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,870
Look at me, son.

343
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,466
Oh, you're a peach.

344
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,305
What's going on?

345
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,558
Come closer.

346
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,812
Step forward.

347
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,534
Stop right there.

348
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,498
(grunts)

349
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,467
(impact sounds) (Jack grunting)

350
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,012
- Get up.
(clanging)

351
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,474
(groaning)

352
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,268
I thought they said you
Bondurant boys were

353
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,303
a bunch of hard-boiled
sons of bitches.

354
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,111
(grunting) (hissing, clanging)

355
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,856
Oh, this is terrible.

356
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,198
This just won't do.

357
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,866
(grunts, screams)

358
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,755
My brothers are gonna get you.

359
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,590
They're gonna kill you.

360
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,379
Is that so?

361
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,719
(groaning)
- It's not gonna help right now, is it?

362
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,561
Why don't you tell
those brothers of yours

363
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,892
we're coming for them next.

364
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,107
You tell 'em.

365
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,072
No more!

366
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,283
No more, please.
Please.

367
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,824
(whimpering)

368
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,242
Don't touch me!

369
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,508
Next time I come down real hard.

370
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,190
All right.

371
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,988
So you want to
get into this racket.

372
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,988
But I see you sitting there,

373
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,027
looking like somebody's
punching bag.

374
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,748
Sol ask you...

375
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,707
...what do you
intend to do now?

376
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,757
- What do I intend to do?
- Yeah.

377
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,090
You.

378
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,924
You expect somebody else
to handle it?

379
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,593
- No.
- Howard, maybe?

380
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,682
- That ain't what I meant.
- What did you mean?

381
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,847
I don't need no help.

382
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,057
FORREST: I'm sorry?

383
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,111
- I don't need no help.
- Oh, you don't?

384
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,404
Here it is.

385
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,072
As long as you are my brother,

386
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,616
you will never let this happen
again, do you understand?

387
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,872
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.

388
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,960
What if I can't?

389
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,711
I mean, I ain't... I'm not
built like you and Howard.

390
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,717
I ain't never been like you.

391
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,473
It's all right.

392
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,688
Jack...

393
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,396
...it is not the violence
that sets a man apart.

394
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,237
All right? It is the distance
that he is prepared to go.

395
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,446
Jack, look at me.

396
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,741
We're survivors.

397
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,909
We control the fear.

398
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,749
And without the fear,

399
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,586
we are all as good as dead.

400
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,388
Do you understand?

401
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,093
- Do you?
- Rakes told me to tell you

402
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,099
they're coming for you next.

403
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,843
Hm.

404
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,765
Yeah, well, they'll be back,
you can be sure of that.

405
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,737
Um...

406
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,536
A present from
your preacher friend.

407
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,250
You gonna open it?

408
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,347
(chuckling)

409
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,882
Fuck you, Howard.

410
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,641
HOWARD: Ah, damn.

411
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,568
(door closes)

412
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,814
(car approaching)

413
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,838
(car doors closing)

414
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,179
Forrest Bondurant.

415
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,521
It seems you've been involved
in certain illegal activities.

416
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,903
Illegal activities?

417
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,859
MAN: Look here, Forrest,
if you play ball with us,

418
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,029
we can make this here
summons disappear.

419
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,032
Are you trying
to shake me down, Henry?

420
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,786
I'm just the messenger here,
Forrest.

421
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,375
(door closes)

422
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,925
Have you met Howard?

423
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,256
(footsteps approaching)

424
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,513
Oh, what?
You gonna shoot me, huh?

425
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,844
FORREST: Howard! Howard!
(grunting)

426
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,176
HOWARD: Huh? Huh?

427
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,220
(men grunting)

428
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,856
Huh? You gonna
hurt my brother?!

429
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,153
Huh? You trying to intimidate
us, Sheriff? Huh?

430
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,280
The Bondurants?

431
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,243
All right now.
That's enough now.

432
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,406
You gonna sell out
like them other Cocksuckers?

433
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,416
(grunting, gagging)
- Huh?

434
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,667
FORREST: That's enough now.

435
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,669
Howard, that's enough.

436
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,085
- All right.
(man panting)

437
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,930
You old piece of shit.

438
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,558
FORREST: Now, y'all oughta know better
than to come around here

439
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,560
when Howard's been on the
stump whiskey for a few days.

440
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,514
I think you might wanna
get out of here.

441
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,527
You give my regards

442
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,485
to Special Deputy Rakes.
HOWARD: - Oh, yeah.

443
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,158
It ain't nothing personal, Henry.

444
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,379
MAGGIE: He got that
special look in his eye.

445
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,509
No I don't.

446
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,920
- Yes, he does.
- Yes, you do.

447
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,757
(Jack laughs,
speaks indistinctly)

448
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,267
(all laughing)

449
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,317
I saw you
at the Bondurant place.

450
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,498
You're not from around here.

451
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,370
Chicago, right?

452
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,880
You were a dancer up there.

453
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,545
The Apex Club, wasn't it?

454
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,261
Did a little number
with feathers, I believe.

455
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,679
Something troubling you?

456
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,848
Get out of my way.

457
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,518
Oh, you don't
need to worry about me.

458
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,403
I ain't the kind to
drink from a greasy cup.

459
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,661
FORREST: Where's Jack?

460
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,031
I've seen him swanning
around in Daddy's old suit.

461
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,409
- Listen, Howard.
- Yeah?

462
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,045
I need you here
with me tonight...

463
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,043
I got some business with
a couple out-of-towners

464
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,544
I never dealt with before.

465
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,256
- Yeah? Where they from?
- Chicago.

466
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,640
Yeah, well, me and Danny, we just
gotta stop by the stills first.

467
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,552
You just be here by 11:00 now.
You got that?

468
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,268
HOWARD: I got it.
When have I ever let you down?

469
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,685
(♪ The Bootleggers featuring
Emmylou Harris: "Fire in the Blood")

470
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,422
How'd you like to come
for a ride with me sometime?

471
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,087
You must be jingle-brained
if you think I'm gonna

472
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,048
get in a car
with the likes of you.

473
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,094
Anyway, you oughta be worried
if my father catches you here.

474
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,019
Talking to me.

475
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,272
He's just in the feed store, there.

476
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,109
Why'd I need to be worried?

477
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,983
You know, coming to
the church meeting like that.

478
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,819
And bustin' out of there
like a crazy person.

479
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,033
Are you affected in the head?

480
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,946
Hold on, now, look here.
Look.

481
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,162
Crazy person wear a suit
as fancy as this?

482
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,043
Still don't explain why
you acted like a lunatic.

483
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,622
I didn't want
my feet washed, is all.

484
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,376
- I know who you are.
- Yeah? Who's that?

485
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,844
One of them Bondurant boys,
and that's enough.

486
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,010
There ain't many that have
a good word to say about you.

487
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,019
- Yeah?
- Except some rubbish about a legend.

488
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,055
Yeah.

489
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,476
About you guys being invincible
or some such nonsense.

490
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,146
- Say that word again. What'd you say?
- Invincible.

491
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,152
Well, shoot, I don't know
what that means.

492
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,155
Sounds good, though.

493
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,164
My daddy thinks you boys are
the worst thing ever to hit Franklin.

494
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,324
Well, what would your daddy know?

495
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,584
You sure got a funny way of courting,
Jack Bondurant.

496
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,000
That is what you're doing, right?
Courting?

497
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,676
Yeah.

498
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,765
All right, then.

499
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,890
You tell your daddy I said hi.

500
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,850
- Oh sh...
- Thank you.

501
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,445

504
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,708

506
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,667

(Howard, Ida Belle laughing)

507
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,898
Hey, Red.

508
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,654
Where them feathers at?

509
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,660
He's a crip.
Don't worry about it.

510
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,953
CRICKET: Hey, Forrest.

511
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,587
All right, go tell Maggie
to shut her down.

512
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,347
(clattering) (Maggie grunting)

513
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,770
All right now, that's enough.
Come on, now, get out of here.

514
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,061
(man panting)

515
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,273
I paid for another jar
and she won't give it.

516
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:05,282
- And then the bitch done me.
- No, you didn't.

517
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,818
We gonna buy near 100 gallons
of your liquor.

518
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,203
Now you ain't gonna
throw in some extra?

519
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,280
You ain't buying a goddamn thing.
Now go on, get out of here.

520
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,662
He pulled a gun on her, then she
pulled the knife around and cut him.

521
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,130
Did you pull a gun on this woman?

522
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,339
MAGGIE: Forrest!

523
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,878
(grunting)

524
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,135
I may be a cripple boy,
you sack of shit

525
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,976
but I'll blow your goddamn
brains out if you move!

(gasps) (gurgling)

527
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,363
All right now. Sorry.

528
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,074
Yeah.

529
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,147
Goddamn you, Howard.

530
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,929
Well, you best be getting home.

531
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,224
- OK.
(grunts)

532
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,564
Are you sure you're all right?

533
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,083
A bit too much whoopee
for one night, I guess.

534
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,578
Yeah.

535
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,587
Bye, Forrest.

536

537
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:29,478
Hm. Well that don't
make no sense.

538
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,075
Well, I don't see nothin'...

539
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,579
- Now you got trouble.
(muffled grunts)

Hey, Forrest.

Them doctors are saying
you walked in here.

Um...

571
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,255
You should've been there, Howard.

572
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,329
Look what they did to you.

573
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,470
I'm leaving, Forrest.

00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,636
Huh.

575
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,184
Well, it ain't really the quiet
life you're looking for?

576
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,569
Those people, Forrest...

577
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:11,320
People like them,
they're why I left Chicago.

578
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,827
I got out and ran.

579
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,580
Come here, Maggie.

580
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,926
Now this has nothing
to do with you, you hear?

581
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,432
Nothing at all.

582
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,350
Did you check out
of that place yet?

583

I want you to come stay
at the station for a while.

you're best off close to us.

You can, uh...

You can use the spare room.

590
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,395
I know a fella across the county line,
take your whole run

00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,814
for five dollars on the gallon.

592
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,490
- Baloney.
- No, Howard, it's a fact.

593
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,322
- Cricket got a message to him.
- Five dollars?

594
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,827
- Yep.
- Beat it, Jack.

595
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,408
I'm not in the mind
for your horseshit.

596

I'll do the driving, Howard,
you ain't gotta worry about nothing.

HOWARD: You?

598
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,582
- And Cricket.
- And Cricket,

599
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,167
that twisted little gimp. You're
gonna deal with Floyd Banner?

600
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,958
You're a goddamn house dog, Jack.
You sweep the floors.

601
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,797
You got no goddamn vision, Howard.

602
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,586
Go on, scram, get outta here.

603
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,970
Hey what's eatin' you anyway, huh?

604
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,975
The fact that you let your own brother,
old Forrest, down?

605
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,932
Shut your mouth!

607
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,638
What you doin', Jack?

608
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,308
(stammering) Checkin' on you.

609
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,815
- I'm all right.
- All right, then.

610
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,976
Yeah, I'm all right.

611
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,067
- Yeah, I was just worried.
- I'll be home tomorrow.

612
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,198
Go on, now.

613
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:57,864
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

614
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,745
- Hey.
- What the hell are you doin', Jack?

615
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,999
Come here and help me with this.

616
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,207
Shit, Jack, are you off your nuts?

617
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,747
- I'm done waiting for table scraps.
- Forrest is gonna throttle you.

618
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,007
Don't you worry about that, grab a box.

619
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,668
You just call Gummy Walsh.

620
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,757
You tell him we're
bringing a big load.

621
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,671
Two hundred gallons at least.

622
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,932
- "We?"
- Yeah.

623
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,555
You mean you and me?

624
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,188
Well, hell, I need backup, Cricket.
You my partner or what?

625
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,018
Shit.

626
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,725

Shit.

628
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,371
Jesus, Cricket, you look like you're
about to shit yourself a kitten.

629
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,955
Whoa, you wouldn't really
shoot that thing.

630
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,753
If anybody gonna
give me cause to, I might.

631
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,038
- Oh, bullshit, I don't believe you.
- Absolutely.

632
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,628
Pow, right between the eyes.

JACK: The transmission?

636
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,934
It don't sound like it.

637
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,769
Did you put gas in it?

638
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,900
- Did you put gas in the truck?
- Shit!

639
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,907
You forgot to put gas in it. Well,
what the fuck are we gonna do now?

640
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:19,908
Uh...

641
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,410
- Huh?
- Uh...

642
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,290
I'm sorry, Jack!
I had other things on my mind.

643
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,416
Like robbing your brothers,
for instance.

644
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,919
Other things on your mind? All you
had to do was put gas in the truck!

645
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,421
All you had to do
was put gas in it!

646
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,048
I got me an idea.
I got an idea.

647

- What, you got a better idea?

651
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,098
You're gonna put moonshine
in the gas tank?

00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,446

Wait, wait, wait!
My name's Jack Bondurant.

687

I come from Blackwater Station.

688
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:31,942
That's impressive.

689
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,780
I'll give you four dollars,
but keep it to yourself.

690
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:43,037
Those boys out front,
they only get but three and a half.

691
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:46,499
I was told five.

Let's get it unloaded.

I respect you Bondurants

There's something you ought to know.

699
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:31,327
I heard what happened
to your brother, Forrest.

700
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:34,873
Them cocksuckers that
did it used to work for me.

701
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,262
- They work for you?
- They left my outfit.

702
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,926
Got an offer from some
slick-looking deputy. He wore perfume.

703
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:47,184
Charlie Rakes?

704
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,772
Yeah, that was him.

705
01:00:51,931 --> 01:00:54,184
What happened to Forrest...

706
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,102
...had nothing to do with me.

707
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,572
Make sure you tell Forrest that.

708
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,525
Tell him Floyd Banner says hello.

709
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:06,370
(tears page)

710
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,202
Give him this.

711
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,376
Say it's a gift

712
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,755
from the Midnight Coal Company.

713
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:27,391
Yeah. Now I remember
them Bondurant boys.

714
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,551
That boy's brother,

715
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:33,144
he's the one who walked
20 miles with his head out clear off.

716
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:36,560
They say he goes around drinking
white mule through a hole in his throat.

is some hard-ass crackers

719
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:50,073
pulling a damn blood feud on me!

720
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,913
Now get this sack of shit out of here!

721
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:19,648
You're gonna hold on, Forrest.
You gotta hear me out.

722
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,154
I sold your whole lot
to Floyd Banner in one damn go.

723
01:02:22,313 --> 01:02:24,566
Would have taken you a month
to off-load that.

724
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:27,118
Not only that, I sold it
for five dollars on the barrel.

725
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:29,699
That's twice what you get.
Right here?

726
01:02:32,323 --> 01:02:35,793
That's two thousand dollars,
minus my commission.

727
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,802
Look at you.

728
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,468
You think you're
so goddamn smart.

729

Yeah, you're wrong there, too.

734
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,993
Special Deputy Rakes was the one
hired the men to do that to you.

735
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:15,203

It's a gift.
From Floyd Banner.

739
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,170
It's an address, Forrest.

740
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,555
For where you can find them
bastards who cut your throat.

741
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,763
I say we get 'em tonight.

do for you, Forrest?

- Here?

Lord, if my daddy caught me with one
of those things, he'd murder me.

- you can get inside my car...

and some gal.

- The cripple boy?
- Yep.

958
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:09,474
- Hiding out in the woods.
- You all right?

959
01:25:12,724 --> 01:25:14,852
Come on, miss,
let's get you home, now.

Come on.

Come on.

Don't worry, miss, he'll be fine.

Keep on going.

That friend of yours,
he called me a nance.

965
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:17,080
Why would he say that?

966
01:26:17,246 --> 01:26:19,419
I don't know, sir.

967
01:26:19,582 --> 01:26:22,005
Maybe 'cause you smell funny.

968
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,802
RAKES: What's wrong with
your damn legs, anyway?

969
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,646
I got rickets when I was a kid.

970
01:26:36,808 --> 01:26:38,731
Left me a little hinky.

971
01:26:44,398 --> 01:26:46,571
That's it. Down a bit.

972
01:26:50,696 --> 01:26:52,619
Here, just go in here.

973
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:59,914
What are we...
Why do you want me to go in there?

974
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,425
It's fine. Come on.

Go on, you never meant what?

982
01:28:35,092 --> 01:28:37,720
To walk around like you own the place?

983

I'm sorry they got the car.

your throat cut from ear to ear?

1063

You did that?

1064
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:54,786
I'm not doing it again.

1065

get a move on!

1069
01:36:08,796 --> 01:36:11,549
Wait a minute.
You came back here that night?

1070
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:18,806
They see you?

- Nothing.

1073
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:33,863
I asked you a question.

1074
01:36:34,029 --> 01:36:35,372
