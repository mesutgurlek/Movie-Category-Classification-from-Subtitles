Sir, it's just a small
resistance group.

301
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,123
And there's no reason
to believe they pose
a significant threat.

302
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,875
Well, I'd consider

303
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,544
a deficit of $350 million

304
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,296
a significant threat,

305
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,923
wouldn't you, Johnson?

306
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,009
Fleck!
Sir.

307
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,929

309
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,601
The police

with the unit, sir.

310
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,228
I'm dealing with it
personally.

311
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,856
You do that.
You get him
to the Rehab team,

312
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,944
and maybe we won't
have to worry about
a small resistance group.

313
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,197
Get the hell out of here!
All of you!

314
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,823
You take your time.

315
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,243
And for God's sakes, Fleck,

316
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,703
try to get the police
on our side.

317
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,128
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

318
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,840
You've got four days,
McDaggett.

319
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:37,595
If Cadillac Heights
isn't cleared for demolition
by Friday midnight,

320
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,597
our loans
will be called in.

321
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,349
OCP will be ruined.

322
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,268
We made a deal,
didn't we, chum?

323
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,562
By the way,

324
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,482
if you're just now
figuring out

325
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,485
the line between
big business and war

326
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,529
is a little blurry,

327
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,199
then you're further
over the hill than
they say you are.

328
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,503
This is entrapment.

329
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,131
My client was visiting
close personal friends
in that motel.

330
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,468
Hey, buddy, your client's
close personal friends

331
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,637
were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

332
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,183
That's prejudicial.
Did the arresting officer
ask to see their union cards?

333
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,267
Yeah, yeah!

334
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,853
Cecil, come
get this crap.

335
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,938
Will somebody please
answer the damn phone?

336
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,775
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

337
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,446
You could've fooled me.
I'll deal with them
looters myself,

338
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,282
get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

339
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,335
How're you feeling, Murphy?

340
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,796
I've been better.

341
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,548
Well, I'll be
honest with you,

342
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,967
it looks like you
just made friends
with a Mack truck.

343
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,638
I don't have many

344
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,264
friends.

345
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,808
Captain gave me
the same speech.

346
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,643
Yeah, well,
I heard it before.

347
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,812
How many times
does that make
"before"?

348
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,902
Dr. Lazarus?

349
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,447
You want to tell me
what happened.

350
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,283
Well, Atlanta beat
the Pistons last night.

351
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,078
That's cute.
I meant with, uh, glory boy.

352
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,413
Him.

353
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,166
He got shot to hell
and, uh, set on fire.

354
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,752
You know what
I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order.

355
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,129
I want to know why.

356
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,255
My real opinion?

357
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,507
No, lie. Make up a story.

358
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,343
Well, Mr. Fleck,

359
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,098
offhand, I'd say
the only reason

360
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,808
he'd disobey an order

361
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,102
is if he didn't
agree with it.

362
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,481
Excuse me?

363
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,067
Well, he made a decision.

364
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,778
His friend was in trouble
and he made a judgment call.

365
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,613
Cops do that, you know.
It's in the manual.

366
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,783
Human cops do that.
What do you mean, his friend?
This thing's a machine.

367
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,570
Look, if OCP
just wanted a robot,
why the hell did they

368
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,288
put Murphy in there
in the first place?

369
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,748
Murphy's dead, sweetheart.
That's on record.

370
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,917
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy.

371
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,546
What's left of his face,
portions of the cerebrum,
the cerebellum,

372
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,965
it's human tissue
that's still alive.

373
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,634
How can you interface
human components
with a machine

374
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,053
and then complain
when the human part
makes a decision?

375
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,473
Okay.

376
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,933
So, not only

377
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,102
did we get Murphy's
years of training

378
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,481
and his
law enforcement skills,
we also inherited his...

379
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:20,902
His memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

380
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,446
Well, I'd call it
his humanity,

381
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,073
but I don't think
you know that word.

382
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,243
I see, well...

383
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,414
Tell you what, Doctor,
you talked me into it.
His emotions, get rid of 'em.

384
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,334
Find out where they're
located and erase them.

385
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,586
If that means wiping out
his memory, that's too bad.

386
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:44,383
Um, we could cut out
the appropriate circuits

387
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,970
by, uh, implanting
a micro neuro-barrier.

388
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,770
Do it.

389
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,066
'Cause I got news for you,
babe, I don't give a shit
how smart you are.

390
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,735
OCP owns the cops.
That means they own him.

391
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,695
It means they own
your cute little ass.

392
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,656
Nobody owns me.

393
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,658
Fine.

394
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,453
We want him
on the Rehab team.

395
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,747
That means you
make him predictable,

396
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,874
or you look
for a new job,
sweet cheeks.

397
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,841
I think I'm in love.

398
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,401
What's going through
your head, Murphy?

399
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,795
LEWIS: That's his family.

400
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,798
Do you want me to install
that neuro-barrier, Doctor?

401
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,508
No. I can do it.

402
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,561
I think I'd like
to be alone with him,
if it's all right?

403
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,383
<i>AIex, I thought</i>
<i>you'd never get home.</i>

404
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:59,185
Do not let the fact
that these people
are homeless sway you.

405
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,606
They are terrorists,
pure and simple.

406
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:09,236
On the screens
are suspected
rebel locations.

407
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,156
If any of these locations
appear on your regular beat,

408
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,449
check it out.

409
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,327
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

410
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,745
Hey, Lewis.

411
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,957
Did you hear what
they did to Murphy?

412
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,602
...and a brief description
of the suspicious...

413
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,295
Murphy.

414
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,946
Hey, Lewis,
you want your body armor?

415
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,532
What? No.
I'm off duty.

416
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,162
What's up, anyway?

417
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,165
Do you have family?

418
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,875
Yeah. I have a brother
in Pittsburgh.

419
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,252
The one who doesn't call.
You know that.

420
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,839
Robo, are you okay?

421
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,632
I'm fine.

422
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,094
And call me Murphy.

423
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,036
Murphy?

424
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:13,003
<i>McDAGGETT ON MEGAPHONE:</i>

We're at war, Coontz.
We could use his help.

469
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,229
COONTZ:
Are you kiddin' me?

470
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,648
Look at him!
He's totaled, man!

471
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,442
People, come on!
We don't have time
for this shit!

472
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,696
He's right.

473
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,407
We should go.

474
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,175
Five meter spread!
Search the perimeter.

475
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,511

Move it!

476
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,221
Over there!

00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,305
Damn.

478
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,849
We're tracking him, sir.
He's moving.

479
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,934
That's impossible.
The building's surrounded.

480
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,395
He's gone underground.

481
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,397
Find a manhole.

482
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,756
We got a little held up.

483
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,017
Ew!

00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,852

No, man!

492
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,645
I told you it was
a mistake to bring him.

493
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,313

All right.

We've got wounded
over here.

498
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,156
Clear the way, people,
come on.
Get out of the way.

499
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,783
COONTZ:
Hold up your side.

500
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,916
He don't look too good.

501
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
Well, you wouldn't look
so good either if you took
a grenade in your chest.

502

Tracking.

Beacon.
Tracking?

504
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,768
Tracking beacon?

505
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:17,936
What did I tell you?
He's gonna lead them
right to us.

506
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,429
Shut up, Coontz.

507
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,723
Nikko, what's he
talking about?

508
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,448
Did he booby trap
the 8th Street entrance?

509
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,700
Maybe.

510
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,023
Better get
mobilized, folks.

511
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,651
They got a little too close
to home that time.

512
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,863
It's not worth it, man.

513
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,157
It is not worth this shit!

514
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,494
You better take
a real deep breath
right now, Coontz.

515
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,913
Because if you don't
think it's worth it,

516
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,999
then you're nothing
but excess baggage.

517

You get it together,
Coontz.

519

Cadillac Heights
may not be much,
but it's our homes.

It's all we got.

our homes is worth it,

he's gone underground.

Between me and you,

we have a warrant out

583
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,131
If we eliminate him,

well, let's say,

You're fired.

590

You're fired!
Get out of here.

591

Three days till disaster.

592
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:55,181
What the hell will I tell
my shareholders, Johnson?

593
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,767
What about more Rehabs, sir?

594
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:01,104
We could recruit them
out of the existing
police department.

595
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,357
It will be cheaper
than hiring mercenaries.

596
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,194
And we could use
the Metro West facilities
as a staging area.

597
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,449
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

598
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,451
You're a good man, Johnson.

599
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:17,370
I knew there was some reason
I made you a vice president.

600
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,205
Thank you, sir.
I really...

601
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,959
Yo, yo, heads up,
heads up.

602

Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

Well? Can you fix him?

604
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,314
This isn't a valve job

605
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,235
I never worked on
a damn Robocop before.

606
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,987
I can do the body work,
but...

607
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,408
Look, all we gotta do
is hold onto the Heights
for three more days.

608
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,577
He can hold out
till then, can't he?

listenin' to me?

610

611
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,459
We don't have
the equipment.

612

Well,
he's not here.
I'm sorry.

620
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,436
You don't believe me.

621
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,278
To tell you the truth,
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

622
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,781
He... He had
a message for you.

623
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,493
He said to thank you

624
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,578
for not taking
his memories away.

625
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,893
Well, well, well.

626
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,272
Afraid you're
a little late, pal.

627
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,235
You must be one
of Kanemitsu's boys.

628
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,612
I'm impressed.

629
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,948
Trouble is...

630
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,744
Your boss.

631
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,415
He kind of owns OCP.

632
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:33,668
And OCP is kind of
on our shit list
with a bullet.

633
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,712
So you wanna know
where the rebels are?

634
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,966
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass.

635
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,050
A vehicle is approaching.

636
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,774
How're you doing, Murphy?

637
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:03,901
I've been better.

638
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,695
Give me a status scan.

639
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,321
Organics intact.

640
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,867
System's efficiency, 23%.

641
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,371
It looks like
a direct hit
to the heart.

642
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,999
I may have to recalibrate
the pneumatic systems as well.

643
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,292
Is he gonna die?

644
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,379
Not if I can help it.

645
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,924
Let's get everything
hooked up to the generator.

646
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,968
We've got work to do.

647
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,387
<i>Now, listen.</i>

648
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,223
<i>I'm gonna unpIug you</i>
<i>for a IittIe whiIe, cowboy.</i>

649
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,019
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>Everything's going</i>
<i>to be okay.</i>

650
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,818
<i>Here you go.</i>

651
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:48,821
<i>I got that heart</i>
<i>you wanted.</i>

652
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,407
<i>l said a Nissan.</i>
<i>That's a Kanemitsu.</i>

653
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:52,392
<i>Jesus!</i>

654
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,235
<i>Jeez!</i>
<i>Hey, Zack, we need</i>
<i>that seaIant pack.</i>

655
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,303
<i>Zack!</i>

656
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,497
<i>Marie! Marie, look!</i>

657
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,248
<i>Shit.</i>

658
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,920
<i>Hey, bring that</i>
<i>chest pIate over here.</i>

659
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:05,797
<i>Time for the</i>
<i>chest pIate.</i>

660
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,132
<i>Huh? Hey!</i>

661
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,009
<i>You wait, man.</i>

662
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,845
<i>You are gonna be</i>
<i>so cherry.</i>

663
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,723
<i>Hey, Moreno, watch out</i>
<i>for the, uh...</i>

664
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:18,059
<i>COONTZ: What the hell</i>
<i>are you doing, man?</i>

665
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,886
<i>Well, l didn't know</i>
<i>that thing was there.</i>

666
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,804
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>
<i>lt's behind the...</i>

667
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:22,788
<i>Don't yeII at me.</i>

668
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:23,773
<i>Well, don't do it.</i>

669
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,958
<i>Murphy.</i>

670
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,459
<i>It's you.</i>

671
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:52,385
<i>AIex, I thought</i>
<i>you'd never get home.</i>

672
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,082
<i>WeIcome home, Murphy.</i>

673
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,695
I couldn't sleep.

674
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,946
How are you feeling?

675
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,699
My efficiency rate is 93%.

676
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,204
Anything above 90
is considered normal.

677
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,707
Um, I heard Marie
call you Murphy.

678
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,543
Is that your real name?

679
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:09,629
It was.

680
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:11,839
Before...

681
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,634
Before what?

682
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,106
So, um...

683
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,613
Now that you're better,
will you stay?

684
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,448
Will you help us?

685
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,867
You know what Bertha says?

686
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:43,037
She says if we hold back
the Rehabs
for just two more days,

687
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,122
they won't be able
to make us move.

688
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,916
And they'll have to
let my parents go.

689
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,877
And we'll all be together
like family again.

690
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,673
Your parents?

691
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,531
Murphy, you okay?

692
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,450
Your parents,

693
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,035
you miss them?

694
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,206
Yeah.

695
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,087
But you remember them.

696
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:38,801
Because if you remember them,

697
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,013
they're never really gone.

698
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,244
Hey, Murphy,

699
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,914
I'm glad your
new heart works.

700
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,089
I heard voices.

701
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,343
Shh.

702
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,472
She should be in bed.

703
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,314
Could you leave her
just a moment?

704
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:39,403
Of course.

705
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:59,340
<i>Won't be the same, dear</i>

706
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,718
<i>If you're not here with me</i>

707
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,098
Hey, you gotta pay for that.

708
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,394
Hey!

709
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,066
What are you, deaf?
Son of a...

710
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:39,747
That's not what we said
we were going to do.

711
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:41,232
That is, too,
what we were
gonna do.

712
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:42,975
That's not what we said
we were going to do.

713
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:44,126
That's where
the Heights is.

714
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,110
Right there.
Right there.

715
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:47,061
Hey, Bertha, you told us
to relocate the weapons,

716
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:48,363
but where do you
want this thing?

717
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,017
My God.

718
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,688
How did you get this?

719
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,441
We stole it from
the police depot. Why?

720
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,944
You know this looks
like the exhaust system
from an F-27.

721
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,697
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

722
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,032
The funding ran out
before we got
a chance to test it.

723
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,994
How do you know
so much about it?

724
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,745
I designed it.

725
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:18,043
Well, it looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

726
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,481
Okay, now what
I've done is programmed
the command system

727
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,025
to take its cues
from your hard drive.

728
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,820
I've also rigged it to work
as an auxiliary power unit.

729
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:48,073
So, if you ever have
a power drain
like you did yesterday,

730
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,950
just interface
with the flight pack

731
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,911
and recharge
whether you fly or not.

732
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:55,414
And, Nikko, you see
those resistors over
there by the ratchet?

733
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,166
Get them for me,
will you?

734
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,043
<i>Get them for me, will you?</i>

735
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:05,466
<i>Get them for me.</i>

736
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,052
<i>Promise me.</i>

737
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,097
<i>Get them for me.</i>

738
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,975
<i>Promise me.</i>

739
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,739
What's goin' on?

740
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,115
Excuse me.

741
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:34,912
Hey, man,
where you goin'?

742
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,706
Unfinished business.

743
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,173
It's okay.
He'll be back.

744
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,800
He needs us, too.

745
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,469
Where's he going?

746
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,639
To keep a promise.

747
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,935
LEON: Sarge,
you got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?

748
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,528
Huh? You got
ghost cop?

749
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:01,455
Leon, I told you,
I don't have time for this.

750
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:02,539
You got a vampire cop?

751
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,572
Murphy.

752
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,365
Good evening,
Sergeant Reed.

753
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,784
Do you know
there's a warrant out
for your arrest?

754
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:15,911
Yes.

755
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,539
I was just checkin'.
What can I do for you?

756
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,667
Please direct me
to the Rehab staging area.

757
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,004
Well,
it's just down the hall.
You can't miss it.

758
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,381
Thank you.

759
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:34,430
You may want to call
the fire department.

780
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:37,219
I said I'll clear the area,
and I'll clear it.

781
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,974
Just get the robot cop
off my back.

782
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,739
I understand you're
willing to pay good money

783
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,324
to know where
the rebel Base Op. is.

784
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,285
Yes, well, um...

785
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,871
The money's good,

786
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,124
if the tip's good.

787
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,500
Yeah.

788
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,210
Well, uh...

789
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,758
The last tip saved
your ass, didn't it?

790
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,275
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

791
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,360
What do we have
here, huh?

792
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:38,130
What's the matter?
You don't like a man
in uniform, huh?

793
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,616
Look, my dad lost his job.
I just need some money.
That's all.

794
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,576
We got lots
of money, honey.

795
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:45,287
GIRL: Don't! No!

796
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,997
She said, "No"!

797
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,373
Huh?

798
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,668
Maybe you have
a hearing problem.

799
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,009
Go home, young lady.

800
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,970
You are in violation
of curfew.

801
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,733
Where's McDaggett?

802
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,488
Room 21 2.

803
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:20,948
Thank you.

804
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,617
I hope you are insured.

805
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:26,829
Elevator door sticks.

806
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,517
Don't.

807
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,615
I have a message
from Officer Lewis.

808
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:20,632
Stop!

809
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:24,511
Drive!

810
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,598
I said drive.
Goddammit, drive!

811
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:37,700
...I want my time, my money.

812
01:10:37,784 --> 01:10:39,884
I told you once.
And I'm not going
to tell you again.

813
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:40,869
You understand?

814
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:43,288
I must commandeer
your vehicle
for police use.

815
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,325
What is your
problem, sucker?

816
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,662
I mean, Officer.

817
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,985
Cover me!

818
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,580
Commander!

819
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,980
BOY: Hey,
what's the deal,
Robo was shot?

820
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,702
Where the hell
is Robocop?

821
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,831
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

822
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,341
Hey, are you
doing that?

823
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,926
I got tired
of splicing wires,

824
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,761
so I put in
a pulse tach
decoder.

825
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,845
A telemetric?

826
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,680
No.
Smart ass.

827
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,641
I know you are,
but what am I?

828
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,477
Here, let me try it.

829
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,657
Thanks for the
heart attack, Coontz.

830
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,576
Maybe I will go
and send out a recon team.

831
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:19,037
I got a better idea.

832
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,541
Why don't we just
all have a seat

833
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,668
and relax?

834
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,379
It'll all be over
in a few minutes.

835
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,506
You son of a bitch.

836
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,924
Hey, watch the language.

837
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,009
There's children
present, remember?

838
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,056
Drop it, Coontz.

839
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,145
I'm not gonna ask twice.

840
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:51,653
What did you mean
about it all being over
in a few minutes?

841
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,284
Get the kids
out of here! Now!

842
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,996
Where are we going?
Just follow me.

843
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:12,924
Bertha!

844
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,051
No.

845
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,139
Go.

846
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,602
Got to get her.

847
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:24,686
Go.

848
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,106
Come on, let's go.
Come on!

849
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,199
Now!

850
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,294
Okay, come on.

851
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,051
Come on! Get in!
Come on!

852
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,138
Come on.

853
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:02,140
MAN: Keep going.

854
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,893
Okay. Now go!

855
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,019
Go on!

856
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,230
No! It's happening again.

857
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,232
Don't let them
take you away.

858
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,657
I said go!
Get out of here!

859
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:35,840
Where is he?

860
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,552
Go to hell.

861
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,471
Take her to headquarters.

862
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,723
I promise my men
won't leave a mark on you.

863
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,560
MAN 1: Let's go.
We got 'em all.

864
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,857
Sir, what about
our friend Coontz?

865
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,529
Well, if we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

866
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,992
<i>MAN 2 OVER MEGAPHONE:</i>
<i>This buiIding is now</i>
<i>under OCP jurisdiction.</i>

867
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,208
We are talking about
hundreds of thousands
of dollars in damage.

868
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,168
So Murphy can be
rough on properties.

869
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,670
Yes, well,

870
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:17,340
every cent of it
will be coming out
of your salaries.

871
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:19,551
Hey, you built him.

872
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,769
Sergeant, we're taking
Cadillac Heights.

873
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,273
I'll need 50 of your men
armed and in full-body armor
in one hour.

874
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,276
Mr. Johnson,
you can tell the CEO
the demolition crews

875
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,154
will have total access
at 0600 hours
tomorrow morning.

876
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,866
Hey, we don't do
that kind of work.

877
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,285
That was a direct order,
Sergeant.

878
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,788
Driving people
out of their homes
is no work for a cop!

879
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,333
Now, Sergeant,

880
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,419
1 5 years on the force
is quite an investment.

881
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:56,838
Your job, your pension.

882
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,883
Maybe instead of worrying
about these squatter people,

883
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,093
you might think
about your own family.

884
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,179
I am.

885
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:16,358
I'm thinking I have
to go home and face them.

886
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,292
You can't do this!

887
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:40,965
Look, you are
employees of OCP.
Now remember that!

888
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,346
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits.

889
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,652
Stop that man.

be fighting to the basement.

01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,736
So? We have
a schedule to keep.

939
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,821
We don't fire
on police officers!

940
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,698
You're out of line,
McDaggett.

941
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,200
I'm still in charge here.
I'm pulling the plug!

942
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,911
Sit down.

943
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,746
What, you've gone
war wacky?

944
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:37,710
I said, sit down.

945
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,089
Good idea.

946
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,512
N IKKO: Psst!

947
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,848
How are we getting
out of here anyway?

948
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,225
Nikko!

949
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,437
How did you get...

950
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,065
No, never mind. Did you see
a transmission dish outside?

951
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:02,610
Yeah,
and I was just watching the
Media Break guy pick his nose.

952
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,904
Okay, do you have your
computer with you?

MAN 1: Need more ammo.

01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,475
MAN 2: Ammo! Ammo!

979
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:20,581
MORENO:
Zack's hit!

980
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,506
They're winning,
aren't they, Sergeant?

981
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:41,769
What in the name of...

982
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:07,336
Yes!

983
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,216
Sir?

984
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,566
Splatter that,
you sons of bitches.

985
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,426
All right, Mr. Robocop,

986
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,595
come and get me.

987
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,517
Get away
from the door!

988
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:18,949
Think it over!

989
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:24,496
My God, Johnson.
Our stock has dropped
to nothing.

990
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,623
We're ruined.

991
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,936
How may I help you,
Officer?

992
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,979
By resisting arrest.

993
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,981
Don't count on it, chum.

994
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:53,442
Anyway,
what's the charge?

995
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:55,569
The murder of Ann Lewis.

996
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:00,282
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

997
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:32,022
McDaggett,
you can have OCP.
It's all yours.

998
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,107
<i>Sayonara.</i>

999
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,485
Where are you going?
You're gonna miss all the fun!

1000
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,619
No flashy bravery,
tin man,

1001
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:30,247
or the two cuties
say "bye-bye".

1002
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:33,751
What are you doing?

1003
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:43,635
Stop them! Stop them!

1004
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:55,773
Stupid fools!

1005
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,567
Don't you know
what you've done to us?

1006
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:03,822
Those androids
are programmed with
a thermal fail-safe device.

1007
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:06,533
They're made
to self-destruct.

1008
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:09,244
In 1 5 seconds,
everything within 20 yards

1009
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,955
of where we're standing
will be atomized.

1010
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,625
We're dead,
you stupid slag!

1011
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,627
Don't count on it, chum.

1012
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,763
Hang on.

1013
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,373
MAN: Come on.
Let me give you a hand.

1014
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:23,902
Kanemitsu-san,

1015
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:27,406
I... I realize
that it looks bad,

1016
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:30,325
but maybe our plans
were over ambitious.

1017
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,120
Let's start
a sukoshi bit smaller.

1018
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:35,247
Let's gentrify
this neighborhood,

1019
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,250
build strip malls,
fast food chains,

1020
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:41,462
lots of popular
entertainment.
What do you think?

1021
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:47,885
What did he say?

1022
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,219
He said
you're fired.

1023
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,459
Well, I got to
hand it to you.

1024
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:23,545
What do they call you?

1025
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,130
Murphy, is it?

1026
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:27,883
My friends
call me Murphy.

1027
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:32,888
You call me

1028
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:34,097
Robocop.

1029
01:37:35,122 --> 01:37:38,122
