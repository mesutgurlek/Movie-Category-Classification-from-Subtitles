Teresa Banks was found.

There are irrefutable similarities that
for obvious reasons I cannot discuss

826
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,141
that lead us to conclude
that Laura Palmer was the second,

the third, victim of the same killer.

I can get you a good rate

Sheriff's getting me a rate.

Hey, Jo.

01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,331
I understand you wanted
to see the sheriff up here.

Yes, I did.

It must have happened
about this time 24 hours ago.
