Brute-force login.
The interesting thing is...

...he's coming in through Hong Kong,
Korea and Malaysia...

101

...but he's trying sequential account
numbers. He's hacking all over.

00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,439
Move over for me.

103
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:01,042
JACK: Let's try a rule change on him,
see what he does.

104
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,563
Put in an IPS signature
that black-holes the pattern.

105
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:09,037
- See if that slows him down.
- That'd slow me down.

106
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,404
- That'd be resistant to false positives.
- Yep.

- Thanks.
- Huh.

108

Just write it off?

110
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,643
MAN 2: That depends on how
you view the statistics.

111
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,958
They're not particularly high,
given the fact that...

112
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:30,325
...we're pushing the business into
some new and uncharted areas.

113
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,842
Online banking is where
the business is heading.

114
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,281
Where we have our branches...

115
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:37,837
...we'll provide our customers with
more ways to control their money.

116
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,123
As you can see by the chart,
after the merger...

117
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,881
...Accuwest will have 1100 branches
in 13 states...

118
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,323
...with over 100 billion in assets.
So to answer you, Harry, yes...

119
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:51,242
...we do see a reasonable level
of fraud loss as a cost of doing business.

120
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:54,001
- How many branches do you have?
- Twenty-seven.

121
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,479
As head of network security, Jack...

122
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,844
...you've never really had to think
in terms of economies of scale.

123
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:03,966
- But your philosophy of risk is...
JACK: Wait a second, Gary.

124
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:08,439
Make this clear for me, will you?
What exactly is my philosophy of risk?

125
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,644
- No need to take this personally.
- I take it personally, goddamn it.

126
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:15,117
I've spent 20 years protecting this bank,
its customers and shareholders...

127
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,720
...from unnecessary risk.

128
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,997

what I'm saying.

129
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,681

Fraud loss is inevitable...

130
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,157
...pass it on to the customers
as the cost of doing business.

131

We don't wanna do that, do we?

a little longer than I anticipated.

There's stuff I really have to get to.

136
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,884
- Okay, let's get on with it.
GARY: Network attacks...

137
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,961
...network activity.

138
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,558
- Where is this guy?
- He's in reception.

139
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,922
He said it's personal.
Should I get him?

140
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,884
No, I'll walk over there.

141
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,396
Mr. Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

142
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,285
Jack Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

143
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:13,039
- Do I know you?
- I know you.

144
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,963
- Do you have a card?
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,201
DHD Financial. What can I do for you?

146
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,119
You can give me
the $95,000 you owe me.

147
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,837
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

148
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm collecting for GambleNet U.S.A.
Does that ring a bell?

149
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,396
- No, it doesn't.
- You racked up 95,000 in online wagers.

150
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,922
And I got the paperwork to prove it.

151
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,362
You got the wrong Jack Stanfield.
I don't gamble.

152
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:41,156
- I don't have any debt. Check your facts.
- You're a deadbeat. See you in court.

00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,516
Do you have any wine?

309
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,437
There's some in the bar.

310
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:34,283
COX:
Pim, go and get me a nice bottle of red.

311
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:37,678
I don't know shit about wine, man.
How do I know if it's nice?

312
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,077
Lt'll be dusty.

313
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:44,876
I didn't know he had a gun.

314
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,403
They hit him so hard.

315
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,645
He'll be fine.

316
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,527
It's just a little lump on the head.

317
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,881
- Let's think about something nice, okay?
- Okay.

318
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,125
I know.

319
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,398
We're onboard the Lark.

big section of the country.

You have to do whatever they want.
I don't care what it is.

It may not be that easy.
We've seen their faces.

You're worried I'll give him
peanut oil, Jack.

I know about his allergy.

Don't touch him.

Don't talk to him.

You don't need to be doing this.

How much does a house like this go for?

This is about robbing the bank,
isn't it?

You're using Jack to help you

Arlin, I'm tired of him patronizing me.
Gary is an idiot.

Be that as it may, he's a fact of life...

They're fine, Arlin.

Listen, Jack, Gary doesn't like you
very much...

00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:02,003
...and based on your performance
yesterday, it's not hard to understand.

Also, we had a debt collector here
yesterday asking questions.

- Somebody compromised my identity...

00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,280
...and ran up $95,000 worth
of online gambling debt.

You know me, l...

I don't gamble. I don't have any debt.

421
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,401
Talk to Gary now.

422
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,764
- I want this merger to go smoothly.
- I can't today, I'm...

423
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,804
Today, Jack.

424
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:28,879
Okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

Um, yeah, let me check with Beth.

00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,163
Oh, yeah, Jack. Need something?

430
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,682
Yeah, I just wanted to have a word.

433
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:00,887
...or difficult yesterday,
I wanna apologize.

434
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:04,244
I want you to know I am committed
to this process.

435
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:09,719

- Seem a little stressed. Everything okay?

436
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,959
- Yeah. I'm just fine, Gary. Thank you.
- You sure?

437
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:17,163
- Yeah.
- We can make this merger work...

438
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:19,124
...for everyone's benefit.

439

a problem, my door is always open.

Janet? Come in here
for a second, will you?

442
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,884
We'll do some letters.

443
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:54,486
Janet, if I've been difficult
or distant...

444
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,922

I hope you'll understand.

I appreciate what you do for me.

00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,240

- Okay.

453
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:23,077
Take five minutes out of the day...

454
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:27,605
...and just sit quietly
and take a break.
