give or take.

318
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:12,420
Almost every other county is 40-, 45-,
in some cases 70-percent black.

319
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:14,714
Blacks are more sympathetic
to other blacks.

320
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:17,968
If he gets it moved, he has
a greater chance of color in the jury.

321
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:19,219
We know what that means.

322
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:22,555
But if the trial stays here,
it"s an all-white jury for sure.

323
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:24,349
Now, Taylor, this is for you...

324

...to integrate your brain with
before 3:00 tomorrow.

325
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,896
TAYLOR: Yes.
-He means without blacks on the jury...

326
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,065
...Hailey hasn't got a chance in hell.

327
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:35,360
RUFUS: All right, Noose is up for re-elect?
-Yeah, November.

328
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,612
Reach out to our friends
in the legislature.

329
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,408
Have them call on Noose. We're gonna
help him decide to keep this case in Canton.

330
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:45,412
Also, send a case of whatever it is
he's drinking these days to Lucien Wilbanks.

331
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:49,082
-l believe that's Dewars.
-Keep that old drunk on the sidelines.

Yeah, get me Sam.

No mistakes.
This is the one we've been waiting for.

LUClEN:
Justifiable homicide will never hold up.

336
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:03,179
JAKE: Then my only chance
is to find a shrink who'll testify...

337
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,765
...Carl Lee was insane
at the time of the murders.

338
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:10,228
Well, l might know a man
who owes me a favor.

339
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,482
-You'll file for change of venue.
-Of course.

340
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:18,236
Judge Noose denies it...

341
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,906
...then you'll get an all-white jury
and you'll lose.

342
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:23,825
Thank you for the encouragement.

343
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:28,913
Well, bear in mind that Mr. Hailey
is as guilty as sin under our legal system.

344
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:34,919
It does not permit vigilante violence,
and he took the law into his own hands.

345
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,589
He murdered two people.

346
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:42,635
Two people who had raped
his 1 0-year-old daughter.

347
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,139
You know...

348
00:27:46,307 --> 00:27:48,558
...you can win this case...

349
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,894
...and justice will prevail.

350

The sons of bitches decertified me, Jake.

355

I swore l will never
enter another courtroom ever.

356
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:15,543
Lucien, you"re the best lawyer
I've ever seen.

when they took your license away...

unless you let them.

out of law school?

Yeah.

"Young man, l cannot promise you riches.

"Carl Lee Hailey did murder Billy Ray Cobb,

...the state requests the defendant
be examined by its own doctors.

Your Honor,
we haven't yet asked for bail.

00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,962
Now, Governor Buckley cannot oppose
a request until one is made.

464
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,005
He should've learned that in law school.

Your Honor, even Mr. Brigance"s

One, I have not been elected governor yet.

And number two,
he is required to request bail.

The state opposes any such request.

469
00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:09,480
In the future, why don't we just wait
till he makes the request, huh?

Thank you, Your Honor.

-Your Honor, we would like to request bail.
-Denied.

472
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,196
I have never allowed bail
in a capital-murder case...

473
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:20,700
...and don't feel
that an exception is called for today.

474
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:21,993
Good enough.

475
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,245
We will be filing for a change of venue.

476
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:25,830
I anticipated this.

Let me save you some time,
Mr. Brigance.

478
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,251
Your motion is denied.

479
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,336
JAKE:
Your Honor, we have not yet filed.

480
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:36,382
We are simply indicating
our intent to file in writing by letting you--

481
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,843
I said, request denied.

...how can you summarily deny
this request?

484
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:47,810
It is quite clear that Carl Lee Hailey
cannot receive a fair trial here.

...failure to properly consider
a change of venue...

...has been a reversible decision on appeal
to the state supreme court.

No.... No trial judge
likes his rulings overturned.

I guess you get to submit that brief after all.

Mr. Hailey, you are hereby ordered...

...to remain in custody of
the Madison County sheriff until trial.

Dismissed.

Find me that state doctor.
What's his name? Rodeheaver.

00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:16,107
Get him down here to interview Hailey.

504
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:20,111
Since he's not able to afford a real one,
find who Brigance is using for a shrink.

505
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:23,281
-l want him discredited.
-You want professional or personal dirt?

506

I don't wanna know how.
Get me enough to shatter him.

We can do that. Taylor.

This is $900, Carl Lee.
We said a thousand down.

Them folks over at the bank,
they won't loan me no money on my house.

Why not? Your house is almost paid for.
You borrowed on it before for Lester's trial.

And l lost my job at the mill.

They called Gwen.

01:55:22,558 --> 01:55:26,853
Mr. Hailey experienced a recurrence
of a dissociative condition...

1695
01:55:27,021 --> 01:55:30,898
...as a result of the trauma
caused by the rape of his daughter.

1696
01:55:31,317 --> 01:55:34,861
Now, since Mr. Hailey was unaware
of the reality of his actions...

1697
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,405
...he could not tell right from wrong.

1698
01:55:37,573 --> 01:55:40,908
Nor could he understand
the consequences of his actions.

1699
01:55:41,076 --> 01:55:44,287
He was, therefore, legally insane.

1700

Could not tell right from wrong...

of his actions.

Therefore, legally, insane.

No, of course not.

Of course.

So let me understand this now...

2007

And when they're done...

2008
02:17:14,827 --> 02:17:17,913
...after they've killed her tiny womb...

2009
02:17:20,082 --> 02:17:23,376
...murdered any chance
for her to bear children...

2010
02:17:23,544 --> 02:17:26,212
...to have life beyond her own...

2011
02:17:29,675 --> 02:17:31,801
...they decide to use her
for target practice.

2012
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:37,849
So they start throwing
full beer cans at her.

2013
02:17:39,852 --> 02:17:42,187
They throw them so hard...

2014
02:17:42,855 --> 02:17:46,316
...that it tears the flesh
all the way to her bones.

2015
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:54,115
Then they urinate on her.

2016
02:17:58,871 --> 02:18:00,246
Now comes the hanging.

2017

They tie a noose.

2019
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:14,886
Imagine the noose coiling
tight around her neck...

2020
02:18:15,429 --> 02:18:18,056
...and a sudden blinding jerk.

2021
02:18:19,141 --> 02:18:22,018
She"s pulled into the air
and her feet and legs go kicking....

...isn't strong enough.

2025
02:18:31,779 --> 02:18:34,406
It snaps and she falls...

...back to the earth.

2027
02:18:40,121 --> 02:18:42,122
So they pick her up...

2028
02:18:43,249 --> 02:18:45,583
...throw her in the back of the truck...

2029

...drive out to Foggy Creek Bridge...

2030

...pitch her over the edge.

2031
02:18:56,012 --> 02:19:00,890
And she drops some 30 feet
down to the creek bottom below.
