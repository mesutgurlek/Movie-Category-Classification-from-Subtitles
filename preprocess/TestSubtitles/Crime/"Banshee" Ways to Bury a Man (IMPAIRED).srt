322
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,875
- I'm sorry, Deva.
- I don't give a shit if you're sorry.

323
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:26,474
Jesus fucking Christ, Dad.

324
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,138
Do you even see how fucked up you are?

325
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:30,240
- It's all right. I just...
- No, it's not all right.

326
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:32,477
Nothing about this is all right.

327
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,677
We are so fucked. This
whole family is so fucked.

328
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,044
- Deva...
- Get off me!

329
00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:40,178
Gordon, let her go.

330
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,545
She called you.

331
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:51,690
- Look, tonight was...
- Gordon, you don't have to explain yourself.

332
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,322
Least of all to me.

333
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,623
- Mr. and Mrs. Hopewell?
- Yes.

334
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,864
Dr. Kessler, I'm the resident on duty.

335
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:59,563
- How is he?
- Max is stable.

336
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,097
He suffered from an acute attack.

337
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,632
How?

338
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:04,233
We're really good about his meds

339
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:05,940
and he always has his inhaler nearby.

340
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:07,909
Nobody did anything wrong.

341
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:09,814
His condition is deteriorating.

342
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,784
His medicine is no longer as effective.

343
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,523
It looks like you already
talked to Max's pulmonologist

344
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:15,986
- about leukotriene modifiers...
- Yeah.

345
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:19,052
- ...beta agonists...
- Yeah, yeah, we thought...

346
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:22,984
we thought we had more time
before all that was necessary.

347
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,621
You need to talk to his doctor.

348
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:27,052
I'm gonna go check on
Max. I'll be right back.

349
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,065
Mr. Proctor.

350
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:41,729
Sheamus, please explain
to me why we're closed.

351
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,201
They came in here,
they busted everybody,

352
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,904
and they took our girls.

353
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:48,134
That's basically what happened.

354
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,734
Very unfortunate.

355
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,702
Obviously not your fault.

356
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,174
Just give me the arrest warrant.

357
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:55,141
I'll take it up with my lawyers.

358
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:59,918
- The warrant?
- Yeah, the arrest warrant.

359
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:02,654
I'm sure you didn't let a bunch of cops
come in here and shut down my business

360
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,318
without a legal arrest warrant.

361
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,591
They just came through the
front door locked and loaded.

362

365
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:25,610

Keep my club open.

366
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,649
Got that?

371
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:46,265
for lunch.

372
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,045
I don't know what we're
gonna do about this.

373
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,085
We're gonna talk to the
insurance company again.

374
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:01,980
They've gotta be
willing to pay for more.

375
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:04,991
They say that Max's asthma
has a chronic condition limit,

376
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,927
and if they don't think the
asthma's gonna get any better,

377
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,760
then they're not gonna
approve new treatment.

378
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:16,332
We're just gonna have to pay
for the treatments ourselves.

379
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,834
Where are we gonna get cash like that?

380
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:26,636
God damn it, how did I let
things get this screwed up?

381
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:38,576
You're a good father, Gordon.

382
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,415
Juliet: They're not gonna
say anything about Proctor.

383
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,985
They're more scared of him than you.

384
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:56,650
And you're not?

385
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:59,353
Proctor owns this whole town.

386
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:01,224
He doesn't own me.

387
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:03,359
<i>How about you?</i>

388

394
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,088
I see him three to four times a week.

395
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:41,193
- He pays you? - Mm-hmm,
but he calls them gifts.

396
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,530
And what would he do if you said no?

397
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:48,358
He'd get me fired from the
club and I need the money.

398
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,861
So, what do you want to tell me?

399
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:53,267
If I gave you something on Proctor,

400
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,834
would you put him away?

401
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,528
Could you even put him away?

402
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,966
Depends what it is.

403
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,935
- Would I have to testify?
- Depends what it is.

404
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,332
Well, I won't testify, and
you have to promise me...

405
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:05,604
- I can't promise you anything until I know what you've got.
- And he can't know it's me.

406
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:07,940
Listen, I got a jail full
of whores I can do this with.

407
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:09,371
And I have a...

408
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,569
I have a son.

409
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,011
Fuck.

410
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,411
Listen, if what you've got is
big enough to put Proctor away,

411
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,745
<i>I'll do everything I can
to keep you out of it.</i>

412
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,081
That's as close to a promise
as you're gonna get right now.

413
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,552
No?

414
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:29,225
There was this guy I used to see.

415
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,426
[sniffles] A client.

416
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,191
He used to drive trucks for
Proctor, running X into Philly.

417
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:38,928
- Ecstasy?
- He said Proctor has this place where they do it all...

418
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,202
<i>cook it, pack it, and ship it off.</i>

419

00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:46,671
Matt Sharp.

unemployment's at 9%.

430
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:13,901
You wouldn't want to keep an honest
man from making a buck, would ya?

431
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,673
An honest man, no.

- Are you one of those affirmative action hires?
- Hey.

436
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,109
How do you like sitting in
the front seat versus the back?

437
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,381
Not as good as it'll feel
