he does is so important.

You wanna quit?

333
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:28,867
No.

334
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,269
I want a raise.

335
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,604
This is a declaration of war.

336
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:34,105
Who could have done this?

337
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:35,906
A concealment spell was placed

338
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,675
to make everything look normal.

339
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,042
They were searching for something,

340
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,011

341
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:45,617
Elemental magic is neutral.

342
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:50,188
At its root it's neither good nor evil.

343
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,260
But this is different.

344
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:57,561
This is dark magic.

345
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,797
Beyond evil.

346
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,036
They tied him to the chair.

347
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,884
"Death."

348
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,553
Is that part of the spell?

349
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,956
You were here last night
before he died, right?

350
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,925
Yes.

351
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:33,230
Let me see your hands.

352

Now.

353
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:47,244
I was five years old

354
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,914
when witches set our house on fire.

355
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,616
My parents died.

356
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,684
But you walked through the flames,

357
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:54,018
wrapped me in a blanket,

358
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:56,320
and jumped out the second story window.

359
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:58,289
Your body broke the fall.

360
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:01,792
I told you we'd met before.

361
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:05,163
If you don't remember, I
can refer you to the entry...

362
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:09,000
No. I remember.

363
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:15,105
You hunted down the witches
and brought them to justice.

364
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:20,612
I've waited my entire life for
the opportunity to help you.

365
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,883
Well, now's your chance.

366
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:30,287
You can help me hunt the
witches that did this.

367
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:37,127
Shouldn't I have a gun or
an iron mallet or something?

368
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,932
Take a deep breath. Center yourself.

DOLAN THE 37TH: Right. Of course.

370
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,636
Because resisting enchantment
requires a clear mind.
