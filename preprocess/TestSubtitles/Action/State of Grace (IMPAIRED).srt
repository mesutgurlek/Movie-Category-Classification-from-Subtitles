How ya doin'?

2
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,096
That's for you.

3
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,561
- You sure you're up for this?
- Yeah.

4
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:54,026
- So, see you tonight, right?
- Yeah.

5
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,822
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,576
- So I'll see you tonight.
- OK.

7
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,005
<i>- (man) What happened to you?
- (man #2) What does it look like?

8
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,924
I don't know.

9
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:23,097
I had this pit bull, right?
Joe. Joe the dog.

10
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,267
I go to feed the fuck, right?
I put his bowl down, he goes nuts.

11
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,062
Bites my fucking thumb off.
19 stitches.

12
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,773
I'm in the hospital three days.

13
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,944
I get out. I get my gun.

14
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:41,740
I go to him "You like to bite things?"
Bite this. " I put the gun in his mouth.

15
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,201
Bam! I blow him
all over the apartment.

16
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,829
- Ever see a dog explode?
- They're here.

17
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:03,095
This neighbourhood's a real shit hole.
I don't know why you had to meet here.

18
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,807
We'll do the next meeting at
Tavern on the Green, all right?

19
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,730
- How you doin', Noonan?
- I'm cold. Let's get this over with.

20
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,857
- Fine. Let's see the stuff.
- Show 'em.

21
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,366
- Let's see the money.
- We'll take this at a little discount.

22
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,328
- I knew this shit was gonna happen.
- This is fucking bullshit.

23
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,040
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me?

24
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,333
- I'll shoot him.
- Don't point that at me.

25
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,377
We'll walk away. This is bullshit.

26
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,963
<i>Give me the bag.
I want to shoot you.

27
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,507
Shoot him.
I'll take this and get the fuck...

28
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,261
Did you hear what I said?
I said give me the fucking bag.

29
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,889
Don't be a fool.
Give me the bag. You want to die?

30
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,724
- Shut up.
- Want me to shoot him?

31
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,101
- I don't give a fuck.
- I'll shoot you now.

32
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,228
Give me the fucking bag!

33
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,773
- Let's go.
- Want to fucking get shot?

34
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,108
Give me that fucking bag!

35
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,999
- Jesus Christ...
- What happened back there?

36
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,959
- What?
- Nothing, right?

37
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,753
I don't... No! No!

38
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,214
- Do you know me?
- No, I don't know ya!

39
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,966
All right, put me
in a subway station. Go!

40
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,425
<i>(# "White City" by the Pogues)

41
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,152
He's wearing a silk suit.
He's got crocodile shoes.

42
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,990
I said "I don't care what fucking shoes
you wear. You're still a crack dealer. "

43
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,036
The guy says "I didn't know
I was in your neighbourhood, man. "

44
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,163
Like his balls were in his throat.

45
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,500
"Don't go to pieces" I tell him.
Then he gets the joke.

46
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,090
- Who the fuck is this?
- What do you want?

47
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,467
- Whatever you're having.
- Fuck you.

48
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,520
Trying to hurt my feelings?
Won't introduce me to your friends?

49
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,981
- Terry?
- That took you fucking long enough.

50
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,317
Terry Noonan. Terry.

00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,714
This is my best fucking friend.
See, I love this fucking guy.

Where you been, fucking Mars?
You're looking good.

58

I gotta take my lord here for a stroll.

59
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,722
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wanna go somewhere?

60
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,056
- Yeah.
- OK.

61
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,392
Hey, catch you guys later, all right?

62
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,812
Give me this, give me this.

<i>You're a fucking prick. (laughs)

64
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,655
Where'd our fucking neighbourhood go?
I don't even recognise the place.

65
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,951
A bunch of yuppie condos.
They could've left ten blocks for the Irish.

66
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,413
They don't even want to call it
Hell's Kitchen no more.

67
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,917
Renamed it Clinton.
Sounds like a fucking steamboat.

68
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,134
These guys you dropped.

69
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,765
- The guy you were with, this...
- My partner? DeMarco.

70
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,186
DeMarco? Can you trust him?

71
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,773
He might as well have done it himself,
Jack. Who's he gonna tell?

72
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,027
Who's he gonna tell?
Anybody he fucking wants.

73
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:14,198
Terry, this guy, this DeMarco,

74
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,576
he gets into a little trouble
with the cops, right?

75
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,497
He'd trade everything he knows
about you for a slice of pizza.

76
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,707
Wake up.

77
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,132
Would you ask Mikey
if he'd throw me something?

78
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,552
Mikey met with a little accident.

79
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,597
So did Flynn.
Frankie's running the show now.

80
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:42,393
- Frankie's the boss?
- My big brother is the boss.

81
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,645
- Frank's the boss?
- Yeah.

82
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,651
He's trying to put this deal together
with the Italians. This guy Borelli.

83
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,153
- Joe Borelli?
- You heard of him?

84
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,198
We're like that.

85
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,660
- Hey, you want another beer?
- I'd love one.

86
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,797
Cheers.

87
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,593
Is your sister still around?

88
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,846
No, Kate moved way the fuck uptown.

89
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,017
- You wouldn't recognise her.
- Yeah?

90
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,021
Terry.

91
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,315
Check this out.

92
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,411
- What the fuck is that?
- It's...

93
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,916
It's Frankie's idea.
You got your favourite gun, right?

94
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,838
He got tired of tossing away
a perfectly good piece after every job.

95
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,049
You take your hands,

96
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,345
and you take your gun.

97
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,223
You put the prints on the gun,
you stash it.

98
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,687
The cops find the gun.
They're lookin' for a dead man.

99
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,981
- This is somebody's hands?
- Yeah.

100
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,693
- What are you touching 'em for?
- Terry, meet Flynn.

101
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,821
Don't fuck with me.
No, don't fuck with me.

102
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:23,327

- Don't! Don't! You're gonna get... Fuck!

- That's somebody's hands!
- Are you scared?

104
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,377
- Get the fuck...
- All right, hands up.

105
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,380
- Put 'em back.

106
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,591
- They're in. All right?
- You're a sick pup.

00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,892
Sweet.

110
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,479
See this gun I got here?
I love this fucking gun.

111
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,069
- I usually shoot straight when I'm drunk.
- You mean you were aiming?

112
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,786
Thank God you're back. I was feeling like
the last fucking Irishman in the Kitchen.

113
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,208
Terry, you've been away
too long. You gotta wake up.

114
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,587
Never do business with a greaser.
The cops get him, they got an eyewitness.

115
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,508
And an eyewitness puts you away.
Unless it's around here.

116
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,636
The cops can't do shit around here.

117
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,473
Now, me and Frankie took
this union guy out last year.

118
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,268
Went up to him on the street,
popped his button.

119
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:32,271
There must've been 50 witnesses.

120
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,232
Cops were all over the Kitchen
asking questions.

121
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,777
This one asshole raised his hand.

122
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,992
Cops found his head spinning
inside a washer- dryer over on 47th.

123
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,244
Haven't heard from the cops in a year.

124
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,705
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

125
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,213
- Jackie, where the hell were you?
- Kate.

126
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,758
I waited for you. You said you'd come by.

127
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,218
- When?
- You don't remember?

128
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,597
- At my apartment.
- You shouldn't have moved so far away.

129
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,516
She moved all the fucking way
uptown. Who can get there?

130
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,811
Oh, right. You get above the 50s,
you get disoriented.

131
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,022
Hello, Kathleen.

132
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,694
- Well.
- It's Terry Noonan. He showed up.

133
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,032
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- How are you?

134
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,451
I thought you were...
Where did we think he was?

135
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,661
Nobody knew.

136
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,706
So, you got nostalgic for mayhem?

137
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,458
Yeah, he just appeared.

138
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,836
It's like angels were flying by,
so they dropped him off.

139
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,640
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

140
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,059
You've got this look. What's this look?

141
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,228
Trying to remember how I feel about you.

142
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,855
- That hard?
- Yeah, right.

143
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:01,568
- I think I'm pissed.
- Yeah, you guys were, you know.

144
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,738
Young. Very young.

145
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,325
She cried a lot when you went away.
My poor little sister.

146
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,495
She cried every night, praying
to the rosary you'd come back.

147
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,790
- You broke her heart, Terry.
- You're an asshole, Jackie.

148
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,751
- What did I do?
- I gotta go.

149
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,586
Stay. Have some coffee.

150
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,797
- You just got here.
- I gotta go to work.

151
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,092
Come on. I never see you.
Just for a minute.

152
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,970
- Terry asked about you.
- What did he want to know?

153
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,973
She works up at the Regent Hotel.

154
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,726
Ashtray in the lobby
costs more than my car.

155
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,521
It's a supernatural event for her
to come down here amongst us.

156
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,483
So, what was it I forgot?

157
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,070
You said it would be no trouble
doing that favour I asked you.

158
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,532
My car got hit by a cab.
I used up all my money to pay for it.

159
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,703
- I have nothing to live on till payday.
- I can loan you right now.

160
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,289
She likes our money,
but not the way we get it.

161
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,333
Why don't you keep it?
Keep your money.

162
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,213
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

163
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,135
Sometimes my feelings get hurt too,
you know? The way you snub us.

164
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,596
Take the money, Kathleen.

165
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:14,099
- Come on, take it.
- All right. Thank you, Jackie.

166
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,560
You're welcome.

167
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,484
So, Terry.

168
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:28,739
- You just passin' through?
- No. He's coming home.

169
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,659
We're trying to work something out.

170
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,830
If you get above the 40s,
maybe you'll run into me.

171
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,959
It could happen. Right?

172
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,005
<i>- Be up to the angels, I guess.
- (Jackie) Them fucks.

173
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:50,511
- Well, nice to see you... I guess.
- Same.

174
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,191
My mother-in-law's got
a foot thing I gotta pay for.

175
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,152
- She's got a foot thing.
- She's in the hospital.

176
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,363
It isn't up to me, all right?

177
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,201
Hey, Stevie! I got a surprise for you!

178
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,745
Don't bother me. I'm negotiatin'.

179
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:20,207
- Hey, negotiator!
- I don't believe this!

180
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,668
Terry fuckin' Noonan!

181
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,796
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Fuck, look at you.

182
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,507
Scary Terry. What the fuck is this?

183
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:33,595
- You go to the seminary? You don't write.
- He's bigger than me now.

184
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,514
- It's been a long time.
- Ten years.

185
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,433
- 12 years.
- We're doin' business.

186
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,478
Hey, Stevie. 300 bucks here, Stevie.
It ain't even gonna cut it.

187
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:45,816
- Where'd you find these two idiots?
- They come lookin' for me.

188
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:49,111
They take my money. I work
my ass off for it and they take it.

189
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,239
Listen. This punk owes
Jimmy Cavello eight grand.

190
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:55,325
Cavello's got cuff links
cost more than that.

191
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,329
Eight grand buys Jimmy
a Broadway ticket. Let's talk business.

192
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,623
They're out of spumone,
you blame the waiter?

193
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,461
What do we have, another mick
to contend with? What's going on?

194
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,422
- You heard what I said.
- Where you fuckin' been?

195
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,925
The last guinea around here was
Columbus. He only lasted a week.

196
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,804
Are you some kind of fuckin' asshole,
or just taking lessons?

197
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,808
Hey, I'll kill you!

You want to do that?

Play it out? Let's straighten this out here.

It's over, man!

203

Cocksucker. Who do you think
you're fuckin' with, eh?

204
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,264
You'll be hearing from
Jimmy Cavello, Stevie.

205
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,188
Hope that was your favourite gun.
I hope you loved that gun.

206
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,315
You don't know who you fucked with!

207
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,651
You motherfucker.

208
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,028
Fuck 'em.

209
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,406
- You fuckin' guys.
- You got it all?

210
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:19,034
You're better than the cavalry.
You saved me from the guineas.

211
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,914
- They was gonna burn you at the stake.
- I'm glad you're back. I missed you.

212
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,583
We'll take this town apart
on St Patty's Day.

213
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,588
Stevie, there's a horse runnin'
called Old Friend Arrives.

214
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,133
No shit. Look at this.

215
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,552
You saved my ass,
now you'll win me money.

216
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,179
I love ya. I gotta go.
OTB opens in ten minutes.

217
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,599
- Hey, today's my lucky day.
- See ya later.

218
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,352
Luckiest day he ever had,
his dog got run over.

219
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,356
- Is he fucked up or is he fucked up?
- I wouldn't let him operate on me.

220
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,692
You'd have to be dead two years first.

221
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,365
I'm gonna call Frankie
about taking you on.

222
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,244
We'll probably have to
go to Jersey to see him.

223
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,205
Jersey? Frankie lives in Jersey?

224
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,126
Yeah. What's the fuckin' world coming to?

225
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:32,191
I want to have kids. I just gotta
find the right broad, like Frankie did.

226
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,987
She'd let me fuck around on weekends,
and make pancakes before Sunday Mass.

227
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,239
- Like Irene, maybe.
- Who's Irene?

228
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:43,243
I spend one night with her, my eyes
are crossed for days. I walk into walls.

229
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,245
- I'd like to meet her.
- She's mine.

230
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,831
- Uncle Jackie!
- Hey.

231
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,126
Hey, hey. Lola, come here.

232
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,712
Look what the fuckin' cat dragged in.

233
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,423
Nice to see you, Terry.
You remember Maureen?

234
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,219
- How you doin'?
- Come on inside. We should talk.

235
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:02,471
- I'm Pat.
- How you doin'?

236
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:06,475
Play with the kids, OK, Jackie?
Teach 'em how to kneel or something.

237
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,936
<i>(Jackie) You want to see my gun, hm?

238
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:24,118
Before you began exploiting these
pathetic skanks' addictive personalities,

239
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,079
- Where were you?
- A lot of different places.

240
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,291
Tell me about one.

241
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,003
- Texas.
- No shit?

242
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,299
I did my bit with the Corps.
Worked an oil rig for a while.

243
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:43,470
Spent a couple of years driving
heavy machinery in Oklahoma.

244
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,141
Even rode a jackhammer in Milwaukee.

245
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,646
You picked some very odd fuckin' places.

246
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,153
- No time in the slam, huh?
- No.

247
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,031
You're lucky.

248
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:10,706
I gotta say, when you was a kid,
I never took you for a shooter.

249
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:17,504
You weren't somebody I'd expect to drop
two guys, like I hear you did in the Bronx.

250
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,758
I'll do a good job for you. Take me on.

251
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,843
We'll see.

252
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,221
You wouldn't regret it.

253
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,775
- What do I have to do?
- It's gonna be a hoot, man.

254
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,115
Check him out, Pat.

255
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,952
Find this DeMarco guy
Jackie says is the hit.

256
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,873
If things check out,
relocate DeMarco in a dumpster.

257
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,462
Noonan's with us, I don't want the cops to
look at us for drug bullshit from the Bronx.

258
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,576
This is how me and Frankie deal with
guys tearing apart the neighbourhood.

259
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:33,372
Easier than sending a telegram.
Don't cost as much.

260
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:41,046
These guys get rich evicting
the real people who live here.

261
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,716
They kick out the Irish
to build yuppie nests.

262
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,016
Yuppies gotta be thicker
than the rats and the roaches.

263
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,353
Assholes can't live without their dogs.

264
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,482
Got dog shit all over the sidewalk.
It never used to be that way.

265
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,528
Used to be, you dropped a cone,
you could pick it up and finish it.

266
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:09,158
People wander the streets homeless
cos of these assholes.

267

- Yeah. And I'm Friar Fuck.

- 100-yard dash.

269

- 100-yard dash?
- Yeah.

270

Are you fuckin' crazy?
You'll blow up the whole place.

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,423
Listen, I have a break in an hour.

303
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,591
- Meet you here?
- Sure.

304
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,552
- Or outside?
- Here's OK.

305
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,680
- Outside's better.
- OK.

306
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,601
I love your uniform.

307
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,817
Is this your dinner break?
You wanna go eat?

308
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,070
Yeah, we could.
I'm not hungry, really.

309
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,157
Frankie's kids are cute.

310
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:21,243
His wife looks great next to him in court.

311
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,871
They're some Laura Ashley
suburban mutation.

312
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:26,832
He commutes,
she drives a station wagon.

313
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,217
<i>So what are we doin'?

314
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,181
I wanted to see you.

315
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:44,308
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

316
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:47,144
Where's Jackie? Did he stand you up?

317
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,355
He ran into Irene.

318
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,232
What a slut.

319
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,653
So how come you don't have a boyfriend?

320
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,157
I do have a boyfriend. He's out of town.

321
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,951
I met him at the hotel. He travels a lot.

322
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:11,251
I'm lying. I recently broke up.

323
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:20,094
- I'm divorced.
- Divorced? Really?

324
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,430
Any kids? I hope not.

325
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,100
Six months ago. Yeah, no kids.

326
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,442
- Let's go dancing.
- Don't you want dinner?

327
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,903
- Don't you have to go back?
- I got somebody.

328
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:42,783
I called the girl who works the other shift.
I begged her. We can do that.

329
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,415
<i>You want to go dancing with me?

330
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:56,588
Come on, Terry. No one forgets
their first love. You know that.

331
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,512
Just the slow ones?

332
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,433
Just the slow ones.

333
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,729
<i>? Well, you tell us that we're wrong

334
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:19,153
<i>? You tell us not to sing our song

335
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:27,619
<i>? Nothing we can say will make you see

336
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:35,753
<i>? You got a heart of stone
you can never feel

337
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:42,634
<i>? You say: oh, I'm not afraid,
it can't happen to me

338
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:16,627
- Yeah?
- DeMarco. Buick's out front.

339
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,421
- Point him out.
- You gotta be kidding me, man.

340
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:32,476
In the corner. At the table.

341
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,687
Just wanted change.

342
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:48,158
I understand you knew a Terry Noonan.

343
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,494
Get out of my face. I don't know no one.

344
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:54,331
- What's this?
- We're gonna go for a little walk.

345
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,500
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.

346
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,585
- Let's go.
- I don't know no one.

347
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,254
- Come on.
- I don't!

348
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,091
<i>(pounding on door)

349
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:10,097
- Yeah?
- Hey, Terry. Terry, it's me, Jackie.

350
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,433
Frankie wants us on the job.

351
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:20,232
Now? It's two in the morning, man.

352
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:24,778
This is one of Frankie's peak hours.

353
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:01,815
- How are you, Mr Raferty?
- I'm fine, Stevie.

354
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,906
I got you five cases of Bushmills.

355
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,826
Nobody drinks it, Flannery.
It costs too much.

356
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:18,332
I'm selling it cheap. 900 bucks for
all five cases. I'm doing you a favour.

357
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:21,210
Mikey McDonnell ran
the same scam on me for 500.

358
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:24,880
Might be the reason
Mikey didn't leave nothing in his will.

359
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,965
<i>(men chuckling)

360
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:32,763
I ain't paying for any
goddamn Bushmills I don't need.

361
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:35,057
Jackie, check out the bar.

362
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:38,352
- See what this gentleman needs.
- Sure thing, Frank.

363
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,762
Stevie, what are you doing
with these bums?

364
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,142
Stevie, are you gonna let
this dickhead insult us like that?

365
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:23,397
Looks like they're low. Bar got crowded
tomorrow, it'd go dry in an hour.

366
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:26,066
<i>(men chuckle)

367
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,405
Ain't givin' you a fuckin' cent, Flannery.

368
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:44,126
What are you doing?
It's like beating up your grandfather.

369
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,211
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

370
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,631
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Fuck you. You shut the fuck up.

371
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:53,093
- I won't tell you again! Shut up!
- The man's 50 years old!

372
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,429
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

373
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,097
- Fuck you!
- Stevie, shut up!

374
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,641

- Hey, Stevie!

375
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:04,104
Hey, Pat! Fuck you! Shut up!

376
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:08,650
- I want your opinion, I'll dial your asshole.
- Nicholson's the asshole.

377
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,404
What the fuck is goin' on here?!

378
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:16,408
- Terry! Get outta here!
- What's the matter, tough guy?

379
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,039
Get outta here!

380
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,918
Get outta here!

381
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:30,297
Pat, you do what I'm telling you!
Get outta here!

382
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:35,386
The bunch of you,
get the fuck outta here!

383
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,471
Get outta here!

384
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:49,316
I want the balance in two days, Raferty,

385
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:52,736
or you can scratch your name
out of the Yellow Pages.

386
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:57,741
- What the fuck were you doin'?
- He hit Stevie.

387
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:01,328
I know he hit him. He was supposed to.
He acted like an asshole.

388
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,914
Why do we have to
beat the shit out of an old man?

389
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,749
To scare him, you clown.

390
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,918
He was scared. He was already scared.

391
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,796
We're trying to intimidate this dickhead.

392
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:14,591
Then we're in a self-inflicted brawl
acting like a bunch of cowboys.

393
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:17,720
The one thing Borelli don't want!

394
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,597
He'll piss on us if he thinks
we lost our manners.

395
00:36:20,723 --> 00:36:22,933
Frankie, I was fuckin' proud of ya.

396
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:27,229
Acting like yourself for a change,
jumping in there. Not like a greaseball.

397
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:31,525
You check with Borelli before you shit.
I don't know who you are half the time.

- Fuck you.
- I'm sorry if I love you.

- You're my brother.
- You're a curse.

- You were doin' a good job of it, too.

401
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,293
You fuck me up again,
the whip comes down.

402
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,837

What's the matter?

00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,769
Terry, what is it?

407
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:59,817
Now, Frankie, if we're gonna work
together, I got a little problem.

408
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,819
Somehow I got to solve it.

409
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:04,363
Is it something I could
help you with, Mr Borelli?

410
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,574
Stevie McGuire.
Lives in your neighbourhood.

411
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:10,327
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

412
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:13,163
It's true. He runs some errands for me.

413
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,792
It's also true he owes
Jimmy here eight grand.

414
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:20,879
Now, eight grand's not a lot of money.
I got guys out there owe me 80.

415
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:24,383
Except I know I'm gonna
get it back from them.

416
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,345
It's really not the eight grand
that's got Jimmy and me upset here.

417
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:32,016
It's this McGuire kid's attitude.

418
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:34,560
Jimmy here goes asking for our money,

419
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:39,606
and this McGuire kid, he spills
a drink on Jimmy's new cashmere.

420
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,775
Did it deliberately.

421
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,194
This is what Jimmy tells me.

422
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,447
Now Jimmy can't get the stain out.

423
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:51,160
He's been to six fucking cleaners,
and the best they could do was fade it.

424
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:55,289
This kid just doesn't have
any respect for Jimmy here.

425
00:40:55,456 --> 00:41:00,627
And if he's got no respect for Jimmy,
he's got no respect for me.

426
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:06,425
Frankie, the most important thing
in doing business is good manners.

427
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,053
And I really don't think it would be proper

428
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,682
for us to have to go into your
neighbourhood to solve our problem.

429
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,893
Understand?

430
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,867
Frankie, don't make a mess.

431
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,830
You kids from the Westside.

432
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:45,673
<i>(Stevie) I'm not a connoisseur,
but I know my wine.

433
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,303
I know my way around if I'm at a table.
Not just by the names.

434
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,640
- How you doin', Stevie?
- Hi, Pat.

435
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:57,976
- We gotta talk.
- Not tonight, Pat, all right?

436
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:01,271
I'm right in the middle of
telling her my life story.

437
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,650
Yeah, well, it won't take long. I promise.

438
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,444
I gotta step outside. I'll be right back.

439
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,531
Cindy, right? Sandy. I'm sorry.

440
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:24,920
What's goin' on, Pat?

441
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:28,507
The eight grand you owe Jimmy Cavello.
Should have quit at two.

442
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:32,011
Cavello? What have you
got to do with Cavello?

443
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:34,304
How you doin', Stevie?

444
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,307
You won't cut me over eight grand
don't even belong to you.

445
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,768
It ain't my habit to cut people up.

446
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,148
I've been working on the eight grand.

447
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:48,527
I've been chipping away at it. Let me
make a phone call. I'll check on it.

448
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:52,406
You should've made it yesterday,
Stevie. Rent's overdue.

449
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:57,161
Frankie, it's me, all right?

450
00:42:57,328 --> 00:42:59,538
We grew up together. We're friends.

451
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:02,708
Don't give me that bullshit.
My friends don't owe money.

452

Stevie borrowed money, that's all.

because somebody forgot to pay money?

484

Every time we turn around
somebody's dead, huh? Bullshit!

Fuck you!

You'll hunt him down. You three
will conduct an investigation

- Where?

Remember Mickey Cassidy? His sister
didn't wear panties to dance class?

503
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:07,619
He's dead too. He was
dumb enough to become a cop.

504
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:10,581
I gotta go to the funeral.
It's over in Queens.

505
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:14,001
- I can't stand driving in Queens.
- You want me to drive?

No. Then I'd have to look out the window.

As a favour, to impress Borelli.
Stevie ain't wrapped in a ribbon,

self- importance is soothed

that this goofball ain't

Just surgically remove the fuckers.

Get on with putting these

You think I went to Boston to be a cop
cos I hated Boston crooks so much?

552
00:51:55,616 --> 00:52:00,704
No, to get away. To get as far away as
I could so that this could never happen.

You gotta get something on Flannery.

571
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:14,862
You gotta see something

- People saw him take Stevie to the car.

580
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,490
Cavello was there. They all drove away.

581

- I know that.

582
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:05,829
They don't respect us.
Cavello's head has gotta roll.

583
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:10,584
Yes, but first we're gonna show some
maturity. Can you show me maturity?

584
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:15,130

- I'm talking about I am your boss.

585

Borelli says nobody gets hit.
We don't have his permission.

586
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:28,268
The neighbourhood's disappearing
in a tide of yuppies and dog shit.

587

Borelli's our ticket

01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:41,111
- Ten minutes.
- Fine. Thank you.

753
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,842
- Hi, Kathleen.
- Frankie, what are you doing?

754
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,428
I gotta talk to you.
Can you find me a minute?

755
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:08,764
Yeah. Give me five minutes.

756
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:12,226
Tell you what. Meet you in the bar
over there. Straight ahead.

757
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:15,646
- Where's the bar?
- Right through there and to your right.

758
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:17,898
- Don't keep me waiting.
- I won't.

759
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,999
Sit down.

760
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:42,506
I ordered you a white wine.

761
01:13:46,427 --> 01:13:48,053
What is it you want, Frankie?

762
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,973
I don't gotta want something
all the time, do I?

763
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:53,183
I never knew you when you didn't.

764
01:13:54,768 --> 01:13:56,603
Who took care of you
when you was a kid?

765
01:13:56,812 --> 01:14:01,900
When guys hit on you, who took care
of you? Who went looking for them?

766
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:06,238
That's why I moved up here-so nice men
could hit on me and not fear for their life.

767
01:14:06,405 --> 01:14:08,991
They fly to Europe.
That don't make 'em nice.

768
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:14,872
I don't know what happened between us.

769
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:19,335
It's kind of like you never
even wanted to know me.

770
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:23,839
If you feel rejected, Frankie,
it's because I do. I reject you.

771
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:27,051
You're so cold.

772
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,221
What happened to you?

773
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:37,061
What happened to that sweet little girl,
her heart was shining through her skin?

774
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:42,107
People say that when they can't make you
do what they want - "You're so cold. "

775
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:45,444
The way you treat me,
I ought to box your ears.

776
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:47,655
- I have to go back to work.
- Sit down.

777
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:52,242
Sit down for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

778
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:54,745
I want to talk to you
about Terry Noonan.

779
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:59,583
He's coming to work for me in my
organisation. I think he'll do very well.

780
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:05,089
But, in the Bronx two weeks ago, you'd
be so surprised to know what he did.

781
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:08,384
He got tangled up in this drug deal
with these lowlifes.

782
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:12,096
He killed both of 'em.
He shot 'em point-blank.

783
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:16,266
So he ain't what
you're looking for, is he, Kate?

784
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:26,276
You came all the way
across town to tell me that?

785
01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:29,613
I thought that you should know it,
that's all.

786

787

- It's Kathleen.

788
01:16:08,736 --> 01:16:10,321
I have to talk to you.

789
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:13,198
You should've called.
These halls are dangerous.

790
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:18,162
It was hopeless. I had to see you.
My mind set its own agenda. So here I am.

791
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:22,916
- What time is it?
- It was three when I left the house.

792
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:26,587
- You want a drink?
- I've had two Valium already.

793
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:31,425
My mind's just... spinning
with everything, you know?

794
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:33,093
Sit down.

795
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:38,599
I mean... Frankie told me
you're working for him.

796
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:40,934
- Why'd he do that?
- What do you mean, why?!

797
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:43,771
Because I got away!

798
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:47,733
You tell me you're a cop and he tells me
you killed two drug dealers in the Bronx.

799
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:50,736
No, that was a setup. They were cops.

800
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:53,489
- You killed two cops?
- It wasn't real. I had blanks.

801
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:55,824
They went down, gave me credentials...

802
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:59,036
- I don't know about this.
- You're asking me.

803
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:01,413
- I thought you were different.
- I am. I'm a cop!

804
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,291
They're my brothers
and you're gonna put 'em in jail!

805
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:08,253
- You're jumping all over the place.
- I'm not jumping all over the place.

806
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:13,509
My brother comes to me and he...
he's telling me he trusts you,

807
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:16,762
and I have this knowledge that you're a...

808
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:19,807
- When I told Linda everything...
- Who's Linda?

809
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:23,060
My shrink. I had a double session today.

810
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:26,897
You told your shrink?
You told your shrink about me?

811
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:29,024
- Of course I told her!
- Wait a minute.

812
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:32,194
There's some shrink out there
who knows I'm a cop?

813
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,822
- That's right. I have a shrink.
- Fuck me!

814
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:39,827
I tell her what happens in my life. I have
a right to try and straighten out my life!

815
01:17:39,994 --> 01:17:42,830
- You could get me killed!
- Oh, shit.

816
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:46,542
I thought I was out of this.

817
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:49,461
I thought I'd gotten away.
It's like some trick.

818
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:52,631
I don't know how I ended up here
but you gotta help me.

819
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,425
I can't leave town. I have a job.

820
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:59,138
And I can't move any further uptown...
or I'll be in fucking Harlem!

821
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:02,599
That's what I came here to tell you.
Just stay away from me.

822
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,644
- That's not why you're here.
- Yeah, it is.

823
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,604
- No.
- Yes, it is.

824
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:12,234
People don't come to a place like this
in the night to tell someone to stay away.

825
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:14,862
- Terry, don't.
- Kathleen, it's OK.

826
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:17,448
- Don't.
- It's OK.

827
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:20,826
It's OK.

828

No. Get off of me. Get off of me!

829

I don't want anything to do with you!
Stay away from me!

You're just like my fuckin' brothers!
You are!

and you just... you just pull!

- I love you.

01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:16,241
<i>All right. See ya.

901
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:42,768
<i>(phone rings)

902
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:47,398
<i>(Kate on machine) Hi. Please
leave a message after the beep.

903
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:49,733
<i>(Terry) Hey, it's me. You there?

904
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:52,361
<i>Hello? Hello?

905
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:00,077
<i>Will you pick up if you're there?

906
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:05,582
<i>Look, we're in the middle of this thing.
You gotta understand.

907
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:09,503
<i>And I'm sorry. If I hurt you,
I'm sorry, all right?

908
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,673
<i>I'll get back. Good night.

909
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:15,175
<i>(hangs up)

910
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:35,696
Hey, Terry.

911
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,539
Where are we going? Beirut?

912
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:49,710
Borelli's phoned Frankie.
We gotta come to this meeting.

913
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:53,714
Cavello got wasted in the Kitchen
in the wee hours of the morning.

914
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:56,425
- Cavello?
- Yeah.

915
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:58,844
Is nobody safe?

916
01:27:10,147 --> 01:27:12,691
- You got the address?
- Yeah, right here.

917
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:15,110
Get on down there now, OK? Get situated.

918
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:18,489
It's just up from the restaurant.
Everything arranged.

919
01:27:18,656 --> 01:27:22,660
I arrive at noon. I don't call you
by two o'clock or Pat don't call you,

920
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:26,997
you come in, tear 'em apart,
the spaghetti still on their spoons.

921
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:31,835
You OK, Noonan?
Everything OK with you?

922
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,256
- It'll be all right, Frankie.
- Yeah, either we're dead or we ain't.

923
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:45,808
Anybody know how to get to Mott Street?

924
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,477
Damn.

925
01:28:33,063 --> 01:28:34,732
Terry.

926
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:19,985
... fold like a futon,
and the fuckin' frame's bent, right?

927
01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:24,448
So I bring it home. It looks easy.
I can't put the fuckin' thing together.

928
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:28,702
So we called in a neighbour,
a guy with a very nice fuckin'...

929
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,413
Let's get down to business.

930
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:36,460
<i>First of all, this problem we got here.
This is your responsibility.

931
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:40,547
Either you get the respect
of your own people, or you got nothin'.

932
01:29:41,173 --> 01:29:45,761
My people, I let them go
at this thing on their own,

933
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:49,556
your brother, he'd be in so many
fuckin' pieces right now,

934
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:53,727
you couldn't put him back together
again even if you had directions.

935
01:29:54,353 --> 01:29:56,355
But I said no.

936
01:29:56,522 --> 01:30:00,484
I said Frankie Flannery is a man who
knows when things have to be set right,

937
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:05,447
and that you'd never let your feelings
get in the way of a big business decision.

938
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:09,410
Now, what I told my people,
Frankie... was wrong?

939
01:30:23,424 --> 01:30:26,385
Of course, this is
a matter of some complexity.

940
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:31,974
But if you won't solve this problem,
I'm gonna have it solved for you.

941
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:36,603
You understand that? Huh?

942
01:30:40,607 --> 01:30:43,360
You don't have to
worry about Frankie, man.

943
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:47,072
And if he ain't OK, there'll be
a dumpster full of dead guineas,

944
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:49,283
spaghetti still on their forks.

945
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:07,885
Look...

946
01:31:08,052 --> 01:31:10,095
I could straighten the kid out.

947
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:15,059
Jimmy Cavello was a great guy.
We all know this.

948
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,562
But the kid...

949
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:23,067
The kid...

950
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:27,237
You should've been there
when I reamed him out over this.

951
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:30,532
He'd have crawled in a hole
and brought the hole in with him,

952
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:32,368
if he could find a hole to go into.

953
01:31:32,493 --> 01:31:37,665
Don't embarrass yourself, Frankie.
I know you don't want to insult me.

954
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:38,957
No.

955
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:43,128
But to be frivolous on a matter
of such importance is an insult.

956
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:46,256
This fuckin' bum is your brother.

957
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:50,844
So I understand your need to pursue
some hopeless course to try to save him.

958
01:31:51,387 --> 01:31:55,557
But everybody knows
what's gotta happen here.

959
01:31:55,683 --> 01:32:01,021
With every heartbeat, his miserable
fuckin' douche-bag life insults me.

960
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:07,194
He's a thorn in my side, Frankie.

961
01:32:07,945 --> 01:32:11,532
<i>Since we're together,
he's a thorn in your side.

962
01:32:13,659 --> 01:32:15,869
Now look, Frankie.

963
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:19,707
I gotta know, and I gotta know now.

964
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:26,630
Are you gonna be able to
pull this thorn out of our side?

965
01:32:35,556 --> 01:32:37,516
All right.

966
01:32:37,683 --> 01:32:39,727
This is your brother, Frank.

967
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:47,526
<i>So, for the sake of family and blood,
I'm gonna give you this opportunity.

968
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:59,913
<i>(clock chimes)

969
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:30,611
Looks like it's time
to kick some guinea ass.

970
01:33:31,487 --> 01:33:33,781
But he didn't call yet, Jackie.

971
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:37,660
He said we don't go
until he called or Pat called.

972
01:33:37,785 --> 01:33:41,789
- That ain't what he said.
- Course it was. I was right there.

973
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:45,167
- Richie, what'd he say?
- Who?

974
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:47,044
- Frankie!
- About what?

975
01:33:47,211 --> 01:33:50,714
What are you askin' him for?
He's fuckin' stupid.

976
01:33:56,136 --> 01:33:58,847
Now, let's have some dessert.

977
01:34:02,059 --> 01:34:05,688
- I gotta make a call.
- Let the business wait.

978
01:34:05,813 --> 01:34:08,232
- Enjoy your dessert.
- It's my wife.

979
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:10,442
Don't offend me, Frankie.

980
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:14,071
You're gonna get up from my table
to call your wife?

981
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,324
Let her wait.

982
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:22,663
Don't fuck him up again.

983
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:25,207
- That ain't what he said.
- It is what he said.

984
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:28,669
<i>- He said if he didn't call.
- No, if he did call.

985
01:34:28,836 --> 01:34:32,006
If we said... He said if we didn't call.

986
01:34:32,172 --> 01:34:33,590
- If he did.
- If he didn't.

987
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:35,509
Did. Jack...

988
01:34:35,676 --> 01:34:38,304
I was in the truck.
He said if he didn't call.

989
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,472
- No.
- If we didn't fuckin' call.

990
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,934
- Where was I?!
- You were there too! You're fuckin' deaf!

991
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:46,645
- He said if he didn't call.
- He said if he did call.

992
01:34:46,812 --> 01:34:48,689
- Relax.
- Richie.

993
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:52,568
- I didn't hear him.
- He's fuckin' retarded!

994
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:55,112
Nothing personal, Richard. You're stupid.

995
01:34:55,237 --> 01:34:57,364
That's not what he said.

996
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:02,369
Jack, he said if he did call.

997
01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:04,705
If he called, we go. Otherwise no.

998
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,835
Have a piece of cheesecake.

999
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:22,806
Fuck me, man. This don't feel right.

1000
01:35:23,724 --> 01:35:26,727
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1001
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,902
Jack, calm down.

1002
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:42,368
<i>- (Jack) Whoo!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Listen.

1003
01:35:42,534 --> 01:35:45,162
He said if he did call...
Relax. Will you relax?

1004
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:49,291
- Terry, I love you, but you're wrong.
- I love you too, and I'm right.

1005
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:51,585
- He could be dying. Let's go.
- Jack...

1006
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:53,754
Let's go, huh?!

1007
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:58,008
You want me to make that call
for you, Mr Flannery?

1008
01:35:58,133 --> 01:36:00,427
Tell your boy to stop
movin' around so much.

1009
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:05,099
He's interfering with my digestion.

1010
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:13,440
Have a cannoli. Some anisette.

1011
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:19,196
Just fucking go!

1012

Big mistake. Big mistake.

1016

Mr Borelli, I really do
gotta make a phone call.

1017

I must make it.
My wife's not been feeling well.

1018

With your permission.

1019
01:37:07,911 --> 01:37:10,247

Either they forgot about us or
this entire neighbourhood better duck.

All right. I want you to
drop me off at 39th Street.

Frankie, I hope you're not
lookin' to start a war here.

Hey. Dumb fucks.
Don't know how close they came.

It's your brother.

is that Borelli's got this beef with Cavello.

Cavello failed to get permission
from Borelli to take out Stevie,

which pissed Borelli off
cos of this thing with us.

other secretive guinea bullshit too.

01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:47,715
I gotta catch a shower, and some fresh
clothes. I've been in this shit for days.

1053
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:51,760
The pick-up's at 11.
I'll let you know where.

1054
01:40:51,927 --> 01:40:56,056
I want to keep this hush-hush, OK?
Just you and me. It's a lot of money.

1055
01:40:56,223 --> 01:41:01,228
St Patty's is coming up, so we'll have
a little loose change to celebrate with.

1056
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:05,399
Hey, Jack.

1057
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:10,362
Come here.

1058
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,253
- You ain't done that for years.
- Yeah.

1059
01:41:51,654 --> 01:41:53,781
- Hey.
- Hey.

1060
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,827
I missed you at the club. What's goin' on?

1061
01:42:00,496 --> 01:42:03,582
Gotta work until 11 or so.

1062
01:42:03,749 --> 01:42:06,126
We can hoot and holler after that.

1063
01:42:06,293 --> 01:42:09,838
Like, I can meet you at the club about 12.

1064
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:14,718
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

1065
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:23,686
- You OK?
- I'm feeling fucked up.

1066
01:42:23,811 --> 01:42:26,563
I gotta make a pick-up.

1067
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:32,861
25 grand. Borelli's got some
bullshit Haitian problems.

1068
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:37,491
Pick-up's at Battery Park.

1069
01:42:43,288 --> 01:42:45,749
I'm fuckin' beat, man.

1070
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:48,711
I'm gonna ask Frankie
for a little time off.

1071
01:42:48,836 --> 01:42:50,879
I've been working hard.

1072
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:57,386
So, the parade's coming up.

1073
01:42:58,012 --> 01:42:59,930
Wouldn't that be nice?

1074
01:43:00,097 --> 01:43:05,561
You, me and Kate can go celebrate
St Patty's Day together.

1075
01:43:07,521 --> 01:43:10,190
Go see the parade. Wanna?

1076
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:13,694
Listen, Jackie. I heard something.

1077
01:43:18,324 --> 01:43:22,619
- I hear Frankie put the hit on Stevie.
- What?

1078
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:25,122
Hey, hey, hey! Get out!

1079
01:43:25,289 --> 01:43:28,959
That is my fuckin' brother
you're talking about, huh?!

1080
01:43:29,126 --> 01:43:31,128
- I heard it.
- Yeah, you heard it!

1081
01:43:31,295 --> 01:43:36,592
Don't mean you gotta repeat it!
You repeat everything you hear?!

1082
01:43:36,717 --> 01:43:39,219
I'm sorry. I heard it.

1083
01:43:47,144 --> 01:43:51,398
- I oughta shoot your fuckin' eyes out.
- I thought you should know.

1084
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:11,210
Get out. Get outta here!

1085
01:44:11,585 --> 01:44:13,629
Come on!

1086
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:17,424
I should wash your mouth out with soap.

1087
01:44:17,591 --> 01:44:21,470
You go somewhere and you think
about what you're saying. Yeah?

1088
01:44:38,404 --> 01:44:41,448
- Battery Park at 11.
- If you're not there, I think he's dead.

1089
01:44:41,615 --> 01:44:44,451
<i>If we see 'em whack each other,
we can get 'em for that.

1090
01:44:44,618 --> 01:44:47,496
You hole up in the hotel
so I can find you if I need you.

1091
01:44:47,663 --> 01:44:50,249
Just be there. I think Jack's goin' down.

1092
01:45:03,429 --> 01:45:05,889
Jackie. How you doin', man?

1093
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,936
- You said you were workin' tonight.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1094
01:45:11,103 --> 01:45:15,482
- Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- Forget it.

1095
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:20,738
You heard something like that on the
street, but you know it's fuckin' bullshit.

1096
01:45:20,863 --> 01:45:24,658
Whoever told you, we'll talk
with him after the pick-up.

1097
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:28,912
I want you to back me up, OK?

1098
01:45:29,038 --> 01:45:31,081
Hey, I'm there.

1099
01:45:44,762 --> 01:45:47,222
Why are we here? I thought Battery Park.

1100
01:45:47,348 --> 01:45:50,017
The meeting's been changed to Pier 84.

1101
01:45:50,184 --> 01:45:54,897
Frankie figured it'd be safer.
Guineas won't try jack shit here.

1102
01:46:30,975 --> 01:46:34,228
Listen, you ain't supposed to be here.

1103
01:46:36,355 --> 01:46:39,024
OK, go and wait for me over there.

1104
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,361
- Behind there?
- Yeah. I won't be long.

1105
01:46:42,528 --> 01:46:45,072
- Watch my fuckin' back.
- Yeah.

1106
01:46:49,952 --> 01:46:51,578
Hey.

1107
01:46:54,915 --> 01:46:57,918
I love the noises
Irene makes in bed, man.

1108
01:47:00,254 --> 01:47:02,256
Me, too.

1109
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:41,003
This is Officer Noonan.
I'm lookin' for Sgt Richardson.

1110
01:47:41,128 --> 01:47:44,548
He's on a stakeout.
That's what I'm calling about.

1111
01:48:10,491 --> 01:48:13,243
Look, I got a change
of 20 for him, all right?

1112
01:48:13,369 --> 01:48:16,121
Tell him it's not Battery Park,
it's Pier 84.

1113
01:48:16,664 --> 01:48:18,791
Hey, Frankie.

1114
01:48:20,668 --> 01:48:22,503
Hi, Jackie.

1115
01:48:23,379 --> 01:48:27,007
- I thought you were the guineas.
- The guineas ain't coming.

1116
01:48:27,174 --> 01:48:30,427
- It's just you and me.
- It's just you and me?

1117
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:32,638
Yeah.

1118
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:49,196
Just tell him to get down here!

1119
01:48:55,077 --> 01:48:56,912
Jack!

1120
01:49:43,959 --> 01:49:46,003
<i>(distant sirens)

1121
01:49:54,595 --> 01:49:57,181
What the hell is going on?
You tell us one place

1122
01:49:57,306 --> 01:50:00,351
but the shooters are all
at some other goddamn place!

1123
01:50:00,517 --> 01:50:05,105
You know what they'd do
if they knew I was doin' what I been?

1124
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:10,277
I'd be strung up on some billboard,
my eyes cut out of my head.

1125
01:50:10,444 --> 01:50:12,613
And I'd fuckin' deserve it.

1126
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:15,282
I ain't your goddamn social worker.

1127
01:50:15,449 --> 01:50:19,203
Now you just tell me
who whacked out Jack Flannery.

1128
01:50:20,329 --> 01:50:23,207
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1129
01:50:23,374 --> 01:50:25,459
- You were here.
- I wasn't fuckin' here.

1130
01:50:25,626 --> 01:50:28,462
I was over at that phone booth calling you.

1131
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:32,424
I should have backed up Jack,
but I was over there doin' my rat job.

1132
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:35,052
Was Flannery here, or his boy?
Who did you see?

1133
01:50:35,177 --> 01:50:38,055
I don't want to do this
any more, all right?!

1134
01:50:38,222 --> 01:50:42,893
I ain't cut out for this undercover shit!
Get yourself an Italian, cos I quit.

1135
01:50:43,018 --> 01:50:46,397
We're on these suckers!
It's just a matter of timing!

1136
01:50:46,563 --> 01:50:47,523
- Timing?
- Yeah!

1137
01:50:47,648 --> 01:50:52,528
These guys don't know what century it is.
And you talk about fucking timing?

1138
01:50:53,445 --> 01:50:55,489
You know what I did?

1139
01:50:56,156 --> 01:51:00,202
I got my best friend killed.
I got Jack killed. That's what I did.

1140
01:51:00,327 --> 01:51:02,121
But it's fucking over.

1141
01:51:02,287 --> 01:51:06,667
Look at me. See? I quit. Good night.

1142
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:08,836
- Terry.
- Fuck you.

1143
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:18,554
Hey, Noonan!

1144
01:51:25,019 --> 01:51:27,021
Fucked up, man.

1145
01:51:42,369 --> 01:51:44,079
Kathleen.

1146
01:51:45,122 --> 01:51:46,707
Hi.

1147
01:51:52,046 --> 01:51:55,007
Nobody even knows
what he was doing out there.

1148
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:26,080
I'm sorry.

1149
01:52:31,835 --> 01:52:34,880
I couldn't have saved Jackie, could I?

1150
01:52:40,636 --> 01:52:43,931
Even though I know it's not true,
I feel I could have.

1151
01:52:49,103 --> 01:52:52,189
But I should have told him what you were.

1152
01:53:25,806 --> 01:53:27,808
Here, Jack.

1153
01:53:30,394 --> 01:53:32,396
You're bound to get thirsty.

1154
01:53:49,997 --> 01:53:51,749
Hey, Terry.

1155
01:53:56,795 --> 01:53:58,839
How's Kathleen?

1156
01:54:00,424 --> 01:54:04,178
She's holding up pretty good.
She's strong. But it's hard.

1157
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:08,599
It's you I'm worried about.

1158
01:54:09,683 --> 01:54:11,185
What do you mean?

1159
01:54:13,771 --> 01:54:16,398
Do you know where I was
the night this happened?

1160
01:54:20,402 --> 01:54:22,363
I was on Pier 84.

1161
01:54:36,377 --> 01:54:41,131
Noonan, if you and me
are on a collision course,

1162
01:54:41,256 --> 01:54:43,634
that would not be very smart of you.

1163
01:54:47,596 --> 01:54:49,974
You know how smart you are?

1164
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:57,523
That's how smart you are.

1165
01:55:14,415 --> 01:55:16,542
He's dead.

1166
01:55:16,709 --> 01:55:19,336
The fuck's dead. Do you see that?

1167
01:55:19,503 --> 01:55:21,297
Motherfucker.

1168
01:55:27,761 --> 01:55:29,805
<i>(knocking)

1169
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:37,604
Who is it?

1170
01:55:38,564 --> 01:55:40,607
<i>(Terry) Kate?

1171
01:55:43,027 --> 01:55:46,030
Kate, I feel awful
about the things I was.

1172
01:55:49,033 --> 01:55:52,578
Kate, you just gotta give me
a minute on this, all right?

1173
01:55:57,249 --> 01:56:02,171
If you don't want me here, just tell me.
But let me see your face so I believe it.

1174
01:56:02,338 --> 01:56:06,467
Terry, I'm telling you the truth.
I'm telling you the God's truth.

1175
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,804
Bastard! You're dragging me in,
making me part of it!

1176
01:56:10,971 --> 01:56:13,349
You want me to drown?
I gotta save my life!

1177
01:56:13,515 --> 01:56:16,352
I know, but I need to explain.
I need you to understand.

1178
01:56:16,477 --> 01:56:19,563
- I understand.
- You're not listening.

1179
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:22,358
Would you just fuckin' listen?

1180
01:56:25,694 --> 01:56:27,738
<i>(sighs)

1181
01:56:32,701 --> 01:56:37,623
I thought some things.
I could come back.

1182
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:41,418
I always hated that I'd run away.

1183
01:56:42,378 --> 01:56:47,549
Had nothing to do with you, except I knew
if I tried to tell you, I'd never get away.

1184
01:56:54,014 --> 01:56:56,892
So I was in Boston. I just ended up there.

1185
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:06,652
It seemed far enough away.

1186
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:14,952
It come to me then. It just happened.
These things happen.

1187
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,621
Other things happen. It's your life.

1188
01:57:24,253 --> 01:57:28,382
They were looking for somebody to go
undercover who knew the Kitchen,

1189
01:57:28,549 --> 01:57:30,551
who was known.

1190
01:57:32,469 --> 01:57:36,432
I could've said no,
but I thought I could do it.

1191
01:57:37,182 --> 01:57:41,437
It was like this opportunity.
I could look the entire thing in the eye.

1192
01:57:41,562 --> 01:57:47,818
You'd be married, forgotten about me.
And Jack, I would leave him out of it.

1193
01:57:49,236 --> 01:57:51,238
But it was only an idea.

1194
01:57:54,616 --> 01:57:57,411
Nothing to do with the truth. It was just...

1195
01:57:59,163 --> 01:58:01,206
a fuckin' idea, like...

1196
01:58:04,835 --> 01:58:10,424
you believe... in angels or the saints

1197
01:58:10,591 --> 01:58:13,719
or that there's such a thing
as a state of grace,

1198
01:58:14,928 --> 01:58:17,431
and you believe it.

1199
01:58:19,808 --> 01:58:22,811
But it's got nothing to do with reality.

1200
01:58:24,605 --> 01:58:30,110
It's just an idea. You got
your ideas and you got reality.

1201
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:34,114
They're all...

1202
01:58:40,454 --> 01:58:42,915
They're all fucked up.

1204
01:59:02,476 --> 01:59:04,520
I was going out.

1205
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:07,815
I gotta go. I gotta get ready.

1206
01:59:11,026 --> 01:59:15,781
He's someone I met at work.
He's taking me out for a drink.

1207
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:22,037
- Frank killed Jack.
- Did he?

1209
01:59:28,794 --> 01:59:32,006
I gotta go down now. He's waiting.

1210
01:59:35,843 --> 01:59:38,971
- You're cold, Kate.
- Yes, I am.

1211
01:59:40,347 --> 01:59:43,434
I don't mind you got a date.
I really don't.

1212
01:59:43,559 --> 01:59:47,813
I ain't jealous. I got a date, too.

1213
01:59:50,024 --> 01:59:54,528
Is there something you want me
to tell Frankie for you when I see him?

1214
01:59:55,988 --> 01:59:58,615
Make sure, when you leave,
the button's pushed in

1215
01:59:58,741 --> 02:00:01,368
and the door's pulled tight before you go.

1216
02:00:17,885 --> 02:00:20,304
- What did you find out, Pat?
- Nobody knows him.

1217
02:00:20,429 --> 02:00:24,224
- They must've brought him from Boston.
- From Boston, to rat us out.

1218
02:00:24,391 --> 02:00:27,728
Don't matter where
the cocksucker's from. He's dead.

1219
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:33,734
It's 15,000 when he takes his last breath.
You bring me his rat head, it's 30,000.

1220
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:45,537
- Where the fuck is he?
- Check it out.

1221
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:51,335
What the fuck are you doin'?
