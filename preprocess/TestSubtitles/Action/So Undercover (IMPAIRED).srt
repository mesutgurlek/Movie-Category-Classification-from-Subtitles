and we want you
to keep an eye on her.

00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,748
and you're well versed
in Jiu Jitsu.

Why are you sorry?

135
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,158
Aikido is a fashionable way
for fat housewives

00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,890
to lose weight
at their local Equinox.

Are you calling me a fat housewife?
Yeah.

You don't think that Jiu

No. It's the most

148
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,625
It's an Eastern European
enforcement practice.

Get close to them.

153
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,101
So the threat of a hit
alone prevents testimony.

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,717
Fifteen thousand.

163
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,812
I've got a kid.

164
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,517
No, you don't.

165
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,287
Your dad got kicked
off the police force

166
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,293
who loves to gamble.

167
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,023
Same (hing.

168
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,030
I'm offering you a chance
to do something real.

169
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,158
A chance to work
for the FBI.

170
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,397
A chance to possibly make a real
difference in someone's life.

171
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,302
Think about it, Molly,

172
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,671
because we both know
that chasing cheating truckers

173
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,472
is not the top rung
of investigative fulfillment-.

174
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,345
My card.

175
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,179
In case you change your mind.

176
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,479
Not going (u.

177
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,804
Where were you'?

178
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,306
Oh, I had dinner
with the guys.

179
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,775
That coffee cup you're holding
is from Rolly Roasters,

180
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,574
and there's only two
franchises in the Dallas area.

181
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,447
Al the airport
and Lone Star Park.

182
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,712
You always read the newspaper
at dinner with the guys,

183
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,119
yet that newspaper you're holding
hasn't been opened yet-.

184
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,088
And that red stamp on your
hand gives you access

185
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,319
to the box seat section.

186
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,157
So tell me, Dad,

187
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,995
how was the track?

188
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,164
You're too quick
for me. Moll.

189
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,068
How much?

190
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:33,441
I was so close to getting
that money for that lawyer.

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,606
I was so close to getting
hack on the force and then...

192
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,741
Really! I was just
one hot streak away.

193
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,574
Dad.

194
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,746
And then I lost.

195
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,084
Then I chased.

196
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,351
How much?

197
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,983
Seventeen thousand.

198
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,879
Armon.

199
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,682
What is this place'?
You'll see.

200
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,151
We've gained you entry
to Alex's sorority.

201
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,623
You're a transfer
from University of Hawaii.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,786
Obscure school.
Far away. Smart.

203
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,127
But I need more money-
What?

204
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,793
Listen, I'm gonna take the gig.
I'm gonna go ta (he college.

205
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,199
I'll even throw in
some lipstick.

206
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,362
But I need five grand more.

207
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,133
Fine, but you're gonna do a lot
more than just put on lipstick.

208
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,649
Okay, you're like,
40 minutes late!

209
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,154
Who's this?

210
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,157
I'm Bizzy.

211
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,556
You're busy?

212
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,149
No, Molly,
her name is Bizzy.

213
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,854
She works out
of the New York office.

214
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,262
So what's this look
we're rocking? Hobo chic?

215
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,095
I don't get it.

216
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,329
Okay, you have to like try on
all these clothes.

217
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,996
Fine.

218
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,541
No, Molly, you say
'totally' or you say

219
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,771
its shorter cousin 'totes'
when you want to say “fine.”

220
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,278
Okay then, let's go.

Double bubble bubblegum gum,

00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,039
They blindfolded me
when they drove me here.

Oh, I'm sorry.
That was totes inappropes.

233
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,088
No, I liked it.

234
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,555
It's kind of like
my last Craigslist experience.

235
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,886
Amaze balls.

236

00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,391
This is the Kappa
Kappa Zeta pecking order-.

You're gonna need to know this
lo fit into the house.

239
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,226
At the top,
we've got Sasha Stolezinsky.

240
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,395
She is ruthless
and power hungry

241
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,961
and runs the house
with an iron fist-ish.

242

She-'s like Khadafi
with highlights'

243
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,069
In-styler rolling hot iron.
Trust me. You'll need it.

244
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,479
If binging and purging were a
crime, she'd be on death row.

Not really.

Cotton, Taylor, Hunter.

251
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,858
They were conceived
while their parents

252
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,193
were having sex
in an L.L. Bean outlet store.

Yeah, I won't
be needing those.

Oh! It': like a sad animal
attempted suicide on her head'

You both know
I'm sitting right here.

If anyone can do it, you can.
You're the hair whisperer.

260
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,882
This is your phone.

261
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,822
What did you do?
Rob a nine-year-old'?

262
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,724
No, you're actually going
to use this phone.

263
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,524
It's got
a built-in Kappa app

264
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,655
with information on all
of your sorority sisters.

265
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,064
Kappa app?
That's right.

266
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,691
And this one
you will not use.

267
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,999
But keep it on you
and on at all times.

268
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,664
Why?

269
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,402
Because that's how
I'm going to find you.

270
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,170
You'll receive a text.

271
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,007
What if I need to call you?
You'll get a text.

272
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,910
So if I need to call you,
I'm going to get a text'?

273
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,208
Correct.
Makes no sense.

274
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,749
Kappa phone,
bat phone.

275
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,319
Don't call it a hat phone.
Why not?

276
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,322
It belittles the importance
of the phone.

277
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,517
Okay. I'm sorry, but I'm
calling it a bat phone.

278
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,653
No. The bat phone was red,
and it was a land line,

279
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,424
and Bruce Wayne
used it for calls,

280
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,659
and you're only using that
to receive texts!

281
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,169
I don't see the point, okay?
Okay.

282
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,938

It's your new identity.

Are you serious?

292
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,123
That's not a name.
That's a gated community.

293
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,251
I really don't care.

Cameron, I don't know
what that word means.

320
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,865
What kind of idiot doesn’t know
what the word “idiot” means?

No, the other one.

You have a problem?

327
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,101
I think you could be
a bit more patient.

Oh, really.

329

a first date.

You know, you seem mare mature
than the other girls.

373

That's because I'm older.

00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:16,084
I was modeling in Croatia for
three years before I came here.

Croatia?
Yeah...

What she's doing with the other
arm, she's just so strong.

393
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,636
I was really nervous
about transferring here, but..-...

394

I'm being totally cynical.

I'm sure you'll love
all of the pageantry.

479

But the real world comes and
gets us ail at some point.

I'm so sorry, Alex!

What did you do?
My shirt is ruined!

482
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,736
This was my special
Kappa Kappa Zeta T-shirt!

483
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,297
And you ruined it.

I am.

Sisters, welcome back
and welcome home.

492
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:34,382
It was a summer of change,
a summer of big developments,

493
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,653
and a summer
of making new friends-.

494
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,094
We have a year of great
excitement ahead of us.

we need to sell more dolls

Wow! That was
disturbingly poetic.

526
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,690
Look, I really am sorry.
It was just accident.

527
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:23,323
No, an accident is like
when you're driving

528
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,299
and you hit a raccoon,
but you don't want to stop

529
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,701
because it turned out
to be somebody': dog.

This is a tragedy.

531

All right, girls, let's go.

532
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,338
<i>The Racketeer Inﬂuenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act.</i>

533
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,206
RICO allowed law enforcement

534
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,836
to get into areas
that it'd never been before

535
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,903
when it came
to investigating the mafia.

536
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,573
It was a Nixon hustle.

537
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,314
Excuse me?

538
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,651
I'm sorry, but you're
not telling the whole story-.

539
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,348
Well, enlighten us.

540
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,221
The Justice Department
used RICO

541
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,351
to go after anybody
on Nixon's hate list.

542
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,659
Gays, liberals, reformers,
subversive students.

543
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,426
Yeah, RICO was enacted
to go after the mob,

544
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,432
but don'! tell me
that it wasn't abused.

545
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,059
I won't.
What's your name?

546
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,865
Brook.

547
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,533
How would someone
like you know (his, Brook?

548
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,246
I don't know.

549
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,373
I guess I'm just like, so into
crime, I want to throw up!

550
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,941
[everyone laughs]

551
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,182
Interesting take
on RICO.

552
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,419
I don't really know
what I'm talking about.

553
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,387
Hey Summer!

554
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,858
That was kind of rude.

555
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,959
She was my freshman
roommate last year.

556
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,695
I haven'! seen
her since (hen.

557
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,898
She's probably just
trying to keep it low.

558
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,372
Keep what low'?

559
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,034
Her affair
with the good doctor.

560
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,634
<i>[Nicholas]
What are you talking about?</i>

561
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,804
She was probably
in one of his lectures,

562
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,542
and now they're on their way to
have scandalous motel room sex.

563
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,949
Come on. How do you
know that. Brook?

564
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,420
The parking pass on the back of his
car is preferential for doctors.

565
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,617
He's not wearing a wedding
ring but I see the tan line.

566
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,215
She obviously
knows he's married,

567
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,784
so that's not why
he doesn't wear it.

568
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,726
It's a guilt thing
cheating men do.

569
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,562
Wow. All I saw was Summer
and some guy. I'm impressed.

570
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,659
You've got a really nice
sense of deduction Brook.

571
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,405
I developed it early.
What?

572
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:49,139
I don't know. I should
probably not talk anymore.

573
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,236
Okay, amaze-balls.

574
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,648
I'm gonna go nap now.

00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,708
Not books, ledgers.
[crunches]

581
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,474
Big, fat accounting ledgers-.

582
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,675
You know they have
computers for that, right?

583
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,274
Our sadist teacher makes
us do it all by hand.

584

That way we really learn.

Hey, Taylor.

Hows it going?

592
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,582
I'm retaining water
and I'm not sure why-.

Why are you in our room'?

594
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:43,354
I'm just borrowing
Alex's thong.

595

You know how we like to all
borrow each other's stuff.

596
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,927
I guess so.

Brandy.
Huh?

598
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,235
If you drink brandy, you won'!
retain all that water.

There's nothing to say.

Look, I know I haven't
been there that long,

611
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,430
but I know dangerous people
and there aren't any there.

Yep, Kashalov
had her killed.

615
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,947
I don'! get it. Why wouldn't
they just kill Alex?

616
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,379
Why would they go
to all the trouble

of planting someone
in her life?

618

If he has Alex killed,
her father will testify.

619

The only way he can gain
momentum right now

is by planting
a killer-in-wait.

who they say they are

to make it look like
they didn't shower or change.

636
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,792
You sleep with a gun?

637
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:35,796
It's not real.

638
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,930
It's not'?
Of course not.

639
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,796
Your money or your life.

640
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,532
I'm gonna bust
a cat in your ass.

641
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,939
Give it back.

642
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,771
<i>It's a cap.
What's a cap'?</i>

643
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,142
It's bust a cap in your ass.

644
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,078
Why would anybody
put a cap in their ass?

645
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,583
Because, Cotton,
that's what the gangsters do.

646
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,550
That's weird.

647
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,748
Oh! And putting a cat in
your ass isn't weird at all?

648
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,282
You're a real
Einstein, Cotton.

649
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,491
<i>I am not.</i>

650
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,796
[rap music playing,
crowd noise]

651
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,599
I can'! believe you'd
wear that here.

652
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,034
You look like a cheap trick.

653
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,661
<i>You bought this
for my birthday!</i>

654
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,467
No, I didn't.

655
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,166
My fathers secretary did
and I signed the card.

656
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,708
And don't you think
for a second

657
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,505
that she's not going
to gel fired

658
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,876
for making you look
like a New Jersey housewife!

659
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,540
I guess he's better once
you get to know him?

660
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,143
Not really.
He just called me a housewife.

661
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,713
Cotton, you don't
need to take that.

662
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,217
Wait, did he
just propose to me?

663
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,193
I don't think--

664
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,025
Wow.

665
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,193
Do you think I'm pretty'?

666
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,136
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

667
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,575
Sometimes I wanna kill you
because you are so pretty.

668
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,806
I'm serious. I think
about killing you a ma.

669
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,646
Oh, you're so sweet.

670

[whooping, shouting]

671
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,182
Hey! Can I interest
you in a dip

672
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,818
in that white trash
pool over (here?

673
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,362
I've already been.

674
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,896
I've got a disease now,
by the way.

675
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,523
Hey, it happens
to the best of us.

676

<i>If you wanna go and take
your mind off of it, or...</i>

677
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,328
Can you not do that'?
Thank you.

678
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,099
There is this amazing
old school jazz band

679
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,434
you gotta let me
lake you ta see.

680
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,166
Ifs in the French Quarter

681
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,039
and it's not a place
students usually go,

682
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,010
but I promise you'll
have a lot of fun.

683
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,377
[grunts]

684
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,279
Not really here
lo have fun.

685
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,080
Besides, I hate
the French.

686
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,217
This is so unlike me!

687
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,452
I touched the bottom!
I touched the bottom!

688
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,764
That's it for today.

689
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,391
I appreciate
(he majority of you

690
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,732
taking this unit seriously.

691
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,295
Remember, your papers
are due next week.

692
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,738
Make them great.

693
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,882
<i>So, what do we have here?</i>

694
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,976
[bat phone beeps]

695
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,716
[organ music, footsteps]

696
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,903
What do you got'?

697
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,739
Professor Nathan Talloway.

698
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,904
He's been teaching
for about a year-and-a-half

699
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,675
but the guy has nothing
on his background.

700
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,248
He is a complete ghost.

701
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,978
Is she sleeping with him?
Possibly'

702
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,748
Sasha's not telling the truth
about her past either.

703
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,585
How do you know that'?

704
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,682
She claims she modeled
in Croatia for three years,

705
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,191
which is smarter
than saying Paris

706
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,590
because it's
a memorable detail

707
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,527
(ha! helps sell the lie.

708
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,690
It's called a unique qualifier.
I use them all the time.

709
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,359
When she told me, she leaned her
head back, looked lo the right,

710
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,199
<i>and widened her eyes
and touched her lip.</i>

711
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,295
These are non-verbal tells
of deception in women.

712
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,171
What about guys?
Is she dating anyone?

713
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,504
There's Nicholas Dexter
in our criminal justice class

714
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,135
but I don't think
it's romantic.

715
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,044
What about him?

716
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,343
He's smart and he's got this
boyish charm about him.

717
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,315
But he's not as immature
as the other frat boys.

718
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,650
Jesus. [nun gasps]
God bless you.

719
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:52,949
What?

720
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,820
You're into him.
Am not!

721
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,291
And BTW's, if anything,
he's the one crushing on me.

722
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,294
BTW's?
By the way.

723
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,125
Crushing on you?
What does that mean?

724
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,825
He kind of asked me out.

725
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,333
Are you gonna
go outwith him?

726
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,233
I told him that
I hate (he French.

727
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,828
No, I'm not here to date.

728
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,738
Obviously, but you are here

729
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,572
to investigate anyone
that comes into her life.

730
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,842
I'm gonna get some intel on the professor.
You investigate Sasha.

731
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,383
And go out with Nicholas.

732
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,974
I don't think going out
with Nicholas

733
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,349
is the best way
m go about this.

734
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,218
Of course it is.
What else?

735
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,153
I'm writing this
totally kick-ass paper

736
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,988
about the pros
and cons of RICO.

737
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,086
What does that
have to do with Alex?

738
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,720
Nothing, I guess.

739
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,762
[talking, dog barking]

740
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,169
How's your head'?

741
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,367
Yeah, I know.
See you later.

742
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:56,851
Brook!

743
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,512
Hey, Brook!

744
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,848
Nicholas, hey.

745
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,357
How are you doing?

746
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,051
Did you enjoy
the party last night?

747
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:08,096
<i>Yeah. Just been so busy with school.
Yeah.</i>

748
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,564
Wish I could just
burn off same steam.

749
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:15,127
Go to some old jazz club
or something, just let loose.

750
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,763
There's that place I told you
about in (he French Quarter,

751
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,365
but it's swarming
with lazy French people.

752
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,138
Maybe they deserve
a second chance.

753
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,541
Yeah, tell that to Algeria.

754
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,603
[laughs]

755
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:31,051
I don't know what that means,
but I bet it was really funny.

756
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,713
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

757
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,984
If you don't mind,
I'd love to tag along.

758
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,215
Your balls are amazing.

759
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,091
My balls'?

760
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:44,291
I meant to say that would
be amaze-balls. Right.

761
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,163
I think I gotta go.

762
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,430
You okay, Break'?

763
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,905

Listen to that.

772
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,823
That is all about
call and response.

773
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,367
You're not
into this, are you?

774
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,960
No. I am.

775
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,972
I just wanted
to get to know you more.

776
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,474
Well, you're the bigger
mystery than me. Me?

777
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,340
Yeah! You come out of nowhere,

778
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,345
you know about motorcycles
and RICO statutes,

779

And that is harmony
and interpretation.

00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,783
Why won't you answer me'?

784

I'm just into this.

Are you hiding something?
Nu.

No, you can
ask me anything.

I'm kidding.

00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,037
You've got a strange
sense of humor, Brook.

790

Yeah. Love it or leave it.

791

00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,928
a job this
and a job that,

795
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,555
and I said [didn't
want a job,

796
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,258
that I was trying
really hard in school,

797
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:27,393
and I was
on the baseball team

798
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,062
and I didn't
have time for a job.

799
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:34,667
He just looked at me
and told me he was leaving,

800
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,268
that he met a woman,

801
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,506
that he didn't love
my mother anymore,

802
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,016
<i>and that I was going to have to
take care of her and my sister.</i>

803
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,950
And he told me it
just like (hat,

804
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,681
like he was telling me what
to pick up from the store.

805
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:54,385
And that's why I quit playing
baseball in high school.

806
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,558
I'm sorry. I didn't plan on telling
you that story. It's okay.

807
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,538
We're at your house again.

808
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,130
One more lime
around the block?

809
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,936
I've walked you home
six times tonight.

810
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,635
Let's make it seven.

811
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,381
So, what about you?
Are your parents together?

812
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,921
No, my mom died
when I was younger.

813
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,220
Did your dad remarry'?
No.

814
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,783
What's he do?

815
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,759
[clears throat]

816
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,956
I don't really want to get
into it right now, Nicholas.

817
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,292
Don't be mad at me.

818
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,893
I'm not mad, I just--

819
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,939
I've been opening up
m you all night,

820
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:42,000
and you deflect any real question
I ask you about yourself.

821
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,943
I just don't trust
people that easy.

822
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,642
I don't have the most faith
in relationships. That's all.

823
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,944
Why not'?

824
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,986
Because I've been there.

825
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:54,318
I've seen it. People lie and
they misrepresent themselves

826
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,686
and they let
each other down.

827
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,924
Well. I don't lie.

828
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,430
I don't misrepresent myself.

829
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,263
And as far as I know,
I don't let anyone down.

830
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,287
You better be
who you say you are,

831
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,158
because I'll know
if you're not.

832
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,519
Pull it together, Morris.

833
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,146
[scream]

834
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,194
Oh my God! Look!
The Lafitte dolls came in!

835
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,559
Look, aren't they adorable?

836
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,324
I had this terrible dream
that Taylor was in our room.

837
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,729
Oh, it really is you.

838
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,910
We have to sell at least a
hundred at the even! tomorrow.

839
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,706
Okay.

840
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,009
Oh, and Brook, thank you
so much for the tip.

841
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,449
I've been drinking like a ton of
brandy and I'm feeling a lot better.

842
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,182
And I'm actually fitting into
my can't-breathe jeans again.

843
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,226
It's like that amazing time
I had (he stomach flu.

844
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,091
Anyways, you're the best.
I'll talk to you later.

845
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,460
Sleeping.
Like I care.

846
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,104
Okay, team.

847
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,366
How are we going to get people
dying to buy these dolls?

848
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,433
I know! We can give away a can
of my homemade mace as a prize.

849
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,102
[everyone]
No.

850
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,544
We can think
of something better-.

851
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,208
Come on, girls.
Let's sell some products.

852
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,583
Colton, you make
your own mace?

853
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:07,248
Yeah. I'm a chemistry major.

854
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,416
You're a chemistry major?

855
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,221
Yes, Brook.

856
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,387
I'm gonna became
a perfumer like Annick Goutal.

857
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,560
They're just upset
because my last prototype

858
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,328
burned some holes
through leather purses-.

859
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,629
But I've perfected it now.

860
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,000
Here. This one's for you-.

861
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,664
See, there's a place for keys on it
and there's a little flashlight.

862
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,071
Thank you, Cotton.

863
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,338
Use it wisely.
[both laugh]

864
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,505
Wait, at least I think
that's the one I perfected-.

865
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:35,976
Buy a doll.

866
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,484
Buy a doll,
play with balls!

867
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,796
Buy a doll,
play with balls.

868
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:51,425
Didn't Lady Gaga
wear that at the VMA's?

869
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,594
Brook?
Nu.

870
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,604
I recognize your voice.

871
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,106
Well, aren't you
just the great detective?

872
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,268
Okay, so let me
gel this straight'

873
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,313
You're a fighting crawdad who's
encouraging people to buy a doll

874
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,713
<i>so that they can play inside of
a giant inflatable child's my</i>

875
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,285
that's more of a liability
nightmare than anything else?

876
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:10,978
Bingo!

877
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,521
No! happening-

878
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,562
<i>The only thing you
will be kissing is my ass.</i>

879
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,724
I'm done. I'm done.
Screw the dolls, I'm done!

880
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,130
Have you sold
many dolls?

881
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,635
Believe it or not, no.

882
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,170
Where's everybody going?

883
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,137
Oh, the Alpha Lambda
Alpha carwash.

884
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,206
Alpha car wash'?

885
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,474
[cheering, talking]

886
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:05,770
It's basically prostitution
with detergent if you ask me.

887
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,903
<i>They are so lucky they
had bad childhoods.</i>

888
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,379
There's no way we're going to
sell all of our dolls in two days

889
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,110
with our clothes on.

890
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,684
We have lo come up
with something.

891
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
[screaming cheering]

892
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,685
Woooo!

893
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,690
We're going to win the
Lafitte Cup, I promise you.

894
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,724
How?

895
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,257
Just trust me.

896
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,132
<i>That guy looks
so much like Cameron.</i>

897
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,865
Come on.
Don't let me down.

898
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,540
There we are.

899
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,445
[shutter clicking]

900
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,654
Dr. Milton'?
Yes.

901
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,484
Have we met'?

902
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,222
No, but I can promise you you're
going to want to be my friend.

903
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,561
Really?
Really'

904
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,405
The waterbed one's
my favorite.

905
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,948
It really brings out
your smile.

906
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:22,006
It would be a great
Christmas card.

907
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,583
What do you want'?

908
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,023
Here you go, Dr. Milton.

909
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,650
Thank you.
I'm happy to help.

910
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,422
You know how important
this is to me.

911
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,191
The negatives
are in the box.

912
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,363
Are we done?

913
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,865
Yep. See you.

914
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,594
Thank you.

915
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,697
Brook, how'd you do it'?

916
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,537
<i>On, I just had
to convince him</i>

917
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,372
that all the sick kids
in his ward

918
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,776
deserve to love crawdaddys
like everybody else.

919
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,280
So Christian of him.

920
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,941
Talk about a man
with a big heart.

921
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,985
Yep, and he shares it
with everybody.

922
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,453
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you sold all our dolls!

923
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,887
[cheering]

924
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,502
Son of a hitch.

925
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,866
[knocking]

926
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,700
<i>Brook, hey.</i>

927
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,638
I know we've gotten off
to a rocky start

928
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,177
but I want to smooth
things over.

929
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,145
Come here.

930
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,672
Sister dysfunction is
just so toxic, you know?

931
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,343
Yeah.

932
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,478
Taylor says you helped
her water problem,

933
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,489
and Cotton says
you've been defending her

934
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,422
when Cameron
gels out of hand.

935
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,652
If it wasn't for you, we'd
never have sold those dolls

936
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,718
and everybody
obvi loves you.

937
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,993
My bracelet.

938
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,934
I would be honored
if you were to wear it-.

939
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,168
Cool, thanks.

940
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,267
No, really, Brook, where I come
from, (his is a really big deal.

941
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,677
But this is a bracelet, with
the words “Mother Green Earth'

942
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:03,583
surrounded by real crusted
pink moissanites.

943
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:07,918
Wow. Thanks, Sasha.
I love it.

944
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,615
Are you going
m put it on?

945
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,592
Duh!
[both lhugh]

946
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,192
OMFG, it's so cute.

947
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,533
<i>You threw the F in there,
so it must be super cute.</i>

948
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,309
Hi, Brook!
Good morning.

949
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,618
Good morning, Brook.

950
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,950
Hey, come eat with us.

951
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,114
I'll save you
a seal, okay?

952
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,247
Okay, cool.

953
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,890
Where did you gel that'?

954
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,261
Gel what?
The bracelet.

955
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:52,898
Oh, Sasha
gave it to me.

956
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,663
That's my bracelet.

957
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,635
That was my mother's
bracelet before.

958
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:57,967
Her name is
right there on it-.

959
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,268
That says Green Earth.

960
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,105
Your mom's name
was Green Earth?

961
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,474
Uh, yeah.

962
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,240
Was she a hippie?

963
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,976
No, Brook. She was 100%
Waccamaw-Siouan Indian.

964
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,641
Do you have
a problem with that?

965
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,016
No, it's just you don't
really look Indian.

966
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,180
I was adopted. Do you have
a problem with that'?

967
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,259
No. Sasha!
Sasha gave it to me.

968
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,294
Sasha, can you came here
for a minute, please?

969
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,987
Did you give Brook
this bracelet?

970
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,032
No, I don't think so. What?

971
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,093
That's your mother's
name, isn't it?

972
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,934
Okay. I see
what's going on here.

973
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,270
<i>Oh, my God, Brook.</i>

974
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,470
I think we found
our kleptomaniac.

975
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,947
That's my iPod.

976
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,609
That's my Eyelicious
moisturizer.

977
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,620
My neck massager?

978
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,553
There's going lo be
a hearing on (his, Brook.

979
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,453
You may be
out of the house.

980
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,993
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

981
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,794
I guess Cameron
was right about you, Brook.

982
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,165
You're no sister of mine.

983
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:05,367
Sasha set me up.
With who?

984
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:10,035
I didn't steal anything, Cotton.
I don'! believe you.

985
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,520
Hey, how's it going?

986
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,569
Klepto.

987
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,365
[indistinct]

988
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,365
Tell me something
good, please.

989
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,204
<i>I'm sorry, honey,
um I checked everything.</i>

990
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:44,371
I checked the Tenet system,
(he Texas DMV backlogs.

991
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,074
I checked six other record
and notification databases

992
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,878
and there's nothing
for a Sasha Stolezinsky-.

993
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,012
All right, it's fine-
I'll figure it out.

994
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,453
How are you'?

995
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:58,287
I'm going to a meeting.
Good.

996
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,186
I love you.
I love you, loo.

997
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:09,769
They don't hate you.

998
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,032
Yes, they do.

999
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,971
They think I'm a klepto.

1000
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,034
What are you doing?

1001
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,704
I'm making sure
I still have my wallet.

1002
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,409
Stop! I'm serious.

1003
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,973
They were just starting
to accept me,

1004
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,814
and now I've become
the enemy,

1005
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,219
which, trust me,
doesn't help anything.

1006
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,588
You're a girl. Didn't you deal
with (his stuff growing up?

1007
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,126
I worked a lot.

1008
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,388
What kind of work
did you do?

1009
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,295
Photography.
What, like weddings'?

1010
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:44,737
No, more nature photography.
Mostly dogs.

1011
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,274
They don't
hale you, Brook.

1012
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:50,173
Okay, nobody can hale you.
Thanks.

1013
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:55,408
I'm really happy you're here.
So am I.

1014
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,076
You're amazing.

1015
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,086
Well, ifs actually
my balls are amazing.

1016
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,450
That doesn't make sense.

1017
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,285
You're the one
that said it.

1018
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:03,825
I have to go.

1019
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,695
Now I have to go.

1020
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,808
[crowd noise]

1021
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,109
Okay, Sasha.

1022
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,684
Here we go.

1023
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,697
Oh, it's you.

1024
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,699
I was hoping
you were a kidnapper.

1025
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,099
Nope. Just me. Everybody's
least favorite Kappa sister.

1026
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:24,400
You know they already
have a nickname for you?

1027
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,337
I won'! tell you if you
don't want to hear it.

1028
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,773
Thanks.

1029
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,674
Fingers.
Fingers Stonebridge.

1030
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,340
That's an improvement
over Brook, don't you think?

1031
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,445
Becky, I'm not a klepto.

1032
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,019
What's that'?

1033
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,214
Something I stole
from Sasha's room.

1034
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,620
Oh, my God. Becky,
you've got to see this.

1035
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,463
That's Sasha!

1036
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:50,861
Yeah, but it's not
her real name.

1037
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,486
There are just so many
fake girls in this house.

1038
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:15,887
I just hate lake people,
don't you, Sasha?

1039
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,153
What do you want'?

1040
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,493
Your name's Suzy Walters,
no! Sasha Stolezinsky.

1041
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:26,226
You never modeled
in Croatia.

1042
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,462
You've never
even been to Croatia.

1043
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,164
You were working at a Taco Bell
when you gal your scholarship here,

1044
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,740
and you were
40 pounds heavier.

1045
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,610
Why do you
have a gun, Brook?

1046
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,508
Because I'm here
looking for someone

1047
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:40,411
who's not who they say
they are, and I found you.

1048
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,246
Why the lies, Suzy'?

1049
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,580
Are you going
to shoot me?

1050
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,746
I doubt it.
Why (he lies?

1051
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,758
Because when [got into college,
I had the chance to start over.

1052
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,658
All my life,
I've been on the outside.

1053
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,323
Sweet sixteens
and proms and boys.

1054
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,597
You don't know
what it feels like

1055
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,534
to watch it all go by,
so you sit on the sideline.

1056
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:03,934
Actually, Suzy, I do.

1057
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,103
Who are you'?

1058
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,371
Your new best friend.

1059
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:15,215
Commencing the Kappa Kappa
Zeta disciplinary hearing.

1060
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:17,683
We are all here today to hear
Brook Stonebridge's version

1061
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,481
of why she stole
all our stuff.

1062
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,716
[whispers]
Allegedly.

1063
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,156
I don'! know
what that word means.

1064
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,058
Just say it.

1065
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,151
Allegedly.

1066
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:32,160
Brook, what do you have
to say for yourself?

1067
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,495
Kleptomania is a disease.

1068
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,563
It's all about bulimia in this
house and I totally gel um.

1069
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:41,336
But we shouldn't cast off
the kleptomaniac

1070
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,208
because they also
have a disease.

1071
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,507
Would we dump the diabetic'?

1072
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,587

<i>Come on, girls. We're
supposed w be sisters.</i>

1074
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:01,826
So with (hat said, I
implore you all to forgive

1075
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,355
and open your hearts
to a sister in need.

1076

and planted it on Brook'

I knew it.

have used it.

[applause]

1083
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:43,704
Hey Brook, I'm so sorry
that I hated you

1084
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,205
and spread all
(hose nasty rumors.

1085
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,264
What'?
What?

1086
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,870
It is such a relief
to let go of the lies.

<i>I'm so happy
you all don't hate me.</i>

Well, Brook put I! best.

1089
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,981
You can't hale the apocalyptic
for having a seizure.

Cotton! It's epileptic.

Alex!
Are you okay?

1094
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,232
You wouldn't understand.

Try me.

I know you're new
and trying ta make friends,

but there are problems
in the real world

that are a lot bigger than asshole
boyfriends or Lafitte dolls.

1099

These problems are very real
and way bigger than anything

1100
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,678
you need to solve
in order to fit in.

1101

Okay.

1102
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,524

Kashalov family named Armon Ranford.

1263

Then obviously he used
a fake name with me.

of that out eventually.

Once he has them in hand,

we can get him for obstruction.
Exactly.

1302

01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,555
I don't think so.

1417
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,688
Who's that?

1418
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:19,824
I'm the contingency.

1419
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,272
I think I gotta sit dawn.

1420
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,340
[groans]

1421
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,406
[groans]

1422
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,446
You're in big
trouble, Armon.

1423
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,344
There's no boys allowed
in the chapter room.

1424
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,113
Oh, everything's so pink-.

1425
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:46,392
Alex!

1426
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:47,722
Hey, Molly!

1427
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:49,353
Oh, my Gad.
How did you--

1428
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,364
Well, Sasha.

1429
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,421
It's a disease.

1430
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,868
Good klepto.

1431
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,097
How'd I do?

1432
01:24:58,193 --> 01:24:59,467
You did great, Cotton.

1433
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,040
[Armon]
Put me in, Coach!

1434
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,269
No more of that
stinking root beer.

1435
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:06,710
Drop and give me 20, God.
Drop and give me 20!

1436
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,442
The FBI's gonna be here soon.
Why don'( you go watch him?

1437
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,575
[sirens approaching]

1438
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:18,650
I need the ledgers
now, Alex.

1439
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:19,782
Yeah.

1440
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,070
[Armon] I want to go
to Candy Mountain,

1441
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,834
and float on the tears
of unicorns.

1442
01:25:33,929 --> 01:25:35,931
<i>Are those real?</i>

1443
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:39,070
I got the kill shot from here,
but I don't know if I can pay!

1444
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:43,139
Maybe I put too much basidiomycoda
fungus in (he mace'?

1445
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,514
It's glorious.

1446
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:49,783
Wait, maybe I wasn't supposed to put
basidiomycoda fungus in the mace.

1447
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:53,816
[laughing, then crying]

1448
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:05,329
You can tum that car into a
jungle gym if you want, girls.

1449
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:06,770
Knock yourself out.

1450
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,364
I missed you.

1451
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:09,635
I am so proud of you.

1452
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,439
I'm proud of you, too.

1453
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,343
Well, I'm your father,
so let me be proud first.

1454
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,949
Good work, Morris. The FBI
could use someone like you.

1455
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:25,458
Thank you, but I think I'm gonna
stick around here and go ta college.

1456
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,960
But my dad could use some help
getting back on (he force.

1457
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,324
Molly.
What?

1458
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:31,489
We'll see
what we can do.

1459
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,226
Make it happen.

1460
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,629
The ledgers.

1461
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,829
The ledgers'?

1462
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,997
Consider it done, Morris.

1463
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:40,301
Welcome back.

1464
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:41,705
Thank you.

1465
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:43,333
You're gonna
be a cop again.

1466
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,900
Brook.

1467
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,174
Dad, this is Nicholas.

1468
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,049
Hi. Nice lo meet you, sir.

1469
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:53,985
Who hit you'?

1470
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:58,157
Your daughter.

1471
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,318
Yeah, she did.

1472
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:04,728
Yeah. I'm just gonna leave you
guys to get to know each other.

1473
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,925
Hey, Brook.
It's Molly.

1474
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:08,524
I mean, Molly.
Come over here.

1475
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,501
Wait, her name's Molly?

1476
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,403
I'm a cop, Nicholas. Just
something to think about.

1477
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:15,835
I'm so proud of you guys.

1478
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,843
<i>OMG, we are
so bad ass.</i>

1479
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,243
I'm really happy
you're my sorority sister-.

1480
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:21,837
Me, (ca.

1481
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,405
I hear some of those
Easy Alpha girls

1482
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:25,348
have infiltrated
(he Sorority Council.

1483
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,011
How do we know
who they are?

1484
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,520
We'll go undercover.

1485
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,784
[all laugh]

1486
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:33,223
[Cotton] Wait, are
we with the FBI now?

1487
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:35,056
Do we gel a gun'?

1488
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,790
Can I have a pink gun'?

1489
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,482
Why did you do that'?

1490
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,789
What're you
doing, Sherlock?

1491
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,451
Outlaws dating this new guy

1492
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:09,722
<i>so I told her I'd check
him out for her.</i>

1493
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:12,561
Ah, yes.
Nature photography.

1494
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,793
So what's up
with this guy?

1495
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:15,459
So far, so good.

1496
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:17,559
He's getting his PhD
in Quantum physics,

1497
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:21,096
so they'll definitely be on
the same page intellectually.

1498
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:23,234
<i>That's cool for you
w do that for her,</i>

1499
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:27,747
because people often aren't who
they say they are, you know?

1500
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,943
They lie. Molly, they let
each other down.

1501
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,112
How long are you
gonna do this for?

1502
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:36,122
A couple of years.
Maybe ten'

1503
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:37,953
Ten years.

1504
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:40,357
You're the detective.
Why don't you figure it out?

1505
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:48,765
This is getting
in the way.

1506
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:08,186
Let's go everybody.
Watch the lights, guys.

1507
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,880
Ready, and background...

1508
01:29:09,978 --> 01:29:12,219
I myself am
an Aikido man.

1509
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:14,191
Aikido is a fashionable way
for fat housewives

1510
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,057
to lose weight
at their local Equinox.

1511
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:17,562
Are you calling me
a fat housewife?

1512
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:18,460
Yep.

1513
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,794
Look---...

1514
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:20,856
I'm a fat housewife
in an--

1515
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:22,867
<i>- Yes.
- Really?</i>

1516
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:25,871
And rolling.

1517
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,874
[silly noises]

1518
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:31,808
[evil crazy laugh]

1519
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,972
Let's go guys.

1520
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,036
Let's make a movie.

1521
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,410
Quiet, please.

1522
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:37,812
I'm not like
most girls.

1523
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,079
Well, Brook
Stonebridge is--

1524
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,482
Who's Brook Stonebridge?

1525
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,681
[laughing]

1526
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,157
Set, and...

1527
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,993
Sorry, but these
are so fucking spicy.

1528
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,590
[coughs
everyone laughs]

1529
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:00,170
That's an entrance!

1530
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,209
I'll find out
if you're not.

1531
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:08,914
[Miley screams
and runs]

1532
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:11,848
I'll find out
if you're not.

1533
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,284
All right.

1534
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:18,714
[both crack up]

1535
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,525
Still rolling,
and ready.

1536
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:26,031
What am I doing?
Fur real?

1537
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,296
Dude. Wait. Now what
do you want me to do?

1538
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:30,870
Jump off the side'?

1539
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,769
Me.
What am I doing?

1540
01:30:32,861 --> 01:30:34,238
Ju-jit-su.

1541
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:36,207
You're well-versed
in ju-jit-su.

1542
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,971
You heard o! the--

[nonsense babble]
Ju-jit-su.

1544
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:47,117
If that ends up anywhere,
I'm gonna kill you.

1545
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:51,315
I'm like,
totally undercover.

1546
01:30:51,413 --> 01:30:53,893
<i>I'm like,
so undercover.</i>

1547
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,828
I'm so undercover.
