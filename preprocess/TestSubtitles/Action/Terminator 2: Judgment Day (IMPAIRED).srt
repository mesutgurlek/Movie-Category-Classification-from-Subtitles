1
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:23,332
Three billion human lives ended on August 29, 1997.

2
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:29,380
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war 'Judgment Day."

3
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:34,594
They lived only to face a new nightmare
the war against the machines.

4
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,551
The computer which controlled the machines, Skynet,...

5
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,637
...sent two Terminator back through time.

6
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,850
Their mission: to destroy the leader of the human Resistance...

7
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,519
...John Connor, my son.

8
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,027
The first Terminator was programmed to
strike at me in the year 1984,...

9
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,363
...before John was born.

10
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,365
It failed.

11
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,287
The second was set to strike at John himself
when he was still a child.

12
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,295
As before, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior,...

13
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,714
...a protector for John.

14
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,301
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

15
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,872
Oh!

16
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,600
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.

17
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,986
You forgot to say "please."

18
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,744
Ooh!

19
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,628
Get him off me!

20
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,858
Pull it out!

21
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,070
Pull it out!
Oh, pull it out!

22
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,924
Take it.

23
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,277
Can't let you take the man's wheels, son.

24
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:41,956
Now, get off before I put you down.

25
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,957
That's it, goddamn it.

26
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,823
R-31 David, Sherman Code Six
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe...

27
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,951
...on an electrical disturbance.

28
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,287
Ten-four, R-31 David.

29
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,795
Come on.
Let's go to my house.

30
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,061
John?
John, get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours.

31
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,644
John!

32
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,067
Your foster parents are kind of dicks, huh?

33
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,195
I swear, I have had it with that goddamn kid.

34
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,948
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

35
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,951
Would you get off your butt and help me?

36
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,954
- Todd!
- What? What?

37
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,332
He hasn't cleaned that room of his in a month.

38
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,919
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

39
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,785
Come on!

40
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,557
John! Come on. Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells ya.

41
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,519
She's not my mother, Todd.

42
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,525
Yeah-ha-ha!

43
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:03,156
This next patient is interesting.
I've been following the case for years.

44
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,554
- A 29-year-old female diag...
- Hey, hey! Come on.

45
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,524
...diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.

46
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:15,604
The usual indicators: depression, anxiety,
violent acting out, delusions of persecution.

47
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,364
The delusional architecture is fairly unique.

48
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,158
She believes that a machine called the Terminator,...

49
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:32,663
...which looks human ofcourse,
was sent back through time to kill her.

50
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:37,000
- That's original.
- And also that the father of her child...

51
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,136
...was a soldier sent back to protect her.

52
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,381
- No.
- He was from the future too.

53
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:47,135
The year, uh, 2029, if I remember correctly.

54
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,555
And here we are.

55
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,631
Morning, Sarah.

56
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,731
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

57
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,527
Fine, Sarah.

58
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:09,992
She, uh, stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

59
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,277
Repeated escape attempts.

60
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,548
Let's move on, shall we?

61
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,284
Douglas, I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

62
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,813
- See that she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure, Dr. Silberman. I'll take care of it.

63
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,112
Time to take your meds, Connor.

64
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,114
You take it.

65
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,492
Now, you know you gotta be good 'cause
you're up for review this afternoon.

66
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,038
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

67
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,081
Ain't no trouble.

68
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,757
Yeah, zap her.

69
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,642
Last call, sugar.

70
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,400
Sweet dreams.

71
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,555
Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?

72
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,894
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

73
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,022
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

74
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,983
He took off on his bike this morning, so he could be anywhere.

75
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,319
Do you have a photograph of John?

76
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,780
Yeah. Sure. Hold on.

77
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,700
You gonna tell me what this is about?

78
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,245
I just need to ask him a few questions.

79
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,842
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

80
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:27,162
No, go on.
There was a guy here this morning looking for him too.

81
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,465
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
Has that got something to do with this?

82
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,513
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

83
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,184
Thanks for your cooperation.

84
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,938
Please insert your stolen card now.

85
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,448
PIN number.

86
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,060
- Will you hurry up? This is taking too long.
- Go, baby. Go, baby. Go, baby.

87
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:04,132
All right.
PIN number 9003.

88
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,251
- Where'd you learn this stuff from anyway?
- From my mom.

89
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:12,299
My real mom, I mean.
Um, withdraw 300 bucks.

90
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,218
Come on, baby. Come on!
Come on. Come on!

91
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,596
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

92
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,308
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

93
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,770
- Yes! Piece of cake.
- Yeah!

94
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,112
- Is that her?
- Yes.

95
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,114
So she's pretty cool, huh?

96
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,450
No, she's a complete psycho.

97
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:43,079
That's why she's up at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute. Okay?

98
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,808
She tried to blow up a computer factory,
but she got shot and arrested.

99
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:48,293
No shit.

100
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,338
She's a total loser.

101
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,257
- Come on. Let's go spend some money.
- All right.

102
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,244
Sarah.

103
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,205
Sarah. Wake up.

104
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,547
Kyle.

105
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,178
- You're dead.
- Where's our son, Sarah?

106
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,473
They took him away from me.

107
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,760
- He's the target now.
- I know.

108
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:50,937
- He's all alone and you have to protect him.
- I know.

109
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,858
You tell me how I'm supposed to do that.

110
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,361
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

111
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,363
I've lost him.

112
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,611
You're strong, Sarah.
Stronger than you ever thought you could be.

113
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,712
- No.
- On your feet, soldier.

114
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,832
I love you, Sarah.

115
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,293
I always will.

116
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,712
I need you.

117
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,547
I'll always be with you.

118
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,469
Remember the message.

119
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,848
The future is not set.

120
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,311
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.

121
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,499
Stay with me.

122
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,295
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

123
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,387
Kyle, don't go!

124
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,443
Kyle!

125
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,685
Mommy, watch this!
Watch this, Mommy!

126
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,817
Whoa!

127
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,060
It's like a giant strobe light...

128
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,813
...burning right through my eyes.

129
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,902
Somehow I can still see.

130
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,869
Oh, God.

131
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,625
We know the dream's the same every night.

132
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,254
- Why do I have to --
- Please continue.

133
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,136
Children look like burnt paper.

134
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,389
Black.

135
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,433
Not moving.

136
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,271
And then the blast wave hits them.

137
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:30,116
And they fly apart like leaves.

138
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:36,497
Dreams of cataclysm, the end of the world, are very common.

139
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,544
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

140
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:47,074
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

141
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,860
On August 29, 1997,
it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real to you too!

142
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:58,645
Anybody not wearing two million sunblock
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?

143
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,564
God, you think you're safe and alive.

144
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:06,542
You're already dead. Everybody!
Him. You. You're dead already.

145
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,322
This whole place, everything you see is gone!

146
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:14,285
You're the one living in a fucking dream,
Silberman, 'cause I know it happens!

147
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,162
It happens!

148
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,634
I feel much better now.

149
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,636
Clearer.

150
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,639
Yes, your attitude has been...

151
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,058
...much improved lately.

152
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,406
It's helped me to have a goal,
something to look forward to.

153
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,408
What is that?

154
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,243
Well, you said...

155
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:59,664
...that if I showed improvement after six months,...

156
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:05,303
...you would transfer me to the minimum security wing
and I could have visitors.

157
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,543
Well, it's been six months, and...

158
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:14,429
...I was looking forward to seeing my son.

159
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,099
I see.

160
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:25,315
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

161
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,693
Now you think they don't exist?

162
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,864
They don't exist.
I know that now.

163
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:38,280
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

164
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,874
If I had, there would have been some evidence.

165
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,460
They would have found something at the factory.

166
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,754
I see.

167
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,341
So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?

168
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,387
No. Why would they?

169
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,066
Let's try a new position right there.

170
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,231
Those neurons are all saturated.

171
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,945
Mr. Dyson? Mr. Dyson.

172
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,365
The materials team is running another-

173
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,408
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yeah?

174
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,411
The materials team is running another series this afternoon.

175
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,647
You have to sign for the-- the, uh-- it.

176
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,751
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. Come on. I'll get it.

177
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:29,536
Listen, Mr. Dyson.

178
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:32,883
I know I haven't been here that long,
but I was wondering if you could tell me-- I mean, if you know--

179
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:36,694
- Know what?
- Well, if you know where "it" came from.

180
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:40,056
You know, I asked them that very same question once.
You know what they told me?

181
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,141
"Don't ask."

182
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,941
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

183
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:55,987
Okay. Insert key.
Left on three, two, one. Turn.

184
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,829
- How are the wife and kids? There you go.
- Great. Thanks.

185
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,109
So what do you think, Doctor?

186
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,145
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

187
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,032
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

188
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:46,456
I know how smart you are,
and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.

189
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,667
I don't think you really believe what you're telling me today.

190
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:53,671
I think if I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

191
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,720
You have to let me see my son.

192
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:07,560
Please. Please.

193
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,606
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

194
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,891
If I could just make a phone call--

195
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:16,577
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

196
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,575
I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board
that you stay here for another six months.

197
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,999
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
- Now, calm down--

198
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,485
- Douglas! Douglas!
- You son of a bitch!

199
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,964
Get her off!
Ten c.c.'s of sodium amobarbital, stat!

200
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,967
You don't know what you're doing!

201
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,262
Get some restraints in here now!

202
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,274
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Got her?

203
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,478
God!

204
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,064
Model citizen.

205
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,157
Bam

206
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,814
You just missed him.
He was here, like, 15 minutes ago.

207
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,109
- I think he said he was going to the galleria, right?
- Yeah.

208
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,244
The galleria?

209
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,734
- I've never seen him.
- Yeah. He's in the arcade.

210
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,667
- Hey, bro, I'm gonna get some quarters. I'll be back, all right?
- Cool.

211
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,327
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

212
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,562
No.

213
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,475
- Oh!
- Hey, do you know this guy?

214
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,727
Nah, I don't know him.

215
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,943
- John.
- Not now. Not now.

216
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,947
Hey. Man, there's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

217
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,369
- Yeah. He's right over there.
- Split, man. Just go.

218
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,954
Yeah.

219
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,127
Hey, man, I think I saw that kid you were looking--
Hey!

220
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,385
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

221
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,913
Hey! Hey!

222
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,714
Get down.

223
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,951
Hey, mister, are you all right?

224
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,412
Mister, you all right?

225
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:34,929
Come on!

226
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,190
Come on!

227
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:11,665
Shit.

228
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,720
Damn!

229
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,201
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

230
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:00,504
Time-out.
Come on. Stop the bike.

231
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:18,138
Holy shit. Now, don't take this the wrong way,
but you are a Terminator, right?

232
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:21,859
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

233
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,244
No.

234
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,122
Ho-- Holy shit.

235
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,543
You're really real.

236
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,921
I mean--

237
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,550
You-- You're like a machine underneath, right?

238
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,635
But sort of alive outside?

239
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,390
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

240
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,407
This is intense.

241
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,702
Get a grip,John. Okay.

242
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,787
Um--

243
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,915
You're not here to kill me.

244
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,417
I figured that part out for myself.

245
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,838
- So what's the deal?
- My mission is to protect you.

246
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,849
Yeah? Who sent you?

247
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,495
You did. Thirty-five years from now, you reprogrammed me...

248
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,932
...to be your protector here, in this time.

249
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,809
Oh, this is deep.

250
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,852
So this other guy, he's a Terminator like you, right?

251
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:07,264
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

252
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:13,136
- You mean, more advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

253
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:17,155
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

254
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:23,213
Where are we going? We have to get out of the
city immediately and avoid the authorities.

255
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:26,508
Listen. I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

256
00:41:26,513 --> 00:41:30,412
Negative.
The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there.

257
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:33,323
- You sure?
- I would.

258
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,837
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks,...

259
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,215
...but I gotta warn 'em.

260
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,926
Shit. You got a quarter?

261
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,438
- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.

262
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,982
- John?
- Yeah. Is everything all right?

263
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:09,726
- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.

264
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,529
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

265
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,274
John, it's late.
Honey, I was beginning to worry about you.

266
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:18,860
If you hurry home, we can sit down and have dinner together.

267
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:22,989
- I'm making beefstew.
- Something's wrong. She's never this nice.

268
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,575
John? Where are you?

269
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,745
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?

270
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:31,848
Hey!
Shut up, you worthless piece of shit!

271
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:33,708
The dog's really barking.

272
00:42:33,793 --> 00:42:37,087
I thought you were gonna tell the
kid to get rid of that fucking mutt.

273
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,183
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

274
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:44,469
Could he already be there?

275
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,848
- Honey, are you okay?
- I'm right here. I'm fine.

276
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,892
Are you sure?
Are you sure you're all right?

277
00:42:51,018 --> 00:42:54,312
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

278
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:56,903
Hey,Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

279
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:59,542
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

280
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:03,213
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

281
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:05,298
Where are you?

282
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:09,052
Your foster parents are dead.

283
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,757
Oh. I need a minute here.

284
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:52,137
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

285
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:55,432
Anything it samples by physical contact.

286
00:43:55,516 --> 00:44:00,437
Get real.
Like, it could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?

287
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,605
No, only an object of equal size.

288
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,166
Why not just become a bomb or something to get me?

289
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,193
It can't form complex machines.

290
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,913
Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.

291
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:13,032
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

292
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,327
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

293
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:57,887
Messages from Mom.

294
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,989
These were taken by a video surveillance camera...

295
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:19,617
...at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.

296
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,705
He killed 17 police officers that night.

297
00:46:25,374 --> 00:46:30,837
Men with families, children.

298
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:36,759
These were taken at a mall in Reseda today.

299
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:41,222
Miss Connor, we know you know who this guy is.

300
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:47,020
Look, I just sat here and told you that your son is missing,...

301
00:46:48,314 --> 00:46:50,982
...that the foster parents have been murdered.

302
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:53,067
We know this guy's involved.

303
00:46:54,153 --> 00:46:57,488
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

304
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,828
We're wasting our time.

305
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,206
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry, guys.

306
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:13,046
She's just grown more and more
disconnected from reality as time goes on.

307
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,131
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

308
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:18,343
If she clears at all and can give us anything,
then I'll call you.

309
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:20,303
Sure.

310
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:24,599
- Douglas, take her back to her room, please.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:28,269
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go.

312
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:33,441
You see, we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

313
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,780
For a while there, she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

314
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:40,782
...running guns.

315
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:43,534
Then there were some other guys.

316
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:49,207
She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from so
she could teach me how to be this great military leader.

317
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,669
Then she gets busted.

318
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:56,673
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you know?"

319
00:47:58,717 --> 00:48:02,804
It's like everything I've been brought up
to believe was all made-up bullshit.

320
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:05,556
I hated her for that.

321
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,062
But everything she said was true.

322
00:48:12,606 --> 00:48:14,565
She knew,...

323
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,611
...and nobody believed her,...

324
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:22,448
...not even me.

325
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:26,327
Listen.
We gotta get her out of there.

326
00:48:26,412 --> 00:48:29,914
Negative.
The T-1000's highest probability for success now will be...

327
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:33,001
...to copy Sarah Connor and to wait for you to make contact with her.

328
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:35,169
Great. What happens to her?

329
00:48:35,254 --> 00:48:38,172
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.

330
00:48:38,257 --> 00:48:41,276
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

331
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,420
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

332
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:45,888
Yeah? Well, fuck youself!
She's a priority to me!

333
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:50,727
Hey, goddamn it!
What's your problem? Goddamn it!

334
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:53,646
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

335
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:56,390
Get this psycho off of me!
Help! Help!

336
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:59,218
- Help! I'm being kidnapped! Get this psycho off of me!
- Let's go check it out.

337
00:48:59,223 --> 00:49:00,795
Let me go!

338
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,784
Why the hell did you do that?

339
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,745
Because you told me to.

340
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,458
What?

341
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:20,048
You have to do what I say, huh?

342
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:22,341
That's one of my mission parameters.

343
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,135
Prove it.

344
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,138
Stand on one foot.

345
00:49:29,224 --> 00:49:30,683
Yes!

346
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:35,396
Cool. My own Terminator.

347
00:49:35,522 --> 00:49:37,065
Wow.

348
00:49:37,149 --> 00:49:39,033
You okay, kid?

349
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:43,062
- Take a hike, bozo. What?
- See? Let's get outta here, man.

350
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,323
Fuckyou, you little dipshit!

351
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:47,325
Dipshit?

352
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,579
Put your leg down.

353
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:54,949
Did you call moi a dipshit?

354
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:56,751
Just trying to help this punk.

355
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:59,287
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me a dipshit.

356
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:02,223
Get him off of me!

357
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:05,093
Now who's the dipshit, you jock douche bag?

358
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:09,639
Get off of him!

359
00:50:12,684 --> 00:50:15,019
- No!
- Holy shit.

360
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:17,396
Put the gun down now!

361
00:50:17,523 --> 00:50:21,025
- Get outta here!
- Come on, Gus. Let's split! Come on!

362
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,742
Jesus!
You were gonna kill that guy!

363
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,953
Ofcourse. I'm a Terminator.

364
00:50:33,956 --> 00:50:36,791
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

365
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:40,253
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

366
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,463
You got that?

367
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:46,091
- You just can't go around killing people.
- Why?

368
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:49,103
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

369
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:53,424
- Why?
- Because you just can't, okay? Trust me on this.

370
00:50:58,781 --> 00:51:02,533
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom,...

371
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:05,328
...and I order you to help me.

372
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,105
Hmph.

373
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:32,683
Hi.

374
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:35,103
You have a Sarah Connor here?

375
00:53:35,187 --> 00:53:37,188
You're runnin' kind of late, aren't ya?

376
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:39,440
They've been in there for an hour.

377
00:53:39,525 --> 00:53:43,236
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

378
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,781
Oh, here comes your friends now.

379
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:52,138
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

380
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,142
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

381
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:23,511
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

382
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,463
Must be my lucky day.

383
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:09,006
Shut up!

384
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:50,858
Yeah, I think you're right about number 24.

385
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:53,778
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.

386
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:55,863
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:14,048
You!

388
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,511
You broke my arm.

389
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,180
There are 215 bones in the human body.

390
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,916
- That's one. Now, don't move.
- All right.

391
00:58:29,815 --> 00:58:31,732
What are you going to do?

392
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,113
Why do we stop now?

393
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:42,201
Now, you gotta promise me you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

394
00:58:42,327 --> 00:58:44,578
- Right.
- Swear?

395
00:58:44,663 --> 00:58:46,580
What?

396
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:50,626
Just put up your hand and say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."

397
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,003
I swear I will not kill anyone.

398
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:56,006
All right. Let's go.

399
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:06,314
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00, Monday through Friday.

400
00:59:10,021 --> 00:59:14,984
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

401
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:19,238
Crazy bastard! Oh, God!

402
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,617
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

403
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,288
Oh, my leg.

404
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:29,290
He'll live.

405
00:59:43,138 --> 00:59:45,764
Son of a bitch!

406
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:50,678
- Let's all try to remain calm.
- Open it, or he'll be dead before he hits the floor.

407
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:52,605
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

408
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,149
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

409
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:57,151
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

410
00:59:57,235 --> 01:00:00,362
It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

411
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:05,201
You're already dead, Silberman. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it. So don't fuck with me!

412
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:08,328
Open the door.
Open the door!

413
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:10,248
Open it.

414
01:00:13,668 --> 01:00:14,836
Back off!

415
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:17,296
Get back!

416
01:00:17,302 --> 01:00:20,674
- I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!
- Back, back, back.

417
01:00:20,759 --> 01:00:22,801
Don't move!

418
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:27,097
- Drop the shit!
- Do it. Do it!

419
01:00:27,182 --> 01:00:29,099
Get in the office.

420
01:00:29,184 --> 01:00:31,101
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

421
01:00:31,186 --> 01:00:32,978
Open the door.

422
01:00:35,857 --> 01:00:38,359
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

423
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:57,086
Get her. Get her!

424
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:24,738
Sarah! Sarah!

425
01:01:24,823 --> 01:01:27,783
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

426
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,744
Let's go! Come on! Open it!

427
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:33,122
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on, come on!

428
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:35,507
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

429
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,523
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it! Come on!

430
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:11,160
No! No!

431
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:16,206
- No!
- Mom, wait!

432
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:17,884
Mom!

433
01:02:23,298 --> 01:02:25,883
- Come back here!
- No!

434
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,552
No! No!

435
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,262
- Help her!
- Wait here.

436
01:02:30,388 --> 01:02:32,514
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

437
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:35,476
- He'll kill us all!
- Hold her.

438
01:02:37,062 --> 01:02:39,813
He'll kill us all!

439
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:03,253
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

440
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:09,635
Come with me if you want to live.

441
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,680
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help. It's okay.

442
01:03:36,204 --> 01:03:37,797
Go.

443
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:13,165
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

444
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:29,506
Get down.

445
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:48,108
Mom!

446
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,295
Out of the car!

447
01:05:08,379 --> 01:05:10,631
Right now!

448
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,424
Go!

449
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:47,752
I'm out.

450
01:05:54,342 --> 01:05:56,218
- Come on.
- Here.

451
01:05:58,763 --> 01:06:00,348
Reload.

452
01:06:09,774 --> 01:06:11,275
Last one!

453
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,534
Hang on.

454
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,270
Ready!

455
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,069
John!

456
01:07:01,993 --> 01:07:03,911
Here, drive.

457
01:07:56,814 --> 01:07:59,148
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

458
01:07:59,153 --> 01:08:01,551
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

459
01:08:04,055 --> 01:08:07,674
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

460
01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:12,020
Cool.

461
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,567
Come here.

462
01:08:23,324 --> 01:08:25,075
I said I was okay!

463
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,996
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

464
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,249
Goddamn it.
You have to be smarter than that.

465
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:34,918
You almost got yourself killed.

466
01:08:35,003 --> 01:08:36,878
What were you thinking?

467
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:40,707
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

468
01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:43,635
Do you understand?
You're too important.

469
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,346
Do you understand?

470
01:08:49,434 --> 01:08:54,771
But I had to get you out of that place.

471
01:08:54,856 --> 01:08:56,773
I'm sorry.

472
01:08:56,858 --> 01:08:59,359
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

473
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,201
What's wrong with your eyes?

474
01:09:10,288 --> 01:09:12,205
Nothin'.

475
01:09:21,632 --> 01:09:24,009
So, what's your story?

476
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:36,730
- You okay?
- Fine.

477
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:42,235
Say, that's a nice bike.

478
01:10:04,258 --> 01:10:06,510
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

479
01:10:14,185 --> 01:10:17,312
Listen.
Do you know what you're doing?

480
01:10:17,396 --> 01:10:20,273
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

481
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:23,235
I bet.

482
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:27,447
- Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
- Correct.

483
01:10:33,204 --> 01:10:35,455
Does it hurt when you get shot?

484
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,876
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

485
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,507
- John, help me with the light.
- Will these heal up?

486
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:47,717
- Yes.
- Good.

487
01:10:47,802 --> 01:10:50,929
If you can't pass for human, you're not much good to us.

488
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:54,266
- How long do you live?
- I mean, last. Whatever.

489
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,143
A hundred and twenty years, with my existing power cell.

490
01:10:57,228 --> 01:11:01,982
Can you learn stuff that you haven't
been programmed with so you can be,...

491
01:11:02,984 --> 01:11:05,610
...you know, more human...

492
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:08,405
...and not such a dork all the time?

493
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:14,995
My C.P.U. is a neural net processor, a learning computer,...

494
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:18,582
...but Skynet presets the switch to read
only when we're sent out alone.

495
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:24,713
- Doesn't want you to do too much thinking, huh?
- No.

496
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,550
Can we reset the switch?

497
01:11:46,611 --> 01:11:49,404
Rotate the two locking cylinders counter clockwise.

498
01:11:56,954 --> 01:11:58,857
Do it.

499
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:08,632
Now open the port cover.

500
01:12:11,636 --> 01:12:13,803
Pull, to break the seal.

501
01:12:17,642 --> 01:12:21,144
Good. Now remove the shock-damping assembly.

502
01:12:24,815 --> 01:12:27,025
You can now access the C.P.U.

503
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,487
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

504
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,031
Pull the C.P.U. beds base tab.

505
01:12:34,575 --> 01:12:36,169
Pull.

506
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:15,073
Can you see the pin switch?

507
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,033
No, no!

508
01:13:18,285 --> 01:13:20,620
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

509
01:13:20,705 --> 01:13:24,040
"It," John, not "him." "It."

510
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:27,585
Okay. "It."
But we need "it."

511
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,296
Listen to me. You listen.

512
01:13:30,381 --> 01:13:32,465
We are better off on our own.

513
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:37,053
But he's the only proof we have
of the future and the war and all that!

514
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:38,714
Maybe.

515
01:13:41,058 --> 01:13:43,101
I don't trust it.

516
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,812
But he's my friend, all right?

517
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:48,732
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things.

518
01:13:48,816 --> 01:13:51,552
And if something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance, so move!

519
01:13:51,555 --> 01:13:54,296
Look, Mom.
If I'm ever supposed to be this great military leader,...

520
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,241
...maybe you should start listening to
my leadership ideas once in a while!

521
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:05,331
Cause if my own mother won't, how do you expect anyone else to?

522
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:23,141
All right. Play it your way.

523
01:14:30,608 --> 01:14:32,650
Was there a problem?

524
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,595
No problem.

525
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:37,355
None whatsoever.

526
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:13,108
Are we learning yet?

527
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:14,726
Hey!

528
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:28,206
We have to get as far away from the city as possible.

529
01:15:32,086 --> 01:15:34,087
Just head south.

530
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,821
Keep it under 65.

531
01:15:43,848 --> 01:15:46,891
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

532
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:49,894
No, no, no, no, no.

533
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,605
You gotta listen to the way people talk.

534
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:56,151
You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that.

535
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:58,611
You say, "No problemo."

536
01:15:58,696 --> 01:16:02,615
And if someone comes off to you with an attitude,
you say, "Eat me."

537
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,953
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

538
01:16:07,037 --> 01:16:10,165
Hasta la vista, baby.

539
01:16:10,249 --> 01:16:12,292
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

540
01:16:12,376 --> 01:16:14,878
And if someone gets upset, you say, "Chill out."

541
01:16:14,962 --> 01:16:16,921
Or you could do combinations.

542
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:19,966
Chill out, dick-wad.

543
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,802
That's great!
See? You're getting it.

544
01:16:22,887 --> 01:16:24,929
No problemo.

545
01:16:35,065 --> 01:16:36,816
You got any cash?

546
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:40,612
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

547
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:43,364
- Mom!
- Okay.

548
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,825
- Get some food.
- Geez.

549
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:49,829
No sense of humor.

550
01:16:55,127 --> 01:16:57,212
And that's another thing.

551
01:16:57,296 --> 01:16:59,839
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

552
01:16:59,924 --> 01:17:01,966
This severe routine is getting old, okay?

553
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,052
I mean, you're acting like such a geek.

554
01:17:04,178 --> 01:17:07,347
- Smile once in a while.
- Smile?

555
01:17:07,431 --> 01:17:10,350
Yeah. You know, smile.

556
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:12,352
Watch.

557
01:17:12,436 --> 01:17:16,147
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

558
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,942
Give me a break.

559
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,820
Okay. Bad example.

560
01:17:22,947 --> 01:17:26,626
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

561
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:38,586
You're crazy.

562
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:50,306
That's good.
Maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.

563
01:17:57,815 --> 01:17:59,816
Want some of my fries?

564
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,287
- Need any help?
- No.

565
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:16,416
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

566
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:18,918
I got you!
I came around here and got you!

567
01:18:19,003 --> 01:18:20,962
No, you didn't!

568
01:18:21,046 --> 01:18:22,839
I told you I'm--

569
01:18:23,624 --> 01:18:26,634
We're not gonna make it, are we?

570
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,887
People, I mean.

571
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:36,019
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

572
01:18:36,103 --> 01:18:38,938
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

573
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:42,317
Break it up before I wring both of your necks. Come on.

574
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:47,071
I need to know how Skynet gets built.

575
01:18:47,197 --> 01:18:52,076
- Who's responsible?
- The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.

576
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,078
Who is that?

577
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:57,540
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

578
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:02,503
Why him?

579
01:19:02,588 --> 01:19:07,050
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary type of microprocessor.

580
01:19:07,134 --> 01:19:09,344
Go on. Then what?

581
01:19:09,428 --> 01:19:14,265
In three years Cyberdyne will become the
largest supplier of military computer systems.

582
01:19:14,269 --> 01:19:19,228
All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers,
becoming fully unmanned.

583
01:19:19,313 --> 01:19:22,440
Afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record.

584
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:25,193
The SKYnet funding bill is passed.

585
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:28,488
The system goes online on August 4, 1997.

586
01:19:28,572 --> 01:19:31,824
Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.

587
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:34,577
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

588
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:39,556
It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m.
Eastern time, August 29.

589
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:42,752
In a panic they try to pull the plug.

590
01:19:43,754 --> 01:19:46,005
- SKYnet fights back.
- Yes.

591
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:49,242
It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia.

592
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,969
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

593
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:56,632
Because Skynet knows that the Russian
counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here.

594
01:19:56,637 --> 01:19:58,018
Jesus.

595
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,005
How much do you know about Dyson?

596
01:20:04,775 --> 01:20:08,027
I have detailed files.

597
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:10,988
I want to know everything.

598
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:15,243
What he looks like, where he lives, everything.

599
01:20:26,295 --> 01:20:28,172
Miles?

600
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:32,553
Miles.

601
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:47,642
Oh!

602
01:20:47,868 --> 01:20:50,486
- Hey.
- Hey.

603
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:52,488
You gonna work all day?

604
01:20:52,573 --> 01:20:56,242
I'm sorry, baby, but this thing is just kicking my ass.

605
01:20:56,326 --> 01:21:00,496
Miles, it's Sunday.
You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.

606
01:21:01,915 --> 01:21:03,833
I can't. Um--

607
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:05,918
I'm on a roll.

608
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,884
Baby, this is gonna blow 'em all away.

609
01:21:20,888 --> 01:21:24,228
- It's a-- It's a neural net processor
- I know. I know. You told me.

610
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:27,640
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

611
01:21:27,644 --> 01:21:30,167
It's superconducting at room temperature.

612
01:21:30,172 --> 01:21:35,229
- Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison.
- Yeah.

613
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:38,868
But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?

614
01:21:38,952 --> 01:21:43,039
I really need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy here.

615
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:47,001
Baby, I am this close.

616
01:21:47,085 --> 01:21:49,086
Come here.

617
01:21:51,632 --> 01:21:54,592
Imagine a-- a jet airliner...

618
01:21:54,718 --> 01:21:58,930
...with a pilot that never gets tired, never makes mistakes,
never shows up to work with a hangover.

619
01:22:01,266 --> 01:22:03,601
Meet the pilot.

620
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:07,980
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children? You don't need us.

621
01:22:08,065 --> 01:22:11,734
Your heart and your mind are in here.

622
01:22:11,818 --> 01:22:14,820
But it doesn't love you like we do.

623
01:22:22,496 --> 01:22:25,289
I'm sorry. Really.

624
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:29,627
How 'bout spending some time with your other babies?

625
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,171
Hey-hey!

626
01:22:32,256 --> 01:22:35,758
- Raging Wateb!
- Yea!

627
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:05,454
Wait in the car.

628
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:27,977
Enrique, estas aqui?

629
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,745
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

630
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,914
Y tú.

631
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:54,119
Siempre como culebra.

632
01:23:55,004 --> 01:23:59,580
- Hey! Que bueno verte, Connor.
- Dije que hiba a regresar.

633
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:02,341
Y yo lo sabia, carajo. Que bueno verte.


634
01:24:02,346 --> 01:24:06,182
Yolanda, venga, que hay visita, carajo.
Traiga la pinche tequila.

635
01:24:06,266 --> 01:24:10,225
- Hey, big John, como te va?
- What's up?

636
01:24:10,226 --> 01:24:11,826
Que grandote es este?

637
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:17,026
He's cool, Enrique. He's with me.
He's, uh, Uncle Bob.

638
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:21,995
- Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
- Uncle Bob, huh?

639
01:24:22,032 --> 01:24:24,208
Okay. Okay.

640
01:24:24,212 --> 01:24:26,952
- Que bonito!
- Como estas?

641
01:24:27,037 --> 01:24:31,822
- Como estas? Que grande estas, mi hijito?
- Drink?

642
01:24:36,713 --> 01:24:38,130
"Uncle Bob"?

643
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:43,477
Eh, Sarita. You're pretty famous, you know, all over the goddamn TV.

644
01:24:42,881 --> 01:24:45,880
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.

645
01:24:45,884 --> 01:24:48,183
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

646
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:51,284
Mihijita, llevese el nino, eh.

647
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:55,272
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and one of your trucks.

648
01:24:55,357 --> 01:25:00,315
- How about the fillings out of my fucking teeth?
- Now, Enrique.

649
01:25:01,321 --> 01:25:05,372
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on, let's go.

650
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:28,055
One thing about my mom...

651
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:32,017
...she always plans ahead.

652
01:25:42,112 --> 01:25:43,988
Excellent.

653
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:54,498
Aw, shit.

654
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:58,302
You know, this is the best truck I got, but the starter motor's gone.

655
01:25:58,306 --> 01:26:00,337
You got the time to change it out?

656
01:26:00,464 --> 01:26:04,049
- Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border.
- Okay.

657
01:26:04,134 --> 01:26:06,927
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

658
01:26:07,012 --> 01:26:11,013
- You get out tonight too. Okay?
- Sure.

659
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,394
Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life, all right?

660
01:26:19,816 --> 01:26:23,402
See, I grew up in places like this,...

661
01:26:23,487 --> 01:26:26,864
...so I just thought that's how people lived...

662
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:29,450
...riding around in helicopters,...

663
01:26:30,869 --> 01:26:32,870
...learning how to blow shit up.

664
01:26:34,539 --> 01:26:40,252
But then when my mom got busted I got put in a regular school.

665
01:26:40,337 --> 01:26:43,506
All the other kids were into Nintendo.

666
01:26:57,646 --> 01:27:00,647
- Are you ever afraid?
- No.

667
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:08,412
- Not even of dying?
- No.

668
01:27:13,537 --> 01:27:17,406
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or another?

669
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:21,961
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.

670
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,951
Then it doesn't matter.

671
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:34,195
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm too important.

672
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,865
That's definitely you.

673
01:28:03,086 --> 01:28:06,253
Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks,...

674
01:28:06,256 --> 01:28:09,550
...but there was this one guy, he was kinda cool.

675
01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:11,677
He taught me engines.

676
01:28:11,761 --> 01:28:13,929
Hold here.

677
01:28:14,014 --> 01:28:16,307
Mom screwed it up, ofcourse.

678
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:21,226
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day and me being this world leader.

679
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:24,273
That'd be all she wrote.

680
01:28:24,357 --> 01:28:26,958
Torque wrench, please.

681
01:28:28,028 --> 01:28:29,862
Here.

682
01:28:29,946 --> 01:28:32,948
I wish I could've met my real dad.

683
01:28:33,033 --> 01:28:34,950
You will.

684
01:28:35,035 --> 01:28:37,119
Yeah, I guess.

685
01:28:37,203 --> 01:28:40,622
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

686
01:28:40,707 --> 01:28:44,126
They sent him back through time to 1984.

687
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,211
Man.

688
01:28:47,964 --> 01:28:50,758
He hasn't even been born yet.

689
01:28:52,135 --> 01:28:54,636
It messes with your head.

690
01:28:56,514 --> 01:28:59,641
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

691
01:29:05,982 --> 01:29:09,610
Mom and him were only together for one night.

692
01:29:09,694 --> 01:29:12,154
She still loves him, I guess.

693
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,074
I see her crying sometimes.

694
01:29:15,158 --> 01:29:19,828
She denies it totally, ofcourse,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

695
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:25,709
Why do you cry?

696
01:29:25,835 --> 01:29:28,253
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

697
01:29:28,338 --> 01:29:29,855
I don't know.

698
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:34,676
We just cry, you know, when it hurts.

699
01:29:40,683 --> 01:29:42,768
Pain causes it?

700
01:29:42,852 --> 01:29:45,729
Uh, no.
It's different.

701
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:48,732
It's when there's nothing wrong with you, but you hurt anyways.

702
01:29:48,817 --> 01:29:50,734
- You get it?
- No.

703
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,937
All right, my man!

704
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:55,447
No problemo.

705
01:29:55,532 --> 01:29:57,157
Give me five.

706
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,703
Just put out your hand like this.
Come on.

707
01:30:02,789 --> 01:30:06,875
All right! Now hit me. Give me five.
Do the same thing. Do the same thing.

708
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,046
All right--

709
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:16,116
Okay, that's good, that's good.
Um, up high, up high. Five low.

710
01:30:16,553 --> 01:30:18,478
Too slow.

711
01:30:21,224 --> 01:30:23,475
No. I'm just kidding.
Let's try it one more time.

712
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,769
Good. Now try it.
Good.

713
01:30:25,854 --> 01:30:28,021
Now do me.
Give me five.

714
01:30:29,149 --> 01:30:33,819
Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.

715
01:30:33,903 --> 01:30:36,697
The Terminator would never stop.

716
01:30:36,781 --> 01:30:40,826
It would never leave him and it would never hurt him,...

717
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:43,996
...never shout at him or get drunk and hit him...

718
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,999
...or say it was too busy to spend time with him.

719
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:50,002
It would always be there...

720
01:30:50,086 --> 01:30:52,754
...and it would die to protect him.

721
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:57,589
Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years,...

722
01:30:57,594 --> 01:31:02,014
...this thing, this machine was the only one who measured up.

723
01:31:02,098 --> 01:31:07,222
In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.

724
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:47,286
Hey, let's try this one.

725
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:52,165
Hey!

726
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:54,251
Here we go.

727
01:34:40,316 --> 01:34:42,859
She said you go south with him like you planned.

728
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:45,871
- She'll meet you tomorrow on the other side.
- Mom!

729
01:34:45,955 --> 01:34:48,073
Mom! Mom, wait!

730
01:35:03,214 --> 01:35:05,632
"No fate."

731
01:35:05,717 --> 01:35:08,719
No fate but what we make.

732
01:35:10,513 --> 01:35:12,597
My father told her this.

733
01:35:14,934 --> 01:35:19,438
I mean,
I made him memorize it in the future as a message to her.

734
01:35:20,773 --> 01:35:22,691
Never mind.

735
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:26,278
Now--
Okay, the whole thing goes-

736
01:35:26,362 --> 01:35:29,281
The future's not set.

737
01:35:29,365 --> 01:35:32,784
There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.

738
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:35,954
She intends to change the future.

739
01:35:36,038 --> 01:35:38,039
Yeah, I guess.

740
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:40,959
Oh, shit!

741
01:35:41,085 --> 01:35:43,003
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

742
01:35:43,087 --> 01:35:46,006
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

743
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:48,467
She's gonna blow him away!

744
01:35:48,551 --> 01:35:52,596
Come on! Let's go! Come on!
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

745
01:36:03,065 --> 01:36:06,318
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

746
01:36:06,402 --> 01:36:08,862
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.

747
01:36:08,946 --> 01:36:12,407
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

748
01:36:12,492 --> 01:36:14,993
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

749
01:36:15,077 --> 01:36:17,395
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.

750
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,032
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

751
01:36:21,037 --> 01:36:23,794
Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

752
01:36:26,672 --> 01:36:31,343
Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die,
but everybody's not like that.

753
01:36:31,427 --> 01:36:35,096
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

754
01:36:37,308 --> 01:36:40,894
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

755
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:21,560
Danny?
Danny, I told you to go to bed like your sister.

756
01:37:21,644 --> 01:37:24,062
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

757
01:37:40,997 --> 01:37:43,540
Danny, your time is up!

758
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:46,668
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

759
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:16,615
Danny!

760
01:38:27,043 --> 01:38:29,544
Daddy!

761
01:38:29,629 --> 01:38:32,172
Danny,just go! Go!
Danny, go!

762
01:38:33,716 --> 01:38:35,426
- Miles?
- Mom!

763
01:38:38,554 --> 01:38:41,431
- Miles?
- Run! Tarissa, run!

764
01:38:41,515 --> 01:38:43,683
Oh, my God!

765
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:53,068
Tarissa,just take Danny and go!
Just run! Run!

766
01:38:53,152 --> 01:38:54,903
Oh,Jesus! Miles!

767
01:39:11,003 --> 01:39:12,755
Aah!

768
01:39:13,839 --> 01:39:15,632
- Daddy!
- Danny!

769
01:39:15,758 --> 01:39:17,968
Danny!
Nobody fucking move!

770
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:21,638
- Don't hurt my daddy!
- Get down on the floor, bitch.

771
01:39:21,764 --> 01:39:23,932
- Get down now!
- Oh, God.

772
01:39:24,016 --> 01:39:25,850
Get out of the way!

773
01:39:25,935 --> 01:39:27,553
Don't hurt him!

774
01:39:28,437 --> 01:39:30,897
Get on the floor!
Fucking down now!

775
01:39:31,023 --> 01:39:33,024
Come on. Come on.

776
01:39:33,109 --> 01:39:35,694
Just-Just let the boy go.

777
01:39:35,778 --> 01:39:38,697
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up!

778
01:39:38,781 --> 01:39:41,444
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

779
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:43,702
- It's all your fault!
- What?

780
01:39:43,786 --> 01:39:46,121
I'm not gonna let you do it.

781
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:05,149
Shh.

782
01:40:37,548 --> 01:40:40,050
Shit! We're too late!

783
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:45,597
Check them.

784
01:40:45,681 --> 01:40:48,349
O-Oh, God.

785
01:40:48,434 --> 01:40:50,269
Look at me, Mom.

786
01:40:51,353 --> 01:40:52,905
Are you hurt?

787
01:40:53,689 --> 01:40:55,256
Look at me.

788
01:40:57,276 --> 01:40:58,577
I almost--

789
01:40:59,361 --> 01:41:00,980
I almost--

790
01:41:11,082 --> 01:41:13,249
It'll be okay, Mom.
It'll be okay.

791
01:41:13,334 --> 01:41:15,460
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

792
01:41:16,879 --> 01:41:18,588
I promise.

793
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:24,803
You came here to stop me.

794
01:41:24,887 --> 01:41:27,639
Yeah, I did.

795
01:41:30,101 --> 01:41:32,519
I love you,John.

796
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:36,356
I always have.

797
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:39,234
I know.

798
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:48,284
Deep penetration.

799
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:52,430
No shattered bone.
You hold here.

800
01:41:52,434 --> 01:41:54,749
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

801
01:42:05,678 --> 01:42:09,054
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

802
01:42:12,101 --> 01:42:16,312
Danny, I want you to come with me right now.
Okay? Show me your room.

803
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:32,035
Oh-- Oh, God! Oh!

804
01:42:44,133 --> 01:42:47,427
Oh, my God!

805
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:58,021
Oh, my God.

806
01:42:58,105 --> 01:43:01,116
Now listen to me very carefully.

807
01:43:02,902 --> 01:43:05,945
Nuclear winter effects caused massive cooling.

808
01:43:06,071 --> 01:43:10,658
Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.

809
01:43:10,743 --> 01:43:14,621
Skynet. Judgment Day.

810
01:43:14,705 --> 01:43:17,081
The history of things to come.

811
01:43:18,334 --> 01:43:24,088
It's not every day that you find out
you're responsible for three billion deaths.

812
01:43:24,173 --> 01:43:26,174
He took it pretty well.

813
01:43:27,843 --> 01:43:30,845
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

814
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:42,065
You're judging me on things I haven't even done yet.

815
01:43:45,527 --> 01:43:48,529
How were we supposed to know?

816
01:43:50,241 --> 01:43:53,326
Yeah. Right.

817
01:43:54,536 --> 01:43:57,747
How were you supposed to know?

818
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:01,542
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.

819
01:44:01,627 --> 01:44:06,172
Men like you thought it up.

820
01:44:09,385 --> 01:44:12,595
You think you're so creative.

821
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:16,057
You don't know what it's like to really create something,...

822
01:44:16,141 --> 01:44:19,870
...to create a life, to feel it growing inside you.

823
01:44:19,874 --> 01:44:23,731
- All you know how to create is death and destruction.
- Mom. Mom!

824
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:28,486
We need to be a little more constructive here.
Okay?

825
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:32,240
- We still have to stop this from happening, don't we?
- But I thought-

826
01:44:33,575 --> 01:44:37,495
Aren't we changing things, I mean right now,
changing the way it goes?

827
01:44:37,579 --> 01:44:42,583
That's right.
There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor. Not now.

828
01:44:42,587 --> 01:44:45,786
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

829
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:48,006
That's not good enough.

830
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:51,926
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

831
01:44:52,011 --> 01:44:56,306
All right, then, uh,
we have to destroy all the stuff at the lab...

832
01:44:56,390 --> 01:45:00,810
...the files, the disk drives, everything, everything here.

833
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:03,062
Everything.

834
01:45:03,147 --> 01:45:04,756
I don't care.

835
01:45:06,358 --> 01:45:08,659
The chip.
Do you know about the chip?

836
01:45:08,664 --> 01:45:11,378
- What chip?
- They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.

837
01:45:11,383 --> 01:45:14,699
- It must be from the other one like you.
- The C.P.U. from the first Terminator.

838
01:45:14,783 --> 01:45:17,201
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

839
01:45:17,286 --> 01:45:22,396
- They told us not to ask where they got it.
- Those lying motherfuckers.

840
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:24,492
It was scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

841
01:45:24,496 --> 01:45:29,212
I mean it was smashed, it didn't work but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

842
01:45:29,297 --> 01:45:31,299
I mean, things we would've never th--

843
01:45:33,302 --> 01:45:35,553
All my work was based on it.

844
01:45:35,637 --> 01:45:37,430
It must be destroyed.

845
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,058
Right.

846
01:45:40,062 --> 01:45:42,727
Can you get us in?
Past security?

847
01:45:42,811 --> 01:45:45,855
I think so, yeah. When?

848
01:45:48,959 --> 01:45:50,860
Now?

849
01:45:54,531 --> 01:45:57,658
The future, always so clear to me,...

850
01:45:57,743 --> 01:46:00,828
...had become like a black highway at night.

851
01:46:00,913 --> 01:46:03,581
We were in uncharted territory now,...

852
01:46:03,665 --> 01:46:06,667
...making up history as we went along.

853
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:43,287
Hi.

854
01:46:43,372 --> 01:46:46,916
Uh, Carl, right?

855
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,253
Uh, friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd--

856
01:46:50,379 --> 01:46:53,956
Hi. take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.

857
01:46:53,961 --> 01:46:59,385
Mr. Dyson, now you know the rules concerning visitors in the lab.
I need written authorization--

858
01:47:00,389 --> 01:47:02,432
I insist.

859
01:47:02,516 --> 01:47:04,267
Don't even think about it.

860
01:47:14,987 --> 01:47:16,905
Come on. It's okay.

861
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:21,459
It takes two keys to open the vault.
They have to be turned simultaneously.

862
01:47:21,463 --> 01:47:24,245
The other one is in a locker at the security station.

863
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:27,540
Gibbons?

864
01:47:30,002 --> 01:47:34,929
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

865
01:47:35,007 --> 01:47:36,883
Shit.

866
01:47:37,009 --> 01:47:38,602
Gibbons.

867
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:41,387
Oh, shit.

868
01:47:47,202 --> 01:47:48,603
Okay.

869
01:47:57,779 --> 01:48:00,990
My card should access this. I--

870
01:48:03,919 --> 01:48:05,495
What?

871
01:48:05,621 --> 01:48:07,538
- What is it?
- Damn it.

872
01:48:07,623 --> 01:48:09,624
The silent alarm's been tripped.

873
01:48:16,298 --> 01:48:19,217
It's neutralized all the codes in the entire building.

874
01:48:19,301 --> 01:48:21,319
Nothing will open anywhere now.

875
01:48:21,803 --> 01:48:23,721
We have to abort.

876
01:48:23,805 --> 01:48:25,806
No.

877
01:48:27,226 --> 01:48:30,561
We go all the way.
Okay?

878
01:48:30,646 --> 01:48:32,247
Okay.

879
01:48:32,731 --> 01:48:36,484
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

880
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:38,629
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is the guy!

881
01:48:38,633 --> 01:48:40,614
Yeah.
It's him and the woman.

882
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:45,826
Look just send everything you got in the area right now.

883
01:48:47,996 --> 01:48:51,999
I have a personal entry code for the lab.
It may still work.

884
01:48:55,069 --> 01:48:57,046
It's no good.

885
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:59,632
Let me try mine.

886
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:05,721
John, fire in the hole!

887
01:49:17,776 --> 01:49:22,572
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

888
01:49:29,705 --> 01:49:32,206
You have to wait a few minutes until the gas clears.

889
01:49:33,959 --> 01:49:35,960
Put this on.

890
01:49:49,641 --> 01:49:52,476
All right, let's get to work.

891
01:50:13,498 --> 01:50:16,917
[Female Dispatcher]
All units in the vicinity and all units able to respond,...

892
01:50:17,002 --> 01:50:21,672
...a 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.

893
01:50:21,757 --> 01:50:27,094
Suspect one is white female identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.

894
01:50:27,179 --> 01:50:30,014
Escaped last night from Pescadero State Hospital.

895
01:50:30,098 --> 01:50:32,341
Suspect one: White male-

896
01:50:35,854 --> 01:50:40,024
All the discs in my office,
all the discs in that office over there,...

897
01:50:40,108 --> 01:50:44,653
...everything behind my desk and all the processors on my left.

898
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:46,906
We'll blow those with the C-4.

899
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:02,713
Can I, um--

900
01:51:02,798 --> 01:51:04,399
Excuse me.

901
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:08,677
Can I borrow that thing?

902
01:51:17,229 --> 01:51:20,147
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

903
01:51:24,653 --> 01:51:26,737
1-Mary-3, give me that location again.

904
01:51:26,863 --> 01:51:31,742
[Female Dispatcher] 2111 Kramer.
Suspects are armed and considered extremely dangerous.

905
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:45,798
Sending the SWAT team.
Over.

906
01:52:24,254 --> 01:52:30,196
All right. 7-2-5-6.
Yes!

907
01:52:34,473 --> 01:52:36,474
Easy money.

908
01:52:40,645 --> 01:52:42,146
Uh-oh.

909
01:52:44,983 --> 01:52:48,486
Oh, shit. Not good.
Not good.

910
01:52:52,032 --> 01:52:53,949
How we doing?

911
01:52:54,034 --> 01:52:55,951
Primer cord is set.

912
01:52:56,036 --> 01:52:58,537
One more barrel, two more minutes.

913
01:52:59,838 --> 01:53:03,338
How do we, how do we set them off?

914
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,169
Remote control.

915
01:53:05,253 --> 01:53:07,129
Piece of cake.

916
01:53:07,255 --> 01:53:09,398
- We got company.
- Police?

917
01:53:09,402 --> 01:53:12,676
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

918
01:53:12,761 --> 01:53:15,262
Go. I'll finish here.

919
01:53:16,264 --> 01:53:17,799
Come on.

920
01:53:18,683 --> 01:53:22,271
- I'll take care of the police.
- Hey, wait! You swore!

921
01:53:24,689 --> 01:53:26,690
Trust me.

922
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:41,372
You at the window!

923
01:53:41,456 --> 01:53:45,233
Drop your weapons and place your hands on top of your head!

924
01:53:46,127 --> 01:53:48,003
Holy shit!

925
01:53:48,088 --> 01:53:51,131
That's a damn mini-gun!

926
01:54:11,778 --> 01:54:13,737
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

927
01:54:13,822 --> 01:54:15,823
Go! Go! Go! Go!

928
01:54:29,796 --> 01:54:31,839
Son of a bitch!

929
01:54:45,312 --> 01:54:47,563
Go, go! Go! Go!

930
01:55:03,371 --> 01:55:05,205
Fire!

931
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:23,932
Here we go.
Same time, to the left.

932
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:27,269
One, two, three, go.

933
01:55:38,448 --> 01:55:41,241
All right, now, in order to get that out you have to just--

934
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:52,586
We got Skynet by the balls now, don't we?
Come on, let's book.

935
01:55:53,672 --> 01:55:55,673
Hold your fire!

936
01:56:20,782 --> 01:56:23,283
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

937
01:56:25,870 --> 01:56:29,081
Time to go. Now.

938
01:56:29,207 --> 01:56:32,334
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

939
01:56:32,419 --> 01:56:35,504
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

940
01:57:00,029 --> 01:57:02,531
Mom! Mom!

941
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:49,069
Shit!

942
01:57:49,074 --> 01:57:51,756
Shit!
She's in the corner, and there's no way outta there.

943
01:58:01,757 --> 01:58:03,283
Get down!

944
01:58:10,508 --> 01:58:12,109
Here.

945
01:58:37,252 --> 01:58:40,712
I don't know how much longer I can hold this.

946
01:58:44,509 --> 01:58:46,426
Fall back!

947
01:58:46,511 --> 01:58:50,399
Everybody out! Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

948
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:27,567
We got a war zone down here!

949
01:59:59,375 --> 02:00:01,376
Shut your eyes.

950
02:00:07,842 --> 02:00:10,844
Stay here. I'll be back.

951
02:00:18,686 --> 02:00:21,021
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

952
02:00:23,733 --> 02:00:26,360
Get onto the floor now!

953
02:00:27,654 --> 02:00:29,655
Okay, drop him!

954
02:00:49,342 --> 02:00:52,052
Aah!

955
02:01:07,902 --> 02:01:10,912
Aah!
God, it hurts!

956
02:01:27,922 --> 02:01:30,132
- Take him out!
- Move out! Move out!

957
02:01:49,027 --> 02:01:50,736
Here, hold this.

958
02:02:03,082 --> 02:02:05,083
Give me a hand!

959
02:02:07,253 --> 02:02:08,837
Holy shit!

960
02:02:23,852 --> 02:02:25,353
Go!

961
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:05,294
Shit!

962
02:03:18,032 --> 02:03:19,633
Get out.

963
02:03:38,544 --> 02:03:43,398
Listen, no matter what happens, you stay under these vests.

964
02:03:43,404 --> 02:03:46,552
- You got it? All right.
- Yeah.

965
02:04:00,575 --> 02:04:02,993
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

966
02:05:00,801 --> 02:05:02,344
Shit!

967
02:05:04,388 --> 02:05:06,806
John! Stay down!

968
02:05:31,707 --> 02:05:33,833
Mom!

969
02:06:13,374 --> 02:06:15,075
Hello?

970
02:06:21,215 --> 02:06:23,908
Aw, damn! You all right?

971
02:06:29,765 --> 02:06:32,934
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

972
02:06:35,396 --> 02:06:38,148
- Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

973
02:06:40,276 --> 02:06:43,111
Are you hurt?

974
02:06:54,373 --> 02:06:58,159
Holy shit. Come on, Mom.
Come on. Come on!

975
02:06:58,164 --> 02:07:00,754
- We need your truck.
- Hurry! Come on.

976
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,561
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

977
02:07:09,263 --> 02:07:12,474
Come on! Go!

978
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:20,482
What the hell--

979
02:07:26,364 --> 02:07:29,115
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

980
02:07:30,409 --> 02:07:32,452
Here. This'll work.

981
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:39,709
He's gaining.

982
02:07:42,296 --> 02:07:44,815
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

983
02:07:44,819 --> 02:07:47,359
I can get out and run faster than this!

984
02:07:57,686 --> 02:07:59,713
He's coming up, to the right.

985
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:02,749
Watch it! Watch it!

986
02:08:25,714 --> 02:08:27,841
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

987
02:08:34,931 --> 02:08:36,824
Take the off-ramp.

988
02:08:46,902 --> 02:08:48,446
Shit!

989
02:08:52,166 --> 02:08:53,667
Hold on!

990
02:09:38,162 --> 02:09:39,787
Don't stop!

991
02:09:47,630 --> 02:09:49,305
Go straight!

992
02:09:51,675 --> 02:09:53,968
- Look out!
- Duck!

993
02:10:07,608 --> 02:10:10,026
Get the hell outta here!

994
02:10:15,366 --> 02:10:17,242
Get outta here!
Let's go!

995
02:10:17,368 --> 02:10:19,119
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!

996
02:11:35,696 --> 02:11:38,197
Hasta la vista, baby.

997
02:12:27,665 --> 02:12:30,166
We don't have much time.

998
02:12:51,522 --> 02:12:53,439
Let's go.

999
02:12:53,524 --> 02:12:58,185
Come on! Come on!
We gotta get outta here! Come on! Get up!

1000
02:13:11,583 --> 02:13:13,292
Hand me the shotgun.

1001
02:13:18,132 --> 02:13:20,183
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1002
02:13:20,467 --> 02:13:22,136
Hurry!

1003
02:13:26,682 --> 02:13:28,307
Come on, Mom.

1004
02:13:33,814 --> 02:13:38,107
Come on, Mom! Get up! Get up! Come on!

1005
02:14:07,681 --> 02:14:09,599
This way. Come on.
This way.

1006
02:14:28,827 --> 02:14:30,995
All right.

1007
02:14:36,626 --> 02:14:38,336
No! Wait!

1008
02:14:38,629 --> 02:14:42,548
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back. Go back.

1009
02:14:50,166 --> 02:14:52,617
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1010
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:55,202
- John.
- John, you've got to go now.

1011
02:14:55,207 --> 02:14:57,413
- John!
- Go! Now!

1012
02:14:57,417 --> 02:14:58,856
No!

1013
02:16:11,722 --> 02:16:13,890
Gotta get up the steps.

1014
02:16:15,684 --> 02:16:17,685
Go on.

1015
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,481
Get up.
Get up.

1016
02:16:22,566 --> 02:16:25,401
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on up.

1017
02:16:50,201 --> 02:16:51,644
No.

1018
02:16:59,686 --> 02:17:02,855
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1019
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:06,275
Grab it. Go. Go!

1020
02:17:16,662 --> 02:17:21,914
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom! Come on!

1021
02:17:22,209 --> 02:17:27,152
Mom! Mom, come on! Mom!

1022
02:18:08,922 --> 02:18:10,923
Call to John.

1023
02:18:12,009 --> 02:18:13,634
No.

1024
02:18:13,719 --> 02:18:15,553
I know this hurts.

1025
02:18:17,389 --> 02:18:19,015
Call John.

1026
02:18:35,449 --> 02:18:38,117
Call to John now.

1027
02:18:39,953 --> 02:18:41,996
Fuckyou.

1028
02:21:53,313 --> 02:21:58,067
John!
Hey! John?

1029
02:21:58,151 --> 02:22:00,269
John? Help!

1030
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:04,531
John.

1031
02:22:08,118 --> 02:22:09,912
John?

1032
02:22:11,831 --> 02:22:17,005
John. John.

1033
02:22:18,506 --> 02:22:20,006
John.

1034
02:22:21,633 --> 02:22:23,517
- Mom.
- Help me.

1035
02:22:24,594 --> 02:22:26,595
Help me.

1036
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:30,766
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

1037
02:22:31,768 --> 02:22:35,144
- John. John.
- Shoot!

1038
02:23:18,398 --> 02:23:19,899
Mom!

1039
02:23:30,035 --> 02:23:32,053
Get down!

1040
02:25:05,588 --> 02:25:08,090
Get up. Come on.

1041
02:25:09,676 --> 02:25:11,969
Holy shit.

1042
02:25:12,053 --> 02:25:14,179
I need a vacation.

1043
02:25:27,735 --> 02:25:29,945
Is it dead?

1044
02:25:30,029 --> 02:25:32,030
Terminated.

1045
02:25:35,451 --> 02:25:37,202
Will this melt in there?

1046
02:25:39,873 --> 02:25:42,240
Yes. Throw it in.

1047
02:25:46,754 --> 02:25:48,347
Adios.

1048
02:25:49,132 --> 02:25:51,133
And the chip.

1049
02:26:05,899 --> 02:26:07,816
It's over.

1050
02:26:10,069 --> 02:26:12,070
No.

1051
02:26:14,324 --> 02:26:16,325
There's one more chip.

1052
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:23,290
And it must be destroyed also.

1053
02:26:28,504 --> 02:26:30,422
Here.

1054
02:26:30,506 --> 02:26:35,010
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1055
02:26:40,058 --> 02:26:43,810
No. No.

1056
02:26:46,606 --> 02:26:49,524
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

1057
02:26:49,609 --> 02:26:52,736
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us. It'll be okay.

1058
02:26:52,862 --> 02:26:56,531
I have to go away. No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1059
02:26:56,616 --> 02:26:59,034
- I must go away, John.
- No!

1060
02:26:59,118 --> 02:27:01,203
No, wait.

1061
02:27:01,329 --> 02:27:04,206
- Wait. You don't have to do this.
- Sorry.

1062
02:27:05,291 --> 02:27:07,417
No, don't do it!
Don't go!

1063
02:27:07,502 --> 02:27:09,461
It has to end here.

1064
02:27:10,505 --> 02:27:13,924
I order you not to go.
I order you not to go.

1065
02:27:14,008 --> 02:27:16,385
I order you not to go!

1066
02:27:21,808 --> 02:27:23,976
I know now why you cry.

1067
02:27:26,312 --> 02:27:29,314
But it's something I can never do.

1068
02:28:03,141 --> 02:28:05,350
Good-bye.

1069
02:29:44,575 --> 02:29:48,829
August 29, 1997, came and went.

1070
02:29:48,913 --> 02:29:53,250
Nothing much happened.
Michael Jackson turned 40.

1071
02:29:53,334 --> 02:29:55,619
There was no Judgment Day.

1072
02:29:55,623 --> 02:29:59,172
People went to work as they always do.

1073
02:29:59,257 --> 02:30:04,678
Laughed, complained, watched TV, made love.

1074
02:30:04,762 --> 02:30:07,021
I wanted to run through the street yelling,...

1075
02:30:07,026 --> 02:30:12,302
...to grab them all and say,
"Every day from this day on is a gift.

1076
02:30:12,306 --> 02:30:14,479
Use it well."

1077
02:30:14,564 --> 02:30:19,965
Instead, I got drunk.
That was 30 years ago.

1078
02:30:20,027 --> 02:30:24,489
But the dark future which never came still exists for me.

1079
02:30:24,574 --> 02:30:28,285
And it always will, like the traces of a dream.

1080
02:30:30,621 --> 02:30:34,499
John fights the war differently than it was foretold.

1081
02:30:34,584 --> 02:30:37,519
Here, on the battlefield of the Senate,...

1082
02:30:37,523 --> 02:30:43,049
...his weapons are common sense and hope.

1083
02:30:44,135 --> 02:30:46,261
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

1084
02:30:53,519 --> 02:30:56,613
- How's that?
- Thank you, Grandma.

1085
02:31:00,067 --> 02:31:04,946
The luxury of hope was given to me by the Terminator.

1086
02:31:06,157 --> 02:31:11,077
Because if a machine can learn the value of human life,...

1087
02:31:12,083 --> 02:31:14,022
...maybe we can too.
