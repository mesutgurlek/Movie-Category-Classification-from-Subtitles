00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,590
[Man narrating] Centuries ago,
during the dawn of the red moon,

2
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,673
our peaceful hamlet
was terrorised by a beast...

3
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,952
... born not of man, but spewed forth

4
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,079
- from the fieriest pits of Hades...
- [women grunting]

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,314
... with an evil fuelled by
a hatred of men and a love of women.

6
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,270
Its name: Carmilla, the vampire queen.

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,398
No one could defeat her, save one man:

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,839
A baron away for decades
fighting in the Crusades.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,310
Upon his return, the baron found
that Carmilla's desires

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,438
had ensnared his beautiful wife, Eva,

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,160
and turned her into a lover
of the vagine.

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,117
No!

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,591
Consumed with vengeance,
the baron pledged to destroy Carmilla

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,433
and flee the village.

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,955
He unearthed the sacred
Books of Nekros,

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,554
where he discovered
the only way of slaying

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,918
this unholy harpy, once and for all,
was to forge a sacred sword,

18
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,198
a weapon blessed with
an ancient Babylonian hex...

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,352
...and infused with his own blood.
- [Groans]

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,513
[Man] Without fear,
he confronted Carmilla.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,432
[Cries out]

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,149
But before the baron
could strike the fatal blow,

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,551
Carmilla laid down a curse most vile.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,678
As you strike me down,
so you shall release evil

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,957
within me into your daughters
and your daughters' daughters,

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,908
and they shall not rest
until your bloodline's ended.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,595
They will know your breed
by these marks above your heart.

28
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,718
And when the life's blood
of the last of your line

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,916
mixes with that of a virgin girl,

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,916
I shall rise again, more powerful
than you will ever imagine.

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,674
[Man] And with that,
he lopped her fucking head off.

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,149
Henceforth,
every woman in our village,

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,551
upon her 18th birthday,
is turned by the curse

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,553
and reborn a lesbian vampire.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,917
Our only salvation is a prophecy
that foretells of the day

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,594
when the last descendent
of the baron's bloodline

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,150
shall return to this hamlet and vanquish
Carmilla's curse forever.

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,668
That time... has begun.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,789
- I'm not happy, Jimmy.
- Why? What did I do wrong?

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,838
Things are different now
to how they used to be.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,310
I just don't love you anymore.
No, I love you.

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,836
- I'm just not in love with you.
- [Neighbours crying out in passion]

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,959
- You know I'll always love you.
- You say that every time you dump me.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,998
I don't dump you, Jimmy.
I just take time out

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,833
to re-evaluate the parameters
of our relationship.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,551
That's what makes us so strong together.

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,837
If we're that strong together,
why are you dumping me... again?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,834
I'm not dumping you. I just think
we're stronger together apart.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,195
That doesn't make
grammatical sense, so...

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,478
Feel it with your heart,
and know what I'm saying is true.

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,872
- So... you are dumping me?
- No.

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,679
But, also in a sense, yes.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,911
- [Neighbour woman] Yes!
- Shit.

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,152
I'm not happy, Fletch.

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,356
[Fletch] I'm trying my best, Miss Rossi.

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,192
Your bestjust isn't good enough.

57
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,114
- What more do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,430
- This has to be the end of the line.
- What?

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,592
- What did I do wrong?
- You punched him in the face.

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,355
You know what I get like when people
mess with my shit. He had it coming.

61
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,988
He was seven.
You're a children's clown.

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,879
Old enough to know
not to go messing with my shit.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,439
Fletch, you punched a child.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,995
He was spraying me
with my own seltzer bottle.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,879
- What was I supposed to do?
- Not hit him.

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,476
Then he shouldn't be spraying
my ball sac. It was only a tap.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,030
- You gave him a bloody nose!
- I look like I pissed myself!

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,034
Christ, Fletch. I don't know
why you do these things.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,272
I guess I just don't like kids.

70
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,512
I keep telling you,
they're a pre-requisite of the job.

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,194
I know. A slight problem.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,509
Maybe I could just be
a clown for adults.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,279
- You're fired.
- Do I get to keep the costume?

74
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,149
No. Drop your costume at the desk
on the way out. Goodbye, Fletch.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,909
- Do I get this week's money?
- Goodbye, Fletch.

I've come up with a plan
for getting her back.

00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,799
What, like revenge?

91
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,430
No, getting her back, not
"getting her back" getting her back.

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,513
Getting her back.
Number one: Take her on holiday.

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,955
Stop there.
That's just fucking stupid.

94

- The two of us, on our own...
- On your own?

95
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,191

and she dumped you and banged that

water ski instructor
with highlights and necklace?

97
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,638
She didn't dump me.
She told me she was just... confused.

98
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
Not that confused she couldn't
figure out where to put his cock.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,911
- That's my bird you're talking about.
- No. No, it isn't. Not anymore.

100
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,030
Look, you need to get away
from all this shit.

101

Let us have a wacky adventure,
you and me.

102

I'm not gonna bum you, but I think
you could use a distraction.

103
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,590
Say what you like, but you cannot
deny I am incredibly distracting.

104

- Some might say annoying.
- And that... [sniffs]

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,640
I don't know.
Where do you suggest we go?

106
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,990
[Whispers] lbiza. [blows]

107
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,875
The sun, the sea, the sand,
clubs and fanny.

108
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,398
Lots and lots of fanny.
Loads and loads of fanny.

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,791
A gargantuan amount of "vajay".

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,952
All wanting to shag you, Jimmy McLaren,

111
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,716
and if there's a few stragglers
who fancy a go on me, then so be it.

112
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,959
I can't. I'm skint.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,680
What? I thought
you had loads saved up.

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,876
Yeah... I lent it to Judy to buy a car.

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,352
Oh, my God! Why don't you just get
"total twat" tattooed on your forehead?

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,239
Can't you see what that witch
has done to our lives?

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,518
Relied on that money for my holiday.
Our holiday, I mean.

118
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,911
- How much have you got?
- Um...

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,911
Uh, well...

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,594
Tricky, because
I've sort of been sacked.

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,557
- You hit another girl?
- It was a boy.

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,199
I don't want to talk about it.

123
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,831
So what we're essentially saying is that
neither of us can afford to go anywhere.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,228
- Pretty much.
- Brilliant.

125
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,073
Uh, hello. Wasn't expecting you.

126
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,913
- I've finally done it!
- Done what?

127
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,914
Get the "champers" on ice.
I'm all yours, honey.

- I'm his girlfriend.

- Really? I'm his wife.

135
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,194
[Exhales] Right.

00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,911
- Dave, get back here!

137
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,594
- I never meant for you to find out.
- [Slapping sound]

138
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,474
- I got a plan.
- Does it involve girls?

139
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,996
- It's cheap.
- Yeah. Does it involve girls?

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,596
Let's... go... hiking.

141
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,350
That... is one of the most
depressingly shitty

- It's a great idea.
- You're a penis!

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,317
Wherever it lands on the map,
we go there.

145
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,436
Leave it to the hands of fate.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,794
- What do you say?
- No.

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,155
- It'll be brilliant.
- It will be shit.

148
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,038
Let the dart show us the way.

149
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,358
All right, then. Fuck it.

150
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,717
I'm only agreeing because
I'm feeling for you right now,

151

[Gasps] Quickly!

459
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,038
- Trudi! We've got to get in there!
- [Objects shattering]

460
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,350
OK. Stand back.

461
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,313
Christ. That thing is rock-solid.

462
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,235
- I must have weakened it.
- Yeah, right.

463
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,392
- Look.
- Blood.

464
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,352
[Woman] Come.

465
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,157
What was that?

466
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,153
I don't know, but let's go find out.

467
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,038
- Is she serious?
- We have to do something, don't we?

468
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,795
This is all getting a bit weird: Women
missing, towels covered in blood.

469
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,952
- It's more of a light spotting.
- Oh, that's all right, then.

470
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,554
We heard her in here,
and now she's nowhere.

471
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,190
- That is very fucking weird.
- Agreed, but we have to find Trudi.

472
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,635
- You like Trudi, don't you?
- Not that much.

473
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,071
That's just weak, man.

474
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,832
For Christ's sake.

For God's sake!

478
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,071
I only got it seen to last week.

479
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,390
Oh, my... Oh, come on!

Shit! [exclaiming]

481

[Jimmy] Hi. You're through to Jimmy.
Please leave a message.

Heidi? Trudi?

487
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,550
- Anything?
- No.

488
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,148
Ah, well. Looks like she's gone.

489
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,997
Head back inside, eh? Cup of tea?

490
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,434
- Told you there was no one out here.
- Trudi?

491
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,354
Probably just gone for a walk
or... something.

492
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,829
Let's head inside.
I've still got some beers.

493

- Oh, shit!

- It's over there.
- I heard it too.

496
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,518
Look. I know something really wrong
is happening here,

497
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,149
but is there any chance
we can just ignore it?

498
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,436
[Jimmy] Fletch! Come on!

Nothing, no?

Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed.

I'm just glad she's dead.
I can hold out for fireworks.

Ja.

526
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,829
I think they want you to say something.

- Never.

That might be the coolest thing
I've done in my entire fucking life.

Stakes. Lots of sharp stakes.

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,514
Arm ourselves with anything we can
plunge through their hearts.

553
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,318
Again, great idea. Like it.

554
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,519

- How ridiculous.
- No.

565
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,752
Just another of God's cruel tricks
to get on my tits.

566
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,469
Even dead women would sooner sleep
with each other than get with me.

- Lesbian vampires?

Next time he'll have me bummed
by a big gay werewolf, I swear.

Come on. We need to lie down.

570
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,476
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's Jimmy's ex.

571
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,279
She keeps breaking up with him,
getting him back,

572
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,034
breaking up with him,
getting him back, you know?

- Me too.

I've been saving myself

someone I can really have feelings for.

577

- What, you like Jimmy?

578
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,389
Yes, I do.
But between her and the vampires,

579
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,028
I'll probably die a virgin tonight.

Jimmy, I know you have
every right to hate me,

that I'm so happy
you let me through the door.

Well, not completely.

I keep doing you don't like.

It's not you, Jimmy. It's me.

have to show me you're different.

You know what they say
about extreme situations.

614
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,999
And this, as I keep pointing out, my
friend, is an extreme fucking situation.

615
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,197
- Bit seedy, isn't it?
- She's worried she'll die a virgin,

616
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,352
and frankly, I'm willing to take
any opportunity I can get.

617
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,398
Emotional vulnerability, fear of
imminent death, vampire attacks.

618
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,552
- Screw it. I don't give a shit. Hi.
- [Footsteps approaching]

619
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,353
How are you doing?

620
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,910
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Um...

621
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,073
[clears throat] As I suspected,

622
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,233
- Judy was a vampire.
- We killed her.

623
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,231
Fantastic.

624
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,874
- Um, I'm going for a piss.
- What, outside?

625
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,315
Do I look like a twat?

626
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,112
- [Snarling]
- [Gasping]

627
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,395
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, gosh!

628
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,152
Oh, God! Oh, God!

629
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,595
Why aren't they coming in?
Judy walked in.

630
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,752
No, they have to be invited in.
You invited Judy in.

631
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,956
Oh.

632
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,392
So all we have to do
is sit tight till morning.

633
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,676
I mean, It's not like I'm gonna say,

634
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,515
"Hey, lesbian vampires,
come into my cottage", is it? Oh, shit!

635
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,591
Under full-on lesbian vampire attack?

636
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,479
Still got it, fella.

637
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,672
Look, I was being ironic.

638
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,070
Guys?

639
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,830
[Hisses]

640
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,831
McLaren.

641
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,673
- She knows my name.
- That's not a good sign.

642
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,436
[Sniffs] She is pure.

643
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,516
- [Screams]
- Fletch!

644
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,680
When in Rome...

645
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,109
[voices whispering]

646
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,953
- Get away from him.
- Fuck off!

647
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,675
[Zipper unzips]

648
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,713
- [Groaning]
- [Snarling]

649
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,991
[Screeches]

650
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,675
- Nice.
- Get her into the shower.

651
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,479
Quick! Quick!

652
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,232
- [Screams]
- Quick! Turn it on!

653
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,389
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

654
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,120
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...

655
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,193
Give us this day... Push her back!
She must stay underwater.

656
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,954
Push her back!
Push her back under.

657
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,398
- Oh, God!
- Keep her under! Don't let her go!

658
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,519
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,

659
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,274
as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

660
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
- Fuck off!
- Keep going.

661
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,153
Fucking hell! [shouting]

662
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,675
For Thine is the kingdom.
Jesus compels you!

663
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,832
Oh, God, I love Jesus!
I love you, Jesus.

664
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,437
- And the glory forever.
- All things bright and beautiful!

665
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,795
- Forever and ever.
- [Screaming]

666
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,358
Amen.

667
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,794
[Shouting] What the fuck?

668
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,952
We need to go quickly.
Your friends have already been taken.

669
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,509
- Ah, shite.
- There's no time to waste. Let's go!

670
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,433
Hang on. How did you know
all this was happening?

671
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,989
You and your friends
were sent as sacrifices.

672
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,073
It's an age-old deal,
where the villagers supply fresh blood.

673
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,879
In return, they get to keep
their cowardly hides.

674
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,828
So we were just a light buffet
for a bunch of hot dykes?

675
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,152
To my shame, yes. Your friend's
arrival in our hamlet is no coincidence.

676
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,551
It's divine intervention
fulfilling a primordial prophecy.

677
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,712
- Balls!
- Does he bear a birthmark?

678
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,269
- Five red scratches around here?
- Yeah.

679
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,318
His bloodline is the key
to the resurrection

680
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,917
of the purest evil known to mankind:
Carmilla, the vampire queen.

681
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,798
Eh?

682
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,428
Paradoxically, the only thing
that can lift this village

683
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,114
from a centuries-old curse
that turns every woman

684
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,192
on her 18th birthday into a vampire.

685
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,319
My daughter, Rebecca,
becomes 18 within hours.

686
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,472
Right. Look,
I know you mean well. I really do.

687
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,154
And I love the vibe.
You look amazing. But...

688
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,235
I've seen weird shit, and even under
these circumstances this is a stretch.

689
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,358
Jimmy's not the Messiah.
He can barely wipe his own arse.

690
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,671
I understand your confusion.
Let's be on our way.

691
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Daddy-o. Go where?

692
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,791
- Back to the village. No time to waste.
- Fuck that noise.

693
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,190
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not going back out there.

694
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,955
I've nearly been eaten three times
by the hottest women I've ever met.

695
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,792
Starting to become a bind.

696
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,873
But it's not too late to save your
friends, this village, the entire world!

697
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,429
Yeah, well, you know,
best of luck with it.

698
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,479
- I hope you get on all right.
- Are you fucking with me?

699
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,837
- Are you allowed to swear?
- Shut up.

700
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,709
You telling me you'd let eternal
darkness sweep over this entire planet

701
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,678
and leave your friends to die?
Your friends?

702
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,116
Well, I only really know Jimmy.
I just met the girl tonight. So...

703
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,159
OK. Stay here and die.

704
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,398
Oh...

705
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,871
What's with all the scratches?

706
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,110
The cruciform.
It drives the beasts away.

707
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,952
- It looks shit.
- Just get in.

708
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,669
OK, scratch master.
Where the fuck are we going?

709
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,035
The tomb of your friend's
great ancestor.

710
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,313
Fletch!

711
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,629
[Voice echoing] Sisters,

712
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,794
a moment that has infested
our dreams and our desires

713
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,157
for what seems like an eternity...

714
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,676
...is finally upon us.

715
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,597
[Moans]

716
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,074
For this night,

717
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,791
the last of the McLaren clan shall fall,

718
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,397
and our queen shall rise again.

719
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,916
- Carmilla?
- The vampire queen?

720
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,155
- [Grunts]
- Sorry. Carry on.

721
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,357
So his blood mixed with
my virgin blood brings her back?

722
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,954
You know a lot, pretty one.

723
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,351
I've heard of Carmilla,
but never have I heard of you.

724
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,637
Obviously you're not evil enough
to even make the history books.

725
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,791
[Gasps]

726
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,076
Well...

727
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,711
[sniffs]... soon she will know of you.

728
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,633
And with her resurrection,
this land will be ensnared forever

729
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,315
in the dawn of the red moon.

730
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,474
[Mouthing]

731
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,269
McLaren, these are your
final moments on earth.

732
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,670
Oh. Mmm.

733
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,799
[Vampires moaning]

734
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,878
The final resting place
of Baron Wolfgang McLaren III.

735
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,677
Jimmy's the reason
I ended up in this shit-hole?

736
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,910
He is our salvation and our only hope.

737
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,629
The prophesy foretold of when the last
of the McLaren clan would return.

738
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,917
With his blood and that of a virgin,
Carmilla shall rise again.

739
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,196
Concealed within this tomb is the weapon

740
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,033
that can slay the beast forever:
The sword of Daeldo.

741
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,590
- And what's that, then?
- Daeldo, the god of lust,

742
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,036
said to be Carmilla's arch demonic foe
in the underworld of Hades.

743
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,918
A hideous multi-tentacled beast.

744
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,799
The only being brave enough
to have tried to penetrate

745
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,838
Carmilla's vilest depths,
and paid for it with his life.

746
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,389
Let me get this straight.
Your plan is,

747
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,439
wait for this bitch to be resurrected,
stake her with the sword of whatever,

748
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,797
thus rescuing my mate, curing
your daughter, ending the curse

749
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,793
- and saving the planet.
- Exactly. So, are you with me?

750
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,713
Not really. I ain't got much
fucking choice, have I?

751
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,598
- [Bell tolls]
- [Gasps]

752
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,399
You do this.
I need to check on my Rebecca.

753
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,596
What? Now I've got to unearth a corpse?

754
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,355
- Concealed within this tomb is...
- Yeah, yeah. Save me the monologues.

755
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,511
This is officially
the worst holiday ever.

756
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,069
[Grunts]

757
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,279
- So there's a red moon, right?
- Forget about the red moon.

758
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,556
She said the last McLaren will fall.

759
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,632
Yeah, I kind of missed that bit.

760
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,519
Oh. Well...

761
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,150
- That'll be me, then. Oh, bollocks.
- Shut up. I'm thinking.

762
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,073
What can you be thinking about
at a time like this?

763
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,549
- How we are going to escape.
- Fantastic. Any ideas?

764
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,075
- No, have you?
- Not a fucking sausage.

765
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,673
Come on, think!

766
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,355

00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,631
It's our first argument.

00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,597
Vic, we're doomed.
That ain't opening.

- Excuse me?

- There's no time to waste. Hurry up.
- Well, you go down, then.

Oh, my... Unbelievable.
It's not my daughter.

- Give me a minute, please.

00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,118
It's nothing.

- What's so funny in there?
- [Laughing continues]

785
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,194
It's got a big metal cock for a handle.

786
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,989
Grow up! The handle draws on
the power of the demon Daeldo,

787
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,948
rendering this blade alone capable
of destroying her once and for all.

- What? How?
- Itjust does, OK?

We're gonna go there,
and we're gonna to die, right?

00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,595
All because you insist some sword,

791
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,433
with a metal cock on the end,
can save the world?

- You're a disgrace.
- At least I can see the funny side.

Let's get on with the job. I'll load up
on weapons. You cover the baron up.

it does look like a cock?

- Jimmy, can I tell you something?

796
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,318
- Have you come up with a plan?
- No, I'm still thinking.

797
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,755
I think we're running out of time.

798
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,556
I just wanted to say that had we met
under different circumstances,

799

I would've liked to have gotten
to know you.

- Really?
- Yes.

801
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,395
In fact, even though we've just spent
a few hours together,

802
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,755
I feel like I've known you forever.

- Really?
- Yes.

804

I thought you might have
picked up on my signals.

What did I miss?

- I can't die without letting you know

00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,672
you're the first man I could
share myself with completely.

810
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,832
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I would've given you everything:

00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,798
My mind, soul and body.

812
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,635

- And now that'll never be.

In there. The crypt of Carmilla.

- "Scullery" is quite scary.
- Eh?

"Scullery" has got
the word "skull" in it.

As opposed to the crypt, which has
got corpses in it. Well observed.
