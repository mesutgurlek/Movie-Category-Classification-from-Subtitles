Let me rephrase that.

5
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,581
It's a matter of limitation.

6
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,751
And the importance
of knowing yours.

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,501
Your boss, Tama.
He had a reputation, yes.

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,790
But he also knew where he stood,
understood how high he should climb.

it's really more of a "one

me in, lock me up?

New prices?

Come on, Reza.

02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:46,064
Just think of it as
a probation period.

How much did Goto pay you?

1146
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:52,746
That's not a smart question to ask.

1147
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,870
Oh, yeah, and why's that?

1148
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:59,422
Because I'm meeting you, not him.

If it keeps me here after
dinner, then it's enough. Hm?

He escaped from the car.

1157
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:34,030
Put the word out.

1158
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,660
Whoever finds him will be...

1159
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,310
He's here.

1160

He's coming up.

1161
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,310

- Yes, boss.

1162

Everything okay?
