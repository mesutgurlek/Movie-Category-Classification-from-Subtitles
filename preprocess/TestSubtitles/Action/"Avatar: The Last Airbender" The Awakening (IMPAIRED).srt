Commander, why are you
off course?

All western fleet ships
are supposed to be moving

the occupation.

Actually, we're from
the eastern fleet.

to deliver some cargo.

Ah, eastern fleet.

173

Well, nice of admiral chan
to let us know he was sending
one of his ships our way.

00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,846
I'm sure admiral chan
meant no disrespect, sir.

175
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,383

to write a quick note
and send a hawk our way?

Next time, we'll send two hawks,
to be sure you get the message.

Just stay quiet until
we're safely across the ramp.

Then we'll sink this ship.

turn to shame and foolishness.

324
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:28,560
But you said yourself,
that was impossible.

325
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:34,633
Sleep well, "zuzu."

326
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:45,411
[Screaming]

327
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:56,588
[Gasping]

328
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,924
I'm not gonna make it.

329
00:20:59,025 --> 00:20:59,825
I failed.

330
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:00,959
[Thunder]

331
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,595
Roku?

332
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,597
You haven't failed, aang.

333
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,233
But everyone thinks
i'm dead again.

334
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:13,005
They think i've abandoned them,
and i'm losing this war.

335
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:14,973
I'm letting
the whole world down.

336
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:20,212
Roku: if anyone is to blame
for the state of the world,
it is me.

337
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,449
I should've seen
this war coming,
and prevented it.

338
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,654
You inherited my problems
and my mistakes

339
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:34,026
But i believe you are destined
to redeem me,
and save the world.

340
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,528
I don't know.

341
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:41,767
Woman: you already saved
the world.

342
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,635
And you'll save the world again.

343
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:48,707
But you can't give up.

344
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,977
You're right.

345
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:58,050
I won't give up.

346
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:37,556
[Chirping]

347
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:42,261
[Groaning]

348
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:48,334
You're ok.

349
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,404
[Growling]

350
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:56,141
I have so much to do.

351
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,310
I know,
but you'll have our help.

352
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,945
You didn't think
you could get out of training

353
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,947
Just by coming to
the fire nation, did you?

354
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,917
What about the invasion?

355
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:08,987
We'll join up with my dad
and the invasion force on
the day of the eclipse.

356
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,156
Hey, what's...?

357
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,094
Oh, it's your glider.

358
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,295
That's ok.

359
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:21,367
If someone saw it,
it would give away my identity.

360
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:27,439
It's better for now
that no one knows i'm alive.
