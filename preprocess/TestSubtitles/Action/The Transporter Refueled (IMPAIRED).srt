00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,152
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

167
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,301
Thirty-odd years working as a rep
for a water company,

168
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,712
and you always seem to find yourself
in the most dangerous places,

169
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:07,621
the most defining moments.

170
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:10,498
Fall of the Berlin Wall,
collapse of the Medellin cartel,

171
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:12,392
- and the Taliban...
- Hmm.

172
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,832
...don't forget the Taliban.

173
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,832
I bet they like Evian in Fallujah.

174
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,832
Well, they don't really care
for sparkling water.

175
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,172
They do prefer the flat.

176
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:20,857
Okay, Dad.

177
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,312
Junior, I don't think you have
one ounce of wiggle room

178
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,574
to moralize to me about
how I earn my living.

179
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,552
- And what you mean by that?
- Oh, nothing.

180
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:30,982
I'm sure all your clients are movie
stars, captains of industry, dignitaries.

181
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:32,658
I don't ask, they don't tell.

182
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:33,978
That should tell you something.

183
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:35,663
(VIBRATING)

184
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,901
Oh, look, um, Miss Unknown
is calling again.

185
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:41,174
And what would make you think
that "Unknown" is a Miss?

186
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,022
I'm just guessing.

187
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,253
Hello?

188
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:48,022
- ANNA: Is this the Transporter?
- (LAUGHS)

189
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,982
That depends who this is.

190
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,255
Hopefully, your next employer.

191
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,341
I don't do business over the phone.

192
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,860
Tomorrow then. 2:00 p.m.
at the bar at the Majestic hotel.

193
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,378
How will I know who you are?

194
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,712
I'll be alone.

195
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,052
(PHONE BEEPS)

196
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:09,072
You know, in my day, when you wanted
to make a cup of coffee

197
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,220
you just had to boil the water
and strain the grinds.

198
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,378
Now it seems like you need a PhD.

199
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,901
Dad, you have a PhD.

200
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:19,377
That's a juicer.

201
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,021
You need a woman around the house.

202
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,152
...acting like haters

203
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:31,256
Haters acting like...
Just, just acting like haters

204
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,780
Yo, repeat my conversation
I talk just 'bout my haters

205
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,472
'Cause haters love my pictures

206
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:40,941
So now I'm getting' funky
Stackin' money off these hoes

207
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:45,134
Haters actin' like...
...actin' like haters

208
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:48,432
Yo, repeat my conversation
I talk just about my haters

209
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,312
Them haters love my pictures

210
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:54,112
So now I'm getting' funky
Stackin' money off these hoes

211
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:57,312
Any kind of cash I'm a professional

212
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,575
When it come to ass I'm a professional

213
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:04,152
When it's getting hot I'm a professional

214
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,392
Murder alien slang extraterrestrial

215
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,618
Bang bang

216
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,139
Leo?

217
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:11,773
Huh?

218
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,457
Since when we work together?

219
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:14,977
Twelve years.

220
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,232
Fifteen.

221
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:18,460
Fifteen years.

222
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:20,333
You still don't trust me.

223
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:21,613
I trust you.

224
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:25,339
But when it comes to girls,
I'd like to take my time.

225
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:27,072
(LAUGHS)

226
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:28,253
Take your time.

227
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:31,872
- And Yuri...
- Hmm?

228
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,940
...is it true that you live
in your plane now?

229
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:38,232
Yeah, no customs, no taxes,
free like a bird, man. (CHUCKLES)

230

- (LAUGHS)
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

231
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,832
- Hold on. Arkady?
- Not now.

232
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,616
There's been an accident.

233
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,139
Da.

234
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:04,900
They're calling it
an electrical malfunction.

235
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,512
His wife identified the bodies.

236
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,023
Then what am I doing here?

237
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,432
He was your accountant, was he not?

238
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,952
Mine and a lot of other people's.

239
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:13,432
Did you ask all of them to come
down here to see his body?

240
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,614
I didn't ask you to come here
to see his body.

241
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,019
I asked you to come here to see hers.

242
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,053
Who is she?

243
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,272
I was hoping you might tell me.

244
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,420
She appears to be one of yours.

245
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,112
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

246
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,872
The Coeur Brisé is hardly
a secret, Mr. Karasov.

247
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:35,613
Even men in my own department
have spent time with your "hostesses."

248
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,592
That is what you call them, no?

249
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,536
I'm a legitimate businessman, Inspector.

250
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,694
I have a lot of people who work for me.

251
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,459
And I can't possibly
account for all of them.

252
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,992
Of course not.
Though what I can't quite figure

253
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,552
is why one of them would want
to kill your accountant.

254
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,592
I thought you said this was
an electrical accident.

255
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,112
That is what the hotel is saying.

256
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,752
They haven't had the benefit
of seeing the .9mm slugs

257
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,312
we pulled from their heads.

258
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,192
- They were shot?
- At close range.

259
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:04,392
I suspect whomever did this started
the fire to cover their tracks.

260
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:07,072
And you think I had
something to do with it.

261
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:08,981
BECTAOUI: I want to be perfectly clear.

262
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,472
No one is accusing you of anything.

263
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:12,858
Good.

264
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:17,534
'Cause if you ever do,
you better come with more men.

265
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,232
You think the West Africans from '95
are trying to get back into the skin game?

266
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:28,512
- They're too smart for that.
- Who is then?

267
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,552
I don't know. But when I find out
who they are,

268
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:32,654
they'll wish they were someone else.

269
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:39,773
You called me.

270
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,543
How did you know it was me?

271
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,023
You said you'd be alone.

272
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:48,672
Well, she's alone.

273
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:49,752
Oh, she has a dog with her.

274
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:52,093
Dog people usually
say they're with their dog.

275
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:57,392
Well, I appreciate you
coming to meet me. I am...

276
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:58,552
- No names.
- What?

277
00:16:58,661 --> 00:16:59,632
That's the first rule.

278
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,912
Someone asks me who you are,
I have plausible deniability.

279
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,537
Better for me, better for you.

280
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:05,872
I heard you were like this.

281
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:06,973
Heard from whom?

282
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,672
Someone you worked with previously whose
name would presumably mean nothing

283
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,978
given your first rule.

284
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:13,973
You're a quick study.

285
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,272
Are there any other rules
I need to know about?

286
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:18,312
Once the deal is made,
the deal never changes.

287
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,573
You change the deal, I drive away.

288
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:21,352
The deal is for one passenger.

289
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:22,712
You pick me up, drop me off.

290
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:24,052
WAITER: Your whiskey, sir.

291
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:32,472
- Any packages?
- Two.

292
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,700
- Weight?
- 104 kilos in total.

293
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,272
Is that a problem? I was told
that you can transport anything.

294
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,579
As long as I don't know what it is.
That's the last rule.

295
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,574
Plausible deniability.

296
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:48,339
When's the pick up?

297
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,699
Tonight. 5:00 p.m.
Banque de Monaco in Monte Carlo.

298
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,333
That's in three hours.

299
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,542
You need to take a nap?

300
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,496
5:01 then I'm gone, clear?

301
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,341
Yes.

302
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:09,072
I gather my previous employer
mentioned my...

303
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,503
Of course. Your fee.

304
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:15,976
Half now, half upon delivery.

305
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:18,096
I'm good at following the rules.

306
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,459
Good.

307
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:30,143
All goes well, perhaps we'll
work together again in the future.

308
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,294
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

309
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,738
It's me. He left. You can proceed.

310
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:53,912
Oh.

311
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:54,992
Is there a problem?

312
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,952
No, it's just that
it's a Château Cheval Blanc

313
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,941
from the 2005 vintage.

314
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,912
(CHUCKLES)
I know, it says so on the label.

315
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,343
But it's 900 euros.

316
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,253
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:07,303
900... 900 euros? Oop!

318
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:08,858
- (SIGHS)
- (LAUGHS)

319
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,912
Perhaps I can point you
toward an excellent,

320
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,832
and more affordable
selection of local vineyards?

321
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:14,933
I'll be fine.

322
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,658
Frank...

323
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:31,458
Do you need anything?

324
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:32,943

01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:30,815
How about being sorry you kidnapped
my father in the first place?

971
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:33,661
I'm sorry about that, too.

972
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:39,175
It was wrong for me to use your father,
and it was wrong for me to use you.

973
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:40,532
Very wrong.

974
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,657
I think our deal is done.

975
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:45,098
Yeah.

976
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:53,457
Don't you want to know
what I'm going to do next?

977
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:56,581
I think I have a good idea.

978
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:01,656
I'm talking about the future.

979
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:04,333
Tell me about the future.

980
01:04:08,141 --> 01:04:11,056
I'm going to finish what we started.

981
01:04:27,621 --> 01:04:29,455
How did you get
caught up in all of this?

982
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:32,654
I come from an impoverished village.

983
01:04:34,461 --> 01:04:37,342
Drinking and drugs killed
the people that guns didn't.

984
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:42,272
And then when I was 12,

985
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:45,137
I came home from the factory
where I worked

986
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:50,093
and my mother introduced me
to a man in a very nice suit.

987
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,622
Karasov.

988
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:01,896
He said I could come and do work
for him in warm places.

989
01:05:03,341 --> 01:05:05,221
He would give me food and clothes

990
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:09,255
and introduce me with men for money.

991
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:13,379
I looked at my mom
and she said it was okay.

992
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:16,173
"Yeah, go."

993
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,782
And so I did.

994
01:05:25,741 --> 01:05:28,861
It wasn't until later that I found out
that she sold me to him.

995
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:31,462
For $500.

996
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:35,578
Jesus, Anna.

997
01:05:35,861 --> 01:05:38,014
I think she could
have gotten $600, right?

998
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:39,897
(CHUCKLES)

999
01:05:41,581 --> 01:05:43,540
You don't need to do this, you know.

1000
01:05:44,461 --> 01:05:45,783
You can still walk away.

1001
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:51,063
If we stop now, it will have
been for nothing,

1002
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,542
everything I went through.

1003
01:05:56,341 --> 01:05:59,777
Do you know what it feels like
to be thought of as trash?

1004
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:07,102
He'll kill you, you know.

1005
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,783
Without thinking about it.

1006
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,792
It's like the Count
said to his Musketeers,

1007
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:21,862
"I don't cling to life
sufficiently to fear death."

1008
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:57,453
(EXHALES)

1009
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,541
Dad. Time to go.

1010
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:24,253
Really?

1011
01:07:26,461 --> 01:07:28,693
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Mmm. Mmm.

1012
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:30,977
(SHUSHING)

1013
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:35,778
WOMAN: (SINGING)
'Cause I'm a fool for you

1014
01:07:36,301 --> 01:07:39,535
You know I speak the truth

1015
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:44,337
Whatever you say or do

1016
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:48,578
You know they're doing another job.

1017
01:07:48,741 --> 01:07:51,895
Yeah, taking on a Russian crime lord
is more of a suicide mission.

1018
01:07:53,061 --> 01:07:55,419
Imagine how horrible your life
has to be to try something like that.

1019
01:07:56,061 --> 01:07:58,472
I've seen some horrible things
in some horrible places.

1020
01:07:58,581 --> 01:08:01,576
Being sold into prostitution
with death as your only out.

1021
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:04,095
That's about as bad as it gets.

1022
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:08,312
The question is, what are you
gonna do about it?

1023
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:09,392
Me?

1024
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,096
There's no one else in the car.

1025
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,696
I don't have to do anything.

1026
01:08:13,941 --> 01:08:16,872
I'm gonna drop you home,
ditch the car at a chopper,

1027
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:19,816
go to Paris for a bit until things
cool down, you know.

1028
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,862
That doesn't sound
like the man I raised.

1029
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:23,622
Dad, stop.

1030
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:25,177
All right, stay within the lines,

1031
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:28,312
watch everything play out,
that's exactly what a fobbit would do.

1032
01:08:28,421 --> 01:08:31,592
Look, my entire life, I've tried
to do the right thing, you know.

1033
01:08:31,701 --> 01:08:34,781
Maybe I wasn't a spy like you,
but I served that fool.

1034
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:36,472
What did it get me?

1035
01:08:36,581 --> 01:08:39,701
Shit I didn't deserve.
You said it yourself.

1036
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:47,141
It doesn't mean you stop
doing the right thing.

1037
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,654
Send me a postcard from Paris.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

1040
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:42,052
- Dad?
- KARASOV: Hello, Frank.

1041
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:46,152
Don't tell me you don't recognize my voice.
It hasn't been that long.

1042
01:09:46,261 --> 01:09:47,333
What do you want?

1043
01:09:47,461 --> 01:09:49,181
Well, I want to make a deal.

1044
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:51,872
You have some people I want,
three of them to be exact,

1045
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:55,312
and I have someone you want.
Go ahead, say hello.

1046
01:09:55,421 --> 01:09:56,472
FRANK SENIOR: Drive away.
Wherever you are,

1047
01:09:56,581 --> 01:09:58,222
- just drive away...
- (TIRES SCREECHING)

1048
01:09:58,701 --> 01:10:01,536
Dad... Put him back on the phone.

1049
01:10:01,981 --> 01:10:05,912
KARASOV: Well, he's resting now and frankly,
I think he's giving you bad advice.

1050
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:07,392
Anything happens to him...

1051
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:10,352
You'll what? Kill me?
Come on, Frank. I know you.

1052
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,832
You were a good soldier.

1053
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,832
And you'll do what
a good soldier always does.

1054
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:17,141
You'll follow the orders.
So listen to me very closely.

1055
01:10:17,461 --> 01:10:21,192
If you ever wish to see your father alive
again, you'll do exactly what I say.

(CAR APPROACHING)

1060
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:01,832
Couldn't stay away?

1061
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:02,952
There's a new deal.

1062
01:11:03,061 --> 01:11:04,032
I thought you said you never...

1063
01:11:04,141 --> 01:11:05,702
That was before he took my dad.

1064
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:08,577
Listen, I'm in this shit because
of you and so is my dad.

1065
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:10,912
So whether you agree or not
we're going to see Karasov

1066
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:13,174
on his yacht right now with the ledger.

1067
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,420
I was all for you,
now I need you to do one for me.

1068
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:17,018
Do we have a choice?

1069
01:11:17,141 --> 01:11:18,372
Not really.

1070
01:11:19,181 --> 01:11:20,253
We'll help you.

1071
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:23,739
No more games. No more bullshit.

1072
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:27,699
Where's Gina?

1073
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,432
She left. Back to her family.

1074
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:31,512
Don't lie to me.

1075
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,432
Karasov assumes
that there is only three of us

1076
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,773
and that's what he is looking for.
Don't you think?

1077
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:37,577
This is why we always
kept someone separate.

1078
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:40,901
So one of us could get away.
That was our deal.

1079
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,663
Let's get your father back.

1080
01:12:28,101 --> 01:12:29,537
Welcome back, girls.

1081
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:17,138
Been a long time.

1082
01:13:17,261 --> 01:13:18,777
Not long enough.

1083
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,741
Still upset about what happened?

1084
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,533
A little bit, yeah.

1085
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:26,832
I thought you John Wayne types
just let it roll off your back.

1086
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:28,263
That was the old days.

1087
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,302
Now we hold grudges and get revenge.

1088
01:13:33,261 --> 01:13:34,432
Revenge for what?

1089
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:38,072
That car of yours is a real step up
from driving a military convoy truck.

1090
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,952
You know, you brought this
on yourself, Frank.

1091
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:42,912
Everyone in your platoon played ball,
they made a lot of money.

1092
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:46,032
It would have been easier if you just
went along with the rest, you know.

1093
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:49,773
I wasn't there to make money.
I was there to fight a war.

1094
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:52,220
I don't play ball with people like you.

1095
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:53,992
Well, I can't speak to the arrangements

makes to get jobs done.

1097
01:13:56,661 --> 01:13:59,735
I'm just happy I was on the side
that profited from it.

1098
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:03,656
Well, let's just hope you get
what's coming to you.

1099
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:15,141
Qiao, Anna, Maria,
glad you could join us.

1100
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:18,872
Where's my dad?

1101
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:20,178
Did one of you bring the ledger?

1102
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:31,061
Now where's my dad?

1103
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,622
- I said...
- I heard you.

1104

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

1105
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:50,456
I assume you have a plan, Junior.

1106
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:02,872
What is this?

1107
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:03,973
You tell us.

1108
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,832
What's that supposed to mean?

1109
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:06,872
You called the meeting.

1110
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:08,232
I didn't call anything.

1111
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:09,822
Cut this shit. What's this about?

1112
01:15:09,941 --> 01:15:11,952
Well, for one, I found the people
who stole from you.

1113
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:13,872
Right. And he's right there.

1114
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,552
Listen, I'm getting pretty sick
of you both accusing me

1115
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:17,672
of something I didn't do.

1116
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:19,672
As a matter of fact, I brought
these people here to kill them.

1117
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,773
He's lying.

1118
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:22,672
Who the hell are you?

1119
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:24,297
I'm Anna and I work for him.

1120
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:26,258
He told me to rob you and I did.

1121
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:27,983
We called you here
because he has your money.

1122
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:32,933
Let her talk.

1123
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,312
ANNA: There's no way
we're taking the fall for this.

1124
01:15:39,421 --> 01:15:40,432
