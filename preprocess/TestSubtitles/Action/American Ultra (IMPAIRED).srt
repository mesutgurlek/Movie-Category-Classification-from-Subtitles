keep going,

When I called you
to notify you

01:24:06,076 --> 01:24:07,475
that the sweep was happening,

1436
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:09,276
I did it out of respect
and courtesy,

1437
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:11,711
and you've made me
regret that now.

1438
01:24:12,146 --> 01:24:15,213
It was not my intention
for you to act like a child

1439
01:24:15,215 --> 01:24:17,448
and try to save your puppy.

1440
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:19,272
The puppy was going down,

1441
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:20,862
I was notifying you
of the puppy's death.

1442
01:24:20,863 --> 01:24:22,452
But the puppy just shit
all over everything!

1443
01:24:22,454 --> 01:24:24,454
You have a crazy,

1444
01:24:24,456 --> 01:24:27,256
scary rabid puppy
that murders people

1445
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:29,357
and will still need to be
put down.

1446
01:24:30,126 --> 01:24:32,126
You understand that? Correct?

1447
01:24:32,495 --> 01:24:34,027
Yes, sir.

1448
01:24:34,029 --> 01:24:36,562
You better pray you can find
a way to turn this into a win

1449
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,697
and pull a miracle
out of your ass!

1451

Pardon me for saying it, sir.

01:25:13,558 --> 01:25:15,457
But that is a puppy
worth saving.

1462
01:25:17,027 --> 01:25:19,327
That is a $400 million puppy.

1463
01:25:20,763 --> 01:25:23,430
And you have him sitting
in a holding cell right now.

You're just going
to put him down?
