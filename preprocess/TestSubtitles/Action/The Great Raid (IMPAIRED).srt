<i>They're trapped.</i>

11

<i>And on stopping Hitler.</i>

15

<i>This strategy effectively
seals the fate of the Philippines</i>

16

<i>Starvation and abuse.</i>

<i>With each new victory.
American forces advance on Japan.</i>

40
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:07,851
<i>And with each new defeat. The
Japanese army becomes more desperate.</i>

41
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:13,382
<i>Fueled by propaganda. They believe
that the Americans will show no mercy.</i>

42
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,689
<i>The government in Tokyo
encourages these fears.</i>

43
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:23,430
<i>Convincing its people they must prepare
to defend their country to the death.</i>

56

<i>Over a quarter million troops
came ashore.</i>

57

<i>Ready for the final push
into the Philippines.</i>

58
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,754
<i>I was a Stanford graduate who'd
entered the service through the R. O. T. C.</i>

59
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,760
<i>I wasn't interested
in being a career soldier.</i>

60
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,594
<i>I just wanted to do my part
and go home to my wife.</i>

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,733
<i>I was a captain
with the 6th Ranger battalion.</i>

62
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:14,467
<i>My commanding officer
was Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci.</i>

63
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,532
<i>(Swing music)</i>

64
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,837
- You in this hand, Lieutenant?
- Thinking about it, Colonel.

65
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,680
Well, if you're thinking about it,
you already lost.

66
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:29,654
- Want me to give you a better look?
- No, Colonel, I don't want you...

67
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:34,683
<i>A West Point graduate. Mucci was
one of the most driven men I'd ever met.</i>

68
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,662
<i>He took on what seemed to many
like a hopeless task -</i>

69
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,326
<i>the job of turning a group of raw.
Untested recruits</i>

70
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,393
<i>into a new unit of elite soldiers.</i>

71
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,962
<i>Originally assigned to handle livestock.</i>

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,942
<i>They were mostly farm hands
from small towns in rural areas</i>

73
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,411
<i>with little or no combat experience.</i>

74
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,211
First Sergeant, overlays are ready.
Have you seen Colonel Mucci?

75
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,185
Yes, sir.
He's in the Waldorf, playing poker.

76
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,587
Wouldn't interrupt him right now.
I think he's losing.

77
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:09,561
Ah, for cryin' out loud. Lieutenant Foley,
get me a new deck. This one's unlucky.

78
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,530
When you stick that pipe in your mouth,
I know you're in trouble.

79
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,897
Just you wait,
you smug son of a bitch.

80
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,562
Colonel, overlays.

81
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,969
Any idea who that is?

82
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,035
<i>- No, sir.
- (Mucci) Corporal of the guard.</i>

83
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:29,105
- Yes, sir.
- Aliteri, find out who the cowboy is.

84
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,513
Sir.

85
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,155
<i>We'd spent months training
and had seen very little action.</i>

86
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,250
<i>As far as the army was concerned.</i>

87
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,263
<i>We were nothing more
than the colonel's personal experiment.</i>

88
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,822
<i>Mucci was determined
to prove them wrong.</i>

89
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,668
- General.
- Henry.

90
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,469
You know Colonel White,
and this is Major Lapham.

91
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,342
Major, this is Lieutenant Colonel
Henry Mucci, CO, 6th Ranger battalion.

92
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,575
Major Lapham is a stay-behind
from the Bataan campaign.

93
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,277
He runs guerrilla units here
in north-central Luzon.

94
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:10,255
Philippine guerrillas have been the primary
source of intel for MacArthur since the fall.

95
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,985
- It's an honor, Major.
- Thank you.

96
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:17,519
Major Lapham,
tell Colonel Mucci what you told us.

97
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,293
Five miles east
of Cabanatuan City here,

98
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:25,327
there's a Japanese POW camp holding
about 500 survivors of the death march.

99
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,771
As we advance on this area,

100
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,504
I believe the Japanese will murder
the prisoners rather than release them.

101
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:36,015
Major Lapham is probably right. There
was an incident in a camp on Palawan.

102
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,916
150 American POWs were herded
into air-raid shelters and burnt alive

103
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,454
on the news that MacArthur had invaded.

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,355
Our axis of advance
is headed right for that camp.

105
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,893
Unless we run into
something unexpected,

106
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,364
we're gonna be in Cabanatuan at the
end of the week, and that may be too late.

107
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,128
Horton, what's G2 got to say about this?

108
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,262
Because of our advances, Jap movements
have become increasingly fluid -

109
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,775
retreating at night, hiding during the day
to avoid our aircraft.

110
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,902
What that means is we can't be sure
where the enemy is.

111
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,106
They're only 30 miles
from our front lines.

112
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:12,948
There's over 30,000 Japanese troops
in that area alone, Colonel.

113
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,614
Henry, you develop a plan
and get it to the G3 by the morning.

114
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,022
<i>- Sir.
- (General) I'll make my decision then.</i>

115
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,157
Henry, I'll be honest with you. This mission
appeals more to my heart than to my head.

116
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,961
Three years ago
we ordered these men to surrender.

117
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,229
The way I see it, we owe them a great debt.

118
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,569
But... I need you
to be a hard-headed pragmatist.

119
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,701
If it doesn't feel right,
you call it off. Understand?

120
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,835
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,073
- Who will you assign it to?
- I'll lead it myself.

122
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,980
Let the rest of your battalion worry about it.

123
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
I trained these Rangers. Everything
I've asked them to do, I've done myself.

124
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,280
I feel like they deserve a shot at this.

125
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,326
And so do I.

126
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,884
All right, Henry.
You show me a plan that works.

127
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,224
Sir.

128
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,756
General Krueger
hasn't made up his mind yet,

129
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,598
so I need you to come up
with a hell of a plan.

130
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,697
The Alamo Scouts are briefing us in five.
After that, you've got till the morning.

131
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,401
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,104
Sir, when you said
you were going to accompany us...

133
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,808
Don't worry, Captain.
You'll be leading the raid, not me.

134
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,908
<i>(Captain) How many guards
in the compound?</i>

135
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,444
<i>- Man: Could be as many as 200.
- (Captain) Any tanks?</i>

136
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:28,358
This building with the metal roof
looks like it's protecting something.

137
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:35,525
If the camp is here, what is the Japanese
strength inside Cabanatuan City?

138
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:40,232
- 9,000 troops, sir.
- Not to worry. That's over four miles away.

139
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,003
What's enemy traffic like on this road?

140
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,012
The Japanese are moving their troops
from south to north.

141
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,709
So this is one of their main routes.

142
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,185
Looks like this bridge
is a mile away from the camp.

143
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,243
Half a mile, sir.

144
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,518
We believe it's heavily fortified. We're
not sure how many troops are guarding it.

145
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,755
Sir, it's hard to determine the number of
men we'll need without more specific intel.

146
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,266
Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury,
Bob. I selected you for your flexibility.

147
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,530
Now, you've got
a 24-hour jump on us, Lieutenant.

148
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,004
Is that enough time to get Captain Prince
all the dope he needs?

149
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:18,135
We'll be ready to report to you at 0800
hours on the morning of the 29th, sir.

150
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>- (Mucci) Get it done.
- (Men) Yes, sir.</i>

151
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,476
Sir, the tough nut is the final approach.

152
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,112
No cover for over 800 yards.

153
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,089
It's as flat as a pancake.

154
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,236
Hey. Hey!

155
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,499
<i>(Whimpers)</i>

156
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,008
How far do you think
Hewitt's got by now?

157
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,952
What difference does it make?

158
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,422
The Japs are gonna catch him
sooner or later.

159
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,864
You couldn't have got me
something easier to chew?

160
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,598
A mango, banana?

161
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,869
Duke's selling graveyard rats,
but I thought...

162
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,105
I thought that'd be overindulging.

163
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,513
Is it your gums
or your teeth hurting?

164
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,847
<i>(Groans)</i>

165
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,718
Starts at the gums, works its way
around the back of my head

166
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,555
and then ends up
in my neck somewhere.

167
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,720
Don't worry.
It's not malaria.

168
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,125
- Sir.
- Take a knee, Lieutenant.

169
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,393
We've just translated
a telegram to Colonel Mori.

170
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,201
MacArthur's conquered the southern
islands. He's landed here on Luzon.

171
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,540
Good ol' Dugout Doug.
He can take in the sun for a few days,

172
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,706
then head on back to Australia
like he did the first time.

173
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,809
The information's good, Major.
I'm in that office every day.

174
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:44,983
We don't know how close MacArthur is
or when he'll reach Cabanatuan.

175
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,452
Tell the men the best thing to do is sit tight
and stay calm till we find out more.

176
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,361
Yes, sir.

177
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,260
- Make sure McMahon gets that.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,998
<i>(POW) Come on, get up!</i>

179
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,575
<i>- Come on, get up!
- (Guard speaks Japanese)</i>

180
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,305
- They caught Hewitt.
- Who was watchin' him?

181
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,419
Poor dumb bastard
couldn't even wait till it got dark.

182
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,786
<i>(Guard shouts in Japanese)</i>

183
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,226
<i>(Speaks Japanese)</i>

184
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,035
<i>(Hewitt yells)</i>

185
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,808
<i>(Japanese) You are responsible for this.</i>

186
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,983
You surrender like cowards,
then you run away like dogs.

187
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:52,616
He'll die, because none of you
had the courage to stop him!

188
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,425
<i>(Whipping continues. Hewitt yells)</i>

189
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,160
<i>(Japanese)</i>

00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,132
<i>(Guard shouts in Japanese)</i>

191
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,220
Redding.

192
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,526
<i>(Speaks Japanese) I need food.</i>

193
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,903
<i>(Grunts)</i>

194
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,843
Colvin, watch his back.

195
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,415
- How much?
- Five.

196
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,037
- You should not have come.
- Neither should you.

197
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,268
<i>(Guard yells in Japanese)</i>

198
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,771
<i>(POWcries out in pain)</i>

199
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,375
The guards are getting
harder to bribe.

200
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,074
What we really need is more medicine.

201
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,282
Carlos and my father were questioned
by the Japanese last week.

202
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,381
They are watching us.

203
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,824
Then tell Margaret
not to take any more risks.

204
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,158
<i>(Speaks Filipino)
You think she'll listen?</i>

205
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,698
<i>(Guard shouts in Japanese)</i>

206
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:43,759
Is there anything else
you want me to tell her?

207
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,274
Just to take care.

208
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:54,439
There is some quinine in the peanuts.
Take some yourself, huh?

209
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,540
You don't look well.

210
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,815
<i>(Colvin) Who's Margaret, Red?</i>

211
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,092
She's an American nurse who was married
to his commanding officer.

212
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:15,464
He died of malaria about a year ago
in one of the other camps.

213
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,061
<i>- (Colvin) Is the major involved with her?
- (Redding) What makes you ask?</i>

214
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,936
<i>(Colvin) Nothing.</i>

215
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,141
He just sounded concerned.

216
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:30,041
Well, he wasn't involved with her,
but he should have been.

217
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,710
Her husband
didn't give a damn about her,

218
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,619
<i>and Gibby couldn't give a damn
about anyone else but her.</i>

219
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,250
- Why didn't he do something about it?
- 'Cause he's a gentleman.

220
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,090
He'd never fool around
with another man's wife.

221
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,289
I, on the other hand, might.

222
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,899
<i>(Colvin) Where is she now?</i>

223
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,061
<i>(Redding) She's still in Manila.</i>

224
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,368
Who do you think smuggles
all the medicine into the camp?

225
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:07,148
<i>(Prince) In 1941. Manila was considered
the pearl of the Orient.</i>

226
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,214
<i>An international city where people
from all over the world lived and worked.</i>

227
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,727
<i>That all changed
when the Japanese took over.</i>

228
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,127
<i>They believed
that as a conquered people.</i>

229
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,927
<i>The Filipinos should do
as they were told.</i>

230
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,495
<i>Those who disobeyed were jailed.
Tortured or executed.</i>

231
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,838
This made the bond between the Filipinos
and the Americans even stronger.

232
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,902
<i>Resistance grew throughout the country.</i>

233
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,418
<i>By 1945. hundreds of ordinary people
had joined the underground.</i>

234
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,683
It's like they have been
watching me for weeks.

235
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,149
The Japanese
have questioned our people before.

236
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,854
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

237
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,160
They know
that the Americans are closing in,

238
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,328
and they know that we have evidence
of their war crimes.

239
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,702
Don Antonio is right. This...

240
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,333
This wasn't like before, Margaret.

241
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,970
Now they know of things
only an informer could have told them.

242
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,140
Then why'd they let you go?

243
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:15,654
I'm sorry, Carlos,
but if you're worried, you're free to go.

244
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,212
I won't hold it against you.

245
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,987
I won't hold it against any of you.

246
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,989
I wouldn't leave unless we all go.

247
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,624
You know that.

248
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:34,731
I can't leave, not as long as there is
a single prisoner left in Cabanatuan.

249
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,467
<i>(Speaks Filipino)
...Margaret.</i>

250
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,445
I saw Daniel.

251
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,675
How is he?

252
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,217
He did not look well.

253
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,651
I think he has malaria again.

254
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:53,988
I know my father said to wait, but
if we do that, it may be too late for Daniel.

255
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,362
No, your father's right.
It's too dangerous. Don't listen to me.

256
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:05,098
No. I will meet you outside the hospital
in the usual place, OK?

257
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,332
I should go.

258
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,475
Company... atten-hut!

259
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,577
At ease.

260
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,279
I'm here to tell you men
the latrine rumors are true.

261
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,122
We've finally got a mission
worthy of Rangers.

262
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,588
We're going to push right through
our front lines into the Japs' backyard

263
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:37,796
and rescue 500 American prisoners of war.

264
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,566
It's going to be a rough son of a bitch.

265
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,541
A textbook-style raid
that can only succeed

266
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,012
through speed, surprise
and overwhelming firepower.

267
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,548
That's why you've been chosen.

268
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,084
Before you start congratulating yourselves,

269
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,713
remember that you haven't achieved
a damn thing yet.

270
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,123
You're the best-trained,
least-proven battalion in this whole army.

271
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,924
This is your one chance
to do something about it.

272
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,295
And I mean one chance.

273
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,563
How you acquit yourselves
over the next 48 hours

274
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,470
will determine how you are judged
for the rest of your lives.

275
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,208
Men worthy of serving in this army,

276
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:24,739
or an embarrassment that history and time
will eventually forget.

277
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,147
It's up to you.

278
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,711
Now, I happen to think it's the former.

279
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,282
That's why I'm accompanying you
on this raid.

280
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,320
There's not another group of men in this or
any other army I'd sooner trust my life with.

281
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:43,835
You're the finest, best-prepared soldiers
this country's ever sent to war,

282
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,894
and I expect you to prove it.

283
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,366
One final thing:

284
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:53,879
I wanna see every last one of you
in the chapel after this formation's over.

285
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:58,178
I do not want any damned atheists
on this raid.

286
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,877
And no fakers either.

287
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:04,855
I want you to get down on your knees
and swear before Almighty God

288
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:09,020
that you'll give your lives
before you let any of those prisoners die.

289
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,855
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

290
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,763
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir!

291
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,095
Carry on.

292
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,502
Company... atten-hut!

293
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,776
The general liked your plan.

294
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:31,713
<i>(Chaplain)... and build an enduring peace
founded upon thy holy laws,</i>

295
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:35,550
and upon that unselfish goodwill
to all those who love justice and peace

296
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:39,785
which thou hast given unto us through
Jesus Christ, thine only son, our Lord.

297
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,385
<i>- Amen.
- (All) Amen.</i>

298
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,957
Take charge of your platoon!

299
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,128
Can't believe the colonel said
don't wear no insignia.

300
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,867
He's got that pencil mustache. Even
the Nips are gonna know he's an officer.

301
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,806
- Shut up.
- I mean, I can wear my helmet.

302
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,311
Come on. I use it to cook, to clean, to wash.

303
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,904
Yeah, the helmets,
they make too much noise,

304
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,950
out in the field.

305
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,248
- Sorry, I didn't hear that, Aldrige. Did you?
- I heard him.

306
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:15,484
Aldrige, you're the best shot
in the company. Ever fire one of these?

307
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,051
No.

308
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,293
- No, sir. I like my M-1.
- Choose yourself a loader.

309
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,825
Lucas.

310
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,802
- Sure about that?
- Yeah.

311
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,479
Rookies.

312
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,538
<i>(Soldiers singing)</i>

313
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,246
<i>(Radio)... Japanese planes have struck
at six different points in the Philippines.</i>

314
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,984
<i>Manila is 13 hours ahead
of Eastern Standard Time.</i>

315
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,753
<i>It is reported that Japanese bombs...</i>

316
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,818
First Sergeant.

317
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:55,159
- So you really are going.
- Someone told me you had the same idea.

318
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah.

319
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,470
Look, Jim,
I'm already taking four of your men.

320
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,532
All fine combat medics, Henry.

321
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,071
But if we get hit hard, you're gonna need
someone who can operate.

322
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,514
I can't miss this, Henry.

323
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,512
It's why I'm here.

324
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:24,791
Besides, sometimes a young field medic
needs his surgeon around.

325
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:28,891
Just like a young company commander
needs his colonel.

326
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,465
You win.

327
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,573
Captain, you got a minute for me?

328
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,642
Sure, Top.

329
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:57,522
I was going over the personnel roster,
and I ain't on it.

330
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,360
Colonel Mucci said he preferred
unmarried men on this trip,

331
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,366
so I had to take you off.

332
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,232
Well, with respect, sir, you're married.

333
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:09,638
And I imagine your wife would miss you
a hell of a lot more than mine'd miss me.

334
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:14,770
I'm the one planning this raid, Top.
Don't make me go against my instructions.

335
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,078
I'm not, sir. I'm asking you
to be a smart company commander.

336
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,320
We got Rangers out there that ain't heard
the first round go downrange in combat yet.

337
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,885
You need me on this mission.

338
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,861
Just think you need something
on that jungle rot.

339
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:36,764
Top, when I was in R.O.T.C., I was four
weeks away from being shipped to Bataan.

340
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,532
I was held back
by an impacted wisdom tooth.

341
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,404
Guys I knew ended up in those camps.

342
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,067
I think I can live with defeat.

343
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:51,876
That may be, but you're gonna find it
a lot harder to live without me.

344
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,789
All right, I'll talk to the colonel.

345
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,587
- Anything else, First Sergeant?
- No, sir.

346
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,457
Thank you. Good night, sir.

347
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:15,102
(Prince) We left 6th Army Headquarters
with very little information.

348
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:19,474
<i>The only advantage we had
was the element of surprise.</i>

349
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,539
<i>We faced a two-day walk through
open terrain patrolled by the enemy.</i>

350
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,813
<i>All it would take
is a single Japanese scout to spot us</i>

351
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,013
<i>and our mission would be over.</i>

352
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,489
Let's go! Riley, load 'em up!

353
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,757
Pack 'em up! Let's move!

354
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,263
Move 'em out!

355
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,597
<i>We all knew the idealistic notion
of rescuing POWs</i>

356
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,900
<i>far outweighted its strategic value.</i>

357
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,135
<i>We didn't spent much time
thinking about it.</i>

358
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:54,509
<i>As far as we were concerned.
We were going to rescue them</i>

359
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,242
<i>or die trying.</i>

360
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,650
- They're gonna just leave us, sir?
- I have no idea what they're doing.

361
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:13,188
Get this quinine to the doctors.
You know the drill - worst cases first.

362
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:22,906
They must be retreating.
Even the brass is leaving.

363
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,001
Hey, Major, Mori's leaving too.

364
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:36,185
Looks like you were right.
General MacArthur's got 'em on the run.

365
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,747
They're not on the run. They've got orders
to fight to the last man.

366
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,792
It's a trap.

367
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,295
A goddamn elaborate one.

368
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:49,966
We walk out those gates,
it'll give 'em the perfect excuse to kill us.

369
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,128
Since when did they need an excuse?

370
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,765
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
out of here before they change their minds.

371
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,571
How far do you think you'll get, Captain?

372
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,943
Even if the Japs are retreating,
the jungle's gonna be crawling with 'em.

373
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,539
What's wrong with that?
We're still soldiers, ain't we?

374
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:09,110
Major's right, Red. Where we gonna go
when most of us can't walk?

375
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,055
I don't recall inviting you, kid.

376
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,354
What happens
to the ones we leave behind?

377
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,486
I never said we'd all make it,
but at least some of us might.

378
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,031
If we sit tight, all of us will make it.

379
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,465
Our troops can't be far now.

380
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,002
Looks like you got yourself
a disciple, Gibby.

381
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,334
It might do you some good
to listen to him.

382
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:34,404
They're out there, Red.
Don't make it any easier for 'em.

383
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,852
Don't worry, I won't escape
without your permission.

384
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,781
Get the padre, Duke.

385
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,721
Poor son of a bitch still believed in God.

386
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,665
Well, if we can't escape,
we might as well eat.

387
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,647
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

388
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:08,264
Where do you think Mori sits?
I'll take a shit on his plate.

389
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,763
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- I wasn't always this sane.

390
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,517
- What's the matter?
- These food parcels were meant for us.

391
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,054
The bastards
were starving us deliberately.

392
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,085
Make sure you get some
to the men in the hospital ward.

393
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,569
Easy, Red.
Your stomach ain't used to it.

394
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,939
What do I care? Feels like
I'm sucking on Rita Hayworth's tits.

395
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,672
I was thinking more Mae West.

396
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:46,532
- What is it, Top?
- Japs. Only left a few hours ago.

397
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,997
Must have been hiding from our planes.

398
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,876
There's no telling where they are now. We
might wanna look around before we go on.

399
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,779
They're retreating, Captain.
That's all we need to know.

400
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,682
- Let's go.
- Move out.

401
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,188
- Platoons, let's go.
- Charlie Two, to the left.

402
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,417
Let's go, Charlie One. Follow me.

403
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,502
(tanks approaching)

404
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,388
Damn it.

405
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,919
They're Kempei Tai.
I think they're heading towards the camp.

406
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,861
The river branches out
about a half mile to the east of us.

407
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:53,701
It's not marked. There might be a bridge
that can get us around this convoy.

408
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,674
The Japanese will be guarding
a major artery at a chokepoint like that.

409
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,107
I think we ought to check it out.
This traffic isn't getting any thinner.

410
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,812
Go.

411
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,518
It was thanks to me
you met Margaret in the first place.

412
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,155
Sure it was.

413
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:23,031
When I look up at the sky like this,
I could be anywhere in the world.

414
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,628
- Where are you now?
- Halfway across the jungle.

415
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:31,836
I disobeyed your orders, and now
I'm only a few miles from civilization.

416
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,435
Well, have a drink for me
when you get there.

417
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,913
What do you want me
to tell Margaret?

418
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,408
Assuming she's still interested.

419
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:45,513
Well, if she's not, I'll propose to her myself,
and you know what?

420
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,186
I'll make you best man,
'cause I know you won't run off with her.

421
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:55,632
If I had someone like that waiting for me
on the other side of an open gate...

422
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:06,601
<i>- That's not regular army.
- ((Daniel) They're Kempei Tai.</i>

423
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,077
Military secret police.

424
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,457
<i>((Japanese)</i>

425
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,826
Don't...
give them the satisfaction.

426
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,953
<i>((Japanese) They'll be dead soon.</i>

427
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:29,358
<i>- ((shouts command in Japanese)
- ((guards shout)</i>

428
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,253
<i>((speaks Japanese)</i>

429
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,778
You fought in Bataan, Major?

430
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,547
You commanded a battalion of the 31 st
Infantry in operations near Mamala River?

431
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,622
I can give you my name,
rank and serial number.

432
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,229
We found these in your barracks.

433
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:54,238
I assume they were smuggled in
by the Filipino resistance.

434
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,448
They say, "Take hope.

435
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,851
"MacArthur is coming."

436
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:07,187
We've lived off rumors like that
for three years.

437
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,625
Only this time they are true.

438
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:15,792
Your forces will recapture the Philippines
within a few weeks.

439
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:22,300
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it isn't long to wait.

440
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,365
You are the senior officer.

441
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,967
If you help me keep order,

442
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:30,606
I can make the rest
of your time here tolerable.

443
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:37,885
But if any of the prisoners try to escape,
I will kill ten others in his place.

444
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,689
Are you married, Major?

445
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,532
- No.
- You have a reason to survive this war?

446
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,802
I'd like to be here for your surrender.

447
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,972
Then you had better stay in good health.

448
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,846
You look feverish.

Three or four days

He tried to convince me

Oh, you're my next of kin now?

what's to stop me leaving this place?

462

I told you what Nagai said.

Ten of us getting killed

466

That's the reason I didn't want to make
any friends here - in case I let 'em down.

467

Sir.

00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,629
What happened here?

509
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,500
The Japanese came into the village
yesterday, with tanks,

510
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,767
to punish these people
for helping my men.

511
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,765
Over a hundred were killed.

512
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,713
Captain, I guarantee you,
this will not go unpunished.

513
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,636
Alamo Scouts. Hold your fire.

514
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,835
<i>- Charlie Company CO.
- ('soldier) This way. Follow me.</i>

515
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,072
The camp is divided into quarters.

516
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:39,742
We only spotted POWs
in the southeast quadrant here.

517
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:42,945
The Jap guard barracks
are here in this area.

518
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,147
There are sentries
in each guard tower,

519
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,385
two at the gates,
five in the guardhouses.

520
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:52,919
We couldn't get precise numbers. Could
be anything between 50 and 100 of 'em.

521
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,830
This isn't enough, sir.

522
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,698
- Enough of what?
- There's too many unknowns.

523
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,330
There's a big difference
between 50 and 100 men.

524
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,843
It isn't always about the arithmetic.
Some things you gotta take on faith.

525
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,379
We get into firefight
inside that compound,

526
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:14,544
and a lot of those men we're trying
to rescue are liable to get killed.

527
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:19,413
Lieutenant Able,
you've got 12 hours till this raid kicks off.

528
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,618
Can you get in there
and bring back more detailed intel?

529
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,527
It's dicey, sir. All that open terrain
in broad daylight.

530
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:29,293
We need more time.
Give them a chance to work in closer.

531
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,460
No more delays now, goddammit.

532
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:36,302
Those poor bastards have had three years
of delays. We'll stick to your plan, Bob.

533
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,535
With respect, sir,

534
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,043
you said you chose me
for my flexibility.

535
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:46,709
Under present circumstances, I cannot
guarantee the safety of those prisoners.

536
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,685
Sir, you may be forced to delay.

537
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,213
Why, Captain?

538
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,191
There's a Japanese convoy
traveling north, division strength.

539
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,785
They will pass
directly in front of the camp tonight.

540
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,923
How is it you came by this information,
Captain Pajota?

541
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,092
From our spies in Cabanatuan City.

542
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,728
Are we talking hard facts
or the bamboo telegraph?

543
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:12,572
The bamboo telegraph told me you
and your men are coming here today, sir.

544
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,815
Lieutenant Able, get some of our own
people on this. As of now we leave tonight.

545
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:23,080
Sir.

<i>('Able) Captain?</i>

You have a minute? I wanted
to discuss this plan with you.

552
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:44,272
My men have been watching
this camp for three years.

553
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,310
We planned to raid it
many times ourselves.

554
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:51,246
- Why didn't you?
- Most of your POWs can't walk.

555
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,943
They're either sick or crippled.

556
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:57,419
The healthy ones were shipped
to labor camps in Japan.

557
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:01,151
If we rescued them,
how would we care for them?

558
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:06,054
Well, how did you plan
to move them from the camp?

559
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,064
In carabao carts.

560
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,600
You have enough carts
for 500 prisoners?

561
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:14,126
If you give me 24 hours, I will.

562
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:20,637
But... you have to convince your colonel
to move to another village.

563
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:23,578
It isn't safe to bring them here.

564
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,083
What village do you suggest?

565
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,415
Platero.

566
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,687
Sir.

567
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,965
Sorry if I was out of line before.

- We'll delay 24 hours.

569
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,263
Get a message to General Krueger.

570
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,572
That'll be all.

571
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,475

I was assaulted myself,

I have no dealings whatsoever
with any underground

607
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,459
or any American prisoners of war.

608
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,199
- Is this your Bible?
- I don't know.

609
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,405
Did you take it from my apartment?

610
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,847
You were married to an American officer
before the war?

611
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,249
I've never been married.

612
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,418
Then...

613
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,550
who is this man?

614
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,686
Your husband?

615
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:07,601
Your lover?

616
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,633
No.

617
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:16,941
But you keep a picture of him
in your Bible.

618
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:25,249
<i>- ('speaks Japanese)
- ('guard responds)</i>

619
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,518
<i>('guard shouts)</i>

620
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,324
<i>('guard speaks Japanese)</i>

621
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,661
<i>('speaks Japanese) From Manila, sir.</i>

622
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,375
<i>('shouts in Japanese)</i>

623
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,731
<i>(♫ opera on record player)</i>

624
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,136
Would you like to sit, Major?

625
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,465
You know her?

626
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,693
I knew her briefly.

627
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,870
Why?

628
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,702
She claims she knew you well.

629
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:29,076
She claims she stayed behind
in the Philippines to be near you.

630
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:33,679
I find that hard to believe.

631
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,184
I didn't make much
of an impression on her.

632
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:38,744
She clearly left an impression on you.

633
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:42,791
Would you like to see her again?

634
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,352
What's that to you?

635
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:52,235
We know this woman

636
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,033
is the head
of an underground movement in Manila...

637
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:02,275
responsible for smuggling stolen medicine
into this camp.

638
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,177
If you convince her to confess

639
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:08,241
and give us
the names of her accomplices,

640
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,744
I guarantee the two of you

641
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:15,690
will be free to leave
the Philippines together.

642
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,657
And if I don't?

643
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,701
You'll be returned
to your hospital ward to die.

644
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:32,067
I assume your colleagues
made her the same offer?

645
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,975
I wouldn't know.

646
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:39,778
She must've turned 'em down.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here now.

647
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:44,777
I'm offering you your future, Major.

648
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,491
My future isn't in your hands.

649
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:26,058
- Aw, honey, you look great.
- So do you.

650
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,324
Pity there ain't
a Cabanatuan beauty contest.

651
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,229
Shucks.

652
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,032
I got you something.

653
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,617
- I hoped it would be quinine.
- Gettin' fussy now, huh?

654
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,710
Sure am.

655
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,255
It didn't get through.

656
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:57,987
Your friend Nagai stopped
all work details to Cabanatuan City.

657
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,622
He's got us digging
air-raid shelters instead.

658
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,893
They'll find some other way
to smuggle it in.

659
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,630
It'll be too late for you by then, old pal.

660
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,831
You ain't thinking of leaving me.

661
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,309
I don't think Nagai's men
want me here.

662
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:18,507
I can think of ten of us that do.

663
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:23,178
Like I said, you're the only one
I give a damn about.

664
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:26,416
You and the kid sometimes.

665
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,252
Don't try it, Red.

666
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,627
I'll see you, Gibby.

667
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:56,085
Tell Duke and Pitt
to keep an eye on him.

668
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:03,688
<i>('cheering)</i>

669
01:01:13,823 --> 01:01:16,993
Is there anyone
who doesn't know we're out here?

670
01:01:18,077 --> 01:01:19,871
It's hard for them to understand, sir.

671
01:01:19,954 --> 01:01:22,665
They see American soldiers,
they think the war is over.

672
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:29,339
All right, all right.

673
01:01:36,095 --> 01:01:41,309
Colonel, may I discuss with you
the role of my men in your mission?

674
01:01:42,393 --> 01:01:46,272
Your men will be
screening our flanks, Captain.

675
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:53,029
Sir, this is our war, too. We've been
fighting the Japanese for three years.

676
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:57,408
Captain Pajota, I understand your anger
at what the Japs did to your people today.

677
01:01:57,492 --> 01:02:02,539
If I were you, I'd also want revenge.
But this mission has objectives of its own.

678
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:07,085
Sir, my men are disciplined fighters. What
happened at Balincarin is not new to them.

679
01:02:07,168 --> 01:02:10,505
Your men will be of great value
on our flanks.

680
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:13,675
Lieutenant O'Grady,
I'm going to step away.

681
01:02:13,716 --> 01:02:16,219
My compliments to the villagers
for their hospitality.

682
01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:17,595
I'll see to it, sir.

683
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:19,681
- Captain.
- Colonel.

684
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:30,024
Want me to take a look
at those feet, Captain?

685
01:02:31,568 --> 01:02:33,903
Yeah.

686
01:02:34,696 --> 01:02:38,700
God only knows
how you walk on these, Bob.

687
01:02:39,909 --> 01:02:43,955
You're lucky the colonel
doesn't know about this.

688
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,460
Doc, can you figure him out?

689
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,006
- Mucci?
- Yeah.

690
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:56,467
Every time I think I have,
he surprises me.

691
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:58,887
Not always in a bad way.

692
01:03:00,763 --> 01:03:03,600
He's the reason I joined the Rangers.

693
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:08,938
There was a time I'd follow him anywhere,
but all we seem to do now is butt heads.

694
01:03:11,357 --> 01:03:15,153
You know, he may not like
you standing up to him...

695
01:03:16,154 --> 01:03:19,365
but I suspect that's why he chose you.

696
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:24,412
I can't imagine any other reason why he'd
ignore these jungle-rotted dogs of yours.

697
01:03:24,454 --> 01:03:28,875
Besides, think he's out there
feeling on top of the world?

698
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:41,596
<i>That's the convoy
Captain Pajota was talking about.</i>

699
01:03:47,185 --> 01:03:51,564
Damn, looks like
they're reinforcing the camp.

700
01:03:52,815 --> 01:03:55,235
Hey, Duke, wake up.

701
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:59,531
It's your turn
to keep watch on Red.

702
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:04,285
Yeah. Yeah.

703
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,986
He's gone.

704
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:23,573
He's gone, dammit.
You fell asleep.

705
01:06:35,979 --> 01:06:39,315
Because one man disobeyed me...

706
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:43,194
ten others will pay the price.

707
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,017
No. Look, my fault.

708
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,602
<i>Please.</i>

709
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:17,520
Please. My fault.

710
01:10:10,193 --> 01:10:12,570
<i>They resupplied the camp
last night.</i>

711
01:10:12,654 --> 01:10:15,073
Brought in fuel and fresh troops.

712
01:10:15,156 --> 01:10:18,034
Looks like they're up to something.

713
01:10:18,993 --> 01:10:20,912
How many?

714
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:23,706
Between 150 and 200 of 'em, sir.

715
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,417
Captain?

716
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:29,671
I was depending on the second platoon
of Fox to hold the Cabu bridge,

717
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:33,174
but if the Japs have 300 men in the camp,
we'll need everyone on the raid.

718
01:10:33,258 --> 01:10:36,010
Maybe we can
hold the bridge with less men.

719
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:39,722
Can you make do
with just one squad from Riley's platoon?

720
01:10:39,806 --> 01:10:45,812
I don't think so, sir. Captain Pajota said
the Japs reinforced the bridge last night.

721
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:51,109
Well, I wish Captain Pajota had shared
this information with me earlier.

722
01:10:51,192 --> 01:10:52,902
Let's take a look.

723
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:23,099
Get a count.

724
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:31,024
With respect, sir, what's to count?

725
01:11:32,483 --> 01:11:36,446
Lieutenant Riley's right, sir.
That's a thousand men over there.

726
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:41,075
Captain, may I show you something?
Here's the bridge.

727
01:11:50,877 --> 01:11:52,795
Colonel.

728
01:11:56,216 --> 01:12:00,261
The others are beginning
to lose faith, aren't they?

729
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:04,641
<i>- They won't let you down.
- It's not a question of letting me down.</i>

730
01:12:04,724 --> 01:12:08,478
We worked hard to raise a fine unit.
They deserve their shot at glory.

731
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:15,068
I don't suppose many of us
are in this for the glory, sir.

732
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:18,112
I'm not talking about publicity, Bob.

733
01:12:18,154 --> 01:12:20,823
It's the glory you carry inside you
the rest of your life

734
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:25,453
knowing you've done something,
something that made a difference.

735
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:29,290
The only recognition I want
is from those boys in that camp.

736
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:30,667
Yes, sir.

737
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:34,837
Did you come here
to change my mind?

738
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:36,923
No, sir.

739
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:42,011
I came to tell you that whatever you
decide, it'll be the right choice.

740
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:45,515
Some things you gotta take on faith.

741
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:53,147
Captain Pajota has
volunteered to hold the bridge,

742
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,567
if you're willing
to hear him out.

743
01:13:01,322 --> 01:13:05,577
Well, you better give me a moment alone
with him so I can eat some humble pie.

744
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,662
Yes, sir.

745
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:14,043
Captain Pajota?

746
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:18,381
We wait until they are at this point,
then we blow up the bridge.

747
01:13:18,423 --> 01:13:21,009
We don't have enough explosives
to bring it down.

748
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:24,721
All we need to do is damage it
enough to stop their vehicles.

749
01:13:24,804 --> 01:13:27,015
We want the soldiers to come.

750
01:13:27,056 --> 01:13:31,227
If I place my men on either side of the
road, we'll trap them in a crossfire.

751
01:13:31,311 --> 01:13:34,397
They'll go around the bridge
and try to outflank you.

752
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,859
The Japanese don't go around,
not when they're fighting Filipinos.

753
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:41,946
They don't have enough respect
for us as soldiers.

754
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:58,213
- How are the others?
- Scared.

755
01:13:59,923 --> 01:14:03,384
They're waiting to hear
what you have to say, sir.

756
01:14:04,552 --> 01:14:07,931
I don't know
what to tell them anymore.

757
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,437
I can say something
on your behalf, sir.

758
01:14:14,521 --> 01:14:16,856
Until you feel better.

759
01:14:22,779 --> 01:14:25,657
Are you any good at writing letters?

760
01:14:26,783 --> 01:14:29,869
It depends what kind of letter.

761
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:34,624
I'm not sure myself.

762
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:38,378
I already started a dozen times
and tore it up.

763
01:14:41,756 --> 01:14:46,844
There's a... pencil and paper
under my mat.

764
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:00,567
Who you writing to?

765
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,486
A lady named Margaret.

766
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:08,700
I'm not sure how well
I know her anymore.

767
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:12,287
I've been living
in my imagination so long,

768
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:17,083
I'm afraid I'll write
some crazy love letter...

769
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:20,962
and embarrass us both.

770
01:15:21,004 --> 01:15:24,007
Red didn't seem to think so.

771
01:15:29,137 --> 01:15:31,848
What'd he tell you?

772
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,018
That she felt the same way you did.

773
01:15:36,186 --> 01:15:40,815
That she'd have left her husband
if you'd wanted her to.

774
01:15:42,525 --> 01:15:48,281
Guess I thought that if I did the
right thing, some good would come of it.

775
01:15:49,616 --> 01:15:52,243
It's funny.

776
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:55,622
I've spent the last three years

777
01:15:55,705 --> 01:15:59,250
thinking of all the things
I wanna say to her.

778
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:06,591
Now I don't even know how to begin.

779
01:16:08,301 --> 01:16:11,221
How about, "Dear Margaret"?

780
01:16:38,665 --> 01:16:42,544
We found the people
we were looking for.

781
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:52,971
<i>You are free to go.</i>

782
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:51,154
<i>Follow her!
She'll lead us to the others.</i>

783
01:18:15,887 --> 01:18:17,722
Shh.

784
01:18:18,723 --> 01:18:21,809
It's all right.
You're safe now.

785
01:18:24,687 --> 01:18:27,732
- They killed Mina.
- I know.

786
01:18:30,276 --> 01:18:32,612
I wasn't always conscious.

787
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:38,368
- I don't know what I told them.
- You didn't tell them anything.

788
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:42,872
Mina and her father were arrested
last night on their way to Cabanatuan.

789
01:18:42,914 --> 01:18:45,500
It had nothing to do with you.

790
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,919
She went because of me.

791
01:18:49,379 --> 01:18:53,508
- She knew I wanted to help Daniel.
- She wanted to help him, too.

792
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,219
I should've stopped her.

793
01:18:56,469 --> 01:18:59,639
I should've stopped her.

794
01:18:59,722 --> 01:19:03,017
But all I could think about was him.

795
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:07,730
Whatever you feel you've done wrong,
you've more than made up for it.

796
01:19:07,772 --> 01:19:10,984
Hundreds of POWs
owe you their lives.

797
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:14,404
No. I did it for him.

798
01:19:14,445 --> 01:19:18,241
- I stayed for him.
- You'll be with him soon.

799
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:22,912
I have friends who will hide you
till the Americans come.

800
01:19:22,996 --> 01:19:25,623
But, Margaret, listen to me.

801
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:30,920
You have to trust in something
stronger than yourself.

802
01:19:30,962 --> 01:19:34,382
Father! Father, the Japanese -
they're here.

803
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:37,969
Take Margaret.
I'll deal with them.

804
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:43,391
<i>Arrest anyone you find!
Go around back.</i>

805
01:19:51,566 --> 01:19:53,067
Agh!

806
01:20:00,867 --> 01:20:03,745
OK, run. Run.
Don't look back.

807
01:20:06,122 --> 01:20:09,083
No need to go in the church.
There's no one in there.

808
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:12,170
<i>There's no one in the church.</i>

809
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:32,899
Gents, here it is. At 1700 hours,
our combined forces will leave Platero.

810
01:20:32,982 --> 01:20:35,235
We'll split up here
at the Pampanga River.

811
01:20:35,318 --> 01:20:39,656
Captain Pajota, you'll continue to the Cabu
bridge, where you'll set up a roadblock.

812
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:42,825
Captain Joson,
do the same on the highway

813
01:20:42,909 --> 01:20:45,745
in case the Japs send reinforcements
from Cabanatuan City.

814
01:20:45,828 --> 01:20:49,791
Your objective is to seal off
the area of operation during the raid.

815
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:53,670
Any Japanese reinforcements
get through you, they get to us.

816
01:20:53,753 --> 01:20:57,298
We'll need as much darkness as we can
to get the POWs out of the camp,

817
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:01,469
so we'll have to begin our approach
during daylight and risk detection.

818
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:05,849
We break the tree line, Lieutenant Riley's
platoon will head to the east of the camp.

819
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:06,850
Sir.

820
01:21:06,893 --> 01:21:10,228
The rest of us will advance
at a low crawl for the main gate.

821
01:21:10,311 --> 01:21:11,771
How much cover, Captain?

822
01:21:11,855 --> 01:21:14,190
There's cover
up to 200 yards from the camp.

823
01:21:14,232 --> 01:21:19,320
After that, we're totally exposed until we
reach a ditch 30 yards from the front gate.

824
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:21,531
This is the camp.

825
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:27,912
This is the main service road,
POW barracks - all enemy occupied.

826
01:21:27,996 --> 01:21:32,876
Suspected tank shed, main gate.
This is the ditch we're trying to reach.

827
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:35,503
Until we get there
we're completely exposed,

828
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:39,299
so we may need to create some
diversionary action in this wooded area.

829
01:21:39,382 --> 01:21:44,137
Sir, how about a plane? Could you have
one of your planes fly over the camp?

830
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,389
Not without breaking radio silence.

831
01:21:46,472 --> 01:21:49,392
It's not a bad idea, Bob.
Might be worth the risk.

832
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:52,520
Good. As we make our approach,

833
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:55,940
Lieutenant Riley's men
will make their way along this ditch,

834
01:21:56,024 --> 01:22:00,695
leaving men at 20-yard intervals
to engage and reduce the enemy.

835
01:22:00,737 --> 01:22:04,949
Lieutenant Riley, soon as you're
in position here, the southeast corner,

836
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:08,912
- your first shot will kick off the action.
- Understood.

837
01:22:08,995 --> 01:22:12,749
Good. Meanwhile, the rest of us
will be in position here.

838
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:15,877
Soon as we get the signal,
Lieutenant Foley's second squad

839
01:22:15,919 --> 01:22:18,546
will take out the guard tower
and sentry shack,

840
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:21,799
and cover first squad,
who will open the main gate.

841
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:24,719
Soon as first squad is inside,
they'll flank right,

842
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:27,514
lay down suppressing fire
on the enemy officer area,

843
01:22:27,597 --> 01:22:29,807
and cover the guys heading
toward the tank shed.

844
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:33,394
I want Corporal Aldrige
and his loader to run the 200 yards.

845
01:22:33,436 --> 01:22:37,398
I want a backup team in case they don't
make it. Tanks get loose, we're in trouble.

846
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:40,693
- Yes, sir.
- Extraction's next.

847
01:22:40,777 --> 01:22:44,739
Lieutenant O'Grady, second platoon will
make their way through the main gate

848
01:22:44,781 --> 01:22:47,450
and force entry into the POW area.

849
01:22:47,534 --> 01:22:50,036
First squad will spread
along the south fence

850
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:53,164
and lay down suppressing fire
to the enemy rear.

851
01:22:53,248 --> 01:22:58,503
Make sure the POW barracks are protected
from enemy fire in all directions.

852
01:22:58,586 --> 01:23:01,714
Once that's achieved,
Lieutenant O'Grady's second squad

853
01:23:01,798 --> 01:23:05,176
will round up the POWs
and lead them to the front gate,

854
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,679
where Dr. Fisher and the medics
will be waiting.

855
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,889
Our aim is to make it
to the Pampanga River,

856
01:23:09,973 --> 01:23:12,934
where carabao carts
will be waiting to escort the prisoners.

857
01:23:12,976 --> 01:23:15,478
As soon as I'm satisfied
we've left no one behind,

858
01:23:15,562 --> 01:23:19,649
I'll fire a red star cluster
to signal the raid's over.

859
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:22,026
Any questions?

860
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,904
Yes, sir.
Who's the last man out?

861
01:23:24,988 --> 01:23:27,824
That'll be me.
You'll cover me at the front gate.

862
01:23:27,907 --> 01:23:30,702
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

863
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,913
Brief your people,
get 'em ready to go.

864
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:36,332
We leave in two hours.

865
01:24:02,358 --> 01:24:04,360
You OK, Top?

866
01:24:05,028 --> 01:24:07,155
Yeah, I'm all right.

867
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,369
I want a word about Lieutenant Riley.

868
01:24:17,832 --> 01:24:19,834
He's got a tough assignment.

869
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:26,216
What's that?

870
01:24:26,633 --> 01:24:28,718
Why?

871
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:31,137
Nothing. Just curious.

872
01:24:35,225 --> 01:24:37,185
250 Japs at that camp.

873
01:24:37,268 --> 01:24:40,313
Another thousand at the river.

874
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:42,690
10,000 more nearby.

875
01:24:42,732 --> 01:24:45,735
Only 120 of us.

876
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:49,072
I figure we're gonna need
a little miracle.

877
01:24:55,078 --> 01:24:57,622
Go ahead, take it.
I got plenty to spare.

878
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:06,089
What do I gotta do, kiss it?

879
01:25:10,635 --> 01:25:12,679
<i>The time is now 1715.</i>

880
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:15,056
And...

881
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:17,642
mark.

882
01:25:17,725 --> 01:25:19,894
Plane'll buzz the camp at 1800.

883
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:22,856
Lieutenant Riley
fires his first shot at 1930.

884
01:25:22,939 --> 01:25:25,525
Captain Pajota
blows the bridge at 1945.

885
01:25:25,608 --> 01:25:30,947
God willing, we'll be out of there by 2100.
Any questions?

886
01:25:30,989 --> 01:25:34,617
Let's all try to get back in one piece.

887
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,245
Good luck, gentlemen.

888
01:26:10,653 --> 01:26:14,240
- Top, go with Lieutenant Riley.
- Yes, sir.

889
01:26:14,324 --> 01:26:15,700
Good luck.

890
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:41,851
- What have you got, Daly?
- We're breaking cover, sir.

891
01:26:44,187 --> 01:26:47,732
Captain, Prince saw
you could use an extra man.

892
01:26:47,815 --> 01:26:50,568
Stick with me
till we get the fence line.

893
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:17,405
Where the hell
are those goddamn flyboys?

894
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:49,581
It's one of ours, sir.

895
01:30:04,721 --> 01:30:08,349
<i>Get them back to their
positions. Tighten security.</i>

896
01:30:08,391 --> 01:30:11,853
<i>Guards, back to your positions!</i>

897
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:23,776
CABANATUAN ROAD

898
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:06,694
I'll be back in the morning, sir.

899
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:11,783
Just in case... I'm not here.

900
01:33:15,578 --> 01:33:18,206
You'll give it to her yourself, sir.

901
01:33:26,589 --> 01:33:28,758
<i>Sir...</i>

902
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,429
it's time.

903
01:33:34,597 --> 01:33:37,308
First Sergeant,

904
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:40,186
if I'm going to be the
one to start this thing,

905
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:42,564
I wanna be sure
everyone's in position.

906
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:47,902
I'll check it out.

907
01:34:00,081 --> 01:34:02,834
Come on, Lieutenant Riley.

908
01:34:09,173 --> 01:34:11,885
What the hell is Riley doing, sir?

909
01:34:25,648 --> 01:34:27,984
Lieutenant wants to make sure
you're in position.

910
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:31,070
We have been for the last ten minutes.

911
01:34:32,197 --> 01:34:34,157
I'll tell him.

912
01:34:36,117 --> 01:34:41,122
The guerillas are edgy. They're afraid the
bridge will blow before the raid begins.

Those who can walk,
head for the main gate.

Those who can't, wait.
We'll come back for you.

Don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you.
We're here to help you.

You're going home.

I-I can't leave him.

955

We won't leave him.
I'll take him myself, all right?

956
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,376
I need you to go out there and tell my men
there's people here need to be carried.

957
01:42:23,459 --> 01:42:26,838
Can you do that?
All right, let's go. Let's go.

<i>Wait. Soldier,
there's sick men back there.</i>

962
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:37,033
Pajota's holding so far, but they're trying
to flank him 100 yards down the river.

963
01:43:37,116 --> 01:43:41,704
Better take a look. Japanese get across
that river, we'll never get these men out.

964

Everyone who can move,

Hold your fire.
Miller, gimme the flare gun.

<i>Let's go, let's go!
Move!</i>

Head to the gate.
Head to the gate.

975
01:45:21,971 --> 01:45:24,807
Dr. Fisher, sir, stay back.
It's not safe yet.

976
01:45:24,891 --> 01:45:27,810
All right, I'll be on
the other side of the road.

977

Here, let me give you a hand.

978
01:45:31,314 --> 01:45:33,149
Pull back!

979
01:45:33,233 --> 01:45:36,277
Pull back!
Daly, pull back!

980
01:45:36,736 --> 01:45:40,740

Go!

1001
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:28,056
Daly, hold him down!
I'm gonna flank him!

1002
01:47:41,653 --> 01:47:43,196
Son of a bitch.

Jimmy?

- Move me.
- All right.

1017

Get him to Platero.
Stay with him, understand?

- Yes, sir.
- Hang in there, Doc.

How many casualties?

1040

One KIA - Pfc Daly.

01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,984
And Doc Jimmy's wounded, too.

1042
01:53:13,067 --> 01:53:17,280
I think it's critical.
We moved him to Platero to operate.

1043
01:53:17,363 --> 01:53:20,366
I don't think he's gonna make it, sir.

1075

Congratulations, Captain Prince.

1089
01:59:18,892 --> 01:59:21,102
I'm very sorry about your losses.

1090
01:59:21,144 --> 01:59:24,272
I want you to know you have done
a great service for your country.

1091
01:59:24,355 --> 01:59:27,734
- Thank you, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1092
01:59:27,817 --> 01:59:30,445
- After you, Major.
- Nice job.

1093
01:59:34,741 --> 01:59:36,993
So...

1094
01:59:37,076 --> 01:59:39,078
how do you feel?

1095
01:59:39,162 --> 01:59:41,122
All right.

1096
01:59:42,665 --> 01:59:45,126
I'm proud of you.

1097
01:59:46,377 --> 01:59:48,379
Thank you, sir.

<i>Never in our history
had such a large group of men</i>

1099
02:00:01,434 --> 02:00:04,979
<i>endured so much
and complained so little.</i>

1100
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:09,943
<i>Many were unable to shake the belief
that their country had abandoned them.</i>

1101
02:00:10,026 --> 02:00:13,071
<i>Left them to die in a foreign land.</i>

1102
02:00:13,154 --> 02:00:16,241
<i>It was said to be
of no significance to the war effort.</i>

1103
02:00:16,324 --> 02:00:21,079
<i>Although for me. Saving them
was a way of setting things right.</i>

1104
02:00:21,162 --> 02:00:22,789
<i>It's true -</i>

1105
02:00:22,872 --> 02:00:25,333
<i>they had been left behind.</i>

1106
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:28,336
<i>But never forgotten.</i>
