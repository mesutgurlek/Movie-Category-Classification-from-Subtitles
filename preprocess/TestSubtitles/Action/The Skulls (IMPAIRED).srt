We got oatmeal.
We got ham.
We got omelets.

- I'll have a ham omelet.

4

More oatmeal, dude.
And try to keep it <i>on</i>

5
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,816
Yeah, dude, more oatmeal.
God, and try to keep it
on the plate this time.

Sometimes you can be
such a bitch.
Fascinating.

7

Hey, buddy. Come here.
I know it's 8:00 a. m...

and you haven't had
your triple-soy

9
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,418

of breeding should have
some manners.

10
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,123
I suggest you
apologize to the lady.

11
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,030
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

12

Oh, sophomores.
You gotta love 'em, huh?

Yes.
That would be lovely.

14

You gonna be there?

15
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,275

really riveting econ seminar...

16
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,505

of the gross national
product, so...

17

- I wouldn't want to miss that.
- Yeah, I would, actually.

18

Thank you, sir.

19

- I'll see you out there.
- Yes, indeed.

20

<i>Okay.</i>
<i>C. Wright Mills'</i>
The Power Elite.

21
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,032
The main thesis
is what?

22
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,934
<i>That at certain institutions,</i>
<i>elite groups are formed that'll</i>
<i>network the rest of their lives.</i>

23
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,372
<i>Then that brings us to</i>
<i>the question,</i>

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,204
<i>Is America really</i>
<i>a class society?</i>

25
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,805
<i>Or is it the meritocracy</i>
<i>we're taught it is since</i>
<i>we were in kindergarten?</i>

26
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,816
Mr. McNamara?

27
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,513
Um, well, actually,
I believe that it's
both, sir.

28
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,557
How can it be both?
It's been my experience...

29
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,720
that merit is
rewarded with wealth,
and with wealth comes class.

30
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,821
<i>Nice recovery,</i>
<i>Mr. McNamara.</i>
<i>[Students Chuckling]</i>

Like you give a shit, man.

33
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,896
I don't believe you, man.
I want you to
keep stealing cars.

34
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,198
When I'm a lawyer, I'm gonna
make a fortune defending
my high school buddies.

35

- I was thinking the same
about you.

<i>Things do change,</i>
<i>even for losers like us.</i>

- That's okay.

about secret societies
and how they're different
from fraternities...

158
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,570
because secret societies
are for life.

the Skulls, and he got
really uncomfortable...

[Chuckles]
Millions.

Like for instance,
who pays for all this?

487
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,515
Rule 46 in your book:

"Each member is required
to leave a percentage of
his estate to the Skulls."

the significance?

the ordeal of war...

Because he was selfish,

would give him everything
