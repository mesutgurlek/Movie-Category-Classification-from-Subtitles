- Yes?

00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,838
I think you've found something.

170
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,381
You see the cartouche there?

171
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,964
It's the official royal seal of Seti the First,
I'm sure of it.

172
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,050
- Perhaps.
- JONATHAN: Two questions.

173
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,886
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

174
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,313
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty,

175
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,140
said to be the wealthiest pharaoh
of them all.

176

Good. I Iike this fellow.

And if you Iook at the hieratic just here,
well, it's Hamunaptra.

CURATOR: Dear God, don't be ridiculous.

181

We're scholars, not treasure hunters.

182
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,951
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers

183
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,626
to amuse Greek and Roman tourists.

184
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:14,083
I know all the blather about the city
being protected by the curse of a mummy,

185
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,920
but my research has led me to believe
that the city itself may have actually existed.

186
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,054
- Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?
- Yes. The City of the Dead.

187
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,390
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt?

188
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,688
Yes, yes, in a big, underground
treasure chamber.

189
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,692
- Heh!
- Oh, come on. Everybody knows the story.

190
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,520
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command?

191
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,607
A flick of a switch, and the whole place
would disappear beneath the sand dunes,

192
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,941
taking the treasure with it?

193
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,948
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum.

194
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,451
Oh, my goodness! Look at that!

195
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,585
You'be burnt it!
You've burned off the part with the lost city?

196
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,921
It's for the best, I'm sure.

197
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,259
Many men have wasted their Iives
in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

198
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,432
No one's ever found it.

199
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,097
Most have never returned.

200
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,062

206

What exactly is this man in prison for?

209

This I did not know.

210
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,458
But when I heard that you were coming,
I asked him that myself.

211
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,164
And what did he say?

No. You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

the box pertains to Hamunaptra?

famous books in history is buried there.

the secret incantations of the old kingdom.

should ever arise,

he would bring with him

You know how he gets
his self fully regenerated?

957
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:09,623

- And sucking them dry!

playing with that.

959
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:17,006
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-Su-Namun.

960
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:22,048
And then juat now in Mr. Burns' quarters,
he tried to kiss me.

961
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,055
It's because of his love for Anck-Su-Namun
that he was cursed.

962
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:28,058
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years...
- He is still in love with her.

Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

964
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,017
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

965
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,147
Yes.

966
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,401
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.
