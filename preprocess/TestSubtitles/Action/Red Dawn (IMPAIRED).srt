You are the difference.

820
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,472
So how can we help?

821
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,146
What we can't figure out is how come
they're not crippled by their own weapon.

What is it?

827
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:00,672
It's how they talk to each other.
A closed network for communication.

828
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,283
So it can't be hacked.

829
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,077
But if we had it,

830
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,346
it'd be the foothold we need
to start pushing them out

We're going to secure the front door.

Don't worry about it. Marines don't die.
They just go to hell and regroup.

Matt, we got to move.

972
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:34,569
Let's just get back in the car.

973
01:24:34,663 --> 01:24:36,528
- Let's keep going.
- We can't.

974
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:39,632
They'll find us.

975
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:41,732
What else are we supposed to do?

976
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:52,203
Robert.

977
01:24:52,414 --> 01:24:54,405
Get me some gear.

978
01:24:54,717 --> 01:24:55,775
What?

979
01:24:56,085 --> 01:24:57,643
They could be here any minute.

980
01:25:03,559 --> 01:25:04,992
Daryl.

981
01:25:17,473 --> 01:25:19,031
Can I borrow your SAW?

982
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:17,425
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?

983
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:19,931
We got plenty of room.

984
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:23,705
I'm sorry for the loss of your men.

985
01:26:24,607 --> 01:26:26,302
We've all lost something, Matt.

986
01:26:28,777 --> 01:26:30,176
You've done enough.

987
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,374
You've done more than enough.

988
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:37,510
I appreciate that.

989
01:26:44,093 --> 01:26:45,924
The fact is

990
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:49,962
we're not doing too bad

991
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:52,326
for a bunch of kids.

992
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:55,128
We're going to fight.

993
01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:58,773
And we're going to keep fighting
because it's easier now.

994
01:26:58,974 --> 01:27:01,943
And we're used to it.

995
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,545
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.

996
01:27:05,748 --> 01:27:09,149
Because we're not going to sell it to you.

997
01:27:09,351 --> 01:27:12,047
It's too ugly for that.

998
01:27:12,788 --> 01:27:14,722
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

999
01:27:14,924 --> 01:27:17,757
when you're fighting for your family,

1000
01:27:18,494 --> 01:27:20,462
it all hurts a little less

1001
01:27:21,997 --> 01:27:23,726
and makes a little more sense.

1002
01:27:25,801 --> 01:27:30,295
<i>Because for them, this is just a place.</i>

1003
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,132
<i>But for us, this is our home.</i>

1004
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:36,971
PRISONERS: (CHANTING)
Wolverines!

1005
01:27:37,179 --> 01:27:38,305
Wolverines!

1006
01:27:38,514 --> 01:27:39,981
Wolverines!

1007
01:27:40,006 --> 01:27:42,006
