1
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,219
<i>Hello, Is this Randy Bates?</i>

2
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,370
Who wants to know?

3
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,339
This is Crazy Carl Cummings.

4
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:02,051
KZTS all-hits radio station.
Pride of the nation at 98.9.

5
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:06,016
<i>We've got a surprise for you just about
as big as Barry Manilow's beak,</i>

6
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:08,569
Are you sitting down?
Better yet, are you laying down?

7
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:12,097
Are you on a waterbed, all comfy?
Are you horizontal, Randy boy?

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,539
No, I'm sitting up,
but I think I can handle it.

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,372
Do you like country music?

10
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,610
I used to like Roy Acuff.

11
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,497
Roy Acuff? Would you take Dolly Parton
in a pinch?

12
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:25,855
I may be Crazy Carl, but I would.
But you won it.

13
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:30,168
An evening with Dolly Parton.

14
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:36,894
The evening begins with a pre-show dinner
for you and Miss Parton...

15
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:39,207
at the Hawaii Kai Room
of the Sheraton Barstow.

16
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:43,449
A backstage pass for you for Dolly's
big show at the Barstow War Memorial...

17
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,004
and then, a little dessert
at Massimino's Cafe.

18
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,849
And who knows whether
the evening will end there?

19
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,130
Because, Dolly, she's a powerful woman.

20
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,173
She's been on the road a long, long time.

21
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:55,564
All right.

22
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,204
- What's your favorite radio station?
- KZTS.

23
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,126
I can't hear you.

24
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,926
We'll pick you up at 6:00
in a long black limousine, baby.

25
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:12,445
Yeah, all right.

26
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,605
Dolly Parton? You turned a hard-core felon
into a trembling teenager.

27
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,444
What kind of indictment
did this guy skip out on?

28
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,441
Two counts of atrocious assault.

29
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,328
He found his wife in bed with a roadie
from ZZ Top and took a tire iron to both.

30
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,242
You must be awful tired,
you had a long drive to get here.

31
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,763
That's my job,
track them and snatch them.

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,116
I can't believe this guy is sitting there
expecting a limousine.

33
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,800
Good evening, sir. Congratulations.

34
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,115
Goddamn, I never won anything before.

35
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,354
Allow me.

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,512
I am ready to party hard.

37
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,397
I'm Tom Nowak. I've been empowered
by the State of California...

38
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,630
to return you to Sacramento
where you're due to stand trial.

39
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,309
You son of a bitch!

40
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,307
You son of a bitch!

41
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,421
What's your favorite radio station, Randy?

42
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:43,070
K-Suck, you dork!

43
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,626
Once we catch them, we never gloat.

44
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,623
Thank you, gents.

45
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,261
What kind of music do you like?

46
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:31,145
I sure as hell don't want to hear
no Roy Acuff, I'll tell you that.

47
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:32,783
Matter of fact...

48
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:36,460
I'd like to hear something
that sounds about as mean as I feel.

49
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,013
Why don't you just let me
pick it for you, then?

50
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,493
A Crazy Carl Cummings special.

51
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:51,218
<i>John Capshaw from Sacramento,</i>

52
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:59,579
<i>He's got a good start,
and Rampage is a tough one to ride,</i>

53
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,700
<i>It looks like he'll get big money
out of this rodeo,</i>

54
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:06,851
<i>Capshaw has gone down,
and the rodeo clowns move in,</i>

55
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,336
<i>Here's what clowns are all about,,,</i>

56
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,014
<i>as the bull takes it out on the barrel,</i>

57
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,532
Thanks, partner.

58
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:27,569
Nice ride, cowboy.

59
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:14,490
Tom, how are you doing?

60
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,880
Say, my favorite bloodhound.

61
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,566
I just did John Capshaw and I could
sure use the cash now, if you got it.

62
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,369
- You did Capshaw?
- How?

63
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,566
I'll tell you later. You got the money?

64
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,686
We're just ordering. Sit down.

65
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,159
You got to eat, for Christ's sake.

66
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:34,400
I'll have the Chief Justice Warren Burger,
well done.

67
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:36,561
Extra fries.

68
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,285
One Warren, burn it.

69
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,123
Have you got the money?
I got to visit someone.

70
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,199
You got to visit somebody?

71
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:47,606
Isn't that funny?

72
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:52,717
I never thought of Tommy Nowak
as the kind of guy who pays a social call.

73
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,157
Have you got the money?

74
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,155
All right.

75
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,560
Thanks.

76
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:12,079
Tell us how you did Capshaw.

77
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,999
He tricked the poor bastard.
That's what he did.

78
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,836
He snuck up
when the dude was half unconscious.

79
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,642
- Who are you?
- I'm Capshaw's lawyer, okay?

80
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:22,516
I'll tell you this...

81
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,800
there's a pretty thin line between
what you do and what some outlaws do.

82
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:31,955
Maybe a thin line, but it ain't invisible.

83
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:04,434
- Afternoon, Miss McGuinn.
- Afternoon, Mr. Barton.

84
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:07,557
When you going to take some sun?

85
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:10,833
You're about the palest thing
in the whole damn camp.

86
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:13,352
One of these days, Mr. Barton.

87
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:19,185
Remember when I gave you
our rent money on the first of the month...

88
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,709
- right on time?
- Remember?

89
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,229
It's a golden day in my book of memories.

90
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,987
First time since you and your husband
came here...

91
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,634
when you actually paid when it was due.

92
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,672
Can I have it back?

93
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,627
You're a really nice person, Mr. Barton.

94
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,506
Isn't he?

95
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:48,825
Hi, honey.

96
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,824
What's up?

97
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,303
Hi, honey.

98
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:17,143
- What's that?
- Leave that alone.

99
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,343
That's baby food money, Roy.

100
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,220
Not for shotguns, not for Wild Turkey.

101
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:29,935
Not so you can get wasted
on some kind of horse tranquilizer.

102
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:34,341
You're with me on that, right?

103
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:37,259
Do you hear, boys?
This is baby food money.

104
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,539
$120.

105
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,252
Would you help me with the baby?

106
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,580
Say, hey, Roy.

107
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,180
- We finally got it knocked, baby.
- Knocked?

108
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,654
Like that Amway franchise in the desert?
Or the oil field work in Alaska?

109
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,334
Or how about our famous
chinchilla farm, remember?

110
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,889
Make cash fast by raising chinchillas
for their pelts...

111
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,698
unless you leave the cage door open
and they run away.

112
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,973
I know I screwed up a lot of things...

113
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:27,371
but honest, we're on Dream Street now.

114
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:29,212
Come on.

115
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,731
How'd you make this money?

116
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:50,527
We didn't make it.
Some friends of ours did.

117
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,773
- It's counterfeit?
- State of the art, baby.

118
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,212
This is the big time.

119
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,052
Listen to me.

120
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:08,212
You do six months for selling hot VCRs,
I'm still here when you get out.

121
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,807
I waited for you.
But I didn't count on these prison buddies.

122
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,488
Please, for the baby's sake,
get rid of these psychos.

123
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,284
They scare me.

124
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,203
Psychos? These guys?

125
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:25,050
Let me keep the money here a few days.
I'll find a good hiding place for it.

126
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,519
I know I screwed up
some things in the past...

127
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,487
but this is idiot-proof.

128
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,278
Doesn't it seem just a little strange
that this woman...

129
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,723
who has no previous record at all...

130
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,880
is the only person being indicted
for possession of counterfeit money?

131
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,043
Your Honor, she was the only one home
at the time of the raid.

132
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:57,243
And she refuses to tell us
anything about the crime.

133
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:00,403
One could hardly blame
the woman, Mr. Hastings...

134
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:04,916
when she's got a Folsom Prison
class reunion...

135
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,916
going on right behind her.

136
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:14,320
If Your Honor pleases, these gentlemen
have come to post bond for the defendant.

137
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:19,035
We believe that the counterfeit money
we found in that trailer...

138
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:21,796
is just the tip of the iceberg.
There are other moneys...

139
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,442
and other crimes involved.
So we ask the court...

140
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:27,161
to set the bond with these facts in mind.

141
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,915
The court sets bail at $25,000.

142
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,356
We can cover that action, baby.

143
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,876
Your Honor, Mrs. McGuinn
prefers to seek bail...

144
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,915
from a recognized bail bondsman.

145
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,475
What do you got for me, Buddy?

146
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,789
I told you. I got Little Walter Drucker.

147
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:59,553
The schmuck who gave me
this defective microwave for collateral.

148
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:03,391
He is sitting downtown
at the Golden Bear Motel...

149
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:06,469
waiting to be plucked
like an apple on a tree.

150
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,665
Why don't you let
one of the kids handle him?

151
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,634
There's no fun
in the Walter Druckers of the world.

152
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:14,270
Fun?

153
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,514
Mr. Bring-them-back-alive
wants a big fun-fix.

154
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,472
If I may quote
the immortal Olivia Newton-John:

155
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,750
"Have you never been mellow?"

156
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:33,026
I know what you can do.
You can fill out mileage reports.

157
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:35,673
Justify all the money
I am giving you for gasoline.

158
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,629
Will you do that for me?

159
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,429
I asked you a question.

160
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,142
And I didn't give you an answer.

161
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:48,702
So, you can do Walter Drucker.

162
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,101
"Hell, no. That's no fun."

163
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,226
You could fill out mileage eports.

164
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,428
"Hell, no. That's too much like a real job."

165
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,340
You can jump on Mary Ellen Chesbro:

166
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:05,342
The beautiful court stenographer who's
been mooning over you for two years.

167
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:09,181
"Hell, no. She might get her hooks in me."

168
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:11,667
Come on, Tommy!

169
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:16,140
Do Walter Drucker.
For once in your life, be reasonable.

170
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,376
I tried that once. I didn't like it.

171
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,059
How's that baby?

172
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,264
I had to leave her with my sister
over in Nevada.

173
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:35,224
Sure was sorry to hear about the arrest.

174
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:37,535
Are they gonna take the baby away?

175
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:40,343
I mean, after they find you guilty and all?

176
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,375
I don't know, Mr. Barton.

177
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,613
Sure is a fine machine.

178
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:50,021
Every boy's dream. A pink Cadillac.

179
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,335
You know what Elvis said.

180
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:04,051
Roy never drove this thing.
Never even had the top down.

181
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,253
And you ask me
why I never get any sun on my face.

182
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,496
I don't mean to interfere...

183
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,531
in your marriage...

184
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,211
but it's dangerous
messing around with a man's vehicles.

185
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,692
You're right about that, Mr. Barton.

186
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,533
Very right.

187
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,567
Come back here, damn it!

188
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,805
What are you going to do now?

189
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,401
Or you can explain it to Alex.
He'll pass judgment.

190
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:22,441
Yeah, okay.

191
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,436
But I'm worn out.
Don't you have any speed?

192
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:34,554
Diet pills? What the hell am I supposed
to do with supermarket diet pills?

193
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,273
You can gobble the whole box
as far as I'm concerned.

194
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,828
I'm not gonna waste good crystal
on you now.

195
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,558
Maybe if you find Lou Ann.

196
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:08,067
Hell of an escape, Lou Ann.

197
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,225
You are about the palest thing.

198
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,667
<i>Obviously a hardened criminal,</i>

199
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,030
I can tell by the Kewpie bow lips.

200
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:25,232
Who cares about her lips? She walked out
on a bond of $25,000. She's a fugitive.

201
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,784
You want her or not?
For me it's all the same.

202
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,864
I want her. You got a priors on her?

203
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:34,663
Her old man has all the priors,
but I didn't post bond for the old man.

204
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:38,982
Did they run together by any chance?

205
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,461
Actually, you might have competition
from the hubby.

206
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,588
She's more scared of him
than she is of the law.

207
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,786
Why's that?

208
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:51,864
He's involved with that gang of ex-cons,
you know, the Birthright.

209
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,819
Birthright?

210
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:03,826
No, Buddy. I want you to understand me.

211
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:07,465
Watch the rhythmic movement
of my lips as I tell you...

212
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:11,097
- I'm not going to take this assignment.
- Come on, I need you.

213
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:13,936
Do you know what I was saying
to somebody yesterday?

214
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:16,666
I swear I said, "Tommy Nowak...

215
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:20,103
"he can track down a shadow
in the middle of the night."

216
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,097
I happen to track fugitives, Buddy.

217
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:26,065
I don't go around aftr whacked-out
ex-cons that carry automatic weapons.

218
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:30,373
But I bet those guys
from the Birthright are saying:

219
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:34,014
"Let's waste this broad
before she turns state's evidence."

220
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,017
I mean, it probably
is the first time in your life...

221
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,698
that you can serve the cause of justice.

222
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:41,779
Yeah.

223
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,580
What? I happen to love our legal system.

224
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:50,297
As long as it keeps you
in diamonds and Sonys.

225
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:55,292
You're saving her by catching her.

226
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,375
So, where are you going to start looking?

227
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,811
It says here she's got a sister
that lives out near Reno.

228
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,093
- Reno?
- Might as well start there.

229
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,854
But watch the mileage, would you?

230
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,214
Stay clear of the Birthright!

231
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:21,632
Speed and wine!

232
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:23,599
Give me some of that stuff.

233
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:28,481
I want that stuff that killed Hank Williams,
I just don't want quite that much.

234
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,555
What are you yelling for, Roy?

235
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,636
Do you think you've earned the right
to have a good time?

236
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,153
No.

237
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:24,352
What's your problem, Roy?

238
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:27,271
No problem, Alex.

239
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,982
Tell me.

240
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:32,426
I don't...

241
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,551
I don't like...

242
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:42,304
"I don't like seeing Lou Ann out there
in Silhouette City."

243
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:49,464
I always know
what you're thinking, don't I?

244
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,545
Yeah.

245
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,667
Go ahead. Take it down.

246
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:58,497
Go ahead.

247
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:12,782
Stop!

248
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,820
Turn around.

249
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,179
Do you trust me?

250
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,215
Yes, sir.

251
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:26,182
Go stand in your wife's picture.

252
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,852
Now, here's the point.

253
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,057
I need at least a dozen more
full automatic weapons...

254
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,892
to start building the arsenal of my dreams.

255
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,935
The arsenal of our dreams.

256
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:19,133
Yeah.

257
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:25,533
But our weapons budget,
our communications budget...

258
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,132
just about our whole budget
is driving around in the desert...

259
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,776
with your wife.

260
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:36,296
Now, are you man enough
to go get it back?

261
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,373
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Good.

262
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:43,454
I thought so.

263
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:46,250
Waycross, why don't you go help him out?

264
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,924
- What should I do about...
- The female?

265
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,531
Use your best judgment.

266
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,003
Look at this gorgeous girl.

267
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:11,170
If this cash was genuine, I'd have
your Harvard education all paid for.

268
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,840
$253,000.

269
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:16,608
That'd just about do it.

270
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,681
This sure does look real.

271
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,281
Why don't you cut loose this one time?

272
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:29,044
Take this play money into Reno
and give yourself a weekend on the town.

273
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,928
What are you talking about?
I just got here.

274
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:40,361
Lou Ann, honey, you're a fugitive.

275
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:47,998
We figured, if anybody comes after you,
this might be their first stop.

276
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:50,964
It's best we scater for a while
until this thing blows over.

277
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,163
We'll take the baby to my folks' house.
She'll be safe there.

278
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:57,715
You just go on in to Reno.
Have yourself a good time.

279
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,479
And get some sun while you're at it.

280
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:13,201
Bye, baby. I love you. Yes.

281
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:19,072
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- We'll see you in a couple of days.

282
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,072
Bye.

283
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,799
Bye, honey. I love you. Don't forget me.

284
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:04,710
You seen a blonde in a pink Cadillac?

285
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:08,068
Only in my dreams.

286
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:19,188
Pack them.

287
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:23,868
Aren't you gonna treat yourself
to some new clothes?

288
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:26,786
We mustn't let our babies
get more glamorous than us.

289
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:30,391
Maybe just one dress.

290
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:34,703
Ring these up.
I'm going to show her to ladies' wear.

291
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:37,303
- And the shoe department.
- Good.

292
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:04,052
I'll go! Give me the dice while I'm hot.

293
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:07,691
Let's go again.

294
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,489
Coming up. Eight!

295
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:17,449
- Okay, give me the dice.
- Your skin is soft.

296
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,562
Fellow, leave the lady alone.

297
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,882
Leave me alone while I'm holding the dice.
Give me those dice. Okay!

298
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:26,043
You can't do it.

299
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:28,607
I'm going to double it!

300
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:32,123
Seven, out.

301
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:34,641
Oh, no. I lost.

302
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:36,767
Your skin...

303
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:39,806
it is so soft. Like Velveeta.

304
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:42,677
You know Velveeta?

305
00:32:43,807 --> 00:32:46,685
Yeah. You think my skin
looks like processed cheese.

306
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:08,916
May I see you for a moment?
Right this way. Thank you.

307
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,678
Sit down over here, Mrs. McGuinn.

308
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:17,161
Somebody got you some nice threads,
didn't they?

309
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:19,954
Recognize this woman?

310
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:24,279
She looks familiar.

311
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:27,150
Like someone who never really
got a break.

312
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:30,632
Someone who might go crazy for a day.
I wouldn't judge her.

313
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,874
You're a cop?

314
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,514
Not exactly.

315
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,832
What do you mean, not exactly?
Who the hell are you?

316
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,398
I'm a skip tracer.

317
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,118
I work for the bail bondsman
who put up your bond.

318
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:53,108
Why didn't you have your husband
and his friends put up the money?

319
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:58,952
If you're taking me back, let's get going.

320
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,471
I can't take much more
of this Elvis tribute.

321
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:14,506
If you don't mind me saying,
you look dressed to kill tonight.

322
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:16,864
I'm dressed to torture, killing's too good.

323
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,785
Could you hold that a second?

324
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:21,749
My purse!

325
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,989
You creep! Just give me back my...

326
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,782
Thanks.

327
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:34,787
I got a warrant for that woman.

328
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:12,140
Here's fine.

329
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:25,065
Didn't think anyone
could run that fast in heels.

330
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:26,942
Tina Turner taught me.

331
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:31,938
Look, mister, I got an 8-month-old baby...

332
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:35,141
I don't even want to hear about it.
I'm just a delivery boy.

333
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:38,456
Where are the handcuffs?

334
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:43,059
Yo're not gonna handcuff me? Aren't you
into the whole bondage part of the job?

335
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,461
Lady, I don't even like starch in my collars.

336
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,689
You wouldn't take bail money
from the Birthright...

337
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,534
but you managed to spend some
of that counterfeit cash around town.

338
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:11,931
It's not so complicated.

339
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,494
I had the whole thing figured out.

340
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:16,296
It's for my daughter.

341
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:21,368
I was going to take a little bit
of the make-believe money...

342
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:24,216
and win a lot of the real money...

343
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:26,530
at the tables.

344
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:29,411
It's dumb.

345
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:33,415
It sounds like
one of my husband's great ideas.

346
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:35,687
He sounds really swift.

347
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:39,687
How'd you get tied up with him
in the first place?

348
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,648
Believe it or not, Roy was the coolest boy
in San Bernardino...

349
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,325
about 40,000 Heinekens ago.

350
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,688
He said I was marrying James Dean.

351
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:58,287
I ended up with an amphetamine junkie.

352
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:02,881
You don't know how many women I talk to
who tell the same story.

353
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,927
Look...

354
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:11,160
I have $250,000
of very high-quality counterfeit cash...

355
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,719
Forget it. I wouldn't take it if it was real.

356
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,802
Shut up and listen to me.
I didn't mean it that way.

357
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,690
- You didn't?
- I didn't mean it that way.

358
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,562
I thought that if I gave the money
to the cops, they might go easy on me.

359
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:28,641
We could go back and pick it up.

360
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:32,687
Helping you with your legal case
is absolutely none of my business.

361
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:35,687
My job is just to follow you, find you...

362
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:38,563
and Federal Express you back home.

363
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,520
The three F's?

364
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,918
I could use a little help.

365
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,116
This is so wrong.

366
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:48,951
Stand aside.

367
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:52,953
It makes a really good hiding place.

368
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:05,667
It kind of reminds you of going
to the drive-in movie, doesn't it?

369
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,672
Parking in the woods...

370
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,827
listening to the crickets off in the distance.

371
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:17,906
- The howling of the wolves...
- Will you shut up?

372
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:20,191
The baying of the dogs.

373
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:25,223
You just have to play
that little-girl-lost routine, don't you?

374
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:29,104
"I'm just a fugitive felon.

375
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:31,986
"That doesn't mean I'm not feminine.

376
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,302
"I just need a strong man to help me.

377
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:37,270
"I guess that makes me
like a Cosmo fugitive."

378
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:42,423
Buddy. Look, I asked you for a favor.
You said okay.

379
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,899
You don't have to go making fun of me.

380
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm through taking shit from men.

381
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,385
That's one thing we have in common.

382
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:55,347
Because I'm through
taking shit from men, too.

383
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:10,736
It's a little late
to try to head out to Sacramento now.

384
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:29,743
Come on in. Make yourself comfortable.

385
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,343
Those are gone.

386
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:37,939
Put your sack down. Take a load off.

387
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,970
Buddy? It's me, in Reno.

388
00:40:56,901 --> 00:41:00,211
I haven't found her yt.
I've got the scent, though.

389
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,373
I'll probably find her tomorrow
or the next day.

390
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,688
Will you forget about the mileage?
I'm tired of talking about mileage.

391
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:13,537
I'll call you in the morning
no matter what happens.

392
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:20,776
Why did you lie?

393
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:32,055
It just seemed easier
than explaining things.

394
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,685
Would you care for something
from our complimentary mini-bar?

395
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,689
Yeah.

396
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:47,807
I forgot that's the way it is
with these joints.

397
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:51,648
They get you half in the bag,
and you forget how to play the game.

398
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:02,001
Maybe one Cuervo. Just a short one.

399
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:12,002
We'll keep the drapes open,
so it won't get too dark in here.

400
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,721
What's the matter? Are you nervous?

401
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:25,045
Are your palms all sweaty?

402
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,763
Can you help me with my zipper?

403
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:41,802
Thanks.

404
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,315
Going somewhere?

405
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:19,198
I was just getting a glass of water.
I have a little gas.

406
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:24,876
Feel good?

407
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:38,833
Thank you.

408
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,789
Look at these little jellies.

409
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:51,151
No, it's mine.

410
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,668
It's mine. That's for the bill.

411
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:57,065
That's for you.

412
00:43:57,196 --> 00:43:59,187
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:04,270
I'm a big tipper.

414
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,108
- Let's look at some of this play dough.
- No.

415
00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:11,147
I have had no trouble
spending any of that money.

416
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:14,627
- I can see why. It's real.
- It can't be.

417
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:16,263
It's real.

418
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:19,709
- How do you know?
- I just know.

419
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:23,621
I think these guys
must have come across...

420
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:27,626
high-grade counterfeit money. They've
been exchanging it for the real stuff.

421
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:32,505
The money in your trailer
was probably the last of the fake stuff.

422
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,909
This is Grade A, U.S. Government green.

423
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:39,100
You mean...

424
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,147
I've been running around...

425
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,383
with $250,000...

426
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,423
in real money?

427
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:51,384
Yep.

428
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,383
Birthright money?

429
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:02,212
Oh, God.

430
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:06,333
What's going to happen to me?

431
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:12,970
What's going to happen to my baby?

432
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,538
I've got a job to do.

433
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,617
We better hit the road.

434
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:35,009
America for Americans!

435
00:45:44,537 --> 00:45:46,334
Did you get the female?

436
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:51,135
What about the money?

437
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:02,853
You two have put me
on a very low-budget level.

438
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:06,172
Now, I tried to have some pamphlets
made up cheaply.

439
00:46:06,454 --> 00:46:09,810
Waycross, why don't you come up here
and take a look at this?

440
00:46:19,772 --> 00:46:22,411
"Niggers," blah, blah, blah...

441
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:25,447
"Spics, gooks taking our jobs."

442
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:28,089
Blah, blah, blah.

443
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:30,122
"Conspiracy of the Jews."

444
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:34,447
- It's not very good.
- Why don't you tell everyone why?

445
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,279
Well, first of all, the printing stinks.

446
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,088
I mean, "niggers" is all blurred...

447
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:43,320
and now and here you got "Jews"
runnng off into the margin.

448
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:45,528
You got that right.

449
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,720
- You think that's funny?
- I mean...

450
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:56,522
Imagine...

451
00:46:56,927 --> 00:47:01,000
trying to recruit new members
with amateurish crap like this.

452
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:02,959
There's no way, Alex.

453
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:06,634
You are going to Silhouette City.

454
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:20,718
All right!

455
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,323
He's a warrior.

456
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:27,758
Good.

457
00:47:30,323 --> 00:47:32,120
Now I feel some unity.

458
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:34,599
Now I feel some power.

459
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:39,634
Not just a bunch of small-time car thieves,
penny ante codeine junkies...

460
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:43,596
wife beaters,
drifters without a clue in this world...

461
00:47:44,481 --> 00:47:45,880
but warriors.

462
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:49,274
Ready to seize everything
that's been denied them.

463
00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:00,437
Why don't you go back
to that sister's house and wait?

464
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:04,398
I guarantee you, within five days
we will have all our money back.

465
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,233
And we will deal with the female.

466
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:16,146
You see that? That's God.

467
00:48:16,277 --> 00:48:19,349
God caused that flat tire.
He doesn't want you to take me back.

468
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:21,825
- God's into blowing tires now?
- Yes.

469
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:25,545
I'm just asking for two more days.

470
00:48:25,715 --> 00:48:28,627
We can go to my sister's house
and I can see my baby again.

471
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:31,832
Don't you know
I've already gone clinically insane?

472
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:36,787
Taking you back here to get the money,
interfering with your case.

473
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:39,788
Ever since I met you,
I've been breaking the law.

474
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:42,592
What the hell is the law anyway?

475
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:45,751
The same people who make the law,
break the law every day.

476
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,631
I am not talking about their law,
I am talking about my law.

477
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:49,747
Fine!

478
00:48:52,272 --> 00:48:54,183
Then follow your own law.

479
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:13,620
<i>What do you mean the trail went cold?
Tom, you're too good,</i>

480
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:16,543
I'm having serious trouble with this.

481
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:19,337
Wait, don't hang up. All right.

482
00:49:20,788 --> 00:49:24,906
Since you've driven all the way to Reno,
Nevada, you might as well do Jack Bass.

483
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:28,978
We got a tip that he's been
hanging around Harrah's lately.

484
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,341
Yeah.

485
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:31,736
Okay.

486
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:33,979
Wait, Tom.

487
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:38,214
<i>Do you know what
cherchez la femme means?</i>

488
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:42,097
It's French for dig up the broad,
already. Okay?

489
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:45,695
I've always admired your way
with a Continental phrase.

490
00:49:51,784 --> 00:49:54,298
I've got a new case. A real mean dude.

491
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:57,983
What the hell am I going to do with you?

492
00:49:58,063 --> 00:50:00,531
Take me along. Maybe I can help.

493
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:13,737
Oh, God. Give me a break.

494
00:50:13,821 --> 00:50:17,131
Too much raw dude for you, babe?
I can dig it.

495
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,299
If my life were a movie,
there'd be a sign on it saying:

496
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,850
"Caution: Some scenes too intense
for younger viewers."

497
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:27,528
Okay.

498
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,373
Let's say this act of yours works
and you catch this Bass character.

499
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,972
- We catch this bastard, doll face.
- Yeah.

500
00:50:34,258 --> 00:50:36,374
We catch him. What did he do, anyhow?

501
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,528
He stabbed a dealer down in Vegas.

502
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,160
Imagined he was cheating him,
and went crazy with a 10-inch blade.

503
00:50:44,337 --> 00:50:46,168
Where are we gonna try and catch him?

504
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:49,613
I hear he's been hanging around Harrah's
the last few nights.

505
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:54,292
What'll you do when you catch him?

506
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,093
I'm gonna apprehend him.

507
00:50:56,735 --> 00:50:59,044
Turn him over to the local authorities.

508
00:50:59,575 --> 00:51:01,964
Without getting to know
anything about him.

509
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:04,284
Nothing about his personal life.

510
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:08,367
I don't want to know about his brother,
his mother, his sister...

511
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,249
I don't want to know
about the family pets...

512
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,642
the pet parakeet, the dog, the cat.

513
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:16,691
I don't want to know diddly-shit.

514
00:51:22,812 --> 00:51:25,645
Wait for my signal.
And remember your line.

515
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:29,488
Hello, Jack. I'm Miss Reno Casino.

516
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:01,286
This is where you want to be. Big jackpot.

517
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:02,435
Big payoffs.

518
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:07,078
Come on in and try your luck.
This is where you want to be.

519
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,760
If you feel lucky,
this is where you want to play...

520
00:52:09,845 --> 00:52:12,200
because the action never stops.
Come on in.

521
00:52:24,403 --> 00:52:25,756
What do you think?

522
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:30,438
Looks like a penis, only smaller.

523
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:40,391
If you're feeling lucky,
this is the place to be.

524
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:42,392
Because the action never stops.

525
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:46,269
If you're hungry, step right up,
come in and try one of our restaurants.

526
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,750
This is it, folks. This is the place
you want to be. Big payoffs.

527
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,477
Here he is, Mr. Hassleback.
Our one-millionth customer.

528
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,996
What a fine specimen of a man he is, too.

529
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:58,831
Yes, Mr. Lucky One Million.

530
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:01,911
Sorry we don't have
a brass band for you, Mr...

531
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:04,193
- Jack Bass.
- Jack Bass.

532
00:53:04,278 --> 00:53:06,269
No brass for Mr. Bass.
