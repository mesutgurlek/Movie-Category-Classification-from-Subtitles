Nothing. How we doing?

Oh, we're ready.

[man 2] It's OK, it's OK.

So...

32
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:55,259
...if we know that sound waves
gain wavelength...

through more dense materials...

36
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,562
...then the anomalies in these waves...

37
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,025
...are the means
by which we can surmise

38
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,610
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

- How are the nails coming, Christine?
- [laughter]

40
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,038
Good. All right,
let's have a demonstration.

41
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,541
Mr. Acker, Veronica.
Thank you very much.

stories, big romantic. Loves Chet.

45

I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

46
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,848
Watch the oscilloscope, all right?

47
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,600
Here we go.

48

- Maybe.

51
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,281
- Yes or no, sir?
- The first one.

52
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,033
Please come with us, sir.

53
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:08,249
- [stammers] Guys, what's going on?
- We don't know, sir.

54
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,334
What do you mean, you don't know?

55
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,170
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

56
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,922
I have security clearance?

57
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,133
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

58

[man speaking French]

60
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,153
Hey, Serge.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,197
Serge. Serge.

62
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,368
Damn! It's about time.
You're always late.

63
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,204
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

64
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,708
What am I doing here? They wouldn't
brief me until you got here.

65
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,712
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military. I hate them.

66
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,548
When are you going to meet a nice girl
and bring her for dinner?

67
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,175
- I'm married to my work.
- So am I.

68
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:04,430
Which makes my wife my mistress.
That's why I'm still in love with her.

69
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,142
- You were always a romantic.
- I love my wife.

70
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,145
- Yeah, I know. I love your wife, too.
- I know.

71
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,230
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

72
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,398
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

73
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,358
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

74
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,235
- Ah, the cheese.
- [both laugh]

75
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:22,156
- You're... you're teasing me, right?
- Oh, my...!

76
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,991
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

77
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,784
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

78
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,412
- Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
- [man] No.

79
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,165
If you were in the wrong place,
you would've already been shot.

80
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,918
- That's a hell of a greeting.
- Serge.

81
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,504
- Serge.
- Serge. Yes. Always a pleasure.

82
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,673
Same here, Thomas.
Dr. Keyes.

83
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,343
I know. Tom Purcell.

84
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,012
Gentlemen, you do realise
that everything here

85
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,389
is totally classified, OK?

86
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,644
At 10.30 a.m. local time,

87
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,773
32 civilians,
all within a ten-block radius...

88
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,858
...died.

89
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,693
They didn't get sick first.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,447
- They simply hit the ground dead.
- Nerve agent?

91
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,699
- [Tom] Our first guess. No.
- They all died at the same time?

92
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,077
[Tom] As far as we can tell,
to the second.

93
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,621
This hits CNN in one hour.
I need a reason.

94
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,332
[Serge] Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

95
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,167
They all had pacemakers.

96
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,380
Under a minute.
Your reputation is well-deserved.

97
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,258
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Tom] How did you guess,

98
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,719
- without any clues from the victims?
- No, that's...

99
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,262
Serge and I are the clues.

100
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,557
I mean, he specialises in high energy
weapons. I do geomagnetics.

101
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,269
So calling us means you suspect
an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

102
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,148
If these are the only fatalities,
they must be people susceptible to...

103
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,026
- ...electronic interference.
- QED pacemakers.

104
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,779
- You're spooky sometimes?
- [Tom] Now, I need to know,

105
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,156
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

106
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,034
The power that you would need
to create an EM pulse strong enough...

107
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,120
I mean, that's... that's not a weapon
that I've ever heard of.

108
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,123
- No.
- OK, we're done.

109
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,669
We're not done, sir. There's nothing
on the other side of the equal sign.

110
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,712
- I agree with Joshua...
- Thank you.

111
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,965
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

112
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,844
but since it's not, I think we can all
breathe a little easier, can't we?

113

- Mm. Strange, indeed.

00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,845
- of the Earth to lay the field over.
- Whoa, the planet Earth?

157
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,514
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

158
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,393
Map out the anomalies that Acker finds
and grunt out the equations.

159
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,314
And... grab those smelly kids
from the Non-Linear Diff class, too.

160
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,982
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

161
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,401
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

162
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,695
- [Danni] Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded. Do not pass Go.

163
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,906
Go directly to PhD.

164
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,539
Be wrong. Be wrong.

165
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,716
[typing on keyboard]

166
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,306
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.
Give me some drag, will you?

167
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,766
Roger that.

168
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,146
[clears throat]

169
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,653
We are in attitude and ready
for entry interface.

170
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,447
Nice work, Major.

171
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,866
I have the controls now for E.I.

172
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,160
I could take us in.

173
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,662
You could... but you won't.

174
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,666
- I'm ready for this, Bob.
- Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,628
You're trained, and you're certified.
Doesn't make you the commander.

176
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,173
And the commander lands the bird.
You got to be the youngest person

177
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,342
ever in space. You should say,
thank you, be happy. Now.

178
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:44,473
[man] Endeavour, Houston, at this time
we show you go for re-entry.

179

- Endeavour, this is Flight.</i>

181
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,565
Weren't able to annoy the commander
into letting you bring her in this time?

182
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,859
That's a negative, Stick. I'll
have to be more annoying next time.

183
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,694
- Is that even possible?
- [laughs]

184
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,489
[man] Endeavour, we see you
in good entry config.

00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,755
We are out of position here.

197
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,632
Guidance shows us on energy
and on course.

198
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,468
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

199
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,345
- We're not where we should be.
- Where the hell are we?

200
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,349
[Stick] Endeavour, guidance is bad.

201
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,102
You are now 1-2-niner miles off course.

202
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,437
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed. Is that...?

203
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,523
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

204
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,025
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

205
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,069
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

206
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,280
Doesn't make sense. The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

207
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,032
We're heading straight for downtown.

208
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,742
We're not gonna crash
into Los Angeles.

209
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,328
They're going to hit
downtown LA at 300 knots.

210
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,000
Bob, you know LA?
Because I have an idea.

211
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,127
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

212
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,589
- Can you clear a freeway?
- OK, thank you.

213
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,132
Come on. Come on.

214
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,261
It's rush hour, Commander,
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

215
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,474
Sir, I have an alternate.
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

216
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,059
It's Houston's call. Houston?

217
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,440
- Computers are still plotting.
- Come on.

Houston, we are running
out of time here.

00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,130
- Sir, I have an alternate.
- All right, Beck, what do you got?

222
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,258
Houston, I have coordinates for an
alternate landing site. Can you confirm?

223
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,677
<i>- Endeavour, give them to me.
- I show possible touchdown</i>

224
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,889

225
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,102
- [Stick] Bill?
- It's theoretically possible.

226
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,021
<i>Endeavour, that is confirmed.</i>

227
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,192
<i>Turn right, heading 1-7-5.
Expect visual contact</i>

228
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,611
<i>with Los Angeles River in five seconds.</i>

229
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,869
No, that will not work, Houston.
We got bridges every few hundred yards.

230
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,663
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

231
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,456
I've figured the "L" over "D" max.

232
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,166
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

233
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,417
We're coming in high and hot.

234

- Arm the gear.

- Gear down. Now.

This isn't going to be subtle.

Get out of the way! Move!

00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:34,995

- [Bob] Inward.

00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,049
- Deploy the chute.
- No. We'd snag the bridge.

246
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,217
We'll tear the tail off.

247
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,805
Banking right.

[Beck] Commander, that next bridge!

Watch it! We're way too high
for that one!

250
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,026
- Suck up the gear!
- Not yet. We'll lose all steering.

We hit, it's over!

252
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,658
And... gear up now!

253
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,624

307
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,916
Conrad Zimsky. Herr Zimsky.

308
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,002
Superstar.

309
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,922
Ahh. [exhales]

310
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,260
I think I skipped drunk.

311
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,512
Went right to hangover.

312
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,890
[low-tempo music plays]

313
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,643
I spoke with the kids.

314
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,937
They don't sleep at night.

315
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:39,817
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

316
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,572
- Is there any chance you're wrong?
- No. The sky, man.

317
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,282
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

318
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,286
- That's high-altitude static discharge.
- I know.

319
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,497
[man] Dr. Keyes...

320
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,667
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

321
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,713
Ahh! It's my best buddies. Hey!

322
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,673
Why don't you join us for a drink?

323
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,259
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

324
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,136
And if I were to say no?

325
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,596
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

326
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,058
- Well, we have no sense of humour.
- That's true.

327
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,396
- Oh.
- And we're armed.

328
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,025
Thank you.

329
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,656
- [Tom] Dr. Keyes, welcome.
- Thank you.

330
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,076
Dr. Zimsky informs us
that you made a useful contribution

331
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,663
to his investigations, so he wanted you
to assist him with the briefing.

332
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,165
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

333
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,168
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

334
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,673
Now, why don't you begin,
and I'll fill in all the difficult bits.

335
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,426
[clears throat]

336
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,012
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

337
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,057
[sighs] Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

338
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,644
And let me explain why.

339
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,523
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

340
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,359
It's made up of
electricity and magnetism,

341
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,821
so it's called, creatively enough,
the electromagnetic field.

342
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,240
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

343
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,410
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

344
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,205
- So this EM field is our friend.
- But now...?

345
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,292
But now, that field is falling apart.

346
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,211
- Why?
- [scoffs] Why?

347
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,756
This here.

348
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,720
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

349
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,309
Uh... Quick and dirty.

350
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:41,355
The thin skin, that's the Earth's crust.
That's what we live on.

351
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,357
It's 30 miles thick.

352
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,486
The meat here, call it the mantle.

353
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,907
And forgetting all the funky
transitions, it's 2,000 miles thick.

354
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:56,287
The core, the peach pit
in the centre, that's a tricky one.

355
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,248
There's two parts:
the inner core and the outer core.

356
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:03,586
Are you following me?
The inner core is...

357
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,756
Well, it's a big solid chunk of iron,
we think.

358
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,259
And that's surrounded by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

359
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,054
Yes, but, most importantly,

360
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,098
this liquid is constantly spinning
in one direction.

361
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,559
So a trillion trillion tons of hot metal

362
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:22,021
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

363
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,231
Right, so, Physics 101:

364
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,942
Hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

365
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,363
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine that drives the EM Field.

366
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,616
And that's where we have our problem.

367
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,618
This engine has stalled.

368
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,288
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

369
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,959
- How could this have happened?
- [people murmuring]

370
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,337
We don't know.

371
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,550
What's the timeline here?

372
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,427
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

373
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,263
we'll start seeing isolated incidents.

374
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,057
One plane will fall from the sky,
and then two, and then...

375
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,477
...in a few months, anything,
everything electronic will be fried.

376
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,981
Static discharges in the atmosphere
will create superstorms

377
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,567
with hundreds of lightning strikes
per square mile.

378
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,485
After that, it gets bad.

379
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,865
The Earth's EM Field
shields us from the solar winds,

380
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:19,495
which are a lethal blend of radioactive
particles and microwaves.

381
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,999
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

382
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:27,545
will literally cook our planet.

383
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,171
Dr. Zimsky.

384
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,967
- [clears throat]
- This is the sun.

385
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,972
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

386
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,599
- Would you?
- Mm-hm.

387
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,862
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

388
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:56,198
A full year, the field collapses...

389
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,700
...and that.

390
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,873
May I?

391
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,960
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

392
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,089
So... how do we fix it?

393
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,175
- We can't.
- Not in my vocabulary.

394
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,551
Then you might want
to get one of those

395
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,220
word-a-day calendars, General,
because it's impossible.

396
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,140
The core is the size of Mars. You're
talking about jumpstarting a planet.

397
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,392
This is a superheated hyper-fluid

398
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,103
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

399
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,231
2,000 miles down, 1,000 miles thick.

400
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,194
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

401
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,613
- with a two-inch drill bit.
- If we can go into space,

402
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,240
- we certainly...
- Well, space is easy. It's empty.

403
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,077
We're talking about millions of pounds
of pressure per square inch.

404
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,996
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

405
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,375
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

406
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,169
[Zimsky] Yes, but...

407
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,176
...what if we could?

408
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,147
Hello, Braz.

409
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,401
Why the hell aren't you dead yet?

410
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,112
OK, this way.

411
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,117
Oh. That went better than I expected.

412
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,619
Dr. Brazzelton,
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

413
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:09,415
Yeah. Twenty years ago,
he stole my research. [laughs]

414
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:13,794
- After that, we kind of lost touch.
- Research that was equally mine.

415
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,005
That's funny, I don't remember a cheque
from any of the patents.

416
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,923
[sighing] All right, Braz,

417
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,969
20 years in the desert
makes you a prophet and a martyr.

418
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,555
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

419
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:29,226
OK, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

420
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,395
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

421
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,440
If you've ever seen ultrasonic waves
break up a kidney stone

422
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,942
on the Discovery Channel,
it's the same deal here.

423
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,738
- Uh, you can put your helmets on now.
- [motor starting]

424
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,365
- Firing.
- [powering up]

425
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,884
[shouting]

426
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,265
[shouting]

427
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,895
[engine powering down]

428
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,858
[Braz] Yeah. Oh.

429
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,488
[coughing]

430
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,910
[Spits]

431
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:34,083
OK, I'm officially impressed.

432
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,800
[Zimsky] Well, all right.

433
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,679
So you've made some progress
with the engine, I will grant you.

434
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,182
Uh, have you begun
to think about a shell?

435
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,853
OK, this is Alex.

436
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,521
OK, Alex. Good.

437
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,649
OK, here we have a concrete block,

438
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:03,237
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

439
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,951
- [engine powering up]
- OK. We're ready.

440
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,376
And we are... firing.

441
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,099
[engine powering down]

442
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,690
- Voilà!
- That's...

443
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,236
- That's impossible.
- [Braz] I combined the crystals

444
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,948
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

445
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,659
and that's what did the trick.

446
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,120
The applications for this are just...

447
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,497
What do you call this material?

448
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,334
Well, its real name has 37 syllables.

449
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,128
I call it Unobtanium.

450
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,922
- Unobtanium?
- Mm-hm.

451
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,383
The Unobtanium will take
the heat and the pressure

452
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,927
and transform it to energy,

453
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,220
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

454
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,891
So the hotter and the deeper she gets,
the stronger she gets, theoretically.

455
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,936
- [Zimsky] Theoretically?
- Theoretically, yes.

456
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,773
This... is Johnson, don't mind him.

457
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,318
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

458
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,738
Excuse me, Dr. Brazzelton, when do you
think the ship will be operational?

459
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,367
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected.

460
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,037
Twelve... ten years, ten years.

461
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,831
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

462
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,087
[laughing] Fifteen billion dollars. I...

463
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,549
Will you take a cheque?

464
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,594
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

465
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,137
Mm.

466
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,808
[pounding]

467
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,812
- [man 1] Shit!
- [man 2] Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.

468
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,356
- We have a warrant.
- [pounding continues]

469
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,987
- [Finch] Purge!
- [Computers beeping]

470
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,116
Come on, purge!

471
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,131
FBI! Freeze!

472
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:29,967
[dings]

473
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,974
[clattering]

474
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,101
OK.

475
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:43,647
I know these look like computers.
Totally not.

476
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:47,943
Theodore Donald Finch.
Carnegie Mellon University. MIT.

477
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,112
Worked at Sun, Lucent, RAND Corp.

478
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,489
My handle's "Rat". Call me Rat.

479
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,408
Sixty-three computer fraud indictments.

480
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,285
Sixty-four.

481
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,371
Two convictions.

482
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,707
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

483
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,125
Wait a second.

484
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,544
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

485
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,590
Because I was really, really hoping
to have sex before that happened.

486
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:14,803
Yeah. I've been told by the FBI,
whose database you crippled last year,

487
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,307
that you are the best in the business.
So you're about to be given a choice.

488
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:21,643
- What if I say no?
- Excuse me, but

489
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,688
is this really the best we could do?
I mean...

490
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:28,400
- How many languages do you speak?
- Five, actually.

491
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:32,488
Well, I speak one.
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

492
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,492
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

493
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,994
your sexual fantasies, your whole life,

494
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:43,457
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

495
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,000
We multitask like you breathe.

496
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,212
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

497
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,093
- Do you have any idea...?
- OK, hey. Hey!

498
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,929
Let's just, let's give the kid a break.

499
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,434
OK, it's a phone. It's just a phone.

500
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,230
Rat...

501
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,900
...we got a big... problem.

502
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,069
A lot of people are going to die.

503
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,196
- We need your help.
- What kind of help?

504
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,697
- [blows on wrapper]
- Information control.

505
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,408
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

506
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,911
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the Net.

507
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,790
Could you... with unlimited resources?

508
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,417
You want me to hack the planet?

509
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,086
[chuckles]

510
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,380
- [dialing phone]
- He wants me to hack the planet.

511
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,840
[blowing sounds]

512
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,759
[phone dialing]

513
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,181
You've got free long distance
on that phone... forever.

514
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:46,520
OK. If I decide to do this,

515
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,273
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

516
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,025
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

517
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,821
- Hot Pockets?
- They help me concentrate.

518
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,323
Sounds fair.

519
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,701
[shoes squeaking]

520
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,207
[door opens]

521
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,085
[man] Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

522
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,006
[swallows]

523
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:17,718
Major Childs, a clarification:

524
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,219
You and you alone were responsible

525
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,722
for proposing the descent vectors
for the shuttle, correct?

526
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,308
Yes, General.

527
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,727
[General] We have determined
that the Class "A" landing mishap

528
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,228
experienced by the Shuttle Endeavour

529
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,982
was caused by biased navigational data
from the ground

530
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,735
due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance.

531
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,237
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

532
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,114
in determining
the descent vectors proved

533
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,868
that you have exceptional
navigational skills.

534
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,953
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

535
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,165
the space programme
and the United States Air Force.

536
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,042
Congratulations, Major.

537
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,630
You are reassigned with Commander
Iverson and Flight Director Stickley

538
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,216
to a new mission, effective immediately.

539
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,095
Transportation is waiting outside.
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

540
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,664
[chattering]

541
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,499
[Serge] Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

542
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,000
- [Josh] Why?
- [Serge] I don't know.

543
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,919
I mean, you look so nervous about it.

544
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,838
- You look so...
- So, how are you holding up?

545
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,840
- Oh, hi.
- I'm good, I'm good.

546
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,677
I'm about to tell a couple hundred
people the world is going to end.

547
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,679
- Well...
- I've had better days.

548
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,681
You look good.

549
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,391
Well, no, you don't look good.

550
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,518
Why did he touch his tie like that?

551
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,312
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

552
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,147
Listen, wouldn't you rather I did this?

553
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,732
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

554
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,526
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

555
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:01,196
Yes. Thomas, this is the most important
scientific operation in history.

556
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,032
And given my status,
I feel that it's my job to present...

557
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,535
Project Destiny was your job, Zimsky.

558
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,537
And you went way beyond
authorised limits.

559
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,038
And let me tell... let me tell you,

560
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:14,209
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

561
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,587
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

562
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,173
- Now, I have not finished checking...
- Excuse me.

563
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:26,096
Rebecca... I'm so glad I was wrong.

564
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,141
Right over left...
No, the other left, the other left.

565
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,475
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

566
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,852
Gentlemen.

567
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:36,481
Commander Iverson, Major Childs,
this is your crew:

568
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,359
- Dr. Brazzelton knows the ship.
- Hello.

569
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,487
- [Tom] Dr. Zimsky knows the planet.
- Doctor.

570
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,448
Dr. Leveque knows the weapons system.

571
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,577
- Excuse me, ladies first. Hi.
- [Tom] And Dr. Keyes... [clears throat]

572
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,871
Dr. Keyes built the navigation system.

573
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,165
- So...
- Hi. Rebecca Childs.

574
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,374
Bob Iverson.

575
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,294
These are your fellow... fellow what?

576
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,921
- Terranauts?
- [Stick] Hello.

577
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,340
All this brain power over here

578
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,050
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

579
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,802
- Y'all better come and join in.
- Yeah.

580
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,431
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

581
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,602
Yeah. It's official. I'm the
least-qualified person on this base.

582
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,605
Dr. Keyes, I'm sure the people in charge
have every confidence in you.

583
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,607
Well, the problem is that I'm in charge.

584
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,610
- [chuckles] Yeah, I know.
- Can I help you?

585
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,362
Yes, please.

586
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,821
[clears throat]

587
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,657
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

588
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,159
Mm-hm.

589
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:33,789
- Is there anything you can't do?
- Not that I'm aware of.

590
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,042
I find that incredibly intimidating.

591
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:40,128
Yep. Most people do.

592
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,381
Here.

593
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

594
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:51,223
[Tom] Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

595
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,934
[Josh] Thank you, thank you.

596
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,646
Good evening. Good evening.

597
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:02,984
Wow. This looks like a meeting
for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous.

598
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,987
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

599
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,365
and have come a long way to be here.

600
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:12,869
So, I'll outline our programme
over the next three months.

601
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,876
<i>Dr. Brazzelton will supervise
the building of a ship</i>

602
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,546
<i>which is capable of reaching
the centre of our planet.</i>

603
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,798
<i>Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge</i>

604
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,384
<i>large enough to restart its core.</i>

605
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,432
<i>Dr. Zimsky will calculate the scale
of the explosion needed.</i>

606
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,934
[Zimsky] This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

607
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,020
of nuclear detonations on the core.

608
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,357
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

609
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,276
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

610
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,902
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

611
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,738
- A thousand megatons, give or take?
- [Zimsky] Tops.

612
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,324
Because any more than that
would create a core instability.

613
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,202
[Serge] We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

614
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,622
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

615
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,748
Yeah.

616
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,001
- I can enlarge the ejection pod...
- [Bob] Forgive me,

617
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:04,212
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

618
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,007
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

619
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,009
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

620
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,052
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

621
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,765
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
And what if the core is made of cheese?

622
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,437
This is all best guess, Commander.
That's all science is, is best guess.

623
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,732
So my best guess is you don't know.

624
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,860
<i>[Josh] With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,</i>

625
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,862
<i>and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction</i>

626
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,655
<i>will help save the world.</i>

627
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,701
<i>The ship will be powered by a small
experimental nuclear reactor.</i>

628
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,413
<i>It will be divided into six compartments
like cars on a train:</i>

629
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,624
<i>the locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,</i>

630
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,835
<i>living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment</i>

631
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,338
<i>and finally the weapons-control module.</i>

632
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:50,467
Up to a 45-degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

633
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:54,888
by these gyro control gimbals.
But if we do breach a section,

634
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,933
bulkhead doors engage automatically,

635
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,269
seal off the section in red, and eject.

636
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,940
- Is ejection really the best option?
- Only option.

637
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,318
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

<i>[Josh] The objective is simple.</i>

639

<i>The obstacles are gigantic.</i>

00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,283
<i>We're going to need
all the help in the world,</i>

641
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,953

642
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,872

know what's happening here.</i>

<i>Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.</i>

644
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,503
[Rat] It's called Virus-bot. It's a
computer virus that will seek out files

645
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,464
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

646
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:34,386

This is my kung fu, and it is strong.

[Serge] We are losing

No, it's not feedback.
It's an impeller malfunction, I believe.

No, it's not, no. If it were

For the 22nd time in a row,

668
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,237
Let's take a little quiet time,

00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,084
What is this?

672
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,880
Uh, well, it's... I invented it.

673
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,008
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

674
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:58,386
It's... not very good reception.

675
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,180
[Josh] Well, uh, you're looking

676
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:03,391
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

677

...it ain't bad.

678
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:10,899
It's like a CAT scan at a hospital,
but it's, uh, it's souped-up.

679
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,485
I invented it
for deep earth surveying.

680
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,904
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

681
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,573
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

682
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,702
I'm sorry, this is really delicate.
And I have it just the way I want it.

So... excuse me.

684
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,417
Uh... Yeah. Then they brought me in

We are about to begin our journey
into the heart of the cosmos...

769
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:21,264
- [Bob] Close.
- ...Into the core of our own planet.

770
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,432
- Where we find therein...
- [Beck] Check.

771
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,228
- ...the secrets of the universe...
- [Bob] ...3.5 PSI.

772
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:31,149
- ...the mysteries of time...
- [Bob] Helen circuit lockup.

773
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,317
- [Beck] Check.
- ...hope for the future.

774
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,820
- [Bob] And signal.
- Deep Earth Control, this is <i>Virgil.</i>

775
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:39,157
- Signal check.
- This is Deep Earth Control.

776
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,951
I have thumbs-up across the board.

777
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,245
You are clear to initiate power-up.

778
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,256
Reactor power confirmed.

779
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,594
<i>[Stick] At 1,000 rpm, we will
countdown to launch. On your mark.</i>

780
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,596
Pad leader, stand by for launch.

781
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:04,974
<i>All right, Virgil.</i>

782
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:11,105
- Mark.
- Gantry count. Ten, nine,

783
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:16,194
<i>eight, seven, six, five, four...</i>

784
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,198
...three, two, one... launch.

785
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,109
- Five hundred feet.
- Leveling out.

786
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,958
OK, guys, let's swing forward.

787
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:21,217
- Eight hundred feet.
- Light 'em up, Beck.

788
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,596
[beeping]

789
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,933
- Gyro leveling operational.
- Hull integrity holding.

790
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:02,883
I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

791
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,053
- [whale sounds]
- Oh, my goodness.

792
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,994
They're singing to us.

793
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,789
Virgil's resonance tubes are powered up,
so they're vibrating subsonically.

794
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:36,375
Actually, we're singing to them.

795
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,711
[hull creaking]

796
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:50,973
What's our depth?

797
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,726
Sixteen hundred feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

798
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,270
- Hull integrity is good.
- You sure?

799
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:59,231
Let's increase impeller speed. I think
we'll be needing additional control.

800
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,570
- [beeping]
- Stick, I'm getting a seismic reading.

801
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:08,616
- What's happening?
- T-phase. Underwater earthquake.

802
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,409
[rumbling]

803
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,499
Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

804
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:19,543
Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

805
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,338
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

806
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:23,547
Four thousand feet.

807
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,928
You see that rock?
That is not good.

808
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,271
We're losing steering here.
There's some kind of crosscurrent.

809
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,483
Fourteen thousand feet.

810
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,874
OK, guys, fasten your seat belts.

811
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,835
We're turning into the skid.

812
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,347
Eighteen thousand.

813
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,725
- Eighteen-five.
- They're going way too fast.

814
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,686
[alarm blaring]

815
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,367
- Twenty-one thousand feet.
- We hit the wall,

816
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:34,785
we're rabbits on the highway.

817
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,162
[Braz] Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

818
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,664
What do you mean, pressure? I thought
you said this thing was indestructible!

819
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:41,375
I said the pressure makes us stronger.
We just don't have enough of it yet.

820
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,296
We're at 25,000 feet. Pull out, sir.

821
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:46,797
- Can't.
- What?

822
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,549
- We're locked in.
- Go to full throttle.

823
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:53,387
Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

824
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,724
But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

825
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,977
Just give it a couple of more seconds.
The lasers will fire.

826
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:05,441
No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

827
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,280
Twenty-seven thousand feet.

828
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,199
[Braz] The lasers will deploy.

829
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,161
Twenty-nine thousand feet.

830
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,996
- Do it!
- And...

831
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,957
- Do it!
- Now.

832
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,014
[monitor beeps]

833
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:10,130
- [beeping]
- And we've got a signal.

834
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,591
- [man] All right.
- [all applaud]

835
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:22,226
All right. [clears throat] Switching on
electron spin burst transmitters.

836
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,187
Ah, plotting through
lowest density material,

837
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:26,897
- reconfiguring every five minutes.
- [exhales]

838
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,568
Hull integrity 100 per cent.
Reactor power 100 per cent.

839
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,654
- All green on the bomb compartment.
- Speed is 60 knots.

840
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,781
[laughs] Hot damn.

841
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:39,243
All right, we'll be through the crust
in 15 minutes and into the mantle.

842
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,787
Twenty-four hours to the core,
and then assuming we survive...

843
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:44,123
- Assuming?
- Yes, assuming.

844
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,418
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

845
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:48,419
[beeping]

846
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:52,047
- They're doing well.
- The crust is just rock.

847
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:54,049
Now, it gets interesting.

848
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,593
<i>Virgil, can we get a status check?</i>

849
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,970
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

850
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,501
- [rumbling]
- Come on, come on.

851
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,516
[exhales]

852
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:48,646
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds per square inch.

853
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,482
And hull integrity is 100 per cent.

854
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:55,486
It's as if we we're diving
through the memories of the planet.

855
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:59,990
But we are about to pass
from memory into madness.

856
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,201
Are you going to be doing

857
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:04,745
that Carl Sagan narration
all the way to the core?

858
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,289
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

859
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:09,583
[stammers] I have an obligation
to my students...

860
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,210
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

861
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:12,836
[Zimsky] Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

862
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,547
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

863
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,508
[Zimsky] Oh, really? Really?
When did you learn how to read?

864
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:18,509
[Braz] You amaze me.

865
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,446
[Bob] People.

866
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,950
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

867
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,871
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

868
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,373
What do you make of this?

869
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,002
The mantle is a chemical hodgepodge
of... a variety of elements...

870
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,881
Say it with me: "I don't know."

871
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:02,219
Well, Commander, wise men say,
"When in doubt, you should go around."

872
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,055
No. It's too big. We turn too slow.

873
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,725
Anything that we can't go through
displays as black.

874
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:11,812
- So, what's... what's static?
- It's nothing.

875
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:16,316
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing.

876
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,319
It's empty space.

877
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,989
L.-

878
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,367
I never taught the computer how
to read empty space.

879
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,785
And I never taught <i>Virgil</i>
how to fly.

880
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,413
Oh, God!

881

[all grunting]

01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,479
Oh, no, man!

01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,296
Serge, you all right?

891
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,466
Yeah.

892
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,518
- Anybody hurt?
- No. You OK?

893
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:15,686
- Yeah.
- [craft hissing]

894
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,145
What's that? What is that?

895
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,691
From the cooling system.
Shut that down. Shut it down.

896
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,777
I told you to go around her.
Nobody listens to me.

897
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,112
Where in God's name are we?

898
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:28,574
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers. Shut 'em down.

899
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,829
We're not going anywhere.

900
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,793
Powering down.

901
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,212
[ship powers down]

902
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,135
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

903
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:52,973
Nope. Whatever it is,
it's also inside our MRI cameras.

904
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,685
- We have to go outside.
- [Serge] What?

905
01:04:56,852 --> 01:05:00,063
Believe me, I hate to admit it,
but I think he's right.

906
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,149
- I'm coming. I want to collect samples.
- [Bob] Wait, hang on, hang on.

907
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,276
The first problem is,
the only way out of the ship

908
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:07,446
is the way we came in,
which is through the impeller outlet...

909
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,157
- Which is still at 5,000 degrees.
- Exactly, I mean...

910
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:13,827
I'll just flush it with liquid nitrogen
from the cooling system.

911
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:17,831
Wait. The cooling system that's keeping
us from roasting to death in this ship?

912
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:21,460
Well, just a small part of it.

913
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,258
Alternatives? Anybody.

914
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,606
[heavy breathing]

915
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,192
[Bob] Whoa, whoa, that's it.

916
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,862
[Josh] It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

917
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:51,865
- [Zimsky] Where the hell are we?
- [Bob] Well, the good news is,

918
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,951
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

919
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,871
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

920
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,374
We just... we got to hope,
if we can cut it loose,

921
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,667
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

922
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:03,752
OK.

923
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,712
Got it.

924
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:09,424
- Beck, try the lights, will you?
- Lighting up.

925
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:17,099
- Oh, it's magnificent.
- [Zimsky] Oh, my God.

926
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:20,268
[Braz] Aladdin's cave.

927
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,730
[Zimsky] It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

928
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,080
I think it's a geode.

929
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:44,167
But I don't understand
how it could have survived down here.

930
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,170
- Cobalt shell, maybe?
- [Zimsky] Well, I mean,

931
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,756
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

932
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,634
Something would have to protect it.
Unbelievable.

933
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:54,886
- Zimsky.
- Yeah?

934
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,265
We're inside a giant gem bubble,

935
01:06:58,432 --> 01:07:00,976
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

936
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,021
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

937
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,401
- Hell of a day.
- [Zimsky laughing]

938
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,403
Yes, it is.

939
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,946
- [Braz] I'll start cutting.
- [Bob] OK, Braz.

940
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:15,198
I'm going to check the hull.
Call me if you need me.

941
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,867
- OK.
- [tool powering up]

942
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,620
[Zapping]

943
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,247
[hissing]

944
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,751
Oh, no.

945
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:27,961
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

946
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,589
- Zimsky...
- Look! It's an amethyst.

947
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:34,301
[Zimsky] Oh, God,
we've breached the shell.

948
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:42,809
[shouts]

949
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,479
- [gasps]
- [all shouting]

950
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:53,528
Guys, you don't have to be here!
I want you back inside!

951
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:57,074
Well, I think that means me.
Orders are orders.

952
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,042
Wait, Josh.

953
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:09,503
The problem is I'm losing oxygen.

954
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,172
- Braz, what can I do?
- Check the feeds for me.

955
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:15,675
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

956
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,305
Quick!

957
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:21,640
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

958
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:25,227
Hey, guys, at this rate we have three
minutes before the lava gets to us.

959
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,187
Come on, guys. Come on.

960
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:32,943
[beeps]

961
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,736
[Braz] It's not going to work
without oxygen!

962
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,863
We're losing oxygen!

963
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,907
[air hissing]

964
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,082
I fixed it. Now cut!

965
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:50,127
[Braz] That's good. It's working now.
It's working well now!

966
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,003
That's good, Josh!

967
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:06,226
- Josh's vital signs are dropping.
- What?

968
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,647
[exhales]

969
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,567
Serge!

970
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:20,824
[Braz] You're almost there.
You're almost there, Josh.

971
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,588
- [grunts]
- Josh!

972
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,884
[grunting]

973
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,519
[grunts]

974
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,774
- Joshua!
- OK, guys, connect the oxygen.

975
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,985
- [Bob] Braz, you got that?
- [Braz] Yes. Connected!

976
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,154
<i>[Bob] Good. I got to check these lasers.</i>

977
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:02,908
OK, Beck, turn 'em over.

978
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,493
Pre-lasers only,
if you don't mind.

979
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,786
Initiating.

980
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,083
This better work.
The tide's really coming in.

981
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:14,920
Yes!

982
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,548
We got lucky! I think we're going
to swim right out of this one.

983
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,844
Bob?

984
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,763
[gasps]

985
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,774
[long beep]

986
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,278
Bob?

987
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,494
Bob...

988
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,916
Braz, come on, it's over.

989
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,502
OK. OK.

990
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,337
Beck! Beck!

991
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,631
<i>We're coming in.</i>

992
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:02,509
<i>[panting] Initiate start sequence.</i>

993
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,135
Beck!

994
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,554
- Beck, do you hear me?
- [Serge] Careful.

995
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,974
<i>Start the impellers!</i>

996
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,979
The door, open the door.

997
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,690
<i>Activate bulkhead doors!</i>

998
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,234
<i>Now, Beck!</i>

999
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,478
[gasps]

1000
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,193
You OK? You're going to be weak.
You're OK.

1001
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,695
Good job, good job. Good man.

1002
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,905
- Well done, well done.
- [Josh] I'm fine. Thank you.

1003
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:11,244
So... we have some good news, and...

1004
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,620
...and we have some bad news.

1005
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,331
Good news.
I'll take good news.

1006
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:18,376
- All right.
- Well, we're alive and we're moving.

1007
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,712
That's g... that's good news.

1008
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,381
Oh, it is hot in here.

1009
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,760
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out of the
cooling system, it's causing things

1010
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,804
just to heat up a little. I'm going
to go back and make some adjustments.

1011
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,891
- I'll lend you a hand.
- I'm fine.

1012
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,268
[Beck] I'm going to check
your heartbeat, OK?

1013
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,729
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.

1014
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:42,067
So, that's the bad news?
That's not too bad.

1015
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,779
No. Commander Iverson died.

1016
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:51,576
But... we're living,
and he would want to...

1017
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:53,036
He'd want us to
complete our mission,

1018
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:56,498
so I think that it's
important that we all...

1019
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:04,214
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1020
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,633
I'm sorry.

1021
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:13,848
Let's give him a second, OK?
He deserves that.

1022
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,649
Oh, God, this all just seems
too big, doesn't it?

1023
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,528
I think you were attempting
the impossible.

1024
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,489
You were trying
to save the world, and...

1025
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,117
...it's overwhelming.

1026
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,161
I came here to save my wife
and my two children

1027
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:39,999
and... six billion lives...
it's too much.

1028
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:44,254
I just hope I'm smart enough
and brave enough to save three.

1029
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:48,925
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.

1030
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,886
- You'd have done the same thing.
- Well, maybe, maybe.

1031
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,942
Hey... who's steering the ship?

1032
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:10,196
- Video screen autopilot.
- I hope he knows the way.

1033
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,240
You and me both.

1034
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:19,330
So... you're really
a college professor?

1035
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:24,335
You're not from the CIA or the NSA
or any of those three-letter places?

1036
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:27,714
No. I am a boring college professor.

1037
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,884
Wrong place, wrong place.

1038
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,472
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

1039
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,851
Well, I just, I just...
Listen, the lack of oxygen

1040
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,978
kept me from weeping
like a little girl,

1041
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:45,315
as is my custom
in dangerous situations.

1042
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,327
[Beck] Hey, guys, we're close
to the mantle core interface.

1043
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,453
Where are you?

1044
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,247
[Serge] Key's in, Dr. Brazzelton.

1045
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,542
- Ready.
- [Josh] We are in the

1046
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,169
- luxurious, beautiful...
- [Serge] OK, the code...

1047
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:10,131
...weapons control
checking the controls on the nukes.

1048
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:11,758
[Serge] This is
the birthday of my daughter.

1049
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,177
[Braz] O-3-1-9-9-5.

1050
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:18,598
- Ready? Three, two and one.
- Yeah.

1051
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,309
Thank you.

1052
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:22,477
Green. All green.

1053
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:26,105
Great. So we have
to synchronise the babies now.

1054
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,487
Just a second.

1055
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,364
- There.
- Mm-hm.

1056
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,658
All right, now let's
put them to bed.

1057
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:40,995
Zimsky, could you please come up
here for a second?

1058
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,331
- Yes?
- We're not supposed

1059
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:46,376
- to go through anything black.
- Yes, so please don't.

1060
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:47,961
What is this?

1061
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,381
[Zimsky] They're scattered everywhere.

1062
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:56,553
Oh, my God! They're diamonds!

1063
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:59,013
[Beck] Great.

1064
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:03,142
You might want to sit down and buckle
up. We're on a collision course here.

1065
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:11,651
Alrighty. Careful.

1066
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:19,742
Guys, we're dodging diamonds
the size of Cape Cod, so bear with me.

1067
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,619
Not exactly nimble here.

1068
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:24,330
- Diamonds? I want some.
- Can I help?

1069
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,438
Oh!

1070
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:52,984
- [thudding]
- OK. It's OK.

1071
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,989
[Beck] OK, it looks like
we're in the clear.

1072
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:04,662
- [scraping]
- [alarm beeping]

1073
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:05,788
Breach!

1074
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:09,792
Guys! Weapons control, get out!
Get out now!

1075
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,429
[Josh] Serge!

1076
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:28,227
Serge! What the hell are you doing?
Come on!

1077
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:31,064
[$6rge] My notebook!

1078
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,860
Serge!

1079
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,285
Take the time reg, Joshua!

1080
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:48,206
- Come on Serge! Come on!
- My notes! You'll need them!

1081
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:51,125
No! God, no, Serge!

1082
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:54,337
- It's OK.
- Serge, come on! No!

1083
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,631
Serge!

1084
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,883
We need the box!

1085
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,551
[Braz shouting]

1086
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,345
We can get him!
We can get him!

1087
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:04,847
Hold on, Serge!

1088
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:22,949
Beck! Beck!
Override the ejection system!

1089
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:27,328
Beck, no! One damaged compartment
threatens the whole ship!

1090
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,498
Beck! Beck!

1091
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,627
<i>Override the ejection system!</i>

1092
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:43,052
Serge, we're right here. We're not
going to forget about you, man.

1093
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,762
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...

1094
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,056
Hey, buddy, look in your monitor
right now. Serge, look in your monitor.

1095
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:51,394
<i>- I'm right here. Serge...
- Josh, I can't see you.</i>

1096
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,855
Braz is going to override
the doors manually, OK?

1097
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:56,482
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?

1098
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,569
Going as fast as I can,
fast as I can.

1099
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:01,738
- OK, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.

1100
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,365
- Shouldn't be two seconds, all right?
- <i>Josh!</i>

1101
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:07,034
Beck, override
the ejection systems, OK?

1102
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:09,662
<i>Damn it. I don't think
Beck can hear me.</i>

1103
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,748
<i>Serge, look at me now. Serge!</i>

1104
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,459
Serge, we're right here, OK? We're not
going to forget about you, man.

1105
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:18,045
I'm going to get you out of here.
We're working on it, all right?

1106
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:22,633
- Stay with me here. OK?
- [sobs] I don't know what to do.

1107
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,635
You can hear me now?
All right, here I am.

1108
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,806
I'm not going to let you go, man. I'm
not going to let you go, all right?

1109
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,100
<i>Stay with me here, OK?</i>

1110
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:35,521
I'm going to come to Paris
and we'll go out, all right? After this.

1111
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,231
After this is all
said and done, all right?

1112
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,025
- <i>Josh!</i>
- Serge!

1113
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:44,030
- Serge! Serge! Serge!
- [Serge screaming]

1114
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,199
<i>Serge _/</i>

1115
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,595
[sighs]

1116
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:12,225
- [inhales sharply]
- [kicking console]

1117
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,087
Did you reset the overrides?

1118
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,050
I never pushed them.

1119
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,761
You let him die.

1120
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,183
Actually, you really want to know?
I killed him twice.

1121
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,894
First when I hit the diamond, and then
when I didn't hit the override.

1122
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,272
Do you want me to feel any worse
about that than I already do?

1123
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,439
It's not possible.

1124
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,899
Why are you being so smug about that?

1125
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,901
- Could you have made the decision?
- [Josh] Yes.

1126
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,236
- Could you?
- Yes, I could've.

1127
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:07,613
If you would've hit that switch,
I could've got him outta there!

1128
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,490
I was yelling for you!

1129
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:15,288
Take it and look at it!

1130
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,666
I was two inches from him!

1131
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:22,253
I was two inches, and I told you
to put the door up and you didn't!

1132
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:26,257
I was screaming for you!
Why didn't you do it?!

1133
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,012
Because I had to make that decision.
Fate or God...

1134
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:33,973
No! Damn it!
You leave God out of this!

1135
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,309
Serge died so that we could
complete our job.

1136
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,935
Oh, that's right,
the job of saving the world.

1137
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:42,481
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.

1138
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:33,157
- [monitor beeping]
- [quiet chattering]

1139
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:37,078
Virgil, you are approaching
core interface. Are you good to go?

1140
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,038
[Braz] Josh?

1141
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:40,831
Josh, can you hear me?

1142
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,461
Josh, can you hear me?

1143
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,468
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.

1144
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,387
Dr. Keyes.

1145
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,348
Right here.

1146
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,396
Deep Earth, we are green
and good to go.

1147
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:46,689
We just got a huge speed jump.
We're at 95 knots...

1148
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:47,815
...110...

1149
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:50,484
...13O... 140.

1150
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,946
Our speed's jumped
because the density of the core

1151
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:56,532
is different than our estimates.
It's lighter than we thought.

1152
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,617
- So much for best guesses.
- [Beck] I'm fine with this.

1153
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,037
At this rate, we'll,
what, hit the inner core

1154
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:04,498
in a little over five hours.
I think we finally bought some luck.

1155
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,042
- Braz.
- Yeah.

1156
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,918
Would you please punch
the new core density into the equations

1157
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,129
for the nuclear detonation?

1158
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:17,011
Please tell me this is enough.

1159
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,769
- Failure.
- [Beck] You're telling me

1160
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,687
the 1,000 megatons
of nuclear warheads

1161
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,647
we hauled down here
isn't going to cut it?

1162
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,151
No. This core material is too thin.

1163
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:33,652
- What?
- [Zimsky] The energy waves from

1164
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:34,904
the explosion
won't spread far enough.

1165
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,405
They'll just bleed
away into nothing.

1166
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:41,535
[exhales, stammers]

1167
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:43,204
That's it.

1168
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:47,500
- We go home. We go home.
- [Josh] Home?

1169
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:51,003
Our commander is dead.
Our weapons specialist is dead.

1170
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,880
Our weapons control systems are gone.

1171
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:55,591
We don't know whether
we can arm the nuclear devices,

1172
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:59,220
and our plan to fix the core
no longer works. So... we have failed.

1173
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:00,429
We have not failed.

1174
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:05,184
We have failed, and we go home,
and we go to the alternative.

1175
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:06,685
What alternative?
What are you talking about?

1176
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,522
General, this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.

1177
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:10,606
Destiny is a go.

1178
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:13,275
<i>Repeat. Destiny is a go.</i>

1179
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,860
[sighs] Damn.

1180
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:22,493
I need to know
everything to do my job.

1181
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,870
You don't have to know this.

1182
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,583
General, it is my job
to ensure the safety of this mission.

1183
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:33,379
Anything that affects it is my business.
Now what the hell is Destiny?

1184
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:35,422
It's a device.

1185
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:41,137
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.

1186
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:45,558
We had reason to believe that our
enemies were building a weapon

1187
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,977
that could generate
targeted seismic events.

1188
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:53,274
They would be able to create massive
earthquakes under our territory.

1189
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,067
- No way of telling who did it.
- So?

1190
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,027
So... we built one, too.

1191
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,490
M.A.D. Mutually Assured Destruction.

1192
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,534
A perfect acronym
if ever there was one.

1193
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,411
- Beautiful.
- They built it first.

1194
01:26:05,578 --> 01:26:07,788
I built it better.
I beamed high-powered

1195
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,624
electromagnetic energy waves
down Deep Earth fault lines,

1196
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,460
- and, you know.
- Zimsky, what makes you think

1197
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:17,089
- that Destiny would touch the core?
- [Josh] 'Cause it already did.

1198
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:22,761
This isn't a fluke.
We killed the planet.

1199
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,847
[Beck] You keep saying
that the core is too big

1200
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,682
to be affected by anything
short of nukes.

1201
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:28,642
- So...
- The core is an engine.

1202
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,395
Throw a small wrench into a big engine,
you can still stall it.

1203
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,691
<i>Deep Earth, this is Virgil.</i>

1204
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:40,154
We require clarification on
the status of Project Destiny.

1205
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:43,991
- Why weren't we notified of this, sir?
- Because you didn't need to know.

1206
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:47,953
<i>Now you may not like this.
I may not like it either.</i>

1207
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,623
But it's my job,
and I do it for my country,

1208
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,417
and if we don't develop these
devices, someone worse will

1209
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:56,462
and they will use them against us.
But you have my word.

1210
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:59,506
No one in this
administration, no one,

1211
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:01,967
had any idea
that this could happen.

1212
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:05,512
So the device that killed the
planet is your backup plan?

1213
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,850
An electric shock can stop a heart.
It can certainly restart one.

1214
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:13,812
- Destiny will work. It has to.
- No, it won't work.

1215
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,190
If you fire that thing again
with the core already stalled,

1216
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,108
- it'll terminally destabilise it.
- Yes, granted,

1217
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,903
there is a marginal risk involved,
but given the circumstances,

1218
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,280
- I hardly see that as an alternative.
- No, Zimsky, listen to me.

1219
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,907
Every volcano on the planet will blow.

1220
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:27,034
There'll be earthquakes big
enough to rip us to pieces.

1221
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,577
- <i>[Tom] Dr. Keyes.</i>
- What?

1222
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,455
I'm afraid it's all we've got.

1223
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:34,917
Now, I have orders from the president.
Come home, <i>Virgil.</i> We go to plan B.

1224
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:37,628
- Well, what about plan C?
- What? What?

1225
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,549
Well, plan C. We continue on.
We restart the core... somehow.

1226
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:45,261
We don't do it, you fire Destiny.

1227
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,720
I can't wait for you
to get out of there.

1228
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,974
- Then don't. We fail, fire Destiny.
- Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!

1229
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,017
- What choice do we have, Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?

1230
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,520
If they set that thing off,
the shock waves will wipe us out!

1231
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,814
We'll be lucky to get back
if we turn back right now!

1232
01:27:56,981 --> 01:28:00,150
Virgil, I'm telling you right now,
we will fire Destiny,

1233
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,236
and we need to do so
as quickly as possible,

1234
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:05,572
and if you're still there,
you will be destroyed.

1236
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,868
Please don't make me
have to do this.

1237
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,626
Plan C.

1238
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,964
It's your call, Commander.

1239
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,139
Majority decision.

1240
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,808
We're going in.

1241
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:34,226
I'm sorry, sir.

1242
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:40,441
Oh, come on, you're a bunch of suicidal
morons! What are you, crazy?

1243
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,068
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?

1244
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,821
Oh, that's a great idea!
That's a brilliant idea!

1245
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,490
I can't believe I'm stuck in this
floating septic tank with you lunatics!

1246
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,993
You may have nothing to lose.
You may have nothing to lose!

1247
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,078
You may have nothing to lose,
but I have my life to lose,

1248
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,414
thank you very much,
while you're up! Now turn it around!

1249
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:57,124
He told us to go back
and we're going back!

Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?

You're out of your mind!

- Zimsky, it's not about you!

- Your torque is R, cross F...
- No, your R is too small, Josh.

- Right.
- Wait, hold on.

01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:08,560
it took me and 400
of the world's smartest people

01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,646
- to come up with the first plan.
- You want to help?

1323
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,357
No. I want to turn around and go home.

1324
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:16,777
- It's not going to happen.
- Well, then we're going to die.

1325
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:19,404
- True.
- All right, look

1326
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,073
- let's start from square one.
- OK.

1327
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:25,243
Let's start from square one. The bulk
modules... depends on density.

1328
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:30,832
Your torque is R cross F,
but you have to integrate volume...

1329
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:35,045
But here, here...
just consider this.

1330
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:39,049
Now, we got this...

1331
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:43,178
OK, now, R cross F,
we're putting put in pi. What's V?

1332
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:47,724
- Oh, for God's sake!
- All right. I'm hitting him again.

1333
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,894
No, no, no!
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.

1334
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,022
- Are you interested?
- Yes. We're interested.

1335
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:57,067
Then let me smoke a cigarette,
and I'll tell you.

1336
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,037
- Oh, thank God.
- [Braz whistles]

1337
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:13,625
Hm? All right, fine, look. Look,
we have to use wave interference, OK?

1338
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,586
Because one explosion won't do it.
Think about stones in a pond.

1339
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:19,798
You drop a large stone into a pond,
you get a big splash,

1340
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:21,425
and then that's it, it's over.

1341
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,303
But drop a smaller stone,
wait until the ripples weaken

1342
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:28,098
and drop another and another,
and another,

1343
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:30,642
and fluid dynamics 101.

1344
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:34,312
The ripples reinforce each other
in geometric progression.

1345
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,231
[Braz] The whole bigger than
the sum of the parts.

1346
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:39,484
Then we'll have five
200 megaton explosions...

1347
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,069
Instead of one big bang.

1348
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:44,698
- [Josh] So, we hotwire the nukes.
- Yes.

1349
01:35:44,865 --> 01:35:47,033
As one does.
We seed them through the core

1350
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,078
at locations that have
to be accurate to the inch.

1351
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,998
We detonate them in a sequence
that has to be accurate

1352
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:54,416
to the millisecond,

1353
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:58,837
then we outrun the biggest
nuclear shock wave in history.

1354
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,381
- Right.
- Yeah.

1355
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,801
I mean, that should be fairly simple.

01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:52,742
- Great. Let's start dropping them.
- No. The bombs are not built

1374
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,078
for these pressures.
That's why they were in that pod.

1375
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:56,413
If you send them out now,

1376
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,290
out of that casing,
they'll be crushed instantly.

1377
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:01,459
- I'm assuming we have a Plan D.
- Plan D is Virgil's compartments.

1378
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,461
We put a nuke in
each section of Virgil,

1379
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,506
and then eject the individual sections
one at a time. They should stay intact

1380
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:08,758
- long enough for the nuke to go off.
- [groans]

1381
01:38:10,594 --> 01:38:12,804
- What?
- Virgil's not designed

1382
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:15,056
to eject undamaged compartments.

1383
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:19,436
OK, these are the ejection mechanisms
holding each compartment in place, um...

1384
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:23,815
They're all connected
by one master hydraulic gear, um,

1385
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:25,442
kind of like keys on a key ring.

1386
01:38:25,609 --> 01:38:28,278
What we have to do,
we have to unlock the piston.

1387
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:31,948
That will release the compartments
so the bombs can be jettisoned.

1388
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,325
Where's the master gear?

1389
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:36,202
In the crawl space
we used to get out earlier.

1390
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:37,495
Well, what the hell is it doing there?

1391
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,164
I built the ship
in three damn months.

1392
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,875
I didn't think I'd be intentionally
sabotaging it. I'm sorry!

1393
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,710
So one of us has to go in there.

1394
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:45,337
- Correct.
- Into the crawl space

1395
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,881
- that has core fluid at 9,000 degrees.
- [Braz] Yes.

1396
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:49,299
Can you flush it
with liquid nitrogen?

1397
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:50,800
[Braz] We don't have
enough at this point.

1398
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,137
9,000 degrees.
And our suits are built to withstand...?

1399
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:56,765
- Half that, probably.
- Right. Half that.

1400
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:58,516
So, what you're saying
is whoever goes into that crawl space,

1401
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,477
is not coming back.

1402
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:13,198
- Together.
- Yes, thank you.

1403
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:14,658
Wait.

1404
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:15,951
- On three.
- OK.

1405
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:19,371
One... two... three.

1406
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:30,382
Huh.

1407
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:36,054
Well, I better go on, get myself ready.

1408
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,849
No, Braz, wait.
No, Braz. Excuse me.

1409
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,059
Just a moment, may I see that?

1410
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:42,852
- No.
- May I? May I?

1411
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:45,230
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1412
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:49,943
- Magic.
- I mean, Braz,

1413
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,779
three straws of equal length.

1414
01:39:52,946 --> 01:39:55,782
I mean, this is childish.
Let's do it again.

1415
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:59,494
No, we will not do it again. [laughs]
I thought you'd be happy.

1416
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,580
No. Not at the expense
of you making us look like fools.

1417
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,290
He's right. Why do you get dibs
on being the hero?

1418
01:40:04,457 --> 01:40:06,626
- Because it's my damn ship.
- Oh, that makes perfect sense.

1419
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:11,006
Look, for 20 years, I've done
nothing but Virgil, 20 years.

1420
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:14,175
<i>Virgil</i> belongs to me,
and I will not let her fail.

1421
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:19,597
I will not. Now if you want to know
what's worth dying for... this ship.

1422
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,642
Building it instead of imagining it.

1423
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:26,187
If <i>Virgil</i> needs more blood,
it will be my blood.

1424
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,858
Now I am going to go and get ready.

1425
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,954

- Oh, that was high school physics.
- Yeah, it's not exactly...

1491
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:13,511
I just took the wavelengths from the
core fluid off the MRI readings.

- Yeah, and multiplied by 800...

Beck, can you hear me?

Beck, if you have any better
ideas, you tell me now.

1534

We've only have three minutes

No. Stay here for one second.

1555
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:52,123
I was trying to call you.

1556

- I know. The coms were down.
- Right.

1557
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:59,714
- I know what you did.
- We don't have enough energy...

- I know.
- ...to get back.

You did good.

1560

I would've done the same thing.

Beck, Beck.

1571
01:53:27,218 --> 01:53:30,429
What could you do if I got you enough
power to fire the impeller?

1572
01:53:30,596 --> 01:53:31,931
Maybe not the laser, but the impeller.

1573
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:35,309
- What? From where?
- The heat of the core.

1574
01:53:35,476 --> 01:53:39,271
It's 9,000 degrees.
Unobtanium converts heat to energy.

1575
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:42,608
So this whole damn ship
is like a big old solar panel.

1576
01:53:42,775 --> 01:53:44,485
Come on, I need your help.

01:54:28,779 --> 01:54:31,490
What the fuck am I doing?

01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:37,348
Come on. Come on, hurry up.
Is that the last one?

1590
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:39,767
Yeah.

1591
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:48,275
Give it a couple seconds.

1592

- [beeping]

1593
01:55:58,535 --> 01:56:00,704
It worked!

1594
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:16,053
Get ready to pull a few G's.

1595
01:56:34,113 --> 01:56:36,782
- Four hundred twenty knots.
- Now, this is more like it.

1596
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:37,825
Four-forty.

1597
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:47,835
Mr. Rat, what's the
centre of this quake?

1598
01:56:48,002 --> 01:56:50,337
It's everywhere!
It's one giant shock wave!

1599
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,381
The planet's healing itself.

1600
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:58,429
At this speed, we're going to be home
in a third of the time.

1601
01:57:30,044 --> 01:57:32,212
As long as we can surf
these magma flows, we'll be OK.

1602
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:34,673
Let's just pray we don't run
into any dead ends,

1603
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:37,593
or we're going to miss those lasers.

1604
01:57:40,304 --> 01:57:42,973
OK, navigator, which way?

1605
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,558
We've got greater
flow density on the left.

1606
01:57:44,725 --> 01:57:46,310
Go with the flow.

1607
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:10,542
- [beeping]
- Bill, where are they headed?

1608
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:11,835
Looks like she found
a space between

1609
01:58:12,002 --> 01:58:15,047
some tectonic plates
somewhere near Hawaii.

1610
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,012
- Josh...
- Yeah?

1611
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:23,263
They're closing in on us too fast.

1612
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:26,391
- I don't know if I can...
- Beck, you got it.

01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:39,238
[beeping]

Um... [stammers]

1615
01:58:43,909 --> 01:58:47,162
We lost them, Stick, and I...

1616
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:09,810
[Beck] Where'd our power go?

1617
01:59:11,228 --> 01:59:13,772
[Josh] We were powered by the heat.

1618
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:15,607
It's stone cold down here.

1619
01:59:18,152 --> 01:59:19,778
Well...

1620
01:59:19,945 --> 01:59:21,905
Look on the bright side.

1621
01:59:23,657 --> 01:59:25,784
At least we're not
going to boil to death.

1622
01:59:25,951 --> 01:59:28,745
- You always look on the bright side?
- Always.

1623
01:59:30,956 --> 01:59:32,291
OK, let's assess:

1624
01:59:35,294 --> 01:59:39,756
We've got no communications,
we're probably 800 feet down,

1625
01:59:39,923 --> 01:59:41,842
but we might as well be 800 miles.

1626
01:59:42,843 --> 01:59:44,636
We're in an Unobtanium

1627
01:59:44,803 --> 01:59:47,347
cigar tube with the sonar
signature of a rock.

1628
01:59:47,514 --> 01:59:50,684
We've got just enough power
to make the ultrasonics burp,

1629
01:59:50,851 --> 01:59:54,229
but no one's listening
on those frequencies anyway, and...

1630
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:56,899
...nobody even knows we're alive.

1631
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,823
OK.

1632
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:07,201
Give me a minute on this one.

1633
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:25,427
This is hopeless.

1634
02:00:25,594 --> 02:00:27,971
Come on, General, we've got to be
getting close. We can't...

1635
02:00:28,138 --> 02:00:31,808
Mr. Rat, even if they were still alive,
there's no way they could contact us.

1636
02:00:31,975 --> 02:00:33,143
[telephone rings]

Skipper, Combat relays that our
sub has something on the sonar.

1639
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:40,400
- Where do they think?
- Bill, put it up on the hydrophone.

1640
02:00:42,277 --> 02:00:44,321
[whale sounds]

1641
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:46,990
Whales, sir.

1642
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:50,577
They're a long way off their usual path,
but that's not uncommon since that...

1643
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:52,829
What are they calling it?
Orbital wobble?

1644
02:00:52,996 --> 02:00:55,207
Yeah, that's what they call it.

1645
02:00:55,374 --> 02:00:59,461
Well, thank you very much, Captain,
but I think we're done here.

1646
02:00:59,628 --> 02:01:01,004
General.

1647
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:08,011
J.O., this is the captain.
Stand down from SAR Operations.

1648
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:42,379
It's whales! It's whales!

1649
02:01:42,546 --> 02:01:46,383
Hey! General! Stick!

1650
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:49,428
It's whales! The ultrasonics!

1651
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:53,307
They're singing to them!
You gotta find the whales!

1652
02:02:11,616 --> 02:02:14,161
[man] Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.

1653
02:02:14,328 --> 02:02:17,831
I'm changing...
Hold on, I'm seeing those whales now.

1654
02:02:17,998 --> 02:02:20,834
Whoa! OK, ball's in the water.

1655
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:23,628
This is neat. Those whales
are circling something.

1656
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:26,256
Hold on, hold on.
We have a strong echo here.

1657
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:28,925
Depth, 800 feet.
There's something down there.

1658
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:31,011
There's definitely
something down there.

1659
02:03:14,638 --> 02:03:17,140
I told you pulsing the
ultrasonics would work.

1660
02:03:17,307 --> 02:03:19,518
Do you ever get tired
of being right?

1661
02:03:20,519 --> 02:03:22,229
Yes.

1662
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:25,148
So, what's next for you?

1663
02:03:25,816 --> 02:03:28,235
- A shower.
- [laughs]

1664
02:03:28,985 --> 02:03:32,155
Then back to NASA, I guess.

1665
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:33,782
You?

1666
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:37,494
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza,
green peppers, onions,

1667
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:40,205
- extra mushrooms, then a shower...
- Mmm.

1668
02:03:40,372 --> 02:03:42,874
...and then back to the classroom.

1669
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:46,169
NASA could use
a few good men, you know.

1670
02:03:48,839 --> 02:03:53,427
Yeah. Unfortunately, so could my
freshmen geophysics students.

1671
02:03:58,348 --> 02:04:02,144
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

1672
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:05,814
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...

1673
02:04:05,981 --> 02:04:08,984
No one's going to ever know
what they did or why they died.

1674
02:04:12,112 --> 02:04:16,450
Unless... it all got out somehow.

1675
02:04:19,536 --> 02:04:23,665
- That's unthinkable.
- Yeah.
