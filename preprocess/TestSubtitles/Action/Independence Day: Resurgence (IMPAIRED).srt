Yes, Madam President.
I'm looking right at it.

the design and the
technology of this ship...

is nothing like the ones
that attacked us.

539

Madam President,
we need to send

540

a team up to investigate
the wreckage.

been neutralized.

make this political?

01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,150
for a virtual one
thousands of years ago.

1465
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Far out.

1466
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,999
Why are you here?

1467
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,958
When I intercepted
their distress call...

1468
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,839
I knew they would come
to exterminate you.

1469
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,834
I came to evacuate
as many of you as possible.

1470
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,194
But you attacked me

1471
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,993
with the same weapons
they used on us.

1472
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,349
They attacked you?

1473
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,669
Correct.

1474
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,354
A Harvester Ship
conquered our planet...

1475
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,988
and extracted
its molten core.

1476
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,594
They use them
to refuel their ships...

1477
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,439
and grow their technology.

1478
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,160
They have done this
to countless civilizations.

1479
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,519
We fought them
for thousands of years...

1480
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,955
but they destroyed
all of our ships.

1481
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,635
I am the sole survivor.

1482
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,712
BRAKISH: I am so sorry
to hear that.

1483
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,109
Do you have a plan?

1484
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,873
My system holds the key
to superior technology.

1485
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,399
And there is
a hidden planet...

1486
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,552
where I teach refugees
from other fallen worlds...

1487
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,518
how to build weapons that will
defeat them...

1488
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,079
once and for all.

1489
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,016
CATHERINE: That's why
they're afraid of you.

1490
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,191
You're the only ones
who threaten their existence.

1491
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
Correct.

1492
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,630
But now that I am activated...

1493
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,513
the queen will detect
my signature...

1494
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,914
and hunt me down.

1495
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,399
It's too late.

1496
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,311
She's already on her way.

1497
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,833
Yeah.

1498
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,149
She's coming.

1499
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,032
Hey, what would happen...

1500
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,751
if we were able to kill her?

1501
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,595
No one has ever killed
a Harvester queen.

1502
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,068
That's encouraging.

1503
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,280
But as a hive...

1504
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,839
her fighters will fall,

1505
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,831
and her ship
will leave your planet.

1506
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,673
Recalled by
other Harvester queens.

1507
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,353
But it's too late now.

1508
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,748
You must terminate me...

1509
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,672
or she will get
the coordinates

1510
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,273
to the refugee planet.

1511
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,078
And that will be the end.

1512
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,355
Wait, wait a second.

1513
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,795
If we're so sure that she's
coming here to get you...

1514
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,671
maybe we can bait her...

1515
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,276
like she baited us.

1516
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,953
Mr. President,
Dr. Okun thinks...

1517
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,709
that we can replicate

1518
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,096
the Sphere's
RF radiation signal...

1519
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,189
David, English,
please.

1520
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,476
Every computer has a
radioactive signature...

1521
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,393
whether it's your laptop,
your phone, even your watch.

1522
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,391
But the Sphere
has an RFR

1523
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,760
that's completely
off the charts.

1524
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,309
So, if we hide
the real Sphere...

1525
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,311
inside the isolation
chamber...

1526
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,776
and pack
this decoy transmitter,

1527
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,800
so to speak...

1528
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,474
onto a tug filled with
cold fusion bombs...

1529
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,596
and lure her
out to the salt flats...

1530
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,116
We can fly it right up her
royal ass and bon voyage!

1531
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,392
You set off
cold fusion bombs...

1532
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,154
you're gonna kill everyone
from here to Houston.

1533
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,992
Not if we use
the shield generators

1534
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,480
from this base
to contain the blast.

1535
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,072
Without our shields,
you better put

1536
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,673
a blaster in every
able bodied hand...

1537
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,115
and get them ready
to shoot some aliens.

1539

Now, we just need a way
to see her coming.

1540
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,838
Follow me.

1541
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,160
Do your thing.

1542
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,918

in the hold.

1567
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,839
DAVID: So, the idea...

1568
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,468
is to get her
to follow this tug...

1569

into the salt flats...

1570

using the decoy transmitter
on board.

And once
she's taken the bait...

01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,671
our cold fusion bombs
can go to town.

As you know, they took out
all of our satellites...

1577
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,032

is gonna have to
fly it in manually.

Well done.

2108
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,234
Thank you,
Mr. President.

2109
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,229
Good job.

2110
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:20,400
Catherine...

2111
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,560
Um...

2112
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:24,234
Don't say anything.
You'll just ruin it.

2113
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,509
Who are you?

2114
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,319
David never mentioned a
beautiful woman in his life.

2115
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,555
Dad!

2116
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,517
I'm Julius.
I'm his father.

2117
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:36,109
Enchantée.
I'm Catherine Marceaux.

2118
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,514
Could you give us
a second?

2119
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,749
I was never here.

2120
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:43,598
Listen, maybe you guys should
stay with me for a while...

2121
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,872
I think that
we'd really like that.

2122
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,629
Yeah, so would I.

2123
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,034
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

2124
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,193
Are you okay?

2125
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,715
SPHERE: I am. Thanks to you.

2126
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,956
This wasn't all for nothing.

2127
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,270
You are a remarkable species.

2128
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,476
Not so primitive
after all, huh?

2129
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,240
You think they'll let me
keep this thing?

2130
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,316
You have the heart
of a warrior.

2131
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:14,158
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

2132
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,077
Hell of a job.

2133
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,235

could survive another attack.

Excuse me,
Director Levinson...

2145
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,958
you won't believe...

2146
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,439
the weapons
and the technology...

2147
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,797
this thing has on its
proverbial hard drive.

2148
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,474
It wants us
to lead their resistance!

2149
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:23,640
What do you mean?

2150
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:24,760
Two words...

2151
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,151
interstellar travel.

2152
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,149
Take the fight to them.

2153
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,673
When do we leave?

2154
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:35,512
We are gonna kick
some serious alien ass.
