161
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,689
I was protecting you the
only way I knew how.

162
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:19,416
I protect this family.

163
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,310
I have been protecting
us for months.

164
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,239
How? By working for your uncle?

165
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,840
You don't understand.

166
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:29,728
I just need a little
bit more time.

167
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,282
I am getting close
to something big.

168
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,017
Like what?

169
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,819
Dad.

170
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:41,924
He is not coming back
to save this family.

171
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,694
- It is just us.
- You're wrong.

172
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:49,365
John can stay tonight,
but that's it.

173
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,067
Tomorrow, we are leaving.

174
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:03,250

chamallow - - Www.addic7ed.com -

175
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:15,069
I had two men at the door. I was
in the can, what, 20 seconds,

176
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,616
and then I hear this noise.

177
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,222
Suddenly the door's
locked from the outside.

178
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,084
I wouldn't beat myself
up if I were you.

179
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,812
It's a professional hit. There's
nothing you could have done about it.

180
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,410
But it just doesn't
make any sense.

181
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,498
The killer must've been a ghost.

182
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,806
MARSHAL: Wait, who are you?

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,115
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dr. Jedikiah Price.

184
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,635
What kind of doctor?

185
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:38,571
The kind who tracks ghosts.

186
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:54,632
- Talk to me, mama. What's happening?
- I couldn't get close.

187
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,918
Stephen and his Ultra gal-pal
were crowding the scene.

188
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:58,341
But what do you think?

189
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,390
Did a breakout actually
bump someone off?

190
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,158
Clearly Jedikiah thinks so.

191
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,100
It doesn't make sense. How?

192
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,951
We can't rule out the possibility
of an evolutionary mutation.

193
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,469
Whoa. You think Mother
Nature created, like,

194
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,550
a Tomorrow Person 2.0?

195
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,509
A Day-After-Tomorrow Person.

196
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,430
There's nothing new and
improved about killing.

197
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:19,649
Well, even Mother
Nature can brain-fart.

198
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,551
Unless it wasn't nature at all.

199
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,387
And what if he's another one out
of The Annex Project, like...

200
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,450
Like that other guy that used
to hang out around here?

201
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:31,953
Blond hair, blue eyes,
about yay tall.

202
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:34,930
John's gone, Russell.

203
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:39,101
(SIGHS) Poor guy's probably
dumpster diving for lunch.

204
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:45,170
Mmm. Oh, man.

205
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,850
Wow.

206
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,178
- Horseradish?
- It's in the mustard.

207
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,714
This is beyond a sandwich.

208
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,948
(CHUCKLES)

209
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:55,751
Honey, some lunch?

210
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:57,566
I need to talk to John.

211
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,004
All right. Well, John,

212
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,600
good luck wherever you end up.

213
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:06,771
Don't worry, you're staying.

214
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,475
Okay? We're all staying.

215
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,150
It seems like she's
got her mind made up.

216
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,567
Well, it's not
really her choice.

217
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,938
Go easy on her, huh?

218
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,766
The Annex Project,

219
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,657
you said there
were no survivors.

220
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,590
Other than me and Killian.

221
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,553
Hey, what about after you?

222
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,829
I'm tracking a
breakout who can kill.

223
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:28,097
Maybe Ultra rebooted
the project.

224
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,618
What does your boss say?

225
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:32,133
Jedikiah denies knowing
anything about it.

226
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:33,253
Hmm.

227
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,636
- Which he would in any event.
- Exactly.

228
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:37,236
So how will I know
what I'm up against.

229
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,394
You won't.

230
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,264
Until he tries to
slit my throat.

231
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,536
That's why your uncle
was so hell-bent on

232
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,319
weaponizing our species.

233
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,839
We are the ultimate
killing machines.

234
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,926
I was about two minutes away from
sending a TAC team out after you.

235
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,878
- Not funny.
- Not joking.

236
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,849
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

237
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,550
No signatures matching our
killer. The guy's under a rock.

238
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,151
Sure about that?

239
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:12,954
No teleports within
the last 12 hours.

240
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,657
Try changing your
search parameters.

241
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,792
Why would he use that
much energy to teleport?

242
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,876
Because that's how much
he used last time.

243
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,931
(GASPS) Oh. What...

244
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:24,766
Did I break it?

245
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,601
It was five minutes ago.

246
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,303
Hillary, what happened?

247
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:30,138
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)

248
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,206
HILLARY: This place
is owned by the guy

249
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,840
our dead witness was testifying
against in some mob trial.

250
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,045
Maybe our hit man is here
to collect his money.

251
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:40,007
With his lethal gene unlocked,
he's gonna have a leg up on us.

252
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,450
Well, there's one of
him and two of us.

253
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,159
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah, he's here.

254
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,490
We should split up.

me a heads up if you spot him.</i>

should see your face.

257
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:06,150
What are you doing here?

258
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,675
Same as you.
Tracking a breakout.

259
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:10,144
Why didn't you tell me your
partner was hella fit?

- Damn, girl.
- I have a deal with my uncle.

I stay in line, he
keeps my family safe.

262
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,166
- I'm bringing that guy in.
- You have a family to protect,

263
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,385
I have a species.

<i>(THINKING) No, no, no,

Where is he?

- I'll take that.
- No, not this time.

What up, Mom?

Wouldn't dream of it, baby.

288
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll throw together dinner.

289
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,642
Oh, already thrown.

290
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,444

- Mmm.
- I thought...

00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,750
Stephen was going to talk
to him about leaving.

294

(CHUCKLING) What's this?

295
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,890
Dig in.

296
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,268
Luca already ate
about half a cow.

297
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,679
I'm guessing you guys
don't get a lot of

298
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,311
proper family dinners.

299
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,065
I try.

300
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,023
But lately I've been lucky to get a
glimpse of my family these days.

301
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,633
It seems like Stephen just comes
home to change his clothes.

302
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,875
Well this looks great.

303
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,910
You know, I...

304
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,872
I can't even begin to imagine

305
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,486
how hard it's been for you.

306
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,817
And Luca. I can tell you this,

307
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:55,654
when Stephen's gone, he is out
there protecting paranormals.

What do you mean?

309
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,046
I thought he was just an intern.

310
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,294
Don't Ultra study the
Tomorrow People?

311
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,497
Ultra hunts the Tomorrow People.

312
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,401
What?

313
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,972
Stephen has been acting
as a double agent

314
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,065
to help us stay one step
ahead of Jedikiah and his

315

lunatic partner.

316
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,571
That we're even surviving is

317
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,272
pretty much thanks to him.

318

00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,091
Just like his father.

321
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,763
Ahem.

322
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,319
Your husband was, umm...

323
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,469
very important to me.

324
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,238
You knew Roger?

325
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,379
So I know how much
Stephen takes after him.

326
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,482
Carrying the world
on his shoulders.

327
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,151
Doing the right thing.

328
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:01,848
No matter what the cost.

329
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,476
I pay the cost, every day.
Right here.

330
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,024
So does Stephen.

331
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,026
Family is everything to him.

332
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,933
Which is why you got to
understand that if you leave,

333
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,497
if you force Stephen,

334
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,767
he would be leaving
his other family.

335
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,748
And we need him just
as much as you do.

336
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,285
Hi.

337

338
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,757
My God.

339
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,926
They've gotten so big.

340
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,663
It's been four years.

341
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,059
I keep trying to

342
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,236
lose track of the time,
I figured it would...

343
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,738
you know...

344
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,973
make missing you hurt less.

345
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,142
Am I supposed to
feel sorry for you?

346
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,944
No.

347
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,182
You were right.

348
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,720
I brought nothing but
danger to your doorstep.

349
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,061
I know we've said our
share of goodbyes, but...

350
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,864
this is it.

351
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,133
I love you.

356
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,094
I ask the questions.

357
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,428
Who are you?

358
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,676
See? That was a question.

359
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:58,268
Are you getting the
hang of this, yet?

360
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,811
The hit man you hired.

361
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,100
The one you gave the money to,

362
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,432
how do I get ahold of him?

363
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,540
What hit man?

364
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:09,079
Was that a question coming out of that
pretty little Russian mouth of yours?

365
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:12,950
Uh...

366
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,840
I have a number for you.

367
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,389

370
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,500
Talk about a fishing expedition.

371
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:33,703
This fish lost a million bucks,
he's out looking for it.

372
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,872
Only a matter of time.

373

<i>(THINKING) If you can hear
this, we have your briefcase.</i>

374
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,751
Get up.

375
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,586
What are you doing?

376
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,288
Have you ever heard of pajamas?

377
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,356
Oh, excuse me.

378

00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,364
We gotta go.

00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,099
- Where?
- I found him.

383
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,834
Our breakout assassin.

384
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,370
How?

385
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,482
The owner of the club is being
indicted on racketeering charges.

386
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,076
He was the one who ordered
the hit on his main witness.

387
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,981
The motel murder victim.

388
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,679
I've got the hit man's number.

389
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,961
So what are we gonna do with it?

390
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,349
Not we. You.

391
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,084
You're going to hire
him to kill a guy.

392
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,079
It's under "H", for hit man.

393
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:27,890
Let me grab my "P" for pants.

394
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,774
You the guy?

395
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,843
I'm the guy.

396

Have a seat.

397
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,348
You seem

398
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,050
young.

399
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,984
Well you're not exactly what
I was expecting either.

400
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,735
You know, you come highly
recommended from a friend,

401
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,457
but maybe he was wrong.

402
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:05,494
Look, I gotta ask.

403
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,863
Are you affiliated with a
law enforcement agency?

404
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:11,333
Reminding you it would be entrapment
to lie about said affiliation.

405
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:12,835
No.

406
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:15,104
I'm just looking for a permanent
fix to a real problem,

407
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,605
you know what I mean?

408
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,608
You mean...

409
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,310
Murder?

410
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:23,928
The murder you had in mind

411
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,387
is gonna cost you a
million dollars.

412
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:27,519
Seems a little steep.

413
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,165
Plenty of guys could
do it for less.

414
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:31,720
But I'm the best.

415
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:34,723
I can get in anywhere,
anytime, anyhow.

you not to kill?

How is he able to kill?

00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,020
Huh? My brother needs me.

486
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:42,907
Because you're
shrewder than he is.

487
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,510
Nature's

488
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,272
pathetic attempt at
balancing the scales,

489
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,714
but let me tell you
something, kid.

490
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,250
One day your brother's going to
realize he doesn't need you.

491
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,160
You're weak.

492
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:55,543
You're a burden to him.

493
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:57,444
An albatross around his neck.

494
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,224
He doesn't need you.

495
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,393
But what if I could help you?

496
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:06,864
What if I could help you get the
powers that are your birthright?

497
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,234
Make you your brother's equal.

498
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:12,737
How?

499
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:16,253
Mmm. Well I would
need a donor, first.

500
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,944
Your twin.

501
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:35,798
The answer's no, Stephen.

502
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,834
Cyrus may not be able to kill,
but he's an accessory to murder.

503
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:40,235
Let me take him in.

504
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:42,873
It is my duty to protect the
Tomorrow People. All of them.

505
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:45,513
What about the other criminal
breakouts we've given to Ultra?

506
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:48,153
Cyrus was being manipulated
by his brother.

507
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:50,994
If you want to punish someone, it
should be the brother that you've got.

508
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:52,381
But no. You and Jedikiah
are too busy scheming

509
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:54,249
to make Nathan sell
out his own twin.

513

You're supposed to
be our inside man.

514
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:05,385
And you're supposed to
help me protect my cover.

515
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,376
I don't want to argue
with you, Stephen.

516
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:10,545
I'm sorry, I just
don't have it in me.

517
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,831
This place is falling
apart without John.

518

(DOOR CLOSING)

520
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:23,506
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Cara is so...

521
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,692
Stubborn? Fearless?

522
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,529
- Beautiful?
- In over her head.

523
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,732
First kicking out, then
refusing to let go of Cyrus,

524
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,687
she's just making one
mistake after another.

525
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,036
She does have a point.

526
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,359
Really? You're going
to defend her?

527
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,786
Jedikiah is going to use
these twins as Guinea pigs.

528
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:41,188
I thought that was just a ploy.

529
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:43,344
No. It's real. Trust me.

530
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:48,249
Power transplants are the
Holy Grail for Jedikiah.

531
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,118
Well, has he ever succeeded?

532
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:52,420
No.

533
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,655
I saw one once myself.

534
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,151
The human is forced to watch

535
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:04,450
as the paranormal is strapped
into this medieval looking chair

536
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,201
that harvests their stem cells.

537
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,970
Every time,

538
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,039
the paranormal dies.

539
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,340
In pain.

540
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,260
Imagine if that
was you and Luca.

541
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,990
Okay. I get it.

542
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:22,816
So, like I said, maybe Cara's
right to want to hold on to him.

543
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:29,101
Look, uh, obviously murder is...

544
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,677
wrong, but...

545
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:33,705
How do you and your brother
spend all the money?

546
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,714
Are we talkin', uh, models
and bottles in Dubai?

547
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,422
Savile row tailors?

548
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,335
Holidays on the Riviera?

549
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,303
Paint me a picture.

550
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,906
Uh, we bought a house.

551
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,508
Uh, in Connecticut.

00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:50,344
Buzzkill.

Cyrus, listen to me.
It is a trap.

562
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:13,615
Your brother's been
captured, and he's trying

563
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,216
to manipulate you into
turning yourself in.

564
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,480
(STAMMERING) No, I can
feel him. He needs me.

565
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,357
Your brother has been
using you for years.

566
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,393
This is finally your
chance to be free of him.

No...

00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:24,306
(STAMMERING) No, I have to
get to my brother. Please.

569
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:27,190
- No, I will not let you...
- He's my family.

570
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:31,195
You must have someone in your life
you'd sacrifice everything for.

571
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:35,418
I thought your offer to give
Nathan powers was a trick.

572
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:38,021
But it's real, only the procedure
will kill his brother.

573
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,033
Hmm.

574
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,806
I wonder where you got that
little piece of information?

575
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,565
Not many of our agents know about
our transference protocol.

576
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,178
Well, you're right. In the past
the donor has typically...

577
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:52,667
expired.

578
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:54,294
But that's science, Stephen.

579
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,741
It's success built upon
decades of failure.

580
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,919
And besides, we've never tried
the experiment on twins before.

581
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:01,247
And you never will.

582
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,551
Cyrus isn't gonna fall for your little trap.
The guy's sitting on a million bucks.

583
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,519
He's probably out of
the country by now.

he dies.

00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,728
It's just the
perfect case study.

643
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:18,721
Two specimens, almost identical,

644
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:22,535
offers us the chance to study the
gene that makes you so special.

645
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:29,542
Any scientist would've killed
for the chance to study them.

646
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,612
Perhaps a poor choice of words.

647
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,564
Or maybe a scientist who himself

648
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:38,091
had a paranormal brother.

649
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,185
Hmm.

650
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:42,989
Well, I'm sure my own
personal history probably

651
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,542
fueled my interest
subconsciously.

652
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,693
I think it's a little
more than that.

653
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,061
Meaning?

654
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:53,800
When I asked you what happened to my
father's body after he was killed,

655
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,949
you said you cremated him.

656
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,102
I did.

657
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:58,637
Why?

658
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:01,183
You are so excited
about the possibility

659
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:03,391
of transferring powers
between siblings.

660
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:05,387
You're telling me
that you didn't wanna

661
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,227
study your own brother?

662
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,414
See if it was possible
to gain his powers?

663
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:12,408
I value my humanity, Stephen.

664
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:16,221
And he was my brother.
Not a lab rat.

665
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,458
I shouldn't have to explain
those feelings to you.

666
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,850
You have something for me?

667
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:47,236
I'm not sure you earned it.

668
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:49,988
You didn't finish
the job, Cyrus.

669
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,579
Your boy, Stephen,

670
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,426
got in the way, and now
my brother's dead.

671
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:58,396
(SNIFFING) So, yeah, I'd say we earned it.

672
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:08,540
(SNIFFING)

673
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:17,816
JOHN: Has it really
come to this?

674
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,653
Hiring contract killers
to do our dirty work?

675
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:25,190
What'd you do, give him
my gun from the lair?

676
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:32,063
You know, I have always
admired your resolve.

677
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:35,533
But this time,
you've gone too far.

678
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:40,638
I had a chance to take
out Jedikiah. I took it.

679
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:42,840
Would you listen to yourself?

680
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,578
You still care for Jedikiah.

681
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:50,281
Or else you'd see I'm right.

682
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,788
Cyrus asked me something.

683
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,523
If there was anyone in my
life I would sacrifice

684
00:37:02,774 --> 00:37:04,144
everything for.

685
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,732
It's you.

686
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:14,872
You're my family.

687
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:22,713
Come back with me.

688
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:30,017
So that you could have an
assassin at your disposal?

689
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:31,822
No thanks.

690
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,793
No, John, that's not what I...

691
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:38,395
I miss you.

692
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:00,350
Hey.

693
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:02,653
Hey.

694
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:05,756
What are you doing up?

695
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:07,658
Waiting for you.

696
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,793
Is everything okay?

697
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:12,796
You tell me.

698
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,400
Yeah, everything's fine.

699
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,368
For now.

700
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:21,571
For now is about as
good as we can hope.

701
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:24,408
(SIGHING)

702
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:27,978
John told me what
you're doing at Ultra.

703
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,981
The war that you're fighting.

704
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:33,923
After everything I did
to try to keep you safe.

705
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,452
Mom.

706
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:40,490
(SIGHING) I always resented your father for
choosing the fight over our family, but...

707
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:43,326
Maybe I was wrong.

708
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:51,419
Mom, everything that I'm
doing is for this family.

709
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:52,607
I know.

710
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:54,525
And I'm proud of you.

711
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:56,749
You're a born leader,
just like your

712
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,075
pain-in-the-ass father.

713
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,513
So we can stay.

714
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:06,649
And you can keep
working at Ultra.

715
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:08,785
Because I know it's important.

716
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:12,355
But I can't stop being your mom.

717
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:15,817
I need to provide some

718
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:18,751
semblance of a normal
life for you and Luca.

719
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,164
I know.

720
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:23,011
Luca needs it.

721
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:26,970
So do I.

722
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:31,574
But the days of burying my
head in the sand are over.

723
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:33,810
I know you're in danger.

724
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:35,044
At Ultra.

725
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:38,031
So every night,
when you come home,

726
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:39,758
I'll be waiting.

727
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:43,252
Because I won't be able to rest
until I know that you're safe.

728
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:47,523
I'm safe.

729
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,226
For now.

730
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,632
That's gonna have
to be good enough.

731
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,735
Good night, Mom.

732
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:27,730
I was so close.

733
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:30,699
So close.

734
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:35,348
I had the perfect two candidates,
and somehow, I just let 'em

735
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,239
slip through my fingers.

736
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,244
Well, you know what that means.

737
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:46,482
You and I are going to have
to put our plans on hold.

738
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,317
Again.

739
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:53,589
I'm so sorry.

740
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:07,636
Oh, yeah, you know, I
forgot to tell you.

741
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:09,237
Your son.

742
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,139
Sharp kid.

743
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:13,508
He's looking for you.

744
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:16,211
He's getting closer every day.

745
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,881
You'd tell me if he tried to contact
you in any way, wouldn't you?

746
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:25,587
You know what happens when we
keep secrets from each other.

747
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,324
Okay.

748
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:32,460
Anyway.

749
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,864
Good night, little brother.

750
