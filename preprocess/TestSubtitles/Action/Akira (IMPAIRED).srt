00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,853
"Haruki-ya"

2
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,703
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms

3
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,040
enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

4
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,585
And with the confusion among members
of Parliament sparked by the comments of

5
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,089
Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent Parliament inquiry,

6
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,593
there seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

7
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,470
Hey. What'll it be?

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,848
Give me three peanuts.

9
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,226
Let's see here...

10
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,326
We've herded those
Clown bastards onto Route 5.

11
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,790
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,502
You wouldn't be so jumpy if
you didn't have something to hide!

13
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,423
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

14
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,552
How about buying something
for once?! This ain't a hangout!

15
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,054
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

16
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,937
Twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...

17
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:14,318
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,779
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

19
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,326
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

20
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,912
All right, let's go!

21
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,792
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

22
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,213
I don't see how you can
ride something like that, man.

23
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,799
I could!

24
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,136
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

25
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,828
Unbelievable.

26
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,914
School kids these days...

27
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,625
Wait! Hey, waiter!

28
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,840
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

29
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,023
This isn't a game, you idiot!

30
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,902
Shit...!

31
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,342
That's...

32
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,928
This is car 375.

33
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:33,058
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

34
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,938
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

35
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,523
It's the cops! What should we do?

36
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,859
Damn, and my motor coils
were just getting warmed up...

37
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,449
Bastards...

38
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,535
Let's go, Tetsuo!

39
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,744
Right!

40
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,496
Damn!

41
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,050
A skirmish has broken out
between student protesters

42
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,053
and riot police assigned as security.
There appear to be some casualties.

43
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,471
Furthermore...

44
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,531
What the...?

45
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,702
What the hell's going on?!

46
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,455
Move it, jerk! I'm in a hurry!

47
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,221
What was that?!

48
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,890
Call the police!

49
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,900
Repeal the tax reforms!

50
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:27,088
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

51
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,298
Something's strange here...

52
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,175
Let me through! I'm sorry, let me through!

53
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,010
What's the big idea?

54
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,353
Look! Blood!

55
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,230
Who are they?

56
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,523
...Excuse me.
... Hey! Don't push!

57
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,315
Excuse me.

58
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,484
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

59
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,240
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

60
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,658
Ryu!

61
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,660
Hey! He ran away!

62
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,084
He's got a gun!

63
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,926
Fire!

64
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,470
Hold your fire! There's a kid with him!

65
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,899
Run...

66
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,026
Hurry...

67
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,865
Go to Ryu...

68
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,952
Ryu will help you now...

69
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,126
Hurry... Get out of here...

70
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,783
Kei!

71
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,288
What are you doing? Hurry!

72
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,169
He vanished...!

73
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,055
He's to the west.

74
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,475
The west? He's in the old city, then.

75
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,570
Eat this!

No, that's...!

How you like that?!

83
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,735
Well? Who is it?

84
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,446
It's not him! It's not Tetsuo!

85
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,448
Okay! Let's go!

86
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,541
You little... What did you do...?

87
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,224
Tetsuo! Hang on! Hey!

88
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,727
Huh? What did you say?

89
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,604
That kid...

90
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,235
He's hurt bad!

91
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,655
Hey! Wait!

92
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,739
We gotta get him to a hospital!

93
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,576
...He needs an ambulance!
... We can't move him!

94
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,921
W- What the hell?!

95
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,229
There's no escape.

96
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,779
We've come for you.

97
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:36,040
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

98
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,920
It's the army! Those are army helicopters!

99
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,345
Move out!

100
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,191
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

101
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,111
Um... We're just, uh...

102
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,572
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

103
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,250
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

104
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,668
Kai!

105
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,258
Hey!

106
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,426
Sir?

107
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,302
Who are they?

108
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,638
They seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.

109
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,281
We're going back.

110
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,075
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

111
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,077
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

112
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,288
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

113
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,414
Tetsuo!

114
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait! Where are you taking him?

115
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,752

116
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,922

So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

123
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,077
and a group of hooligans called
the Clowns picked a fight with you.

124
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,538
They hurt your friend,
so you lost your temper,

which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

Hey! You can't look at this!

And how's your mother doing?!

Huh? Oh.

Luckily, she made it
through the worst of it last night.

And I suppose she's made it over

hunt down anti-government groups now, huh?

...Wanna put up a fight, huh?

just hang yourself or something!

Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

What? You son of a...

150
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,557
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

151
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,142
"Pops"?!

152
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,227
There was one more of us.

What?

00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,112
This is her. Can she leave with us?

I'm not even married!

Call a doctor!

that weird kid Kaneda saw...

I think I saw him, too.

And what about Tetsuo?

165
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,015
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,600
What did you say?!

167
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,145
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

168
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:54,734
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

169
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,905
Skirt-chasers will try anything these days...

170
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,824
You'll help anyone so
long as they're a girl, won't you?

171
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,744
No way! I have high standards!

172
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,747
It's not their looks that count.

173
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,751
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that moves me.

174
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,088
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

175
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,590
I'm Kaneda. Nice to meet you.

176
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,134
See you around, Kaneda.

177
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,054
You're leaving already? Don't be like that!

178
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,391
Hey, come on! I did save you and all!

179
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,941
At least tell me your name, you bitch!

180
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,072
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

181
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:46,410
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

182
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,248
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

183
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,999
Even if that's true...

184
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,043
That isn't important.

185
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,506
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

186
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,925
I never studied them in school, you see.

187
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,886
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

188
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:09,600
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

189
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,231
There's a phone call for the Colonel.

190
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,027
You should put your affairs in order.

191
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,116
It's me.

192
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,805
This way, Colonel.

193
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,808
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

194
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,061
but there's something you really must see.

195
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,650
Please observe.

196
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,903
It's the special pattern from that young boy.

197
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,114
It doesn't resemble any I've seen so far,

198
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,242
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or configuration like this.

199
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,913
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

200
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,583
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

201
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,626
I'll superimpose it over this one.

202
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:27,762
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

203
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,932
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving

204
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,894
the riddle of Akira's pattern growth process.

205
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,687
All right. Continue.

206
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,397
Very well, sir. Thank you.

207
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,193
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

208
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,404
It may be rough on him,

209
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,949
but I thought we might try
starting him off with level 7 capsules.

210
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,242
Is it safe?

211
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,494
Leave everything to me.

212
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,746
That's not what I meant!

213
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:58,751
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

214
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,254
will we be able to control it?

215
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,590
Well, that's...

216
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,425
Can I leave this to you?

217
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,889
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data

218
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,810
and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

219
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,358
Maybe we shouldn't touch that power.

220
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,694
The power of God?

221
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,574
A... ki... ra...

222
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:36,664
But we have to. We have
to touch it and control it.

223
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,584
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

224
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,420
There can be no hesitation!

225
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,338
Very well, Colonel.

226
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,675
"Ward 8 Vocational Training School"

227
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:52,346
If trash like you, that can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students

228
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,559
and can't adapt to living in a group,
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

229
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,229
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

230
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,565
you're sent to the regular courts!

231
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,067
Bite me! Don't mess with us, you bald goat!

232
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,694
Aren't any of you listening?

233
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,280
...You lost me halfway through!
... Discipline!

234
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,573
Discipline!

235
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,907
...Discipline!
... Ow!

236
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,410
Discipline! Discipline!

237
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,786
Discipline!

238
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,705
Dismissed!

239
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,542
Thank you very much, sir!

240
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,754
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

241
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,839
We're gonna remember this!

242
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,048
I hope you rot and die!

243
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,800
You sick bastard!

244
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,177
Shit...

245
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,184
Yamagata!

246
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,102
What happened to your cheek?

247
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,437
Shut the hell up.

248
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,397
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

249
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,317
They say you fought the
Clowns on a highway in the old city!

250
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:46,734
Yeah.

251
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,070
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

252
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,697
And last night...

253
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,699
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

254
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,743
And that idiot Tetsuo had an accident, too.

255
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,411
What happened to Tetsuo?

256
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,413
He's in the hospital.
I guess, but we don't know where.

257
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,916
The idiot was trying to show off.

258
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,045
That idiot...

259
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,047
What, you mean Tetsuo?

260
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,050
Shut up! I've had enough
of your damn flirting!

261
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,594
What's gotten into you?!

262
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,154
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

263
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,075
Doctor! There's a problem!

264
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:44,416
I can't. The dorm mother
throws a fit if you go out before 10.

265
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,378
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

266
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,423
That old bag's such a pain...
She's always yammering on and on and on.

267
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,176
Tomorrow at three? Sure, that'd be okay.

268
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,555
Hey, what happened
to that girl a while back?

269
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,559
I don't like her much.
Her personality just gets on my nerves.

270
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,519
Kaori...

271
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,939
Tetsuo!

272
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,860
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

273
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:22,413
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

274
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,623
And that examination...

275
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,169
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

276
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,839
I don't want to go back there.

277
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,549
Let's run away...

278
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,843
Where?

279
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:41,307
Someplace. Someplace far away.

280
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,811
...What's your problem?
... That's mine!

281
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,895
I wanna get laid!

282
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,897
Hey! Today's independent study!

283
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,944
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

284
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,946
Drag his butt in here!

285
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,907
Kaneda! Your bike!

286
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,618
My bike?

287
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,537
Look!

288
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,208
Tetsuo!

289
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,337
Are you sure this is okay?

290
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,048
Shut up! Just keep quiet and hang on!

291
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:23,349
"Off Limits"

292
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:25,893
Huh?

293
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,561
What's wrong?

294
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,564
Shit!

295
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:30,981
Oh, no...

296
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,027
"End the Shimamoto
Labor Union's Illegal Strike!!"

297
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,907
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.

298
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,409
...My butt hurts.
... Okay, I get it...

299
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,994
Look, bikes!

300
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,914
Is that Kaneda and...?

301
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,833
It's not them!

302
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,837
Kaori!

303
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,592
Any sign of him?

304
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,844
Kuwata and the others
went to look around Kisarazu.

305
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,764
All that's left now is the industrial area!

306
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,058
Okay, let's go!

307
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,189
We owe you for the other night!

308
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,949
Shut up!

309
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,121
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

310
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:39,299
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

311
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,931
Run!

312
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,641
Don't let 'em get away!

313
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,816
Wait!

314
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,994
Tetsuo!

315
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,670
"Smash the Strike!!"

316
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,054
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

317
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,099
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

318
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,893
Knock it off!

319
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,980
This happened because
you took my bike for a joyride.

320
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,898
Enough, already!

321
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,693
Shut up! Don't order me around!

322
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,403
We were worried about you.

323
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,324
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

324
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,912
I could've handled it myself!
I admit I got beat up that one time,

325
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,749
but I won't always be on the receiving end!

326
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,168
Understand?!

327
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,466
Tetsuo...

328
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,927
Shut up! Stay away from me!

329
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,557
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

330
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,559
Leave me alone!

331
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,562
Akira!

332
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,984
Tetsuo!

333
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,447
What's wrong?

334
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,074
Akira!

335
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,159
I don't know who that is!

336
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,809
Tetsuo, are you...

337
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,352
Hey!

338
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,316
This is strange.

339
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,403
I'm getting a blue pattern on scope #3!

340
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:08,198
Oh, no! Retrieve the subject! Hurry!

341
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,256
What're you doing to my friend?!

342
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,805
What's with you?
You just come back from a funeral?

343
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,521
Tetsuo!

344
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,231
Kaneda!

345
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,276
Shit...

346
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,578
Wait!

347
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,754
Hey, Kaneda...

348
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:20,187
I see we have some youngsters doing
their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

349
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,523
That just means that they're stupid, don't it?

350
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:31,490
This is boring. Hey, let's go home.

351
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,200
But it's still early!

352
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,204
Yeah, but without their bikes
they're just skirt-chasers out of water.

353
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,413
You mean "fish"!

354
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,959
Come on, let's go. Let's toss these fish back!

355
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,171
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

356
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,466
What the...?

357
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,884
Look!

358
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,412
That's...

359
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,374
Here we go again... Let's get out
of here before we get involved again.

360
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,334
Huh?

361
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,460
Kaneda?

362
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,004
Hey!

363
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,384
This area is being cordoned
off due to a terrorist bombing.

364
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,344
Those who wish to get
through, line up in single file,

365
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,515
present your ID and go through the checkpoint.

366
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,693
Get in.

367
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,864
What's wrong? Hurry. I'll be right behind you.

368
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,074
You know the rendezvous point, right?

369
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,454
...Be careful.
... You too, Ryu.

370
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,379
"We're the Clowns"

371
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,094
Stop! Stop, damn it!

372
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,473
She's got a gun!

373
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,986
Okay, that's far enough!

374
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,529
Drop the gun!

375
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,538
Drop it now!

376
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,129
Stop!

377
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,311
I think it came from over here!

378
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,146
...There were two shots!
... No, three!

379
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,898
It's just up ahead!

380
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,734
Hey. Let's get out of here.

381
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,194
Come on!

382
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:47,769
"Idiot | Moron | Fool | No. 1 "

383
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,970
Kaneda!

384
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,583
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

385
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,419
I had a dream.

386
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,254
A dream?

387
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:02,761
The city will be covered by a
dark shadow and start to crumble.

388
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,347
Lots of people died...

389
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,726
...and we met Akira again.

390
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,102
Akira?!

391
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:18,276
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

392
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,197
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

393
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,242
You mustn't let that boy go.

394
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,662
His power, it...

395
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,919
What did she mean?!

396
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,883
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

397
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,385
Her medication is normal. too.

398
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:48,056
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

399
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:53,770
I think what Number 25 said
was her precognitive power at work.

400
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,650
This must be presented to the
supreme executive council for inquiry, but...

401
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,527
Do you believe her?

402
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,988
I have no doubts
regarding Number 25's abilities.

403
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,907
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

404
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,618
What about you, Colonel?

405
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:13,206
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

406
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,845
Here, sir.

407
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:31,266
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

408
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:47,198
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

409
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,369
He wondered if their power was the form
the next stage of human evolution was taking,

410
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:56,958
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it someday.

411
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,919
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

412
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,089
Military men always consider the risks first.

413
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,717
It's taken thirty long years.

414
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,763
We've come so far from the rubble.

415
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,931
We can't just trade one for the other.

416
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,728
I've always thought that
you hated this city, Colonel.

417
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:22,192
The passion to build has cooled
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten,

418
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:26,154
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

419
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,075
So you're trying to save the city, then.

420
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,620
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

421
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,584
Colonel, we're here.

422
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,877
This way, sir.

423
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,818
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

424
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,570
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

425
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,158
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

426
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,036
Emergency power generator, check.

427
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,079
Open it.

428
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,497
Yes, sir.

429
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:17,997
Uh...

430
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,332
Go to the Control Room!

431
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,750
Yes, sir!

432
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:43,314
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

433
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:48,403
No abnormalities detected in any of the
rooms' Dewar Walls or in the defense system.

434
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,240
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

435
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,201
All systems nominal, then?

436
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,422
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

437
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,966
They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public.

438
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,385
They forgot all shame and honor

439
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,931
and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

440
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,686
and shut the lid of the Pandora's Box
they themselves had opened.

441
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:26,733
Ryu!

442
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,068
Hey, we're still young.

443
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,738
I think we can start over.

444
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,156
I'll go with you to the police.

445
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,115
Ryu!

446
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,742
Come on, turn yourself in!

447
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,994
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

448
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:38,661
Ryu!

449
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,623
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

450
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,000
let's go out for tea or something.

451
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,169
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

452
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:50,340
What's done is done. The guy's dead.

453
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,432
Who're you?!

454
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,143
Ryu! You're okay!

455
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,771
...Kei, is that you?
... Ryu!

456
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,232
Who's this?

457
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,775
Who, me?

458
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:14,948
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

459
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,535
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

460
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,619
...Are you a spy?!
... No!

461
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,496
Liar!

462
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,293
Is he really okay?

463
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,880
All I know for sure is that he's not a spy.

464
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,882
Ow...

465
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,261
Sneak into their lab?!

466
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,888
Are you serious? Don't you
remember the fiasco with that kid?!

467
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:43,017
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

468
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,481
The lab passes that they issue once a week...

469
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,525
They're from Mr. Nezu?

470
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,985
What's the objective?

471
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,779
Detailed data on the new subject.

472
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,406
New subject?

473
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:03,580
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

474
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:08,418
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

475
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,045
Looks like he's a student
at a vocational training school.

476
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,757
but he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

477
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,637
Ow!

478
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,224
Ow! What's the big idea?!

479
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,225
You!

480
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,810
He heard us! Let's kill him!

481
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,561
Ryu!

482
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,607
W- Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

483
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,733
He saved me!

484
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,067
Twice!

485
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,153
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

486
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,740
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is a friend of mine!

487
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,909
I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth!

488
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,704
I was there when it happened!

489
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,750
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

490
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,794
Huh? They don't?

491
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,882
That's an intriguing story.

492
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,885
Will you be taking the boy with you?

493
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:03,640
He knows the subject, and I think
we can use him as a decoy if necessary.

494
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,393
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

495
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:12,857
In all respects, this city is
saturated. It's like an overripe fruit.

496
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,693
And within it is a new seed.

497
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,864
We only need to wait for
the wind which will make it fall.

498
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,034
The wind called Akira!

499
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,412
Ryu, look!

500
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,789
What is it?

501
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,500
We aren't the ones who will change it,

502
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,712
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

503
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,549
That which is called
science perverts providence!

504
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,302
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

505
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,516
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

506
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:51,145
The time of atonement is upon us!

507
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,150
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

508
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,529
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

509
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,115
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

510
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,200
Break up this illegal gathering!

511
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,286
Terrorist activities carried out by

512
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,915
anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

513
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,169
The army, riot police, and even
traffic police have been fully mobilized.

514
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,589
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

515
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,008
And then there's the abduction of Number 26!

516
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:24,220
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

517
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,807
No one's ever heard of "Peace
and Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

518
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,394
And then there's this request of yours

519
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:36,441
for further funding because
of subject Number 25's prediction.

520
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,025
You must be joking!

521
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:43,322
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us

522
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:48,619
while we straighten out the former
Prime Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

523
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,748
so where, exactly, are we
supposed to get that kind of money?!

524
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,461
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

525
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,088
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

526
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,759
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

527
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,970
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

528
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,138
Shut up, old man!

529
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,139
What?!

530
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,018
That power is starting to
walk around free as we speak.

531
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:17,607
...Unless we control it now, we'll lose everything!
... Who do you think you're talking to, youngster?

532
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,651
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

533
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:25,281
There's still no proof that the
last World War was caused by Akira!

534
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:29,410
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all

535
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,412
unless an Akira disaster actually happens?!

536
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,998
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?

537
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,292
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

538
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,586
No, I think he was Number 21...

539
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,507
The Colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier.

540
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,842
I've had reports that
anti-government elements are using

541
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:50,723
this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

542
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,850
No! That's untrue!

543
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,478
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

544
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,563
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

545
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,067
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

546
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,946
Aren't you just using Akira as
camouflage to cover up your misconduct?

547
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,781
What are you getting at?

548
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:15,498
Colonel, we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

549
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,457
Right!

550
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,877
You are to be put before an inquiry committee.

551
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,337
I agree!

552
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,509
Excuse me!

553
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,845
Colonel! Colonel, where are you...

554
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,514
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

555
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,807
Explain yourself!

556
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,060
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

557
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,019
Colonel...!

558
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,855
Wait, Colonel!

559
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,045
W- Water...

560
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,413
Hey, wait a minute...

561
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,042
Isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

562
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,587
The cable they ordered came in early.

563
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,214
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

564
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,133
"Verify Pass Cards"

565
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,094
I've brought some workers with me, too.

566
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:57,266
I could take it back, but the
work's gonna be done sooner or later.

567
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,273
Okay, let's go.

568
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,573
What the...?

569
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,395
Milk?

570
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,322
Stay away!

571
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:29,877
Blood!

572
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,462
I'm scared!

573
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,014
Jerk!

574
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,350
W- Who the hell are they?

575
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,534
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

576
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,661
A problem with the automatic lock?

577
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,336
Hey! You can't just walk off from your room!

578
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,342
Come on, let's go back.

579
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,679
What the hell happened? What a mess!

580
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,331
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

581
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,877
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

582
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,462
That's probably the place.

583
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,008
The central wiring shaft should be up ahead.

584
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,844
We should be able to use it
to go straight to the sublevels.

585
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,349
Be careful. It's deeper in the middle.

586
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,934
What a stink!

587
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:50,809
Quiet!

588
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,021
What? I said it stinks because it stinks!

589
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,941
...Is your nose busted?
... Hurry up and stay quiet!

590
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,986
Damn! Hide!

591
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,404
Huh? Where?

592
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,782
What're you doing, you idiot?!

593
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,047
They left?

594
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,715
Looks like they've beefed up security.

595
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,467
Must be that siren we heard.

596
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,927
What should we do? Scout around some?

597
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,428
No.

598
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,680
...Are you okay?
... Let's keep going.

599
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,182
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

600
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,350
All right.

601
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,228
We've been spotted! Run!

602
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,521
Shit!

603
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,649
Don't! Don't shoot!

604
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,947
Shimazaki! Shit!

605
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,991
Forget about him! Run!

606
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,788
What the hell is that?

607
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,124
Here it comes!

608
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,168
Forget it! You can't do any good!

609
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,800
Die!

610
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,177
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

611
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,223
I have encountered intruders
and am engaging! Request backup!

612
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,100
Here it comes!

613
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,502
Kei!

614
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,506
Where's that gun?!

615
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,051
Damn it...!

616
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,763
Kaneda!

617
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,566
Kei, this way!

618
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,528
Hurry!

619
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,198
Kaneda, hurry!

620
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,964
Kaneda!

621
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,687
The brakes! Where are the brakes?!

622
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,939
That's not it?

623
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,941
This is the central wiring shaft!

624
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,859
It's gotta be this one, then!

625
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,785
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

626
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,079
Ask the Colonel for clearance to fire!

627
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,206
Turn that up!

628
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,707
There must be some mistake.

629
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,419
That boy looks like the
patient they admitted to the lab.

630
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,797
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

631
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,841
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

632
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,008
Tetsuo?!

633
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,928
He is in an extremely dangerous
state! Don't let him through!

634
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,931
I repeat, do not let him through!

635
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,127
What the...?

636
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,344
It's no use hiding.

637
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,513
We have no choice, then. Use your guns!

638
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,058
We can't let him go any
farther, no matter what it takes!

639
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,728
Fire!

640
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,686
So, here you are...

641
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,401
Stop it!

642
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:56,323
How long are you
gonna keep playing around?!

643
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,290
Where'd the other one go?

644
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,126
Why, you...

645
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,837
Die!

646
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,800
Takashi!

647
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:30,023
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

648
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,735
I never knew I had powers like this!

649
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,036
Damn it, which way should I go?!

650
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,665
Straight. Straight ahead...

651
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:47,749
Huh?

652
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,711
There's a freight elevator.

653
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,007
We can take it to sublevel 8.

654
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,851
Good, you're all together.

655
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,230
You thought you could kill me?

656
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:15,485
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

657
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,035
That was you...

658
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,494
Takashi!

659
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,538
Attack him together!

660
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,832
O- Okay.

661
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,005
You little twerps!

662
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,357
That's enough! All of you!

663
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,617
Who the hell are you?!

664
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,207
What's the matter?
Does your head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

665
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,209
Your power isn't fully matured.

666
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,544
If you push yourself,
you might do irreparable damage.

667
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,713
Just do as we tell you.

668
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:21,968
What the hell did you people do to my head?!

669
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,145
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

670
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,481
He can't control it.

671
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,362
What?!

672
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:46,118
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

673
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,704
She says something horrible will happen.

674
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,997
Mind your own business.

675
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,962
What? More powerful than me?

676
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:04,177
He's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

677
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,139
Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!

678
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:07,681
What?!

679
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,018
Kiyoko said that you'll awaken Akira.

680
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,980
If that happens, no one
will be able to stop him.

681
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,732
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

682
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,692
Impossible! Akira's already...

683
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,987
Where is he?!

684
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,156
Stop it!

685
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,949
Shut up!

686
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:35,041
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

687
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,212
Enacting disaster protocols.

688
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,799
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

689
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,094
Enacting disaster protocols.

690
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,763
What the...?!

691
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,605
Hands up!

692
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,818
Where the hell is the "Baby Room"?!

693
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,665
Oh, no! Run!

694
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,714
Gangway, coming through! Coming through!

695
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,591
Damn it, move!

696
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,053
Kiyoko...

697
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,449
Damn, that hurt...

698
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,578
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

699
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,584
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

700
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:05,799
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get
out of here, those guys outside are gonna...

701
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,928
There he is! Catch him!

702
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,391
Stay away from me!

703
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,604
Kaneda!

704
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:26,069
Oh, right. I forgot you were there, Kaneda.

705
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,280
That's okay, Kaneda.

706
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:32,868
I won't be needing you to save me anymore.

707
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,787
From now on, I'll be saving you.

708
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:39,082
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

709
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:44,337
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

710
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,716
You don't like the way I talk?

711
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,301
Does it make you mad?

712
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,011
Well, what're you gonna do about it?!

713
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,432
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

714
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:09,863
That's enough! Don't hurt anyone else!

715
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,783
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

716
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,994
He...

717
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:19,331
The Olympic stadium...?
In an underground facility?

718
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,126
No! You're wrong! Akira is...

719
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,588
Wait!

720
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,560
What the hell? I can do this, too?!

721
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,318
Kiyoko, are you okay?

722
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,236
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

723
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,031
What about you, Masaru? You're bleeding.

724
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,200
What happened to him?

725
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,493
He flew away.

726
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,329
How can he have so much power...?

727
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:05,210
How could this have
happened? Is anyone here?

728
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:09,005
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

729
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,257
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

730
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,719
...Find him! Go after him!
... Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

731
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,889
Hurry up! Get that rubble cleared!

732
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,518
He went to where Akira is.

733
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,522
What? You're all safe!

734
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,317
He's heading for the facility
below the Olympic construction site.

735
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,528
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

736
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:39,077
You mean he's gone outside?

737
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:44,791
Damn it! We'll follow him! Prepare for pursuit!

738
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,209
...Yes, sir!
... He's heading west!

739
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,962
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

740
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,798
Tell them to beef up their security!

741
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,009
...You...!
... Set up checkpoints on all...

742
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:04,477
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

743
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,563
...Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

744
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,775
...He has to be stopped before his powers mature... Two disguised
as workers resisted and were shot, and the rest are at large.

745
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,529
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

746
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,991
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

747
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,452
Request assistance from
the Eastern District Battalion.

748
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:20,952
Yes, sir!

749
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,371
Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

750
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,001
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

751
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,754
Who the hell are you?!

752
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:36,593
I'm here to inform you of the
supreme executive council's decision.

753
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,515
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is
hereby stripped of his command and rank,

754
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,934
and will be placed under arrest.

755
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,561
What?!

756
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,647
Please come with us.

757
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:54,152
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

758
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,198
...Shoot him.
... Yes, sir!

759
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,200
What?

760
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,118
W- Wait!

761
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,123
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

762
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,627
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

763
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:18,343
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

764
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:26,684
Announce a state of emergency,
arrest all members of the executive council

765
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,479
and remove them from
the chain of command!

766
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,356
We're going after Tetsuo!

767
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:35,568
Urgent message to all
district battalion commanders!

768
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:44,035
"Haruki-ya"

769
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:49,249
Hey, what's up? You by yourself?

770
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,545
Weren't you in an accident or something?

771
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:57,090
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

772
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,844
Gimme some... capsules.

773
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,597
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

774
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,809
Just hand 'em over!

775
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,894
All right, if you say so.

776
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:14,232
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

777
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:18,611
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

778
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:29,372
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's finished.

779
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:35,128
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

780
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:45,805
What's wrong?

781
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,557
"This End Up"

782
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,226
He's dead!

783
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,811
What?!

784
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,481
What the...?

785
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:01,863
Tetsuo?

786
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:06,701
What are you doing here?

787
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,537
You want some, too?

788
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,166
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

789
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,752
The barkeep's dead!

790
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,799
A fish out of water dies, huh?

791
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:27,931
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

792
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,183
Kaneda sends his regards.

793
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,684
You saw Kaneda?!

794
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,979
He's probably dead by now...

795
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:41,027
You did this, Tetsuo?

796
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,573
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

797
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:46,950
Tetsuo!

798
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,078
I don't need a piece of
junk like that anymore...

799
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,704
You son of a...

800
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,878
Yamagata!

801
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,303
Shit...

802
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,937
He went to where Akira is?

803
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,147
That's what that girl said.

804
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,568
The army, you, and Ryu are
all looking for this "Akira" guy,

805
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,862
so that's why you're chasing after Tetsuo.

806
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:29,158
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

807
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,911
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

808
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:39,377
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

809
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,421
Absolute energy?

810
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,425
Humans do all kinds of
things during their lifetime, right?

811
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,887
Discovering things, building things...

812
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:57,603
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

813
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:01,774
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

814
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,779
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

815
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,491
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

816
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:14,620
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

817
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:19,042
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

818
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:22,503
Because of genes, I guess.

819
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:27,633
And even before that, maybe
there were genes in the water and air.

820
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,219
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

821
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:34,682
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

822
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,519
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

823
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,523
Hey, what's the matter? Are you okay?

824
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,068
Did you get hit on the head back there?

825
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,863
Maybe everyone has those memories.

826
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,824
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

827
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:56,662
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

828
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,750
That's what Akira is?

829
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,045
Amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

830
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:06,839
They just devour all the food around them.

831
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:11,594
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

832
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,265
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

833
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,684
At the government's request, you see.

834
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:24,190
They failed, and it triggered the Fall of Tokyo.

835
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,736
That power is still too much for...

836
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,198
What?!

837
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,033
The door's unlocked.

838
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,788
Huh?

839
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,629
This has got to be a trap.

840
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:47,713
Go back, then.

841
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:52,009
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

842
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:58,891
By the way, what's
with you and that Ryu guy?

843
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,018
...What do you mean?
... You're always together.

844
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,855
That's none of your business!

845
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:08,776
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

846
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:09,694
"Us"?

847
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:13,156
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

848
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,615
Do you think this will work?

849
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:21,164
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

850
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:28,087
The fact that she turned up right
under our noses says as much, I think.

851
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,797
I guess...

852
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:47,523
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

853
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,943
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

854
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,779
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

855
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,909
We're at the Haruki-ya snack bar
near the highway interchange in Ward 8.

856
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:03,956
It doesn't look like a bomb
explosion, so we think it was him.

857
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,835
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

858
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,963
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Understood!

859
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:18,971
Kaneda!

860
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:22,058
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

861
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,977
Something seemed strange
about him from the second I saw him.

862
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,897
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

863
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,900
It was like he was a different person.

864
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:35,988
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo.

865
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,576
And then... Yamagata, he...

866
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,957
We've always been together.

867
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:52,380
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

868
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:57,343
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

869
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:01,847
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

870
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,808
My bike...?

871
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,652
What're you gonna do?

872
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,821
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

873
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,079
You dumb bastard!

874
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,958
Kaneda!

875
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:46,684
Kei!

876
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,311
What's wrong?

877
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,526
You! You were there that night...

878
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,156
Wait!

879
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,622
Kei!

880
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,585
They disappeared!

881
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,506
You were the ones who
changed Tetsuo too, weren't you?

882
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:22,595
Akira's power exists within everyone.

883
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,013
Who's there?!

884
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:31,395
But when that power is awakened,
even if you weren't prepared for it,

885
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:37,318
you must choose how to use it.

886
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,613
And he has made his choice.

887
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:47,078
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

888
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,290
We're partly to blame for his actions.

889
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,543
Why did you take Kei, then?!

890
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,296
We want her to help us.

891
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,633
You can't just use people
like that! Bring Kei back!

892
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:05,388
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

893
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,934
Hey!

894
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,477
Damn it!

895
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,773
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

896
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,024
Y- Yes, that's right.

897
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,652
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

898
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,028
Yes.

899
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,739
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

900
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,366
Yes.

901
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:29,453
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

902
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,041
I underestimated him.

903
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,673
Hold them here! Damn!

904
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,580
Mr. Nezu...

905
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:16,125
R- Ryu?! Is that you?

906
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,043
I'm sorry, sir...

907
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,588
The mission was a failure.

908
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,381
What are you doing here?!

909
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,967
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

910
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:27,970
All of my men...

911
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,889
They've all been killed.

912
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,517
Y- You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

913
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,311
What? You can't be...

914
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,566
Kei...

915
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,741
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

916
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,286
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

917
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,538
What?

918
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,624
7th Avenue is just ahead!

919
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,876
It intersects this road 100 meters from here!

920
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,049
Prepare for battle!

921
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,061
Right, we've spotted the subject.

922
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,522
What? Attack?!

923
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:23,692
But he's just a... We're attacking a boy?!

924
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,572
Look! There he is!

925
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:29,365
Impossible!

926
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,116
Is this for real?

927
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:42,461
"Samurai Spirit"

928
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,964
Firing preparations complete.

929
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,510
Damn it! Fire!

930
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,525
...Akira!
... It's Lord Akira!

931
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,486
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

932
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,280
That's not him! Don't be fooled!

933
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:10,364
That's not Lord Akira!

934
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,032
Shut up!

935
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,995
Long live Lord Akira!

936
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,913
Fire!

937
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:19,415
Huh?

938
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,041
What's wrong?

939
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:51,048
"Akira"

940
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:54,134
in spite of martial law in the
name of freedom of the press!

941
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,972
What in the world is
happening here in Neo Tokyo?

942
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:00,933
What you see here seems to
be fires caused by tank cannons.

943
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,978
But who is this young boy?

944
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:07,272
Is he fighting the coup forces all by himself?

945
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:13,779
Viewers, the army has just
illegally ordered us to land!

946
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,115
Freedom of the press is now in jeopardy!

947
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,575
What happened? Were they cut off?

948
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,703
The bridge! He's heading for the bridge!

949
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,872
Let's go see!

950
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,725
Are you really going alone?

951
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,186
He wants this, doesn't he?

952
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:49,356
We should call the gang together.

953
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,774
Hey!

954
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,402
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

955
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,948
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

956
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,707
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

957
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:11,253
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

958
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,590
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

959
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:22,139
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira"

960
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,600
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira"

961
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:30,189
Consume our unclean hearts!

962
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,691
Fear not!

963
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:38,197
Your bodies will be purified in the flames!

964
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,616
Ready!

965
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,203
Fire!

966
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,212
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

967
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:54,379
Aim!

968
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,048
Fire!

969
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,764
Watch this!

970
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,605
Look out! Let's get out of here!

971
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:24,118
Help me!

972
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,210
Ground forces! Ground forces, come in!

973
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,337
Report! What is the subject's status?!

974
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:36,922
Ground forces!

975
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,467
Call the Doctor.

976
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,554
We have confirmation of his
recent movements and are in pursuit.

977
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:46,098
His present position is... Let's see...

978
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:51,395
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

979
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:55,190
That's about 2 km south of the
Olympics construction site in the old city.

980
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,775
What?!

981
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,866
What was that?

982
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,868
Look!

983
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,621
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

984
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,207
Wha...?

985
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,417
Huh?

986
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:19,923
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

987
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,551
What? That's the subject?!

988
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,136
S- Stop!

989
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,096
Stop, damn it!

990
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,039
Nice place you have here.

991
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:44,007
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

992
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,679
You shouldn't use your power this way.

993
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:49,805
What?

994
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:54,643
In the end, you won't be able to control it.

995
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,144
The kids...

996
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,146
You're those brats, aren't you?!

997
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,041
Okay, then...!

998
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,064
What the...?

999
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,119
It's not safe here, Colonel!

1000
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,829
Well, what're you gonna do?

1001
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,126
Open up!

1002
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,680
What the hell?

1003
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,683
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

1004
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:25,020
That's the "Akira" you wanted to meet.

1005
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:27,856
There's your Messiah!

1006
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,400
After his transcendental awakening,

1007
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:35,238
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

1008
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,451
And that's what was left of it.

1009
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,418
"Cranial Nerve"

1010
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,589
The scientists back then
were unable to solve the mystery,

1011
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:56,885
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples

1012
01:31:57,094 --> 01:32:02,432
to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen capsule.

1013
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,059
SOL... We'll use SOL!

1014
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:05,727
Sir?

1015
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:10,273
Akira is already dead!

1016
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,735
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

1017
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:20,867
So come back with us!

1018
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,536
Like hell!

1019
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:25,288
Contact the central defense center

1020
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,042
and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

1021
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,669
Yes, sir!

1022
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,061
Hey, watch it!

1023
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:52,399
Damn it, move! Get out of the way!

1024
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:11,459
What is this, science class?

1025
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:31,396
What's wrong? Have some trouble?

1026
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:35,191
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

1027
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,319
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

1028
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,196
You had me worried again.

1029
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:43,491
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1030
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:48,204
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

1031
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:53,001
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

1032
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,170
You always treat me like a kid.

1033
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:58,048
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

1034
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:00,175
And now you're a boss, too...

1035
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:02,218
Of this pile of rubble.

1036
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:03,553
Kaneda!

1037
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,222
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

1038
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,975
Die!

1039
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,569
Tetsuo!

1040
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:45,345
Son of a...

1041
01:34:58,567 --> 01:34:59,859
Kei!

1042
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:02,987
Oh, hell!

1043
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:09,244
Let's do it!

1044
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,464
Got him!

1045
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:24,259
Huh?

1046
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,098
The battery?!

1047
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,183
What's the matter, Kaneda?

1048
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:35,979
God damn it! This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

1049
01:35:36,188 --> 01:35:37,981
Fight with your bare hands!

1050
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:42,736
Oh, this is funny...

1051
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:46,614
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1052
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:50,160
Now do you understand how it feels?

1053
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,251
What's this light?

1054
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:10,096
Well, did you hit him?

1055
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:13,099
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

1056
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,934
Prepare a second volley!

1057
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:42,462
Hey! Kaneda!

1058
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:03,817
Tetsuo!

1059
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,416
Shit...

1060
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,918
Huh?

1061
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:23,294
What the...?

1062
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,665
Correcting for tracking system error.

1063
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,709
T- minus-20 to energy alteration.

1064
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:04,210
...Fire extinguishers!
... Are you okay?

1065
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,003
Hurry! Hurry!

1066
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:07,881
What happened? What's going on?

1067
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,600
Kaneda!

1068
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:21,185
Kai! Kei!

1069
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,729
...Kaneda!
... Kaneda!

1070
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:23,646
Get on!

1071
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:24,898
Get on? Where?

1072
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:26,649
Hurry! Hurry!

1073
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,423
What's that?

1074
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:06,731
They say it's SOL.

1075
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:19,285
Magnificent...

1076
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:32,799
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

1077
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,676
That's when we do it.

1078
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:37,637
But will it work?

1079
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:43,267
The future doesn't
proceed along a single course.

1080
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:47,230
There ought to be a future we can choose.

1081
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,533
What's Tetsuo's status?

1082
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:00,535
Ah, Colonel...

1083
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:04,038
We set up a camera in the stadium a while ago.

1084
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,873
We have him under observation.

1085
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:11,421
Colonel, you must take a look at this data!

1086
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:14,590
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

1087
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,635
It's magnificent. Absolutely magnificent.

1088
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,513
This is clearly a proton collapse.

1089
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:24,684
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

1090
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:27,729
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics...

1091
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,188
No, science...

1092
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:32,525
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

1093
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,487
Oh. That's...

1094
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,198
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1095
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,576
Uh, Colonel!

1096
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,374
T- That's...!

1097
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:53,671
You bastard! What did I tell you?!

1098
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,506
B- But, Colonel!

1099
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:59,177
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject!

1100
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,055
Shut up!

1101
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,079
Shit! It's on fire!

1102
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:27,371
The battery! The battery!

1103
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,500
My bike! It's burning up!

1104
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:33,044
Hey, what's a bike or two?

1105
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:37,215
What? Then there's nothing
wrong with using yours, right?

1106
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:38,424
You heard that?

1107
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:39,675
Yeah, I did!

1108
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:41,803
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

1109
01:42:23,345 --> 01:42:25,263
Tetsuo?

1110
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:40,820
Tetsuo, why does
everyone call you "Akira"?

1111
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:45,366
He never existed in the first place.

1112
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:48,286
They didn't care who it was.

1113
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:53,040
Just so long as he destroyed things.

1114
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,543
Your arm!

1115
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:59,422
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

1116
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,719
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1117
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:08,931
It's nothing!

1118
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:09,849
Tetsuo...

1119
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:11,851
Shut up! Just go away!

1120
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:21,736
Medicine...

1121
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:25,114
What's wrong, Tetsuo? Are you in pain?

1122
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:28,868
Go back to the lab and
get me some of that medicine!

1123
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:30,703
Did you hear that, Doctor?

1124
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,121
Yes, Colonel.

1125
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,498
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

1126
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,084
I'm not entirely certain,

1127
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:41,464
but it seems that the power that had
been held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1128
01:43:41,673 --> 01:43:45,092
He may not be able to control the
power that has awakened so suddenly.

1129
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,803
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

1130
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:53,392
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

1131
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:59,941
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

1132
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:06,030
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

1133
01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:14,664
Kaori... Kaori...

1134
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:18,960
Please... I need that medicine...

1135
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:20,836
No...!

1136
01:44:21,046 --> 01:44:22,129
Tetsuo!

1137
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:25,383
Tetsuo!

1138
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,344
Tetsuo...

1139
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:02,169
Kaneda?!

1140
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,250
Huh?

1141
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,718
Son of a...

1142
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,515
You kids... What are you doing here?

1143
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,607
You never learn, do you?

1144
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,694
Tetsuo!

1145
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,460
Takashi...

1146
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:28,089
Akira...

1147
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,758
"Optic Nerve"

1148
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:45,856
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

1149
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:56,325
Kaori...

1150
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:02,498
Help me...!

1151
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:15,636
Help me!

1152
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,930
Stop it!

1153
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:35,656
Kaori?

1154
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,701
Kaori! Kaori!

1155
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,495
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!

1156
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:44,665
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

1157
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:47,460
What?! What did you say?!

1158
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:50,129
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

1159
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:52,756
My power's acting on its own...!

1160
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:55,217
Kaori!

1161
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,428
Kaori's dying!

1162
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:59,763
Kaneda, help me!

1163
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,849
Stop, Tetsuo!

1164
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:04,018
Stop it!

1165
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:08,022
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

1166
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:12,026
Tetsuo!

1167
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:16,572
Kaneda! Run away!

1168
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:31,587
Tetsuo!

1169
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:46,852
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru! Get away from here!

1170
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:52,358
Come on!

1171
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:01,825
I can't believe it. It's as if...

1172
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:17,508
Kiyoko! Taka...

1173
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,546
Hi, Akira.

1174
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:07,224
Th-This is...

1175
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,935
But that's... Oh, no!

1176
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:21,530
W- Where am I?

1177
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,866
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

1178
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:25,284
You'll be safe in there.

1179
01:50:25,493 --> 01:50:27,494
Kiyoko! Where are you?

1180
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:43,886
Tetsuo!

1181
01:50:44,095 --> 01:50:46,513
Kaneda!

1182
01:50:46,723 --> 01:50:48,098
Hang on!

1183
01:50:50,143 --> 01:50:52,561
...If you don't get out of here now, you'll...
... Out of the way!

1184
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:54,104
Tetsuo!

1185
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:56,357
Don't go!

1186
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:05,199
No, Takashi!

1187
01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:08,744
If you went in now, you'd be trapped, too.

1188
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:13,374
But none of this is his fault!

1189
01:51:19,798 --> 01:51:22,841
...Takashi!
... Takashi!

1190
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:36,105
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

1191
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:40,401
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

1192
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,111
You're right.

1193
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,238
Together, the three of us could...

1194
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:54,957
Oh, man...!

1195
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:58,502
We should get out of here. Hey!

1196
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,379
Kaneda...

1197
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:36,457
Look, you're not revving your engine enough.

1198
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:40,210
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

1199
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,879
What're you doing?

1200
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:44,131
Cornering, man.

1201
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:47,593
Got it, Tetsuo...?

1202
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:55,350
Look, there's another one!

1203
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,686
...Another transfer student?
... He was abandoned.

1204
01:52:57,896 --> 01:52:59,938
You can see it in his face.

1205
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:08,947
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

1206
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,408
Wait!

1207
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:31,738
This is Akira...?

1208
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:35,117
Yes. We called him.

1209
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:37,411
To have him take Tetsuo away.

1210
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,831
Take him away? Take him where?

1211
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,208
It's too much for Tetsuo.

1212
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:46,837
And for us. And for Akira.

1213
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:50,591
It's too big for us as we are now.

1214
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,595
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1215
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:57,848
You see, it's already begun.

1216
01:54:58,057 --> 01:55:00,267
Your friend's...

1217
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,978
My friend?

1218
01:55:03,187 --> 01:55:06,273
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

1219
01:55:31,758 --> 01:55:33,300
Tetsuo...

1220
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,932
This is yours, right?

1221
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:49,900
They're always like that with the
new kids. You came today, right?

1222
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:51,610
They beat me up, too.

1223
01:55:51,819 --> 01:55:54,905
But the truth is, those guys are wimps.

1224
01:55:55,114 --> 01:56:00,869
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

1225
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:04,039
To tell you the truth, I just got here myself.

1226
01:56:04,248 --> 01:56:06,041
I'm...

1227
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,751
Kaneda...

1228
01:56:09,003 --> 01:56:11,046
Kaneda?

1229
01:56:11,255 --> 01:56:11,838
Kaneda!

1230
01:56:12,048 --> 01:56:13,340
Kei?

1231
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:42,703
W- What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

1232
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:47,332
B- But this isn't...

1233
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:52,379
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!

1234
01:56:58,136 --> 01:57:01,304
Kei!

1235
01:57:06,894 --> 01:57:08,478
What happened?

1236
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:13,275
It's disappearing...! It's disappearing!

1237
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:27,349
Kaneda!

1238
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,665
Tetsuo...

1239
01:58:54,335 --> 01:58:56,169
Kaneda...

1240
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,547
Thanks.

1241
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:03,552
You called to me, right? I heard you.

1242
01:59:10,351 --> 01:59:13,270
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

1243
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,689
What about Tetsuo?

1244
01:59:15,898 --> 01:59:18,483
He left.

1245
01:59:18,693 --> 01:59:20,652
So did those three kids.

1246
01:59:20,862 --> 01:59:21,945
Akira, too.

1247
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:24,573
Kaneda, back then, you...

1248
01:59:26,409 --> 01:59:31,371
Kaneda! You're alive?!

1249
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:38,295
I thought you were in there for sure!

1250
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:39,379
Tetsuo...

1251
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:41,548
What happened to Tetsuo?

1252
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:43,008
Is he dead?!

1253
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:46,553
I'm not so sure. But he's probably...

1254
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:16,041
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1255
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:18,752
You see, it's already begun.

1256
02:00:37,563 --> 02:00:42,192
I am... Tetsuo.
