That's my baby, too.

162
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,243
Ifwe got back
together...

163
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,747
I ain't even about
to let you have my baby

164
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,249
so you can have him
hangin' out with you

165
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,251
and your fucked-up friends.

166
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:31,128
And how would Charlene
feel about that?

167
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,298
I ain't messin'
with Charlene no more.

168
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,759
Raheem, you ain't even
foolin' nobody.

169
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:39,303
Everybody knows.
It's all over the school.

170
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,264
Come talk to me
when you're serious.

171
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:43,766
I'm serious now.

172
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,100
I'm serious, too,
Raheem!

173
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,810
This does not
make you a man.

174
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,771
I need a real man.

175
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:52,232
I'm not lettin' my child
grow up and be fucked up

176
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:55,236
Iike you and your
stupid-ass friends.

177
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,154
Yeah, well,
fuckyou, then!

178
00:08:57,238 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't need
your tired ass anyway, bitch!

179
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,743
That was real smooth, man.

180
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,078
I'm squashin' her.

181
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,913
That shit is
too much work.

182
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,915
I should've
let you have her.

183
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,917
I let you have her.

184
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,418
Just buggin', man.
What's up?

185
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,753
Yeah. I thought so.

186
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,256
\ So you wanna
be a gangster... \\

187
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,882
Yo, Bishop!

188
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,261
What you want?

189
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,682
Your ass, punk!

190
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:25,724
People been sayin'

191
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:29,270
that you say
you can bust my ass.

192
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,272
You believe that shit?

193
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:32,273
So?

194
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,778
Chill, chill,
chill, chill, chill.

195
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,780
Smile, man, smile.

196
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,240
See this?

197
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,784
Take a real good look at him,

198
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:47,288
'cause that's how
a dumb nigger commits suicide.

199
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:50,791
You thinkyour shit
is that bad, man?

200
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,085
You got that much juice?

201
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,461
God damn right.

202
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,463
Don't nobody
fuckwith me.

203
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:58,799
'Cause you already
fucked up, man.

204
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:01,427
You can't fuck up somethin'
that's already fucked up.

205
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,305
Ifyou wasn't
as fucked up as you are,

206
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,432
you'd see
that shit, man!

207
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,059
What a dumb nigger, man.

208
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,770
Fuckyou, you beans and rice
son of a bitch!

209
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,148
Respect me.
I was almost your father,

210
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,483
but the line
was too fucking long!

211
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,819
Hey, hey,
it's cool, man.

212
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:20,070
It's cool.

213
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,990
Raheem, man, you better
tell your boy somethin',

214
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,826
'cause I don't care
if he's crazy or not.

215
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,953
I'll stomp the shit
out of his ass.

216
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,997
You ain't saying
nothing but a word!

217
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,833
He's just bullshittin'.
He didn't mean it.

218
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,293
Shit if I didn't mean it.

219
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,670
Fuck that little
Puerto Rican maricon!

220
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:39,298
Maricon? Maricon?
Ifyou're looking' for faggots,

221
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,842
you ain't got to look no farther
than your pa.

222
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,803
I hear he liked bein'
the prison yard whore!

223
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,847
Fuckyou,
motherfucker!

224
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,101
Get away from my store!

225
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,979
I'm gonna shoot
your pee-pee off, man.

226
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,278
Tell me that wasn't
the shit.

227
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,488
You're crazy, man.

228
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,950
Ain't had no fun like that
in a while.

229
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,161
That nigger had you
by your neck and shit.

230
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,621
I swear to God--

231
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,790
What's up, Fat Chops?

232
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,291
What's up, man?

233
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,626
Hey, how you doin'?

234
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,794
You're late, man.

235
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,295
I feel good.

236
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,214
Sorry, man.
I was busy, man.

237
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,966
I had a hard time
gettin' away, man.

238
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,801
Give those chubby palms
a rest,

239
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,719
you'd get here
with the rest of us.

240
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:28,806
Want to know
why I'm really late?

241
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,808
I was doin'
the hootchy-kootchy

242
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,018
with Donna Bromwell.

243
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,187
So you boned
Donna Bromwell?

244
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,147
Yeah, man.
She liked it, too.

245
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,608
My man,
finally got that ass.

246
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:40,985
I heard that.

247
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,111
Thankyou.
Appreciate it.

248
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,362
So how was it?

249
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,656
It was good.
What do you think?

250
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,325
I heard Donna Bromwell
was a real freak.

251
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:51,412
The bitch tried to fuck me
on the stove.

252
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,998
She still got that,
uh, tattoo?

253
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,750
No, man. I wasn't lookin'
for no tattoo.

254
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:01,463
I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy,
my friend.

255
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:05,009
You knew it was Donna
from that hair on her face.

256
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,427
Yeah, man, come on.

257
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,512
You didn't know about
Donna Bromwell, man?

258
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,139
What, man, what?

259
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:14,268
That she used to be
Donald Bromwell?

260
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,477
\ Big Don \\

261
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:16,478
Don Juan.

262
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,355
Fucky'all, man.

265
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,280
Get the fuck off me!

266
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,281
My man.

267
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,826
You big
fat-head jalopy.

268
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,077
'Reckin' crew!

269
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:36,290
Hope you're feelin'
lucky today, my brother,

270
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,792
'cause I'm getting ready
to bust your ass.

271
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:41,295
You want me
to lie to you?

272
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,797
Just 'cause you
pour syrup on shit

273
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,424
don't make it pancakes.

274
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:46,467
Q!

275
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:47,468
What's up?

276
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,636
What's happenin'?

277
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:51,305
You got that
party tape for me?

278
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:53,265
Yeah, I got the shit.

279
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,434
My brother, my brother,
my brother, my brother.

280
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,270
Bad news, though.
Bein' that we in a recession,

281
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,773
the shit's gonna cost
$1 5 instead of 1 0.

282
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,399
- $1 5.
- $1 5?

283
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,776
Hit the button!
Hit the button!

284
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,110
Pow!

285
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,780
Kiss? Money?
What you gonna do, sweetheart?

286
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,782
I ain't got all day.

287
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,077
Do what you're told.
Give me a kiss.

288
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,287
Was the last party
serious?

289
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,789
It was slammin'?

290
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,290
It was all right.

291
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,625
It was dope, right?

292
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,293
Do you hit
Brenda's skins?

293
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,461
What?

294
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,296
Did Brenda Witherspoon
shine your silver?

295
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,257
My mother shines
our silver.

296
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,300
All you could see
was that butt.

297
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,803
I don't know why you thought
that was so tough.

298
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,805
She got the snappy-nappy
dugout piece.

299
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,682
Snappy-nappy
dugout piece?

300
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,143
Did you fuck
Brenda Witherspoon?

301
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,146
Yeah, I did, man.

302
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,648
Yeah?
You did, right?

303
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,733
$1 5, G.

304
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:47,319
Lord, I came
at the perfect time.

305
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,321
Pop two quarters in,
pop-tart,

306
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,323
and let's get it on.

307
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,242
Let me get
in that ass.

308
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:56,245
What makes you think
you can beat me?

309
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:57,413
Two reasons.

310
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,749
1 --if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

311
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,253
2--if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

312
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,797
Get this goddamn
game started,

313
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,257
tugboat ass
motherfucker.

314
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,758
What's up?
What's up?

315
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:12,720
What you got?
Hey! Hey!

316
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,264
[Siren]

317
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,807
Here they come!

318
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,268
Put your asses
back in school!

319
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,061
What's up? What's up?
Outta there.

This shit is mine,

some bullshit-ass
deejay contest.

370
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,540
First prize is
custom gold 1 200s

371
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,584
and a six-month contract
to deejay at the Ruffhouse.

372
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:34,588
Better than this pool hall
nickel-and-dime bullshit.

That was the Hott Boxx.

378
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,850
Anybody could have won
in that shit.

379
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,852
This is the Ruffhouse.
The comp will be serious.

no greater comp than me.

Yes.

00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:21,290
Mr. Quiles was regularly
harassed by local gangs.

1149
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:34,053
Puerto Rican gang.

They think they rule
the fuckin' world.

1151

Didn't your gang
regularly harass Mr. Quiles?

1152

No. 'Cause
we're not a gang.

Yeah. We didn't
kill him, though.

We didn't say
you killed him.

harassed Mr. Quiles!

If anybody had a motive
to do Raheem in,

1159
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:57,451
it would have
been Radames.

1161
