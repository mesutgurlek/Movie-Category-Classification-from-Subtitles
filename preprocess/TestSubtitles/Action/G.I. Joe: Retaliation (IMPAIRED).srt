Sir, launch controls are nearly up.

700

make a kid this big, man?

Can we be traced?

747
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,209
We can mask our IP addresses.

We're fighting uphill here.

I came here when I was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.

775
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,179
I was bounced around
from home to home, until this

776
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,465
became my home.

777
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,434
Guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.

00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,856
They whooped my skinny ass so much
I started to enjoy it.

Till one winter,

780
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,278
I grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.

781
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,033
I punched a guy so hard
he couldn't move his arm to tap out.

782
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,611
Then when the Joes
came recruiting to the hood,

783
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,787
I'd already beaten down half of it.

I became a Joe to serve. In the field.

we take the hill.

Between August 9th and August 19th,

800
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,034
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"

801
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,208
and started using "I mean" and "sort of."

802
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,956
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."

803
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,174
"Soda" became "pop."
