00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:38,024
What about her?
He said to tell you
it was the wife of Wyndom Jackson.

156
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:43,626
You know, now that I think of it,
that mysterious woman yesterday--
Orchid, you said her name was.

157
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:48,003
It was difficult to tell through
the black veil, but she could have been
Wyndom Jackson's wife.

158
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,235
Of course, we've never
been properly introduced,

159
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,767
but once at the garden club
cotillion when I chaired
the entertainment committee,

160
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:56,508
she was chairing
the dance committee--

Oh, well.

[ Magnum Narrating ]
When Christie hired me
to play games with Louise,

163
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,965
she'd conveniently used
her sister's maiden name.

164
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:20,699
She knew if she told me
who Louise was married to,
I wouldn't have anything to do with her.

Even at triple my normal rate.

166

Wyndom Jackson was notorious
for two things--

167
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,541
his money and his temper.

168
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:33,415
The first he'd picked up after the war
by investing in property.

169
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:36,387
The temper I guess he was born with.

who always got his way,

Plenty. Starting with
who your sister really is.

a difference to you.

Married to Wyndom Jackson
makes a real big difference.

00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:32,070
is it morality or economics?

187
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:34,669
Are you so angry because
Louise has a husband...

188
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,910
or because he's one of the Islands'
five richest men?
Both.

189
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:42,216
And I sure as hell
wouldn't play war games
in an alley with Wyndom Jackson's wife.

190
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,984
Why not, Magnum?
Are you a reverse snob?

191
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:48,458
No. Because the stakes
are too high with your crowd,
and things go wrong.

192
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:51,690
And people like you
don't pay the bills,
and people like me get stuck.

193
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,665
Are you afraid?
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

194
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:58,363
I'm afraid of hurting my friends
who helped me stage the attack.

195
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,531
What if Jackson finds out
and he doesn't like
that particular game?

196
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,666
He'd run them down
without even looking back.

197
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:07,179
Are you so confident
he doesn't know about Louise's
penchant for drama?

198
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,942
Oh, come on.
That's the whole idea
of the games, isn't it?

199
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:12,484
To keep Louise occupied
and out of public trouble?

Then I suggest you ask Louise.


459
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:08,482
Magnum.

460
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:12,690
Thank you for saving my life.

461
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:16,427
I meant to thank you before,
but I'm afraid I lost consciousness.

462
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:21,871
Christie, take Louise
down to the car.
No. Wait, please.

463
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,400
Magnum, maybe you think
you saved Louise's life
and I should be grateful,

464
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:30,676
but you're wrong,
because I really hold you responsible
for everything that's happened.

465
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,444
Stop it, both of you, please.

466
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:37,284
You know,
I don't know who beat me up
or who's after her or why,

467
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:39,346
but somebody poisoned her.

468
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,984
I poisoned myself.

469
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:50,460
I put the poison in the thermos
the night before as part of the game.

470
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:53,594
To take if you wouldn't continue.

471
00:34:55,907 --> 00:35:00,503
And the next morning,
when it was obvious
that you weren't going on with it,

472
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,978
I took it.

473
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:06,983
But believe me, Magnum,
I would never have let you
take any of it.

474
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,685
But I took it.

475
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,714
And I'm ashamed.

476
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,424
Please take me home.

477
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,871
I'm sorry.

[ Higgins ]
You promise to leave
the living room exactly as it is...

479
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:44,048
and stay away until Mable Dodge
has redecorated the bedroom?

480
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:47,489
Whatever you want.
Now what can you tell me
about the poison she took?

481
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,021
She was very fortunate
to reach the hospital so quickly.

482
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:56,931
The poison Louise ingested
is particularly vicious,

483
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,196
because unless counteracted quickly,

484
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,933
it's virtually impossible
to reverse its destructive processes.

485
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,373
Like, uh, breathing carbon monoxide.

486
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:09,607
Even when pure oxygen is administered,
the victim's red blood cells
are already so damaged that--

487
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:12,479
Are you saying
she wasn't kidding about this?

488
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,075
If Louise Jackson swallowed
that poison deliberately,

489
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:17,144
she was either an ignorant fool...

490
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:19,247
or a woman determined
to take her own life.

491
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:32,434
[ Magnum Narrating ]
Louise may be a little offbeat,
but she wasn't suicidal.

492
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:35,905
And death would have been
a sure bet if she'd taken the coffee
on schedule.

493
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:38,067
At the beach,
miles from nowhere.

494
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,076
Too far from any medical attention.

495
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:43,910
Someone was trying to kill her,
and she was lying to protect
whoever it was.

496
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:47,042
And there could only be
two people for whom she'd do that.

497
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:49,109
Her husband and her sister.

- You sent those guys
to beat me up.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

507
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:43,534
Now just wait one minute.
Do you think you can just admit...

508
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:46,406
you sent those goons after me
and then just walk away?

509
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:48,843
I don't believe you people.
You're just incredible.

510
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:51,108
I didn't mean
to have anything happen to you.

511
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,515
I was just trying to scare you.
I'm sorry they got carried away.

Now, if that's not
good enough for you,
we can fight.

513
00:37:57,322 --> 00:38:01,759
You're younger than I am
and stronger maybe,
so you'd probably win.

514
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:05,887
But I'm richer than you are,
so in the end I'll beat you.

515

Now, why don't you just
accept my apology?

[ Sighs, Chuckles ]

517
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,264
Did you do this
'cause of Louise's game?

518
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,070
I was afraid--

519
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:27,516
I was afraid she was
beginning to care for you.

520
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,613
And I couldn't stand that, you see.
If she left--

521
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,623
Afraid enough to kill her?

522
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:39,692
Hey, I love Louise very much.

523
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:41,789
Maybe I do hold on too tight.

524
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,200
Maybe. But I'd never hurt her.

525
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:47,294
And I'd never let anything
happen to her.

526
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,671
That's funny.
That's exactly what Christie said.

527
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,542
Christie's a wonderful girl.
If it wasn't for her,
I never would have met Louise.

528
00:38:56,614 --> 00:39:00,345
Wait a minute.
Christie introduced you to Louise?

529
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,386
Yes. Christie was my secretary.

530
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:06,389
She worked in my office
in my home.
We were very close.

531
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:11,190
Louise used to come by and pick her up,
and once in a while she'd take
one of my horses out for a ride.

532
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:13,560
She had an accident.
She told me.

533
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:17,032
You know, I never met a woman
with such spirit.

534
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,069
I was beginning to feel old.

535
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:21,799
But when she came
into my home to recover,

536
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:24,637
suddenly I had a whole new chance.

537
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:27,234
I could never even
think of her ever leaving.

Mr.Jackson,
she really does care for you.

Christie and Louise,

where are they?

Gone for a drive, I guess.

Well, where'd they go
for a drive?

543
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:47,927
Do they have any special spot?
Any favorite spot? Anything?

Well, sometimes they drive out
to the other end of the island.

I have just about had
all I can take with your version
of reality--both of you.

613
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:39,706
You're rich, you're spoiled
and you--you try and twist life
around your finger like it was gum.

614
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:42,268
And she's my sister, Tom.

615
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:45,474
And no matter what she did,
I can't forget that.

616
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:49,007
- She's my sister.
- Magnum, please.

617
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,714
Let me settle with--
with Christie.

[ Sighs ]
On one condition.

619
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:02,029
The games stop.

620
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,662
Okay, I promise.

621
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:10,206
No more games.

622
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:12,299
No more games.

623
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:21,344
It's only for a few days,
until after the photographic session.

624
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:24,216
Hey, Higgins, no problem.
No problem at all.

625
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:29,617
Well, I must say
you're being very decent
about all this, old boy.

626
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,129
Uh, Magnum--

627
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:36,496
Look, Higgins,
why should I have a problem?

628
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:40,128
jackson and Louise are going
to the mainland for two weeks
on a second honeymoon,

629
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:42,570
and they've hired me
to stay at their house.

630
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,165
It's a security check.
I'm sure you know about that.

631
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:57,547
It's a wonderful place, Higgins.
Thirty rooms.

632
00:47:57,621 --> 00:47:59,680
A staff of six.

633
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:03,591
Oh, did I tell you
about Jacksons yacht?

634
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:05,185
They hired you?

635
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:11,092
Now let's get this straight, Higgins.
I want fresh, white paint on the walls...

636
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:13,659
and the furniture cleaned
because of dirt from storage.

[ Engine Starts ]

638
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:20,903
I'll see you around, Higgins.
Give my love to Mable Dodge,
whoever she may be.

639
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:36,025
Are you Mable Dodge?

640
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:43,026
Yes, Magnum.

641
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,227
This is Mable Dodge.

642
00:48:47,037 --> 00:48:50,029
She of the magenta walls.

643
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:57,503
I love your work.
