1
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,809
(Steam whistle blowing)

2
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,450
(Explosion)

3
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,162
(Steam whistle stops)

4
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,704
(Man)
Are you number two boat?

5
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,626
Faster! (Indistinct)

6
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,348
(Indistinct shouting)

7
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,602
(Man) He was on number one
last time I saw him.

8
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,459
(Sighs, tuts)

9
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,087
(Man) Ahoy there!

10
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,346
(Whirring)

11
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,275
(Panting)

12
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,785
Lady, you don't look like somebody
that's just been shipwrecked.

13
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,830
- Man, I certainly feel like it!
- (Panting)

14
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,957
Did you see anything
of Charcoal?

15
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,293
- Who?
- Joe, the steward.

16
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,962
He helped me into the lifeboat
with my things.

17
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,756
I thought this boat
was abandoned.

18
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,134
Not by me, it wasn't.
It looked pretty good to me.

19
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,971
What part of the ship
are you from, darling?

20
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,973
Engine room. (Gasps)

21
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,976
I was off duty in the washroom.
Thanks.

22
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,520
Caught with my...

23
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,899
I was washing my hands
when the torpedo smacked us.

24
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,901
Most of the crew
were trapped like rats.

25
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,736
When they got to topside,
it was a shambles.

26
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,196
Quite a night!

27
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,157
Reminds me of an air raid once
that hit me in Chungking.

28
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,411
Reminded me of a slaughterhouse
I once worked at in Chicago.

29
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,581
Those Nazi buzzards in
tin fish ain't enough...

30
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,666
they've got to shell us too!

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,754
Ha! Now I can perfect my backhand.

32
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,756
Get that!
It might come in handy.

33
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,468
Let's have the cap too.

34
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,264
What are we worryin'
about this junk for?

35
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,308
Let's take a look for the others before
that U-boat surfaces again and sees us.

36
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,060
She won't surface.
One of our shells got her.

37
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,186
Are you sure?

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,146
She was killed dead, darling.
Went down like a rock.

39
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,191
- Did you see it?
- It's all in here, my pet.

40
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,528
You're Constance Porter.
I heard you were aboard.

41
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,739
- So you took pictures?
- And what pictures. Priceless!

42
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,200
Oh, I caught some
wonderful shots on deck.

43
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,828
A little knot of people
around one of the lifeboats.

44
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,999
They look slow and heavy and fat
with the life belts on, so lonesome.

45
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,544
Then a shell hit the lifeboat.
They all jumped overboard.

46
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,213
I got a beautiful shot of the gun crew
firing at the submarine.

47
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,424
But the best of all was in the boat,
here, with Joe.

48
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,717
I got the freighter going down,

49
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,969
one of the lifeboats caught
in the suction and pulled under.

50
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,888
I got some of the U-boat crew
jumping overboard and I also got...

51
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,599
(Gasps) Look!
That's a perfect touch!

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,315
What did you do that for?

53
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,817
Why don't you wait for the baby
to float by and photograph that?

54
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,944
(Man shouting)
Help!

55
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,154
Gangway!

56
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,824
You stupid, clumsy, son-of-a...

57
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,576
Why don't you
look where you're going?

58
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,413
Absolutely irreplaceable stuff.
Priceless. The best film I ever took!

59
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,291
- Goes to the bottom of the sea!
- That's better than going there yourself!

60
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,341
I wouldn't have parted with that film
for a million dollars!

61
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,470
When will I ever get stuff like that again?
Of all the stupid, clumsy...

62
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,181
Maybe we can arrange another shipwreck
for you sometime.

63
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,558
Sparks, did you have time
to send out an SOS?

64
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:56,021
Hardly... the first shell from the U-boat
did for the radio shack! (Panting)

65
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,732
Keep going, Kovac,
there's more people out there!

66
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,866
- Where'd this come from?
- It was floating by.

67
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,618
(Panting)

68
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,749
Miss MacKenzie!

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,552
- (Woman) Stanley!
- She's out there!

70
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,806
She's alive.
Come on, Kovac! Come on!

71
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,433
(Sparks)
There's somebody, out there.

72
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,143
To your right, Kovac!

73
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,063
(Connie) There's three of them.
(Sparks) Swing over, Kovac!

74
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,273
(Woman) Hurry,
we've got a wounded man!

75
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,858
Step on it!

76
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,200
A dame!

77
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,119
Never mind me.
Help him... he's hurt his leg!

78
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,664
- Well, hang on, Miss!
- Well, folks, we're in business again.

79
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,295
- Somebody gonna give me a hand?
- Ritt!

80
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,923
- You old rat!
- Connie! (Chuckles)

81
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,634
Did you come from the freighter
or the Stork Club?

82
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,846
- Still striking oil, I see, eh, Ritt?
- (Man) Anybody got any liquor?

83
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,515
I'll have this off you in a jiffy.

84
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,810
I'm okay, Sparks.
What happened to Nolan?

85
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,354
I was on my way from the bridge
to bring him our position.

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,399
A shell from the U-boat
hit the radio shack!

87
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,026
I was at the wheel waitin'
for Hennessy to relieve me.

88
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,863
Just set the mug up
with some hot java when...

89
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,990
Holy smokes, look at this mess.

90
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,783
Maybe we'd better
get the raft back.

91
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,076
Do you think we'll stay afloat?

92
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,371
If the buoyancy tanks are okay
she'll float, even if we're waterlogged.

93
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,999
I see you've even managed
to get some of your luggage aboard.

94
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,710
- Just the bare necessities.
- Uh, look at that!

95
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,837
Six full boxes,
and I had to grab this one.

96
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,632
Don't cry, my pet.
It'll last until we're picked up. I hope.

97
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,427
- First shell must've done for the skipper.
- And most of the gun crew.

98
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,928
What happened to the woman
with the baby?

99
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,638
See if you can
find a first-aid kit.

100
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,475
(Ritt) I thought everybody was killed.
I never expected to see you alive.

101
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,727
You know I'm practically
immortal, Ritt!

102
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,520
I... I thought I was done for.

103
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,606
See, we were playing poker
in the saloon...

104
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,774
Now, how do you get this thing off?

105
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,737
Here's the first-aid kit.
It's been pretty well smashed up.

106
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,781
Oh! I need something
to cover him up with.

107
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,034
Let me have that blanket, please.

108
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,453
Bandages, please.

109
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,080
Well, share and share alike,
I always say!

110
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,500
- Lie down, please.
- What for?

111
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,461
You'll be more comfortable.
I wanna take a look at your leg.

112
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,589
Oh, well, okay, babe. Maybe you'll
let me return the compliment someday!

113
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,258
- Lie down, please.
- I think it's got a hunk of slug in it.

114
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,093
(Ritt) Yes, sir.
It was the biggest pot of the game,

115
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,013
but believe you me,
I never even stopped to collect it.

116
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,724
- That pot went to Davy Jones.
- Well, not all of it.

117
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,560
- Here's 20 bucks Mr Jones didn't get.
- Well, it's yours.

118
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,395
- It was floating in the water.
- Well, keep it.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,899
No, go on! I insist!
It's probably legitimate as salvage.

120
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,652
- You one of the crew, son?
- Black gang. Oiler. Name's Kovac.

121
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,112
- Kovac, eh? My name's Rittenhouse.
- Glad to...

122
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,656
- Rittenhouse?
- That's right!

123
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,116
- C. J. Rittenhouse?
- C. J. Rittenhouse!

124
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,285
- Junior.
- Here.

125
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,829
Are you sure there's
no sulfanilamide left in the kit?

126
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,456
'Fraid not.

127
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,458
- Hurt?
- No.

128
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,588
Here's the shrapnel. Thought
you might like to keep it as a souvenir.

129
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,758
Nah! My hide was full of that stuff
on the last trip.

130
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,970
- Hold it steady!
- I oughta have my head examined.

131
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,993
This is the fourth
time I've shipped out

132
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:18,932
since the war, and I
ain't got no place yet!

133
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,434
Gee, I wish I could make
the complete round-trip just once.

134
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,020
- How does it look?
- It's a pretty deep cut.

135
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,355
It's leakin'.

136
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,357
I ain't gonna wind up
with a gimpy leg, am I?

137
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,068
No! Not enough to interfere
with your jitterbugging!

138
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,320
- Jive, huh?
- Eh, tell her, Sparks!

139
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,447
Why he's the champion hoofer
of the merchant marines.

140
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,991
Tell her what I done
in Jersey City.

141
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,660
Listen, I copped two prizes
at Roseland one year,

142
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,913
and all the time, I'm suffering
somethin' terrible from double pneumonia.

143
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,874
I can out-jive the rest of those hepcats
even with a bum gam.

144
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,626
Everything under control?
Anything I can do?

145
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,587
You ain't got somethin'
to drink on ya?

146
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,381
- Sorry, son! Not a drop.
- I have some brandy, darling.

147
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,091
Oh, boy! I could sure go
for some of that.

148
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,011
- I'll get my flask. - No! In a case
like this, the rule is to...

149
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,596
Come on!
We're among friends, ain't we?

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,432
- I don't think it's advisable.
- Look! Just one slug... it'll pick me up!

151
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,434
Make up your minds, darlings!

152
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,935
(Man) Help!

153
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,771
Help!

154
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,233
Help!

155
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,526
It's Charcoal!

156
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,449
(Man) It's the steward!

157
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,285
(Sparks) There's a woman.
(MacKenzie) And a baby.

158
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,745
(Grunts)

159
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,289
(Ritt) Easy there!

160
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,207
(MacKenzie)
Give me the baby!

161
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,428
Are you all right, Joe?

162
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,847
I got my feet wet
a little bit.

163
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,101
(Panting) She was fightin' me
all the time in the water.

164
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:49,064
She tried to drown the baby
and herself with it.

165
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,325
Huh, it's all right, sister.
You're safe.

166
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,411
The baby's safe.
It's all right. The danger's over.

167
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,415
You're safe now.
Nothing to worry about.

168
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,307
Best let her have it.
We'll wait till she's asleep.

169
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,436
Here!

170
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,733
Hey! That's right!

171
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,074
Her name's Higley.
She was bombed out in Bristol.

172
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,201
One of them shell shock cases
sent to America.

173
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,453
Her child was born in New York.

174
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,334
Said to me on the ship, "I'm going home
to show my husband the baby!"

175
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,254
(Connie) Here, darling.
You better put this on.

176
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,841
Hey, look. Another customer.

177
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,310
(Ritt) Where'd he come from?
(Connie) Is he a crew member?

178
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,980
(Sparks) I never saw him before.
(Joe) Not off our boat.

179
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,816
(Panting) Danke schön.

180
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,657
(Speaking German)

181
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,164
He's very grateful to us
for having saved his life.

182
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,833
Regrets very much the U-boat
was compelled to sink our ship.

183
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,668
Ask him why they shelled
our lifeboats.

184
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,670
(Speaking German)

185
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,592
- Captain's orders!
- If you ask me, he's the captain himself.

186
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,218
Ask him if he's the captain.

187
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,679
(Speaking German)

188
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,312
He says he's not a captain or officer,
just a crew member.

189
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,272
Well, crew member or skipper,
he's German!

190
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,900
A guy can't help bein' German
if he's born a German, can he?

191
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,486
Neither can a snake help being
a rattlesnake if he's born a rattlesnake!

192
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,279
That don't make him a nightingale!
Get him outta here!

193
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,866
Don't be silly, darling! He can't very well
get off in the middle of the ocean, can he?

194
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,576
- Throw him off!
- Have you gone out of your mind?

195
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,870
- Throw the Nazi buzzard overboard!
- That's out of the question!

196
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,371
- It's against the law.
- Whose law?

197
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,040
We're on our own.
We can make our own law!

198
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,168
Now, just a minute!
He was acting under orders.

199
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,087
Our freighter was an enemy ship.
After all, we're at war.

200
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,299
Is that woman at war?
Is her baby at war?

201
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,302
And listen, how come
you know the lingo so well?

202
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,763
How come when I climbed into
this lifeboat you were the only one in it,

203
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,807
all dressed up like you knew
you were going someplace?

204
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,977
I was going someplace.
I was going into a lifeboat.

205
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,480
What is this?
Are you insinuating?

206
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,565
You seem pretty anxious
to stand up for your friend here!

207
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,192
What do you mean, "my friend"?

208
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,319
Now, children,
let's keep our shirts on!

209
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,572
I haven't got a shirt
or a mink coat either!

210
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,076
Oh, I get it!

211
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,953
A fellow traveller!

212
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,080
I thought the Comintern
was dissolved!

213
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,249
Now, we're all sort of
fellow travellers,

214
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,376
in a mighty small boat,
on a mighty big ocean!

215
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,921
And the more we quarrel and criticize
and misunderstand each other,

216
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,549
the bigger the ocean gets,
and the smaller the boat.

217
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,926
The boat's too small
for me and this German!

218
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,762
Me, I'm perfectly willing to abide
by the decision of the majority.

219
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,597
That's the American way.

220
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,643
If we harm this man, we are guilty
of the same tactics you hate him for.

221
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,938
On the other hand, if we treat him
with kindness and consideration,

222
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,607
we might be able to convert him
to our way of thinking.

223
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,776
That's the, uh...
That's the Christian way.

224
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,947
Okay! Now, me, I'm American too.
I was born one in Chicago.

225
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,284
But my people are from Czechoslovakia!
Ever hear of that place?

226
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,452
I say let's throw him overboard
and watch him drown!

227
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,247
When he goes down, I'll dance a jig
like Hitler did when France went down!

228
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,249
Me, too!

229
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,294
Just for the record,
I'm an American, myself!

230
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,504
I'm in a kind of a spot.

231
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,632
My name is Schmidt,
but I changed it to Smith.

232
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,594
That's what I got against these guys
more than anything else.

233
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,179
They make me ashamed
of the name I was born with.

234
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,184
I got a lot of relatives in Germany.
For all I know this guy may be one of them!

235
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,895
I say throw him to the sharks!

236
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,356
No, Gus! I don't say
it wouldn't be a pleasure, mind you,

237
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,066
but... we haven't got the right!

238
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,068
(Gus) The right?
What do you mean the right?

239
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,780
Well, he's a prisoner of war.
Got to be treated as such.

240
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,283
The way it's done is to hang on
to him till we're picked up,

241
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,036
then turn him over
to proper authorities.

242
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,331
Till such time,
we represent the authorities.

243
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,832
That's clear, isn't it?

244
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,502
- You see what I mean, miss?
- I don't understand any of it.

245
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,632
I don't understand people hurting
each other and killing each other.

246
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,966
I just don't understand it.

247
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,179
- Then what are you doing in a uniform?
- I'm doing the only thing I can.

248
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,890
Trying to put them together again
when they get hurt.

249
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,268
As far as the German's concerned, I...
I agree with Stanley.

250
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,561
So do I.

251
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,939
I'll talk to the man. Maybe I can get
some information from him.

252
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,733
- Material for your book?
- Incidentally!

253
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,945
- George?
- What do you say, Joe?

254
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,823
- Do I get to vote too?
- Why... Why certainly!

255
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,285
Guess I'd rather
stay out of this.

256
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,663
How about you, sister?

257
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,874
My baby's dead.

258
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,153
Does anyone know
the service for burial at sea?

259
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,740
Well, I, uh... I suppose
any prayer would do.

260
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,243
Let me see, now.

261
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,579
The Lord is my shepherd.
Uh, I shall not want.

262
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,041
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

263
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,669
He, uh... He, uh...

264
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,797
(Joe) He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

265
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,426
He restoreth my soul.

266
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:57,765
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness, for His name's sake.

267
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,438
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

268
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,233
I will fear no evil.

269
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:13,114
For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

270
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:19,620
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

271
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,874
And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord.

272
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,460
Forever.

273
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,628
Amen.

274
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,099
(Kovac) Well, I don't know
how much of this stuff is any use to us.

275
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,477
Isn't much we can do
with these food compartments.

276
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,105
(Ritt) Well, at any rate,
things are getting shipshape.

277
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,441
None of the buoyancy tanks
seem to have been smashed.

278
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,942
The water breaker's been taped up,

279
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,862
and in the morning we'll rig up a sail
and get going.

280
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,157
And in the meantime, I think
we'd all better try and get some sleep.

281
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,826
Uh, Kovac, don't forget
to wake me for my watch.

282
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,412
(Kovac) We'd better send up
another flare soon.

283
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,833
How do you feel, darling?

284
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,669
Better, thank you!

285
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,339
Much better!

286
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,509
- Have I been asleep long?
- Not very.

287
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,553
What's this?

288
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,807
Mrs Porter lent you her coat
to help keep you warm.

289
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,393
It's a beautiful coat.

290
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,021
- Is it real mink?
- I hope so.

291
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,399
It's lovely.

292
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,860
I've always admired mink.

293
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:37,073
It's the most ladylike fur there is,
I always said.

294
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,537
So warm and comfortable.

295
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,666
Thank you so much
for letting me wear it.

296
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,211
Where's Johnny?

297
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,466
Where's my baby?

298
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,887
(Higley)
What have you done with him?

299
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,391
What did you do
with my baby?

300
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,602
Your baby's dead!
Don't you remember?

301
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,867
You killed him, didn't you?

302
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,998
Poor little thing!

303
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,754
The sea... so big and terrible.

304
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,927
Johnny, it's Mum!

305
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,181
Where are you?

306
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,517
Where are you, Johnny?

307
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,770
Johnny!

308
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,107
Let me go!
Let me go to him!

309
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,359
Get a rope, somebody!
We've got to tie her down!

310
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,487
Here you are.

311
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,658
Let me go to him.

312
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,453
(Whispering)
Let me go.

313
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,707
(Yawns audibly)

314
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,676
- Good morning, sir!
- Hmm? Oh!

315
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,137
Good morning, Sparks!
Asleep on watch!

316
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,182
It's a fine thing!
I oughta be court-martialed!

317
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,435
I wonder
how much we've drifted.

318
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,437
Not very far
with that sea-anchor out.

319
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,106
Oh, the sea-anchor, of course.

320
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,233
You know, I had no idea
what those things looked like.

321
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,736
I thought they were big, heavy iron things
with a hook to hold us onto the sea bottom.

322
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,862
When you threw that thing out,

323
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,074
I thought it was some sort
of a toy parachute or something.

324
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,034
They really
keep the boat from drifting?

325
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,871
Last time I was adrift, a sea anchor
held us up 48 hours in a storm.

326
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,208
- You've been torpedoed before?
- That's right, twice.

327
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,586
- How long before you were picked up?
- Last time, it was 43 days.

328
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,214
Forty-three...
That must have been awful!

329
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,758
Yeah! We did get
a bit sunburned.

330
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,760
Then, of course,
we had a good sound boat.

331
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,887
Plenty of food and water...
everything intact.

332
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,348
Well, haven't we plenty too?

333
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,434
A good deal of our food's
been ruined.

334
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,062
Three out of the four water breakers
have been smashed.

335
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,482
A lot of water leaked out of the fourth one
before it was taped.

336
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,235
What worries me is the compass.

337
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,447
Knocked to pieces.
That's a bit awkward.

338
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,868
And, of course, there's Jerry.

339
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,911
Ah, good morning, Mrs Porter.

340
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,959
(Sighs)
What's good about it?

341
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,046
- How soon do we get picked up?
- Good morning, Connie.

342
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,757
We were discussing that.
It seems there's no way of telling.

343
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,259
- Did you sleep well?
- Not a wink.

344
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,136
Not only that, I froze.

345
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,931
Only had my fur coat
to keep me... warm.

346
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,101
Where's Miss Higley?

347
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,983
(Debris clattering)

348
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,831
(Ritt) I'm sorry, folks.
I'm terribly sorry.

349
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,959
It was pitch black
when I relieved you, Kovac.

350
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,836
I couldn't see a thing.

351
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,464
For all I know, it might have happened
during your watch.

352
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,655
(Typing)

353
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,699
- (Carriage return dings)
- (Wind blowing)

354
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,004
- Eight biscuits.
- Minus eight biscuits! Oh, thanks.

355
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,465
- Kovac, how's the sail coming along?
- Coming along!

356
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,550
Light, sir?

357
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,179
Uh, no, thanks! I think I'll hoard
this heater till we get someplace.

358
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,850
Well, folks, I've been taking inventory,
and we're in the black.

359
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:00,521
A going concern. It's no use
lying around waiting to be picked up.

360
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,316
As we might have to wait
as long as, uh... as 43 days.

361
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,860
So we might as well get organized.

362
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,279
The first order of business
is department heads.

363
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,698
- Uh, Sparks?
- Yes, Mr Rittenhouse.

364
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,702
- Call me Ritt. We're all in the same boat.
- Yes, sir. Ritt.

365
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,704
Sparks, you are, uh,
in charge of navigation.

366
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,873
- Aye, aye, sir!
- Uh, George?

367
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,207
Call me Joe.

368
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,877
- Is your name Joe?
- Yes, sir.

369
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,171
Very well. Joe it is.

370
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,840
- You are head of the commissary.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,217
Connie, will you keep
the ship's log, please?

372
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:34,263
Righto, Ritto, providing I control
the copyright and all publication rights.

373
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,931
Including the Scandinavian!

374
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,100
(Chuckles)
Yes! Miss MacKenzie!

375
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,561
You are in charge of sick bay.

376
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,982
Don't look now,
but I think we have a skipper.

377
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,694
- Who elected Mr Rittenhouse?
- Mr Rittenhouse.

378
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,404
Ritt, to you!

379
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,991
- You think he's capable?
- Sure! Till the sail goes up.

380
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,910
We never should've
let him stay on board.

381
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,621
He'll eat our food, drink our water,
and double-cross us, first chance he gets.

382
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,581
What are you afraid of?
He's one against seven.

383
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,584
It was eight yesterday.
Or have you forgotten?

384
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,422
There's a piece in here about some people
who were adrift in a lifeboat for 80 days.

385
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,718
- Say, maybe we can beat that record.
- Heaven forbid!

386
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,304
We might even get in the newsreels.

387
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,097
Rosie'd get a bang outta that.

388
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,142
It'd remind her of the first cup we won
at the Garden for marathon dancing.

389
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,686
- We danced 80 consecutive hours.
- (Stanley) Consecutive?

390
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,023
Well, 10 minutes off every four hours
for coffee, cake, stuff like that.

391
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,108
How'd you feel
after 80 hours of dancing?

392
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,111
I had a slight headache,
but Rosie, she was just gettin' wound up.

393
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,280
She grabbed a cab,
went right over to Roseland!

394
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,658
- Does she work there?
- She lives there.

395
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,622
- How does the leg feel now?
- It don't feel at all.

396
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,916
I wish I could walk around.

397
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,210
I sure hope
that thing don't leave me gimpy.

398
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,087
- Al'd love that.
- Who's Al?

399
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,674
Al Magaroulian.
He's an Armenian rug-cutter.

400
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,759
He knew Rosie before I did.

401
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,177
He's got fallen arches.

402
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,346
Keeps him outta the draft,
but not outta Roseland.

403
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,308
Kovac, you know something
about machinery, don't you?

404
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,852
- A little.
- See if you can fix this clasp.

405
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,443
Mrs Porter, I've read a lot of your stuff.
You wanna know what's the matter with it?

406
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,945
No, do tell me.

407
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,031
You've been all over the world.
You've met all kinds of people.

408
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,201
But you never write about them,
you only write about yourself.

409
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,080
You think this whole war's a show put on
for you to cover, like a Broadway play.

410
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:27,918
And if enough people die before the last
act, maybe you might give it four stars.

411
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,003
Come on, Sparks.

412
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,046
- All right, tovarich! Now, listen to me!
- (Sparks) Heads up!

413
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,842
Joe, man the tiller
till we're squared away!

414
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,760
(Wind howling)

415
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,934
- Well, folks, we're under way.
- Where to?

416
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,396
- Huh?
- Where are we going?

417
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,773
First operator said
we were headed for Bermuda.

418
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,151
Well, good! Uh, Sparks,
you better take the tiller.

419
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,238
Yes, sir! Uh,
what about the course?

420
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,907
(Ritt) Does anybody here know
the course to Bermuda?

421
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,870
I was at the wheel when we got punctured.
The course was 115 east-southeast.

422
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,872
Fine, then,
east-southeast it is.

423
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,543
Yes, sir! But, uh,
where is east-southeast?

424
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,504
- Without a compass...
- What's the matter with the sun?

425
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,300
With the sun this high, it's pretty hard
to tell the points of the compass.

426
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,843
I think it's out that way.

427
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,971
- You think?
- Doesn't anybody know?

428
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,475
(Speaking German)

429
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,226
(Speaks German)

430
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,732
- He says east-southeast is that direction.
- (Kovac) How's he know?

431
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,902
Well, he ought to know. His U-boat
was operating around here, wasn't it?

432
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,071
Do you suppose he'd lead us
to Bermuda, British territory?

433
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,155
(Speaking German)

434
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,283
(Speaking German)

435
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,249
He says he'd rather be a prisoner of war
in Bermuda than here.

436
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,834
At least he'd have
good food and a bed.

437
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,670
I wouldn't trust anything he says.

438
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,588
Kovac, you're so prejudiced
you can't think straight.

439
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,256
If anybody's in the position to know

440
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,717
where we are and where Bermuda is,
he's the one.

441
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,345
- Who says so?
- We'll follow the German's course.

442
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,763
Who elected you skipper?

443
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:09,103
Well, I... 'Course,
if there's anybody else you'd prefer...

444
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,479
What do you
know about a ship?

445
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,816
He just happens to own
a shipyard, that's all.

446
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,443
- (Kovac) Has he ever been in it?
- He has thousands of employees.

447
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,986
Of course he knows
how to handle men.

448
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,614
Not in a lifeboat. What we need
is an able seaman, and we've got one.

449
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,118
Who, me?
I'm a disabled seaman.

450
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,912
Anyhow, I never did have
no executive ability.

451
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:30,165
- I think maybe Sparks there...
- No, not me.

452
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:35,254
I know a bit about navigation, but when it
comes to taking charge of a boat, well...

453
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,340
- What about Kovac?
- That clunk run this boat?

454
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,759
With what? An oil can?

455
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,680
If you're talking about a skipper,
we have a skipper right on this boat.

456
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,058
- He wasn't the captain.
- Wasn't he?

457
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,810
- Herr Kapitän?
- Ja?

458
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,147
Well, I'm a monkey's uncle.

459
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,441
There! You have a man
who's familiar with these waters.

460
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,026
He knows seamanship and navigation.
What about it?

461
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,319
You want to turn the boat over

462
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,238
to the man who sunk our ship
and shelled our lifeboats?

463
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:05,325
I want you to turn the boat over to the man
obviously best qualified to run it.

464
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,327
- You're crazy.
- (Ritt) Now, wait a minute.

465
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,206
There are two sides to everything.
Let's look at this calmly and reasonably.

466
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,417
The German is just as anxious
to get to safety as we are,

467
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,044
and if he's a trained skipper,
why shouldn't he take charge?

468
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,756
- Because I'm taking charge.
- Since when?

469
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,509
As of now, I'm skipper. Anybody who don't
like it can get out and swim to Bermuda.

470
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,429
- I'll buy it.
- Suits me.

471
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,973
- What about you, miss?
- I'm for it.

472
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,434
- Yes, sir!
- Well, if the rest agree...

473
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,728
All right, Commissar,
what's the course?

474
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,774
Well, we...

475
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,654
- Which way'd you say, Sparks?
- Out there.

476
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,324
Nein, nein.
(Speaking German)

477
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,207
He says if you go your way,
you'll only head further out to sea.

478
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,209
He insists the course
to Bermuda is that way.

479
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,753
We'll head this way.
Take the tiller, Sparks!

480
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,046
Aye, aye, sir!

481
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,923
Careful!

482
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,013
(Splashes)

483
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,183
Including the Scandinavian.

484
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,482
(# Flute)

485
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,568
- How do you feel now, Connie?
- Awful!

486
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,946
It isn't the sea that makes me sick,
it's the loss of my typewriter.

487
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,574
That typewriter went with me everywhere...
Rome, Berlin, Paris, London.

488
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,910
- Oh, quit grousing.
- Why shouldn't I grouse?

489
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,830
Little by little, I'm being stripped
of all my earthly possessions.

490
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,125
First, my beautiful stocking,
then my camera.

491
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,962
I don't mind the loss of the camera
so much, but the film in it.

492
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,047
I get positively ill
when I think about it.

493
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,883
(Ritt) Hey, do you remember
the boom we had after the last war?

494
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,865
Well, the boom we're
gonna have after this

495
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,762
one'll make the last
look like a mild flurry.

496
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,931
Then my steamer rug goes,

497
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,767
then my fur coat,
and now my typewriter!

498
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,394
(Ritt continues)
Take China, for example.

499
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,272
400 million customers
waiting to sign on the dotted line

500
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,815
as soon as peace is declared.

501
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,192
(Connie) I never should've taken
the freighter, should've gone by clipper.

502
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,195
Me, too! I'd have been
in Spain by this time.

503
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,990
Spain? Were you going
for the state department?

504
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,951
State department? Certainly not!
I was going for C. J. Rittenhouse.

505
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,787
- What for?
- What for? Why, my dear fellow!

506
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,456
Pipe down, Ritt!
The "Gay-Pay-oo"!

507
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,709
What are you doing
with my memo pad?

508
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,044
I borrowed it from you
to make a deck of cards.

509
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,046
Never heard such impertinence,
opening my bag!

510
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,716
It was open.
How about a little draw poker?

511
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,510
- Eh, suits me fine.
- Deal you in?

512
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,137
With a deck
you've made, darling?

513
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,638
(Ritt) What are you
gonna play for?

514
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,099
(Kovac) Dollar limit?
(Ritt) That'll do for a starter.

515
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,893
- Cut for deal!
- All right!

516
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,730
You deal!

517
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,906
What are those letters
on your diaphragm?

518
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,575
- Love letters.
- Oh, you believe in advertising?

519
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,201
Open!

520
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:57,372
Never could understand this quaint habit
of making a billboard out of one's torso.

521
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,666
- Stay!
- Three cards!

522
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,085
I must say you've shown
the most commendable delicacy

523
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,921
in just tattooing the initial,

524
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,131
not printing the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers.

525
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,841
Open!

526
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,845
- Nines?
- Queens!

527
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,681
See, how many are there?
One, two, three, four, five.

528
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,642
Remind me to show you
the rest of them sometime.

529
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,352
Your deal, my boy.

530
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,228
And see you deal them
off the top.

531
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,481
You mean, you're used to
people dealing off the bottom?

532
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,107
I was just joking.

533
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,487
I never thought I'd go into it.
I used to faint at the sight of blood.

534
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,864
What made you join
the merchant marine?

535
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,367
I don't know.
Never thought about it.

536
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,495
I suppose it was
'cause I lived in Greenwich.

537
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,872
Maybe it was the river there,
and the ships.

538
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,749
It's the first time
I've ever been to sea.

539
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,043
I was born and raised
in the wheat country.

540
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,545
You know, sometimes when the
wind blows through the wheat,

541
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,631
it looks something like the sea.

542
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:52,970
Well, it's not a bad life, the merchant
marine, except for the U-boats.

543
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,389
After a while, you get
to taking even them in your stride.

544
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,433
It's rather scary the first time,
though, isn't it?

545
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,103
I'm glad the freighter
was torpedoed.

546
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,775
My dear young lady,
what an extraordinary thing to say!

547
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,902
What are you doing that for?

548
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,946
It's the bandage, Lu,
it's too tight or something.

549
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,990
Oh, wait! Let me!

550
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,244
Holy mackerel!

551
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,496
Ain't it a lulu?

552
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,081
What about it, Miss?

553
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't know! I'm afraid it...

554
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,043
(Gus) Looks more like
a leg of lamb, don't it?

555
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,545
(Man speaking German)

556
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,923
Get away from here!

557
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,093
Tell him to get back to his place
before I throw him overboard!

558
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,387
(Speaking German)

559
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,932
- What did he say?
- (Both speaking German)

560
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,940
(Both continue)

561
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,118
Gus, I'm afraid
your leg's very bad.

562
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,624
- Gangrene?
- (German) Ja, Gangrene.

563
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,460
It'll have to be
amputated at once!

564
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,718
I've never even assisted
in an amputation.

565
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,387
(Speaks German)

566
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,939
He says, being an enemy and,
technically, our prisoner,

567
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,484
perhaps you wouldn't want
to trust him with the operation,

568
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,777
but he's willing to do it.

569
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,361
What the devil
does he know about it?

570
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,740
He says he was a surgeon in civilian life.
He's done many operations.

571
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,366
If he did, they were probably illegal.

572
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,202
If he's a medical man,
why isn't he in medical service?

573
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,162
I don't know and I don't care!

574
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,540
Perhaps the gangrene isn't legal, either,
but it's there!

575
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,959
The leg has to come off.

576
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,923
No dice!
I don't want no operation!

577
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,927
- Darling, you want to live, don't you?
- Not with one leg.

578
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,929
- Don't be a sap, Gus!
- You don't understand.

579
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,765
- Sure, I do! Rosie!
- What's Rosie got to do with it?

580
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,738
Everything!
If I lose my leg, I lose Rosie.

581
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,227
Of course, I don't know Rosie.

582
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,313
She loves to dance. It's her hobby.
It's her whole life.

583
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,357
Put yourself in her place.
Do you like to dance?

584
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,566
Mad about it!

585
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,236
Well, then, what good's a hepcat
with one gam missin'?

586
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,613
- If my leg goes, Rosie goes!
- If she's that kind of a...

587
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,406
Don't you call Rosie that kind of a...

588
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,367
I oughta know...
I introduced you to her, didn't I?

589
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,619
No, you didn't! Al Magaroulian
introduced me to her.

590
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,580
- I knew her before Al Magaroulian did.
- Al Magaroulian...

591
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,209
The heck with Al Magaroulian!
What's he got to do with it?

592
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,628
- Rosie's as good as anybody.
- And a darn sight better.

593
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,047
- If she was the right kind of a woman...
- Kovac, you take that back!

594
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:39,344
Darling, don't pay any attention
to this human 24-sheet! Listen to me!

595
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,722
I don't know Rosie, but I know women.

596
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,808
Some of my best friends are women.

597
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,185
- And one of 'em's that kind of a...
- What kind of a...?

598
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,772
Well, an independent creature
who lives her own life!

599
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,940
(Gus) That's Rosie all over.

600
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,526
With a heart of gold.
And she gives it away.

601
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,404
Rosie'd give the shirt off her back
to anybody.

602
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,447
She's got a heart
as big as her head.

603
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,867
(Connie) And you wanna break it.

604
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,953
- Who, me?
- Well, you'd rather die than trust her!

605
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,748
Who says I don't trust her?
It's Al Magaroulian I don't trust!

606
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,587
He knew her before I did.

607
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,799
She swore to me there was
nothing between them, but...

608
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,718
Maybe there wasn't.

609
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,428
But Rosie's human
like everybody else,

610
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,097
and it ain't like we was married,
or had a home and all.

611
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,268
Maybe we shoulda got hitched
before I left on that last trip.

612
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,189
I shoulda took care
of that insurance.

613
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,524
Rosie kept askin' me about it.

614
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,693
The kid's always thinkin' of me.

615
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,197
That's why you've got
to think of her,

616
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,157
back home,
putting on a big show,

617
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,952
laughing and dancing,
pretending to be having a good time.

618
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,288
And all the while,
her heart's aching,

619
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,624
torn with loneliness
and uncertainty.

620
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,459
Not knowing whether
you're dead or alive.

621
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,046
Then, at last, to find out
that you risked your life,

622
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,799
perhaps even died,
just because you had no faith in her?

623
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,971
God, forgive me!

624
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,020
Poor kid, she'd be
broken-hearted when she...

625
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,360
Well, let's go!
What are we all waitin' for?

626
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,363
- (Speaking German)
- (Inaudible)

627
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,284
(Connie)
He'll need a pail of water, Joe.

628
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,662
(Speaking German)

629
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,665
- Is there any sort of anaesthetic?
- Nothing!

630
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,042
- Nein.
- You have some brandy, haven't you?

631
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,461
(Speaking German)

632
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,422
- He says brandy's better than nothing.
- Did I hear brandy?

633
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,716
- Let me get it for you.
- Oh, thanks, Joe!

634
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,346
Can you open it for me?

635
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,348
That's right, it's just here.

636
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,602
- Here, darling.
- Hi-yo, Silver.

637
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,854
(Speaking German)

638
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,023
He'll need a tourniquet,
a belt or something.

639
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,192
I'll lose my pants if I take mine off.

640
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,027
- How 'bout your belt, Sparks?
- Here it is.

641
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,531
- (Kovac) Get it, Joe.
- It was nice knowin' ya.

642
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,783
(Speaking German)

643
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,746
Um, oh, Joe! He wants a needle and twine
from the, uh, boat kit or something.

644
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,206
It's in a ditty bag, Joe.

645
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,458
Aah!

646
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,753
Am I gonna feel good
pretty soon.

647
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,842
Kovac, why'd you want
to say that about Rosie?

648
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,052
- Say what?
- What you said.

649
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,763
- I'm sorry, Gus.
- Take it back!

650
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,181
Okay, I take it back.

651
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,727
(Connie) What can we use for forceps?
(MacKenzie) You have tweezers?

652
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,937
I've got tweezers.
Yes, Joe, you'll find them in my bag.

653
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,565
- The little box on the top.
- (Joe) Right.

654
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,986
Ask him how much
of that stuff he can drink.

655
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,196
(Speaking German)

656
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,784
Go ahead, Gus! The works!
Down the hatch!

657
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,371
I'll never forget you.

658
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,423
(Man speaking German)

659
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,551
(Connie speaks German)

660
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,681
(Kovac) Joe, clear away
some of that stuff.

661
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,687
We'll lay him out here. We'll need
something for weights to hold it down.

662
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,108
(Slurring) Kovac...
You know what I think

663
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,945
of that no-good, snake-in-the-grass
friend of yours, Al Magaroulian?

664
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,531
Magaroulian's no friend of mine.

665
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,618
(Slurring)
Magaroulian's a skunk.

666
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,164
Two-legged skunk.

667
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,459
- I hate his guts.
- (Slurring) You're okay, pal.

668
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,133
Hi, Lu!

669
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,011
Hiya, Gus!

670
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,647
Well, anyway, it's an experience!

671
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,818
(Gus) I oughta have
my head examined.

672
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,070
(Slurring)
I didn't have to go to sea.

673
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,659
I coulda got a job in a defence plant
making good dough.

674
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,787
I coulda joined the army,
or even the navy.

675
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,834
'Stead of that, I got assigned
on a stinking ol' rust bucket.

676
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,216
Mr Rittenhouse?

677
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,678
Yes, son?

678
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,186
Call me Gus!

679
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,528
Hiya, babe!

680
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,030
- Hi, toots!
- Give us a kiss, will ya?

681
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,843
Hey, Joe.
What'd ya stop playin' for?

682
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,137
Come on! Give us a little music!

683
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,356
No, no! None of that slicker music!

684
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,775
Come on! Come on!
Boogie it up! Boogie it up!

685
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,822
(#Slurred singing)

686
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,452
(Speaking German)

687
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,245
Tell him to hold the boat
as steady as possible.

688
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,372
- Steady as you go, Sparks!
- Righto!

689
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:47,045
- (#Slurred singing continues)
- (Flute Stops)

690
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,429
(Slurred singing ends)

691
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,936
Saying a thing like that!

692
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,064
Just because she likes to dance
and have a good time.

693
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,610
Nobody's gonna call Rosie...

694
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,701
Hey, Kovac!
You're a no-good heel.

695
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,332
(Speaks German)

696
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,251
Take his backrest away.

697
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,462
- All right! Look alive now, Sparks!
- Righto!

698
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,408
Bring more bandages!

699
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,713
(Wind Howling)

700
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,358
Joe!

701
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,291
Mr Kovac!

702
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,348
Keep her steady, you fool!

703
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,740
(Kovac) Open.

704
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,909
- Stay.
- Three cards.

705
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,079
(Kovac) Bet one.

706
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,581
(Ritt) Call. Nines.

707
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,583
(Kovac) Queens.

708
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,585
(Ritt) Give 'em a good shuffle.
(Kovac) Okay, cut 'em.

709
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,880
(Ritt) Fill another inside straight,
I'll cut your throat!

710
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,465
It's lucky for Gus
we had somebody aboard

711
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,550
who knew how to meet
an emergency like this.

712
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,219
(Connie)
Two more cards, darling.

713
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,596
You know, by golly,
the thing that got me...

714
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,391
(Speaking German)

715
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,399
Play cards, Ritt!

716
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,859
(Speaking German)

717
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,618
- Say, what are you two gabbing about?
- Currents.

718
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,413
Not the pie kind,
darling, the ocean kind.

719
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,165
Fascinating subject, currents.
They're either for you or agin you.

720
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,459
Connie, darling, do you stay
or do you pass?

721
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,002
Ritt, darling, I've already stayed.

722
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,630
- Yeah, well, it'll cost you
two bucks more. - Oh!

723
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,633
- (Speaking German)
- Connie!

724
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,885
Hold your horses, darling!
I'm in a conference.

725
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,723
- Women and poker!
- I'll stay.

726
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,601
Fortunately, Kapitän seems to think
we're on a favouring current, quite swift.

727
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,520
We got a favouring breeze, too.

728
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,148
Good! Then we ought to be
in Bermuda in no time.

729
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,941
I hope so, for Gus's sake.

730
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,693
That is, if we're
on the right course.

731
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,320
- Well, does he still think we're not?
- He didn't say anything about it.

732
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,655
Well, ask him!

733
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,407
(Speaks German)

734
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,285
(Speaks German)

735
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,495
One can't be sure
without a compass.

736
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,790
- He was pretty certain a few hours ago.
- Yeah!

737
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,542
I wonder what
made him change his mind.

738
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,836
(Speaking German)

739
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,341
We probably drifted somewhat
on account of the current.

740
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,636
We've been through all that. What's
he doing in this part of the boat, anyway?

741
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,888
Why? Is he in quarantine?

742
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,557
- Tell him to get back to the bow.
- I'll do nothing of the sort.

743
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,894
You may be skipper of this lifeboat,
but you're not dictator! Or are you?

744
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,522
Wait a minute, Kovac! There's no sense
treating the man like a leper.

745
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,191
He did save Gus's life, you know.

746
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,027
For the time being. After all,
it was an emergency operation.

747
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,363
Don't you realize that it's imperative we
get Gus to a hospital as soon as possible?

748
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,490
Sure, I do.

749
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,992
Then, why not listen to somebody
who knows?

750
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,994
(Speaks German)

751
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,256
How do you like that? Now he isn't sure!
Says he won't take responsibility!

752
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,510
But that's not the point!
The point is, are we headed for Bermuda?

753
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,304
What's come over the man?
All you got to do is answer yes or no.

754
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,224
(Speaks German)

755
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,403
He admits
we're on the wrong course.

756
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,280
Admits? He's only saying
what he said before.

757
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,866
- I had to drag it out of him. He says...
- I don't care what he says!

758
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,744
- Yeah, but suppose he's right!
- That's my funeral.

759
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,080
No, it's not...
it's Gus's funeral!

760
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,416
Whose funeral?

761
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,127
Hey, wait a minute!
What is this?

762
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,880
(Ritt) Well, fella,
how do you feel now, huh?

763
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,257
(Sighs)

764
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,593
In the pink.

765
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,428
Outside of a little hangover.

766
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,059
Right now I'd give the other leg
for a cigarette.

767
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,778
Here, darling.

768
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,365
(Flicking lighter)

769
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,955
Guess maybe I lost
a little weight, huh?

770
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,208
You'll be all right, Gus.
He did a swell job.

771
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,918
Danke schön.

772
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,466
Well, skipper, how soon
do we get to Bermuda?

773
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,638
Pretty soon, Gus. We've got
a good breeze and a favouring current.

774
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:18,311
There's a little difference of opinion
about the direction we're headed.

775
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,688
Trouble is, I'm not sure
about our course.

776
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,650
I'm only sure of one thing...
I don't trust that Nazi.

777
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,777
There must be other submarines around
and he knows where they are,

778
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,154
or maybe a supply ship!

779
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,281
He knows where that is too.

780
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,743
On general principle, I'd copper anything
he says. That's how I stand.

781
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,620
You agree with me, Sparks?

782
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,832
Well...

783
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,501
Does anybody agree with me?

784
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,717
You're the skipper!

785
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,724
All right, Sparks.

786
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,559
Follow the German's course.

787
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,343
I, uh, was admiring your bracelet.

788
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,845
- Gift from a husband.
- It's gorgeous.

789
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,306
My first husband.

790
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,517
Glad the freighter
was torpedoed.

791
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,645
- What?
- That's what you said yesterday.

792
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,065
That was a stupid thing to say!
I didn't mean it, exactly.

793
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,484
What did you mean, exactly?

794
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,530
I only meant
I was rather glad that we...

795
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,824
Well, I wasn't particularly
anxious to get to London.

796
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,034
What are you afraid of
in London?

797
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,869
Myself.

798
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,373
I mean, uh, it's a personal problem.
In other words, I...

799
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,042
I know, darling! I know!

800
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,795
Genus Homo. Male.

801
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,424
And married, but not to me.

802
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,260
- You call that a problem?
- It is to me.

803
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,804
Fiddlesticks!

804
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,432
I don't want to pry into
your personal affairs, darling,

805
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,350
but you know
what's the matter with you?

806
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:26,313
You've been reading Kipling.
"The sins ye do by two and two,

807
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,234
"you must pay for one by one!"

808
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,903
'Course I don't know
who the guy is.

809
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:37,783
But I know men...
especially married men!

810
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,997
Some of my best friends...
(Yawning)

811
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,690
Don't let her upset you.

812
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,109
She certainly has a way
of getting at things.

813
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,194
That's right.

814
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,781
I didn't mind her prying, really.
I wanted to talk.

815
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,618
Maybe that's why I'm all mixed up,
because I've never told anybody.

816
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,040
I think I'd rather tell you
than anybody.

817
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,252
His name is Stephen.

818
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,880
He's a doctor.

819
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,424
We worked in the same hospital.

820
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,135
All the time,
I knew he was married.

821
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:42,056
His wife's a fine woman,
and they have two beautiful children.

822
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,228
So, you see, it was hopeless.
It was quite hopeless.

823
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,773
Yes, of course! I... I see!

824
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,276
Well, we both decided
to forget about it.

825
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:58,697
And when he enlisted
and was sent to London, I was glad.

826
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,450
I was really glad.

827
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,787
I tried to forget him,
but I couldn't.

828
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,542
He wrote several times.
I never answered.

829
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,212
And then when I was assigned
to London myself...

830
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,134
Well, I knew if we met there
away from home, away from every...

831
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,178
I'm sorry.

832
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,389
Maybe I better wait till I get home

833
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,350
and take it up with Mr Whosits
on the Goodwill Hour.

834
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,603
Sometimes that programme's funny.

835
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,524
Sometimes it isn't a bit.

836
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,237
When people are in trouble,
they turn themselves inside-out.

837
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,949
Seem to feel better when they
get some sort of an answer.

838
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,078
Whether they get an answer
or not, they feel better.

839
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,415
Thank you, Stanley.

840
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,714
Lovely night we're having.
Lots of stars out tonight.

841
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,182
I remember the night before we was
torpedoed. Nolan was... He was my first.

842
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,101
- Yes, I met him on the boat.
- That's right. Yes.

843
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:13,105
He was telling me all about his wife
going to stay with her family in Bermuda.

844
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,940
And how it's changed
since the war.

845
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,401
He told me that...

846
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,447
I remember as he pointed out
our course over the bows,

847
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,742
I saw the planet Mars
low on the horizon.

848
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,827
That's Mars over there,
to the right.

849
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,207
And that's Venus.

850
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,629
We're headed for Venus.
We're going East.

851
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:43,302
We're not heading for Bermuda.
We're heading to miss Bermuda.

852
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,141
Well, we'll see about that.

853
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,650
(Sparks muttering)

854
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:04,073
(Ritt) After all,
we did have to drag it out of...

855
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,450
(Kovac) That's part of the trick.
He made suckers out of all of us.

856
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,912
Kovac, I still say we have no right
to condemn the man without a hearing.

857
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,790
Perhaps the course he gave us was
wrong, but that doesn't prove anything.

858
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,041
He might have been mistaken.

859
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,211
When I questioned him yesterday,
he didn't want to commit himself.

860
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,046
He said one couldn't be sure
without a compass.

861
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,673
The thing to do is to wake him up
and question him.

862
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,051
(Kovac) We'll get nothing but lies.
That's what he was brought up on.

863
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,554
And I was brought up under the idea that
a man is innocent until he's proved guilty.

864
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,473
What do you want me to do?
Appoint one of us to be his lawyer?

865
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,684
But don't you see,
without a compass...

866
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,645
Mrs Porter, remember
yesterday you looked at your watch

867
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,313
and told the German the time?

868
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,649
- Yes!
- Did he ask you the time?

869
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,942
Of course he did.

870
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,361
- That's funny.
- What's funny about it?

871
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,530
- He had a watch of his own.
- Well, what of it?

872
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,741
If he had a watch, why would he
have to ask Mrs Porter for the time?

873
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,159
That doesn't prove anything.

874
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,538
Lots of times I have my own watch
in my pocket and I ask somebody the time.

875
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,083
Lots of people do that! It just, uh...
It just saves time, that's all.

876
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,086
But he looked at his own watch
just before he asked Mrs Porter.

877
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,505
Perhaps his own watch stopped.

878
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,717
I remember when he asked for the time,
he took a squint at the sun.

879
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,052
What are you trying to do, convict a man
because he looks at the sun?

880
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,888
- Is it a crime to ask for the time?
- (Kovac) Certainly not.

881
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,600
- What time is it?
- Ten past 7:00.

882
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,687
- I think you're slow.
- Slow? That's a Philippe Patek.

883
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,689
I wanna know what time it is
by the German's watch.

884
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,482
Well, why don't you
wake him up and ask him?

885
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,152
Don't have to wake him up.
Not with Joe around.

886
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,695
- Joe.
- Yeah?

887
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,447
- Operate.
- Huh?

888
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,073
(Kovac) Do your stuff.

889
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,950
What stuff?
I don't know what you mean.

890
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,910
Frisk him for his turnip.

891
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,497
- I cut that stuff out a long time ago.
- But this is an emergency.

892
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,833
- The folks'll understand.
- Understand what?

893
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,418
Joe used to be one of the best
all-around...

894
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,295
Now, wait a minute, Gus!

895
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,130
You ain't got no right
bringin' up what used to be.

896
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,758
That's all right, Joe.
Some of my best friends are...

897
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,345
I know, but I made
a pledge, a solemn pledge.

898
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,846
Do you wanna commit mutiny?

899
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,641
- Is it an order?
- It's an order.

900
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,645
Oh, I can't.
The guy's asleep.

901
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,980
That's a break, isn't it?

902
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,608
Yeah, but it's like...
It's like shootin' a sittin' duck!

you, wake him up! Only, get the ticker!

- (Stanley) Kovac!

905
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,955
Looks like quite a blow.

906
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,044
Pardon me!
I'm... sorry!

907
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,144
Now, you know the right time.

908
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,146
Dirty double-crossing rat!

909
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,232
Kovac, what are you gonna do?

910
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,401
- What do you think we're gonna do?
- Don't say "we"!

911
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,487
- I'll not consent to a thing like this.
- I'm not consulting you.

912
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,094
There's only one thing
to do with the guy.

913
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:52,866
But, Kovac, it's...
it's murder!

914
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,243
It's execution!

915
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,829
- No, we can't! We mustn't!
- (Sparks) There must be some other way.

916
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,498
Why can't we tie him up,
keep a watch on him?

917
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,625
Let him have it, Kovac!
Right now!

918
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,252
I'm not defending the man.

919
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,295
But why can't we wait till it's night?
Then, in the morning...

920
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,923
What are you so squeamish about?
We're at war!

921
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,675
You've seen 'em killed,
haven't you?

922
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,469
In battle, yes!
But not in cold blood like this!

923
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,346
- Look out!
- (Alice) Stanley!

924
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:06,315
You fools! Stop thinking of yourselves!
Think of the boat!

925
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,275
Joe, take the sheet!
Make it fast!

926
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,402
Kovac, man the pump!

927
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,237
The rest of you bail!

928
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,246
What do you know?
We got a führer!

929
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,250
Never mind about that baggage!
Start bailing!

930
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,587
- You speak English!
- Of course I speak English!

931
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,092
- Can we stay afloat?
- Those buoyancy tanks'll hold us up.

932
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,721
Oh! My suitcase!

933
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,556
(Ritt) Get that, somebody!

934
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,267
Rittenhouse!
Lash down that food!

935
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,862
There go our rations.

936
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,073
There goes our water supply.

937
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,163

938
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,255
We might as well go down

You're a born accompanist.

945

You didn't make
a single mistake, hardly.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

We're all born accompanists.

01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,555
"How'd I do, Willi?"

951
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,560
What are you laughing at,
you silly goon?

952
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,064
That's one for the book...
your book.

953
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,901
Only, when you write it,
they won't believe it.

954
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,528
Our enemy...
our prisoner of war.

955
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:02,074
Now, we're his prisoners,
and he's gauleiter of the boat,

956
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,244
singin' German lullabies to us
while he rows us to his supply ship

957
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,163
and a concentration camp.

958
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,041
Tell 'em, Willi!
Tell 'em how funny it is.

959
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,419
That isn't funny.
It's logical.

960
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,507
Now that we've been blown off our course,
it would take us weeks to get to Bermuda.

961
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,093
Certainly. It's perfectly logical.
The supply ship was our only chance.

962
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:25,389
You know how I feel about that.
I'd rather take my chances with the sharks.

963
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,807
But he'll never make it.

964
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,434
Without food and water, how long do
you think he can keep on rowing like this?

965
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,771
Long enough, Mr Kovac,
to reach my objective.

966
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,023
Are you sure, Willi?

967
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,192
Maybe one of us should had better
try to relieve him at the oars.

968
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,027
That's not necessary.

969
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,322
- Maybe I can take over for a while.
- Never mind, I'll row.

970
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,784
How can you keep on rowing,
Willi, hour after hour?

971
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,786
The rest of us
can hardly lift an oar.

972
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,373
It's the master race...
the Herrenvolk!

973
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:55,419
- Didn't you know they can do anything?
- I'm beginning to believe it.

974
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,671
Right living is what does it.

975
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,466
Or, as the French say,
"Qui tôt se couche bien se porte."

976
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,512
Sacre bleu!
You speak French, also!

977
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,139
Yes, I spent some time in Paris.

978
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,641
Oh, yes.

979
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,145
Tell me, Willi. Why didn't you speak
English when you first got on the boat?

980
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:17,274
Well, you see, I didn't know then
whether I could trust you or not.

981
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,112
Wie geht's, Herr Schmidt?

982
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,488
Name is Smith!

983
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,659
All right, Mr Smith.
How do you feel today?

984
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,496
Same as yesterday... thirsty!

985
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:35,792
Well, steward, anything
from the commissary yet?

986
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,630
- Not even a nibble.
- Well, keep on trying.

987
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,718
If you catch some fish,
you'll not only have food, but drink.

988
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,596
When you chew raw fish,
there's always a little fresh water.

989
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,639
Water.

990
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,852
There's that cloud.

991
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,731
What a day
for a ball game.

992
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,900
St. Louis's the team
to watch this year.

993
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,068
If we only had some bait.

994
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,029
- St. Louis's got hitters.
- (Stanley) It's been there all day.

995
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,323
Stan Musial's been
cloutin' 'em out.

996
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,034
How about Ty Cobb?
He's pretty good too.

997
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,870
- Got some A-1 pitchers.
- Yeah.

998
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,165
If the Dodgers only had a guy like Ernie
Bonham, or even Johnnie Humphries.

999
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,708
Pittsburgh's the team to watch.

1000
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,753
Only 17 points below St. Louis.

1001
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,715
If we beat the Pirates
and St. Louis loses to Boston...

1002
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,509
- Hey, Kovac.
- Yeah?

1003
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,553
Who do you think'll
pitch for Pittsburgh today?

1004
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,016
I don't know! I haven't been
following the games much this season.

1005
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:37,062
Probably Wyatt for the Dodgers,
Sewell for the Pirates.

1006
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,856
Yeah. Probably Sewell, Gus.

1007
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,903
- I think I'll take Rosie.
- Where to, Gus?

1008
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,863
Ebbets Field.

1009
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,199
It's gonna be a good game
this afternoon.

1010
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,077
(Whispering) Ritt!

1011
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,454
He's off the beam again.

1012
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,794
Well, Willi, how about
another song, eh?

1013
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,089
Certainly, my friend.
What would you like to hear?

1014
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,633

1030
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,840
I can't sing anymore.
Makes me dry.

1031

Doesn't it look to you
as if those clouds are darkening up?

1032
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,512
At the centre, a bit.

1033
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,140
Those really are
rain clouds this time.

1034
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,393
- I hope so. For Gus's sake.

1035

Why don't you give me
a break, Lu?

1036
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,029
The salt'll only
make you thirstier.

1037
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,406
You might just as well
sip poison.

1038
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,882
"B.M." Her initials are larger
than the others.

1039
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:15,720
Was she the last...
or the first?

1040
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:19,265
What was her name?
(Soft chuckle)

1041
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,393
So you won't talk, huh?

1042
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,395
Where'd you get the handcuff,
Mrs Porter?

1043
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,146
You may call me Connie.

1044
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,692
You did once during the storm,
remember?

1045
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,986
You said, uh...

1046
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,447
"We might as well go down together,
eh, Connie?"

1047
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,324
I liked the way you said Connie.

1048
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,660
It was like a sock in the jaw.

1049
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,453
Tell me about the bracelet.

1050
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,164
That was a dead giveaway,
you know, darling,

1051
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,126
wanting us to die together like that.

1052
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,588
Dying together is even more personal
than living together.

1053
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,426
- What'd you pay for the bracelet?
- Nothing.

1054
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,969
Barter?

1055
01:06:56,095 --> 01:07:00,682
(Chuckles) You're a low person, darling,
obviously out of the gutter.

1056
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,853
Maybe that's why
I'm attracted to you.

1057
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,648
- Maybe that's why you're attracted to me.
- Quit slumming.

1058
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,609
Funny part of it is,
I'm from the same gutter.

1059
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,573
Remember when you first got on the boat,
you said you used to work in the, uh...

1060
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:19,075
the packing house
section in Chicago?

1061
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,661
Well, I came from there too.

1062
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,122
South Side?

1063
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:27,125
Ashland Avenue...
back of the yards.

1064
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,628
And I lived there until I got this.

1065
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,631
It worked miracles for me.

1066
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:38,053
It took me from the, uh...
South Side to the North Side.

1067
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,931
It was my passport...

1068
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,310
from the stockyards
to the Gold Coast.

1069
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:51,316
It got me everything I wanted...
up to now.

1070
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,878
Quit slumming!

1071
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:17,383
- How about a few hands, Ritt?
- Huh? Suits me fine.

1072
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:29,020
- Do this up for me.
- Connie, I'll fix it for you.

1073
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:30,522
Come on, Ritt.

1074
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,526
(Ritt) Kovac, how much do I owe you?
(Kovac) Twelve thousand bucks.

1075
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,028
(Ritt) Merely temporary, my friend.
I'll get it back.

1076
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,948
- (Kovac) Deal 'em.
- Looks like bits of ice.

1077
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,699
I wish they were.

1078
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,786
They're really nothing
but a few pieces of carbon,

1079
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,288
crystallized under high pressure
at great heat.

1080
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,374
Quite so, if you want
to be scientific about it.

1081
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,459
I'm a great believer
in science.

1082
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,044
Like tears, for instance.

1083
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:57,090
They're nothing but H2O
with a trace of sodium chloride.

1084
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,969
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet.
You will have to get rid of it.

1085
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,595
- The bracelet?
- Mm-hmm.

1086
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:05,765
I've worn it for 15 years.
It's brought me nothing but good luck.

1087
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,225
He hates it.

1088
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,978
I wouldn't take it off
for anything or anybody in the world.

1089
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,397
(Ritt) In the old days, there was a place
in Boston, Young's Hotel,

1090
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,732
had the best restaurant
in the world.

1091
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,318
(Kovac) Bet it wasn't any better than
Henrici's Coffee House in Chicago.

1092
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,404
Or Bookbinder's in Philly...
that was food for you.

1093
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:23,867
There, it's fixed! In Munich,
there is a place called Lorber's.

1094
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,911
- Their specialty is pot roast.
- Pot roast.

1095
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,497
Young's used to have a menu
150 pages long.

1096
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:33,251
Yes, sir, 150 solid pages
of eatments,

1097
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,753
and, oh, boy, what eatments.

1098
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,338
(Kovac) Ever eat in Antoine's
in New Orleans?

1099
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,757
(Ritt scoffs)
Can't compare with Young's.

1100
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:43,511
You never tasted such food in your life...
'specially seafood.

1101
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,431
Steamed clams
dripping with melted butter,

1102
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:51,102
lobsters... lobsters à la Newburg
with a special white wine sauce...

1103
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,563
- Ritt, shut up!
- What's wrong?

1104
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,690
Stop jabbering about food!

1105
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,151
Isn't it enough we've lost all our supplies
through your carelessness?

1106
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,278
- Carelessness?
- Yes, stupid, criminal carelessness!

1107
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,071
But it wasn't me.
I wasn't in charge of the food.

1108
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,489
The commissary was Joe's job.

1109
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,075
You dirty rat,
trying to shift the blame onto Joe.

1110
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,619
- (Joe) Maybe it was my f...
- No, it wasn't!

1111
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,871
You should have seen
the storm coming!

1112
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,706
My dear Connie,
what's the matter with you?

1113
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,917
She's all right,
just a little bit hungry.

1114
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,753
What are you squawking about?
It'll make a swell chapter.

1115
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:19,214
"How It Feels to Be Starving",
first-person, singular.

1116
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,341
Those are good things to write about,
hunger and thirst.

1117
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,635
If you really come
from back of the yard...

1118
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:26,012
Kovac, why don't you kill Willi?

1119
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,056
Why don't you cut his throat,
like you said you would?

1120
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,099
I'll tell you why!
You're not strong enough!

1121
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,477
He's made of iron!
The rest of us are just flesh and blood...

1122
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,438
hungry flesh and blood, and thirsty!
(Sobbing)

1123
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,318
(Sobbing Continues)

1124
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,739
(Kovac) For the love of Mike,
will you throw that ratty cigar stub away?

1125
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:45,823
Why should I? Does it annoy you?

1126
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,493
Yes, it makes me nervous
watching you chew on it all the time.

1127
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:49,702
Well, it makes me feel good.

1128
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:52,372
Oh, you feel good, do you?
That's fine. Fine!

1129
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,415
Ritt, how much money
are you worth?

1130
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,334
Enough to buy and sell you
a million times!

1131
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,419
- How about raising the ante?
- Anything you say.

1132
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,672
- From now on, each stick is $100.
- Anything you say.

1133
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,799
- Deal 'em!
- Anything you...

1134
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:10,014
- How many factories do you own, Ritt?
- What business is that of yours?

1135
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,101
I was just thinking... by the time
we get home, I might own one of them.

1136
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:14,936
Bet a hundred.

1137
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,938
Raise a hundred.

1138
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,607
- Stay.
- How many cards do you want?

1139
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:23,528
- Three.
- Three to you! Three to the dealer.

1140
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,571
Think I'll go for one
of your airplane plants.

1141
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,573
I've got ideas of my own
about how to run a factory.

1142
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,243
- Yeah, into the ground.
- I'll have a labour-management committee.

1143
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,869
We'll hold a meeting every week.
And first...

1144
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,205
Are you trying to tell me
how to run my own factories?

1145
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:36,666
Not all of them,
just the one I'm gonna own.

1146
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,378
- Bet a hundred.
- I'll see you! Queens.

1147
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,380
Kings.

1148
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:47,385
You know, it's mighty funny
how you keep winning all the pots.

1149
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,845
I'm a lucky guy.

1150
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:52,807
Well, just the same...
I wish we had a new deck of cards.

1151
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,059
Give me another stack of chips.

1152
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,272
- That's another thousand.
- Your deal.

1153
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,864
- Sorry, Ritt.
- Cut you in?

1154
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:09,615
My credit still good?

1155
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:13,036
- Well, uh, your bracelet.
- No, thanks.

1156
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,581
- What's the score?
- $13,500!

1157
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,417
- How about raising the ante?
- It's your funeral.

1158
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:22,086
- Thousand dollars apiece?
- Right.

1159
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:23,838
Okay.

1160
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,426
I'll open for a thousand.

1161
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,595
Raise you two.

1162
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:33,598
I'll raise you two.

1163
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,933
Call.

1164
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,435
How many?

1165
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:39,771
Two cards.

1166
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,649
Someday you'll learn
it doesn't pay to hold a kicker

1167
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,443
if you live long enough.

1168
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:54,369
Just to keep the pikers out.

1169
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,456
- I'll bet five.
- Matched your kicker, huh?

1170
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,375
Five's the bet.

1171
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:03,002
Put up... or shut up.

1172
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,713
And raise you five.

1173
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:10,134
Kovac, now you're talking
my language.

1174
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,805
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

1175
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:19,477
I have got you over a barrel...
we'll do the bookkeeping later.

1176
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:22,063
I'll see your five,

1177
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,898
and I'll raise you...

1178
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:29,320
all the chips you've got,
plus all the money I owe you.

1179
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:33,699
Kovac, looks as if you've
stepped out of your class this time.

1180
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,081
(Kovac) See you, Rittenhouse.
What have you got?

1181
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,667
I've got... (Cries out)

1182
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,884
That was my pot.
You couldn't possibly beat me.

1183
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:55,471
- I have a full house.
- And I had four deuces.

1184
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,098
How do I know
you had four deuces?

1185
01:13:57,182 --> 01:14:00,059
You ought to know.
You made the cards, didn't you?

1186
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,936
And you marked 'em too!

1187
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:05,189
They are crooked,
and you are crooked!

1188
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,485
- It's raining!
- (Commotion continues)

1189
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,238
- It's raining!
- It's raining!

1190
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,074
(Willi)
Get the sail!

1191
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,206
- Here.
- That's right.

1192
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,468
(Rain stops)

1193
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,748
(Gus) I was at the wheel
when she hit.

1194
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,169
My watch
was just about over...

1195
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,591
and I was goin' down
for some hot java.

1196
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,929
When she keeled over...

1197
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,598
the siren was screamin'.

1198
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,435
Like a human being
she was screamin'.

1199
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,271
Right to the end.

1200
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,192
(Mutters)

1201
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:35,571
Oh, you should've heard
the sound of the rain...

1202
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:39,075
drummin' on the canvas.

1203
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:43,704
Most beautiful sound
you ever heard in your life.

1204
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,542
I looked up...

1205
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,128
a couple of drops...

1206
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,298
fell right on my lips.

1207
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,810
Hey, Joe!

1208
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,230
What's the matter?

1209
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,984
Why have you
stopped playin'?

1210
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,404
Come on!

1211
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,614
Heat it up!

1212
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,451
Give it the Harry James!

1213
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,589
Gee, Rosie!

1214
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:38,968
You're an armful.
An armful of honey, that's what you are.

1215
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:44,849
Say, Rosie, I'm thirsty.

1216
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,352
How about a drink?

1217
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,984
Set 'em up, Pete!
Nice tall ones.

1218
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,903
Plenty of ice.

1219
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,538
Here's to you,
Rosie baby.

1220
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,767
What is it, Gus?

1221
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,894
Willi's got some water.

1222
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,938
That's right, Gus.

1223
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,900
I just had a tall one,
plenty of ice.

1224
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,361
Sure, Gus! Sure!

1225
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:41,697
- But Willi only had water.
- That's right.

1226
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,369
Uh, I guess
I'll get back to Rosie.

1227
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,123
(Weary grunt)

1228
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:57,755
Willi, where'd you get the water?

1229
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:02,259
- You've been holdin' out on us.
- You mustn't wake up the others.

1230
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,261
They are tired.

1231
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:09,475
Well, what about you?

1232
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,727
- Ain't you tired?
- No.

1233
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,772
Me neither.

1234
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:18,275
I feel fine,
except my right foot's asleep.

1235
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,696
I can hardly feel it.

1236
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,032
Willi, tell me.

1237
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:30,538
Do you think I should
write to Rosie, tell her about it?

1238
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,581
Or should I wait till I see her?

1239
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:34,959
Wait till you see her.

1240
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,086
Yeah, but...

1241
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,423
I can't walk in on her
gimpy and all like this

1242
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:43,134
without no...
warning, can I?

1243
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:46,804
I got to find some way to...
to break it to her gentle.

1244
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:48,806
It'll be all right.

1245
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,809
Okay.

1246
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,479
- So long, Willi.
- Good-bye, Gus.

1247
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,316
I'll never forget
what you done for me.

1248
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,903
If there's anything I can ever do for you,
just let me know.

1249
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,407
There is something
you can do for me.

1250
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,536
Remember
your name is Schmidt.

1251
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,165
You like it better
than Smith?

1252
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,084
Much better!

1253
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,879
- You'd better hurry, Gus! She's waiting.
- Okay.

1254
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:24,717
- That water you was drinkin'...
- Rosie's waiting for you.

1255
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:28,179
- Why didn't you share it with us?
- Shh!

1256
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:31,015
You mustn't wake them!

1257
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,729
Okay, Willi.

1258
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,898
Why don't you go after Rosie?

1259
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,401
She's waiting for you at Roseland!
There! Do you see the lights?

1260
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,533
Help!

1261
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,703
Stanley!

1262
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:54,955
Help!

1263
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,916
Stanley?

1264
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,375
(Mumbling, indistinct)

1265
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,377
Stanley!

1266
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,506
Willi, he's got...

1267
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,216
Help!

1268
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,259
Help!

1269
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,568
- Where's Gus?
- He's gone over.

1270
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:28,280
- No use, Stan...
- (Stanley) Gus!

1271
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:30,199
- He went under.
- Gus!

1272
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,368
Willi, what is it?
What's happened?

1273
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,329
Schmidt went over the side.

1274
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,498
He was calling my name.
That's what woke me.

1275
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,709
You can't imagine
how painful it was to me.

1276
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,795
All night long, to watch him

1277
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,964
turning and suffering
and nothing I could do for him.

1278
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,924
Why didn't you stop rowing?

1279
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,718
- Why should I?
- To help him!

1280
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:52,680
The best way to help him
was to let him go.

1281
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:58,269
I had no right to stop him,
even if I wanted to.

1282
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:02,147
A poor cripple dying
of hunger and thirst...

1283
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,610
What good could life be
to a man like that?

1284
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,738
He was trying to tell me something.
If I could only remember.

1285
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:12,616
He's better off now,
out of his trouble.

1286
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:16,954
- Something about water.
- He was in agony from thirst.

1287
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:20,082
I wanted to cry,
but the tears wouldn't come.

1288
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,625
No, how could they?

1289
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:26,589
(Connie) If I remember rightly,
tears are water

1290
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,632
with a trace of sodium chloride.

1291
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:31,176
- Isn't that so, Willi?
- Ja.

1292
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,012
What about sweat?

1293
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:37,141
What's the chemical
composition of sweat?

1294
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:40,269
Water... with a trace
of something or other.

1295
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:42,021
Now, I remember!

1296
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,107
Gus said
Willi had some water!

1297
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,943
Yeah!
Right under his shirt!

1298
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:58,162
Quite so.

1299
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:03,083
I took the precaution of filling the flask
from the water breakers before the storm,

1300
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,461
- just in case of emergency!
- (Flask splashes)

1301
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:08,339
And I had food tablets
and energy pills too.

1302
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,967
Everybody on the U-boat has them.

1303
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,512
You should be grateful to me
for having the foresight to think ahead.

1304
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,933
To survive, one must have a plan.

1305
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,227
But there's nothing
to worry about.

1306
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,563
Soon we'll reach
the supply ship,

1307
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:26,357
and then we'll all have
food and water.

1308
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,861
- Too bad Schmidt couldn't have waited.
- (Shrieks) You!

1309
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,374
Please, don't...
Please, Miss Alice!

1310
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:23,038
(Blows landing)

1311
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:09,668
To my dying day,
I'll never understand Willi.

1312
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:11,962
Or what he did.

1313
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,841
First, he tried to kill us all
with his torpedoes.

1314
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:19,094
Nevertheless,
we fished him out of the sea,

1315
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:22,806
took him aboard,
shared everything we had with him.

1316
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,518
You would've thought
he'd have been grateful.

1317
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:29,146
All he could do
was to plot against us.

1318
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,774
Then he...

1319
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,359
He let poor old Gus
die of thirst.

1320
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,529
What do you do
with people like that?

1321
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:44,495
Maybe one of us
ought to try to row.

1322
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,664
Where to?

1323
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,417
What for?

1324
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,003
Nah!

1325
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,381
When we killed the German,
we killed our motor.

1326
01:24:56,508 --> 01:25:00,344
No! We still got a motor.

1327
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,097
Eh? Who?

1328
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:07,726
Nah!

1329
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:12,356
We're through.

1330
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,526
Are you afraid?

1331
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,237
No. I don't think so.

1332
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,908
If we had got out of it, I...

1333
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:25,661
I was going to ask you
to marry me.

1334
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,040
What do you think
you'd have said?

1335
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,210
I think I would've said yes.

1336
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,801
Well, then, whatever happens...

1337
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,637
I'd like you to marry me.

1338
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,640
Congratulations!

1339
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:48,851
Well, that's settled.

1340
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,063
And what now, little men?

1341
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:56,483
I've been a widower for 18 years.

1342
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,611
We never had any children.

1343
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,823
All I leave behind me...

1344
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:06,160
is a great many
millions of dollars.

1345
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,328
I hope they do
somebody some good.

1346
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,999
So, we're all going
to fold up and die,

1347
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,627
just because that
ersatz superman is gone.

1348
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:18,380
My only regret is...

1349
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:20,340
that in the end...

1350
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,426
I joined a mob.

1351
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,553
Baloney!

1352
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:27,264
We weren't a mob
when we killed him.

1353
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:29,516
We were a mob
when we sat around...

1354
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,643
prisoners of the man
we'd saved,

1355
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:34,354
kowtowing to him,
obeying him,

1356
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,356
practically heiling him,

1357
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,233
because he was kind enough
and strong enough

1358
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:40,444
to take us to a concentration camp!

1359
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:44,698
Good grief, look at you!

1360
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:49,369
Rittenhouse, C. J. Rittenhouse,
self-made man.

1361
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,164
Made of what?

1362
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:56,627
As long as you're sitting there,
thinking of your last will and testament,

1363
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,296
I'll write your epitaph for you now.

1364
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:02,174
"Ritt, he quit!"

1365
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,010
That goes for you too, Narcissus!

1366
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:07,242
It's a good thing there's
room on your chest

1367
01:27:07,243 --> 01:27:09,348
for another letter...
"Q" for quitter!

1368
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,976
And you, Joe...

1369
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:16,355
It's all right for you to look up
and trust in somebody.

1370
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,483
How about giving him a hand?

1371
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,070
What's the matter with us?

1372
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:28,158
We not only let the Nazi
do our rowing for us, but our thinking!

1373
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,535
Ye Gods and little fishes!

1374
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,249
Fishes!

1375
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,209
Ye Gods!

1376
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,048
We haven't got
energy pills,

1377
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:46,843
but the ocean's full of them...
millions of fish swimming around!

1378
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,512
Well, why don't we catch some?

1379
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:51,139
We tried that!
We have no bait!

1380
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,851
Sure, we have bait... by Cartier!

1381
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,229
Are you kidding?

1382
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:00,482
Kidding, my foot!
I'm starving!

1383
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:03,402
Well, what are you
waiting around for?

1384
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,737
Where's the fish line?

1385
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,413
Bait your line, chum.

1386
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:16,832
(Ritt) Not only food, but oil.

1387
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:19,710
We can squeeze the fish for oil.
It's better than water.

1388
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,921
I can recommend the bait.
I ought to know... I bit on it myself!

1389
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,923
I've never eaten raw fish before.

1390
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,800
I have. It's not bad.

1391
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:29,511
We'd better not count our chickens
before they're hatched.

1392
01:28:29,595 --> 01:28:31,596
- What do you mean, "chickens"?
- (Chuckles)

1393
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,266
There never yet was a poor fish
that wouldn't bite on one of those.

1394
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:20,020
- (Gasps)
- Strike! (Shouting)

1395
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,108
- It's a good one!
- Careful!

1396
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,610
- Easy!
- Easy does it!

1397
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:28,612
- Don't let him have slack!
- Easy!

1398
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:39,122
- There's a ship.
- Huh?

1399
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,293
Gangway!

1400
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:47,214
Why, you... My bracelet!

1401
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,091
(Connie cries out)

1402
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,599
(Chuckles, laughs)

1403
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:11,780
(Ritt)
It's the supply ship, all right.

1404
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,365
Yeah!

1405
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:15,909
(Stanley) Willi's had
the last word at that.

1406
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:20,831
Well, some of my best friends
are in concentration camps.

1407
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:25,168
(Ritt) Do you suppose they'll have
any coffee aboard... real coffee?

1408
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:29,756
- (Man) Hello!
- What'd he say?

1409
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,384
He says, yes,
they have some coffee.

1410
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,428
And Wiener schnitzel
and pig's knuckles

1411
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:38,682
and sauerkraut
and apple strudel... hot!

1412
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,811
Look! The supply ship's signalling.

1413
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:49,151
(Ritt) What's happening?
Why are they turning around?

1414
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,488
Maybe they forgot
the cream for the coffee.

1415
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:55,699
They're not going
to pick us up! Hey!

1416
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,201
(Ritt) Well, that's...
that's impossible.

1417
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,745
They can't leave us here like this.
Why... Why, that's inhuman.

1418
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,915
As a matter of fact,
it's a violation of international law.

1419
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,919
- (Distant rumbling)
- And now, there's a storm coming up.

1420
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:11,047
- (Rumbling)
- No, that's gunfire.

1421
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:15,385
I think it would be a good idea
to get out of here.

1422
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:17,220
- (Artillery fire continues)
- Do you know I...

1423
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,682
You know, I believe
that we're being shelled by our own side.

1424
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:22,767
They're shooting at us!

1425
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,561
What's the matter with them?
Can't they see us?

1426
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,105
- Why can't we signal 'em or something?
- (Kovac) With what?

1427
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,608
- Where are we going?
- (Shell whizzing)

1428
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,361
What's the best place to go?

1429
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,077
She's moving towards us.
Hurry up, Kovac!

1430
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:44,623
(Ritt) Can't you boys
row any faster?

1431
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:49,920
- (Shell whizzing)
- (Women cry out)

1432
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:08,730
(Explosions continue)

1433
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,075
(Explosions continue)

1434
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,505
In a word, wow!

1435
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,554
(Whimpers)

1436
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,181
Relax, Mr Rittenhouse!

1437
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:53,608
- (Explosion)
- They've got her!

1438
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,368
Watch your head!

1439
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:18,508
- She's going down.
- And fast too!

1440
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,344
Not fast enough for me!

1441
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:42,407
(Kovac)
Well, that settles the score.

1442
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,244
Here comes our ship. She ought
to be here in about 20 minutes.

1443
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:50,540
- What can we use to signal with?
- Wait'll she gets a little nearer.

1444
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:55,378
Well, folks,
we're in business agai...

1445
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,007
- There I go again.
- (Weeping)

1446
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:05,055
(Weeping continues)

1447
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:08,892
Well, I only hope Mrs Spencer
hasn't been worrying too much.

1448
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,935
- Who's Mrs Spencer?
- My wife.

1449
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:12,687
George, you're married?

1450
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,440
Those things happen to everybody,
you know.

1451
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:18,276
Twenty minutes?

1452
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:20,779
Good heavens...
my nails, my hair, my face!

1453
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:22,405
Oh, I must look a fright!

1454
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,200
Oh!

1455
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:29,663
- Oh, here, darling.
- No, darling! You first.

1456
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:33,667
Yes, darling! Yes! 'Cause one
of my best friends is in the navy.

1457
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:36,419
- Hmm, nice! Mighty nice!
- The boy goes to high school!

1458
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,463
Really? What's his name?

1459
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:40,006
- George.
- Oh.

1460
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:42,008
George Charles Spencer.

1461
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,511
- Lovely family, George! Lovely family!
- Oh, thanks!

1462
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,555
Stanley, do you realize
I don't even know your last name?

1463
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,141
G-A-double R-E-double T.

1464
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:54,104
"Garrett!" (Chuckles)
Garrett!

1465
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,273
Am I presentable, darling?
How do I look?

1466
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,526
- A million! (Chuckles)
- Fifty grand...

1467
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:02,112
Kovac, my boy...
I owe you fifty grand.

1468
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:05,448
- Forget that last hand, Ritt.
- I will never forget that last hand.

1469
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,867
Don't be silly, darling!

1470
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,994
He'll find a way
to take it off his income tax.

1471
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,914
- Not at all! Not at all!
- And don't forget...

1472
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,417
- You owe me a bracelet.
- Yows'm!

1473
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,420
- And a typewriter!
- Sure!

1474
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,338
- And a camera!
- You bet!

1475
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:22,966
And... Look!

1476
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:33,435
(Moaning)

1477
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:37,689
- Danke schön.
- It's his arm. Let's get his coat off!

1478
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:44,612
Hey, wait a minute! Have you
forgotten about Willi already?

1479
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:46,531
Ritt, this is different!
The kid's wounded.

1480
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:47,866
Throw him back!

1481
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:52,579
(Connie) Don't be silly, darling.
He's... He's helpless. He's only a baby.

1482
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:02,380
(Kovac)
The baby has a toy.

1483
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:05,508
- I should've frisked him.
- You see?

1484
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:08,887
You can't treat them as human beings.
You've got to exterminate them!

1485
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,930
(Pistol clatters on boat floor)

1486
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:13,683
(Splashes)

1487
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,645
Easy, Ritt!
He'll be taken care of.

1488
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,858
(Speaking in German)

1489
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,319
He says,
"Aren't you going to kill me?"

1490
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,654
I'll have to tie this up
till the ship's doctor takes care of it.

1491
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:29,199
"Aren't you going to kill me?"

1492
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,743
What are you gonna do
with people like that?

1493
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:33,369
I don't know.

1494
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:36,206
I was thinking of Mrs Higley
and her baby.

1495
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,249
And Gus.

1496
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,503
Well, maybe they can answer that.
