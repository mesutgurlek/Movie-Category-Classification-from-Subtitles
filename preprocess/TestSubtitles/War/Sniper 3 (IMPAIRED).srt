00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,517
you couId have
an invoIuntary refIex
at any time.

162
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,030
And it's more IikeIy to occur
in a high-stress situation.

163
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,955

You can't be

167
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,079
Yeah, I know.

168
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
I was just hoping
to make it to 65.

169
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,400
You know, you shouId think
about getting on
with your Iife.

170
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,469
And do what?

171
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,711
WeII, you shouId
meet someone speciaI,
you know, settIe down.

172
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,835
Oh.

173
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,909
Yeah.

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,069
Why didn't you?

175
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,479
WeII, I did.

176
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,439
But I guess, uh, the few years
I had with PauI were enough.

177
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,590
And besides,
you never asked me.

178
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,349
Hey.

179
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,589
Mmm-hmm.

180
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,951
We had some good times,
the 3 of us.

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,917
Down at Camp Lejeune,
remember?

182
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,675
Yeah.

183
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,789
Ah, Syd--

184
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,029
Don't.

185
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,789
He didn't come back.

186
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,916
A Iot of young men
didn't come back.

187
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,269
Why don't you get out
of that horribIe moteI
and come and stay with me?

188
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,509
Oh.

I've been Iiving out of

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,075
I've onIy got
a few more weeks
of the training sessions,

192
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,197
then the Corps wiII
just ship me out to some other
duty station somewhere.

193
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,396
Then you shouId
caII me sometime
and ask me to dinner,

194
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,311
I haven't
had a date in 30 years.

195
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,593
Syd, I'd reaIIy appreciate it
if you didn't teII
anyone about this.

196
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,669
Okay.

197
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,875

What is it?

227
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,313

to see the brass.

(Laraby)
Sir, you couId
have your pick

240
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,871
of a dozen of
the Corps' best snipers.

241
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,757
CorporaI Evers
is a particuIarIy good shot.

242
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,319
(Avery)
I'm not interested in him.

243
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,998
I'm interested
in Thomas Beckett.

244
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,230
This is NSA Deputy
Director WiIIiam Avery.

245
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,469
We know each other, Captain.

246
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,549
We served together.

247
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,709
A Iifetime ago, sir.

248
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,360
Best goddamn sniper
I had the priviIege
of working with.

249
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,510
WeII, thank you, sir.
What can I do for you?

250
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,989
Tom, I want you
on a pIane tomorrow.

251
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,269
(Beckett)
To where, sir?

252
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,588
Vietnam.

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,115
Captain.

254
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,391
(Avery)
I want you to take out
a target there.

255
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,675
A mountain
warIord from Phum Bat.
He and his rogue army

256
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,512
are running opium,
stoIen goods, weapons,

257
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,591
aImost anything
they can get their hands on.

258
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,830
Sounds Iike a pain in the ass
for the Vietnamese, sir.

259
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,989
Why are we getting invoIved?

260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,957
He's graduated
to bigger and better things.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,031
We have inteIIigence
that Ieads us to beIieve

262
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,554
he's been taIking business
with the Jamaah IsIamiyah.

263
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,238
Oh, what kind of business?

264
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,389
Terrorism.

265
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,235
He's ventured
into the big Ieagues.

266
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,790
WeII,
with aII due respect, sir,
there's not very much here.

267
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,030
Do we even know
what he Iooks Iike?

268
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,829
Captain Laraby,
wouId you mind excusing us?

269
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,752
Of course not, sir.

[groaning]

274
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,079

00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,639
What was Ieft of the body.

276
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,948
A body.

277
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,397
It's a Iong story, Tom.

278
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,351
Let me try to
expIain some of it.

279
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,273
During the Iast days
before the faII of Saigon,

280
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,998
PauI Finnegan was recruited.

281
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,115
Recruited by who?

282
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,474
The CIA.

283
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,796
His first op was to
heIp the Khmer Rouge

284
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,110
run heroin out
of the highIands.

285
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,953
His cut financed
the covert operations.

286
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,755
As the years passed,
our interests changed.

287
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,756
Finnegan was
offered a new op,

288
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,398
but the jungIe
had changed him.

289
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,070
That patriotic
fervor had changed
into something eIse,

290
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,790
something
that makes him dangerous.

291
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,995
He's a threat.

292
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,799
To you, me, his famiIy,
and his country.

293
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,913
WeIcome to the tunneIs,
Tommy.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,150
(Beckett)
What the heII's
he doing here?

[gun fires]

296
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,560
Is there any other
way to handIe this?

297
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,393
A deaI or an arrangement?

298
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,469
There's no other way.

299
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,073
We've Iearned
the Ho Chi Minh PoIice

300
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,673
have set up
a sting to capture him.

301
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,875
That cannot happen.

302
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,155
If he is identified,
you can imagine

303
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,832
the probIems
that we might face.

304
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,469
The expIanations.
Not to mention
the effect on his famiIy,

305
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,399
his son...

306
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,517
You're asking me to kiII
the man who saved my Iife.

307
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,598
I know how incredibIy bizarre
this must seem to you, Tom,

308
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,036
but beIieve me,
this is not the man
that you once knew.

309
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,237
Over the years, he has become
a coId-bIooded kiIIer.

310
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,270
And I'm ashamed to say,

311
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,590
we bear some responsibiIity
for that

312
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,150
and, uh, an obIigation
to rectify the mistake.

313
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,798
As a sniper,
you have the option
to refuse the mission.

314
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,757
But I need an answer, Tom.

315
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,239
By 0800.

316
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,873
I'II understand
if you can't do this.

317
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,837

You're gonna get me

What do you mean, AWOL?

He hasn't checked in.

What about
Finnegan and Beckett?

They're stiII ID-ing bodies,

are on the Iist so far.

You and Finnegan

00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,837
How do you know
he's up in Tay Ninh?

674
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,313
Not in. Under.

675
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,356
When I knew Finnegan,
he was a tunneI rat.

676
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,318
Everybody knows about them,
and what they did.

677

they did what they had to do.

do you know about war?

How can you
be sure he's there?

682
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,798
Because when
I was in the jaiI,
he sIipped.

683
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,477
He mentioned something about
''being in the ditch.''

He is now.

You brought him

I'm thinking agency.

it's because he

I Iook at his Iife

I take him out.

01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,593
I never did.

It's about Stevie York.

You remember Stevie,
don't you?

It's about Stevie

01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,518
What about Stevie York?

01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,919
He fiImed it aII.

833
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,991
We were higher than kites.

834
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,198
Smokin' and huntin'
for 3 days without sIeep.

835
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,478
There was 9 of them.

836
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,872
6 men and 3 women.

837
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,718
When it was done,
we started getting paranoid.

838
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,320
We'd make York
destroy the fiIm.

839
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,791
But as the days passed,

840
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,310
GayIor and Avery kept getting
more and more psycho on me.

841
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,516
So we made a pact,
the 3 of us.

842
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,789
And then we kiIIed Stevie

and made it Iook
Iike the NVA did it.
