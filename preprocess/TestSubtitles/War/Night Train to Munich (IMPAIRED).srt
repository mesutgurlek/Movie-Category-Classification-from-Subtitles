00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,070
Oh! That's a night fish.
You've been out in a ketch.

164
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,301
Not like me
- fishing to keep away from the old woman.

165
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,546
- Where do we change?
- The beach.

166
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,343
- And then London?
- Yes.

167
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,418
There I shall go to see
a friend of my family.

168
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,419
He fled to England last
September. He'll help us.

169
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,489
He's living at a place called
Hampstead. You've heard of it?

170
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,251
Yes. Karl, if you only knew
how glad I am to be back here...

171
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,623
where people can still laugh and be happy.

172
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,164
Come away, Alfie. If you're not falling
in something, you're dragging in something.

173
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,165
Go on.

174
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,884
- Good evening.
- Uh, good evening.

175
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,386
- I should like to see Dr. Fredericks.
- Have you an appointment?

176
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,686
No, but, uh, if you would give him
my name. It is Marsen. Karl Marsen.

177
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,590
- Well, will you come in, please?
- Thank you.

178
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,760
Now, if you will take this
to Gilby's, the opticians.

179
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,772
They're just around the corner.

180
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,332
If you mention my name, they will make up
your little girl's glasses at a reduced charge.

181
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,036
Thank you, Doctor.

182
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,580
And don't worry. With care,
she will grow out of it.

183
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,650
- Thank you, Doctor. Good night.
- Good night.

184
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,379
There's a gentleman to see
you, Doctor, a Mr. Marsen.

185
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,182
Marsen?

186
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,950
Oh, very well. Show him in.

Mr. Marsen.

190
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,267
- Good evening.
- How do you do, Doctor?

191
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,499
I was given your name. I'm suffering from
an, uh, eyestrain and should like a test.

192
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,667
- Headaches and so forth?
- Hmm, yes.

193
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,007
If you will be good enough
to sit in this chair, please?

Thank you.

195

- Warm this evening, isn't it?
- Rather.

196
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,220
I hear there may be a storm brewing.

I have to report that on instructions
from Gestapo headquarters...

210
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,122
I successfully made contact
with the woman Bomasch...

211
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:52,630
in Concentration Camp Number
Four, Reichsprotektorat of Bohemia.

212
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,497
I escaped with her, as
arranged, on the 27 th ofJuly...

213

at 124 Paddington Lane, Marylebone.

216
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,481
Good. She has, of course, made
no attempt to locate her father.

217

No. I am awaiting your instructions.

Bomasch is working for the British
admiralty. Where, we have no idea.

220
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,584
He is certainly well hidden and well guarded.

221
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,924
- Therefore, we must move cautiously.
- Understood, sir.

222
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,930
So do not appear too eager.

223
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,490
Impress upon her that you are
aliens and must move carefully.

224
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:35,198
Suggest that she places an
advertisement to this effect...

225
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,333
<i>in the personal column of the London Times...</i>

226
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:42,470
signed perhaps with some nickname
which her father will know at once.

227
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,483
You will see that that advertisement
is repeated daily until it is answered.

228
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,179
When that happens, you
will report to me instantly.

Go to the destination on the ticket,

00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,934
ask for a man named Gus Bennett.

You've got the name? Gus Bennett.

- Yes, but who do I ask?
- Everyone there knows Gus Bennett.

anyone. That is most important.

- I don't know yet.
- But, uh, what did he say?

257

was said I wasn't to say a word to anyone.

- But not me.

If I didn't, it's simply because
Karl is an alien without a passport.

- This is a fine country to live in.

462
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,924
- Hey. What's that?
- Nothing.

463
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,397
- Name. Department.
- Schwab. Records. Intelligence.

464
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,128
- Report that man.
- Excellent, Officer.

465
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,331
While we have men like you at home,
we have nothing to fear. Nothing.

466
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,509
Oh, I have an appointment
with Commander Kampfeldt.

467
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,771
- Where can I find him?
- Second floor, sir.

468
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,403
Thank you.

469
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,610
This is a very grave matter, very grave.

470
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,483
It has just been reported to me that
you've been heard expressing sentiments...

471
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,215
hostile to the fatherland.

472
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,950
- What, me, sir?
- What is it?

473
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,459
Major Herzoff to see you.
He asked me to give you this.

474
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,121
Can't you see I'm engaged?

475
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,825
I warn you, Schwab, such treasonable conduct
will lead you to a concentration camp.

476
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,834
But, sir, what did I say?

477
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,235
You were distinctly heard to remark,
"This is a fine country to live in".

478
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,307
Oh, no, sir. There's some mistake.

479
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,139
<i>No, what I said was,
"This is a fine country to live in".</i>

480
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,145
Huh?

481
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,874
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

482
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,246
Hmm. I see.

483
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,411
Well, in future, don't make
remarks that can be taken two ways.

484
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,115
- Much wiser not to talk politics at all.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,748
<i>- You may go.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

486
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,759
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

487
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,724
<i>This is a fine country to live in.</i>

488
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,137
<i>This is a fine country to live in.</i>

489
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,211
This is a bloody awful country to live in.

490
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,439
Shall I show Major Herzoff in, sir?

491
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,539
- Uh, yes, yes.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,413
Please.

493
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,353
Major Herzoff.

494
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,016
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

495
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,752
- Sit down, Major.
- Thank you.

496
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,828
Sorry to keep you waiting.

497
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,556
"This is to introduce to
you Major Ulrich Herzoff...

498
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,566
"of the Corps of Engineers.

499
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,104
"Major Herzoff is in Berlin on
an important technical mission...

500
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,333
"for which he requires admiralty assistance.

501
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:49,311
"I am sure, my dear Kampfeldt, that
you will give him your best cooperation.

502
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,405
<i>Heil Hitler. " Et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.</i>

503
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,680
I wish these War Office fellows
would learn to write properly.

504
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,686
Signature might be anything.

505
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,086
Whose is it?

506
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,159
Well, I have no idea.

507
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,660
As usual, I was taken
from one office to another.

508
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,595
- I suppose it couldn't be Sardvitz.
- Sardvitz?

509
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,666
Or did he go in the purge?

510
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,292
- I can't remember.
- I believe he did.

511
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,895
Hmm. Whoever he was, he
spoke very highly of you.

512
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,907
He did?

513
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,409
Might be Meidvidtz.

514
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,479
Not very likely though.

515
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,743
However, the important thing
is, what can I do for you?

516
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,284
I want to refer to certain
technical evidence...

517
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,878
given before the Naval Heavy
Armaments 1935 Committee.

518
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,389
If you will let me have a
report of the copy, Commander.

519
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,929
Certainly. It will take only a moment.
I have my own filing system here.

520
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:44,458
A copy of the Naval Heavy
Armaments 1935 Committee's report.

521
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,967
- Have you been in Berlin long, Major?
- No.

522
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,303
I only left the Siegfried line last Tuesday.

523
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,604
Really? How is it there?

524
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,009
Things are pretty hectic, I expect.

525
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,016
Pumping night and day.

526
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,216
I was there in a consultative capacity.

527
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,779
Steel fortifications.
You possibly have heard.

528
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,088
<i>Oh, yes, yes. Major Herzoff, of course.</i>

529
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,927
Looks rather like Stuckner.

530
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,933
But I believe he is doing
diplomatic work in the Balkans.

531
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,833
<i>- And who is not?
- [Door Opens]</i>

532
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,305
I'm afraid we haven't a
copy of the 1935 report, sir.

533
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,377
- What's that?
- We have one of'34, but not '35.

534
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,946
Are you sure there was a '35 committee?

535
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,106
I sat in it myself as army liaison officer.

536
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,982
I beg your pardon. Very well, very well.

537
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,386
It's these fellows at the top.
They forget to send copies on.

538
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,482
Perhaps the construction
department might be able to help.

539
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,790
The very thing. They might have
one. I'll ring them at once.

540
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,057
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- No trouble at all.

541
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,065
Commander Prada.

542
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,297
I have with me Major Ulrich
Herzoff of the Corps of Engineers.

543
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,705
He is well known for his splendid
technical achievements on our west wall...

544
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,107
as you're no doubt aware.

545
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:05,342
<i>He will be greatly obliged if
you can give him some assistance.</i>

546
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,316
You'll see him at once? Thank you, sir.

547
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,087
1935, you said. I guess I could
get hold of a copy for you.

548
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,060
Now, Commander Prada, you may
be able to help me more directly.

549
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,131
- You know, I just left the Siegfried line.
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,599
- So Kampfeldt said. How is everything?
- The Krupp's armor plating is the trouble.

551
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,296
Confidentially, that's why I am in Berlin.

552
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,000
Do you realize that the steel used by the
Czechs is better than anything we have got?

553
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,441
Mm-hmm. So I've heard. But surely,
now that we control the Harska works...

554
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,810
Not enough. We let the only man who
counted there slip through our fingers.

555
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,577
- Bomasch.
- Yes. I knew Axel Bomasch personally.

556
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,677
I was present at the first gunnery test
of his G.K. plating. Incredible results.

557
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,688
Where is he? Working for Britain.

558
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,418
<i>But if we can't trace this 1935 report-</i>

559
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:52,986
One moment, Major. You will be surprised to
hear that Bomasch is no longer in England.

560
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,394
What?

561
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,262
He was brought back to
Germany only a few hours ago.

562
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,495
<i>In fact, he's in this building now.</i>

563
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,608
But this completely alters my plans.

564
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,184
Perhaps you can arrange for
me to see Herr Bomasch at once.

565
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,253
I'm afraid it's impossible.
He's with the controller.

566
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,652
Surely there's no harm in my
asking him a few questions.

567
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,724
It's beyond my province, Major.

568
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:24,226
I'll pass you on to Captain Viengarten,
but frankly I don't think
it will get you any further.

569
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,387
The controller's office is rather
like the kingdom of heaven...

570
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,091
and, if anything, a little more exclusive.

571
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,728
But you are no longer living
in a decadent democracy...

572
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,032
ruled by a pack of raving intellectuals!

573
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,165
This is the Third Reich, and
the führer does not tolerate...

574
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,800
stupid, insolent obstinacy!

575
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,641
You have been asked to work for
Germany, Herr Bomasch, and you will.

576
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:47,047
Can't you leave him alone? You've bullied
and shouted at him ever since we got here!

577
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,051
- He's had no sleep!
- He must agree!

578
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,454
Can I have another word with him, sir?

579
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,457
As you please.

580
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,634
Anna. It's useless for your
father to resist like this.

581
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,035
You must persuade him. You will
both be given reasonable freedom.

582
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,040
Freedom here?

583
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,508
In time, you will see things the way I do...

584
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,011
the way everyone in Germany does.

585
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,013
I'm not a German.

586
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,676
Germany is as much your
country as it is ours now.

587
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,584
We don't hate the Czechs.
We only wish to protect them.

588
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,918
As you're protecting the people of Poland?

589
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,084
You have been too long in Britain,
listening to their smug hypocrisy!

590
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:34,062
If I listened to hypocrisy in
Britain, it was not from the British.

591
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,636
I was doing my duty...

592
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,696
as a citizen of the Reich
and a subject of the führer...

593
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,641
for whose sacred mission
no sacrifice is too great.

594
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,510
That sounds rather like
something you learnt from a book.

595
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,448
For years, you've had this sort of thing drilled
into you until it's all you know or care about!

596
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,147
<i>You're a fanatic with a
set of stupid, fixed ideasl</i>

597
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,453
If you hadn't made me hate you more than
I thought I could possibly hate anybody...

598
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,755
I think I should feel sorry for you.

599
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,660
You have expressed yourself
very clearly, Fraulein Bomasch.

600
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:12,327
You will be placed in a concentration
camp until your father comes to his senses.

601
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,894
- Must you drag my daughter into this?
- It rests with you, Herr Bomasch.

602
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,239
Hello? What, here?

603
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,470
Very good.

604
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,911
Admiral Hassinger is on his way up.

605
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,977
The Chief of Naval Staff,
Vice Admiral Count Hassinger.

606
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,078
Come in, my dear fellow. Come in.

607
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,995
Strasse, let me present Major
Herzoff of the Corps of Engineers.

608
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,532
I expect you have heard of him.

609
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,068
<i>The man behind the
Siegfried line, eh, Herzoff?</i>

610

Well, what progress?

613
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,079
You remember me, Herr Bomasch. I
did not expect to see you again here.

614
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,421
And you, Fraulein Bomasch.
I see you have not forgotten.

615
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,224

618

Major Herzoff is preparing a highly
confidential report on armor plating.

619
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,398
He has been on several missions to Prague.

620
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,876
- He met Bomasch there.
- Just one moment, sir.

621
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,971
Marsen, conduct Herr Bomasch and
his daughter into the next room.

622
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:37,278
- Mr. Bomasch.
- Maybe we shall meet again, later.

623
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,693
I thought it unwise to
speak in front of Bomasch.

624
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,756
- So far, we've made no impression on him.
- I do not agree. He looks 10 years older.

625
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,768
My orders are to obtain quick results.

626
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,770
At the Reich, we are rather
inclined to believe...

627
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,999
that the knuckle-duster is
the best diplomatic weapon.

628
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:01,806
- Do I understand that you question?
- I question nothing. I am an army officer.

629
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,216
Personally, I do not
follow any of this at all.

630
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,751
Bomasch is not the man to be
bullied into cooperation, sir.

631
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,752
Well, what do you suggest?

632
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,288
I knew Fraulein Bomasch in Prague.

633
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,657
She has a great influence with her father and is
the one person who can make him change his mind.

634
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,392
Oh, Marsen here has tried
that, but she refused to listen.

635
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,492
He is largely responsible for
tracing Bomasch in England...

636
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,902
<i>completely outwitting the
British military intelligence.</i>

637
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,975
So, may I express a soldier's admiration...

638
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,512
<i>for one who can carry out his mission under
the very eyes of the enemy secret service?</i>

639
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,773
Thank you, sir.

640
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,780
But if I may say so, I
hardly think the captain...

641
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,214
is a suitable person to influence the lady.

642
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,445
And who do you think would be more suitable?

643
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,647
Why, uh, myself, for instance.

644
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,383
- You?
- Why not?

645
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,925
Herzoff was very friendly
with her in Prague, you know.

646
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,120
A little more than friendly.

647
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,424
You saw the way she looked
at me when I came in.

648
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:58,399
Oh, yes, of course. Seems to me
you are a bit of a dog, Herzoff.

649
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,300
A technician, Admiral. One does
not talk about these things...

650
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,431
but I think if I were to spend
a few hours alone with her...

651
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,271
I might induce her to reason with her father.

652
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,973
Oh. What do you think about that, Strasse?

653
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,140
I cannot promise, mind you.

654
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,309
Four years is a long time.

655
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,387
It seems to me it is worth attempting.

656
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,286
- After all, the business is urgent, Strasse.
- It is indeed, sir.

657
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,020
You really believe that you could
influence a girl in a matter of hours?

658
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,154
- Shall we say overnight?
- I see.

659
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:30,097
Knowing Fraulein Bomasch, sir, I
doubt whether even his qualities...

660
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,100
will make any impression on her.

661
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,727
- You aren't acquainted with my qualities.
- Strasse, we'll let him try it.

662
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,807
No harm done if he doesn't succeed.
Leave all the arrangements to me.

663
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,605
This requires a knowledge of
maneuvers. Come along, Herzoff.

664
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,781
You may be right, my dear.
Bennett may be trying to help us.

665
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:53,015
But why have they brought us to this
hotel, provided you with clothes?

666
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,023
It doesn't make sense to me.

667
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,685
Well, Bennett's behind it, obviously.
He's organized the whole thing.

668
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,092
How?

669
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,892
Well, how did he manage to get into
the German admiralty as a Nazi officer?

670
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,297
But I don't see how he can
get us away from here, Anna.

671
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,768
Oh, Father, don't worry about it.
Perhaps you'd better go to bed now, eh?

- Does that matter?

Well, tomorrow morning I'm
going to phone the admiral...

697
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,640
and say that your father is now
prepared to work for Germany.

698
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,043
- What?
- I shall say that I persuaded you
to reason with him.

699
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,138
They're bound to ask me
to take you both along.

700

The Gestapo man downstairs
will let us pass and then...

701
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,320
- Yes, but how do you know he will?
- They listen in to the phone. They always do.

702
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,390
Then instead of driving to the admiralty,
we shall go to a meadow outside Berlin...

703
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,118
where a plane is waiting.

704
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,185
I see. But why should the admiralty
believe you've persuaded me?

705
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:17,097
I shall indicate that, uh, once
again you have succumbed to my charms.

706

Once again?

707
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,933
It happened in Prague, I'm afraid.

708
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,565
And you told them a
fantastic story like that?

709
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,543
Fantastic? Well, it was four years
ago, there was a harvest moon...

710
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,806
and I was younger and more dashing then.

711
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:34,247
But you really mean all this?
It sounds far too simple.

712
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,285
I have a very simple mind.

713
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,480
But there is one small complication. Uh...

crawling with Gestapo.

<i>All passengers must wait outside. Rlease go.</i>

908
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,924
No good being undignified, old man.

909
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,995
No, quite right.

please, please. Come on. Come on.

911

Come on. So. Please. Please. Please.

912
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,947
Oh, Major. May I phone Munich
to notify them of our delay?

913
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,745
Of course.

914
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:26,310
My absence may provide the opportunity for
Fraulein Bomasch to approach her father.

915
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,117
It might help.

916
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:31,887
You seem to have made a considerable
impression on the lady, Major.

917
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:34,759
I apologize for doubting your capabilities.

918
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,940
Stay on guard here. See
that no one enters or leaves.

919
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,341
Understand? No one.

920
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:01,617
- That man who spoke to you, did you know him?
- Yes, I did. A fellow called Caldicott.

921
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,591
It's probably the first time he's ever left
England before the end of the cricket season.

922
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:08,494
- Just my luck. He gave me a very nasty moment.
- No one would have guessed it.

923
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,828
I was a member of the Foreign
Office operatic society.

924
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,424
Do you know I once played Pooh-Bah
to the Foreign Secretary's Ko-Ko?

925
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,936
- Have you thought of any way
of getting us out of this?
- I have.

926
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,565
A car will be waiting at Munich
to take us to headquarters.

927
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,975
We'll be quite a crowd, and I shall ask
for a second car so that we can be alone.

928
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,979
- Suppose they don't give it to us.
- They will.

929
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,608
Because by that time, we shall be on the verge
of persuading your father to work for Germany.

930
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,618
You, on the other hand, must
be asking for time to think.

931
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,415
- You get the idea?
- Yes, but...

932
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,513
- Then we only have the chauffeur to deal with.
And after that
- Switzerland.

933
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,991
- Switzerland?
- Well, we can hardly break through
the Siegfried line.

934
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,289
Yes, but Switzerland's
a long way from Munich.

935
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,421
If we can bluff them into giving
us that car, we'll make it.

936
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,500
So from now on, Mr. Bomasch,
you've got to make up your mind...

937
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,966
whether to keep your armor
plating or let it go rusty.

938
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,970
- Is that quite clear?
- I think so.

939
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:53,065
And you're still so crazy about me
that you would sell the armor plating
for a very small lock of my hair.

940
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,643
All right.

941
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,946
You can't sit here!

942
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,949
- Why not?
- This truck is required.

943
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,144
Come on. Off, off, off, off, off, off.

944
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,346
I suppose these bags aren't required too?

945
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,220
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off.

946
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:13,261
Pushed about from pillar to post by this
railway ever since we got on the train.

947
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:16,126
- Everything we sit on seems to be required.
- It's monstrous.

948
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,063
- We shall write to the company about this.
- Hmm!

949
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,794
You're not at war with England yet, you know.

950
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,496

- What's the matter?

958
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,937
My golf clubs.

959
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,268
Where are they?

960
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,433
I lent them to Max in Berlin.

961
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,341
Like a fool, I said he needn't
bring them back till next Wednesday.

962
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,546
[Exhales] Probably seen the last of them.

963
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:12,553
Yes. I expect they'll require
them for something or other.

964
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,715
I read in the paper that
they're pulling up park railings.

965
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,588
I don't see the connection, old man.

966
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:21,390
Well, your clubs are steel, aren't they?

967
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,260
- Yes.
- So.

Especially made for me.

971
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,074
Why not get in touch with Max?

972
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,840
- How?
- On the telephone.

973
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:40,142
Ask him to send them to London immediately.

974
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,217
It's a desperate chance,
but it's worth taking.

975
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,286
I shall never be able to replace them.

976
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,928
- Oh, uh, telephone?
- Hmm?

It concerns Major Herzoff, sir.

981
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,719
I think a full inquiry

happened a few minutes ago.

A few minutes ago? You mean he's with you?

984
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,954
Admiral Hassinger gave him the authority.

985
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,861
Hassinger did? He never told me.

986
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,593
That's very suspicious.

987
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,761
Yes, but the admiral himself introduced him.

988
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,395
I'll ask him. I'll phone you back.

- More like an "F."
- I do not know, sir.

No, no. But he may have assumed it.

less gave him carte blanche.

- Well, everything points to it.
- Yes, but is that enough?
