00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:02,946
It was a very dangerous thing to do.

499
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:05,236
[Explosion]

500
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,236
- Move!
- Go!

501
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:09,737
[Explosions, gunfire]

502
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:13,236
Sir,

503
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,946
2nd Platoon lost this main trench.

504
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,737
Get me the Mortar Team
from the West Reserve now.

505
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,236
You get the hell scared
out of you first of all.

506
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:44,236
The first time I got shot at, um, was,

507
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:46,946
"hey, this isn't a game. This is for real.

508
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:48,571
This guy really missed me,

509
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:50,236
and he killed somebody else.

510
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:52,236
But tomorrow he'll try to kill me."

511
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,236
[Gunshot]

512
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:56,738
As we say in the military,
that opens your nostrils.

513
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:05,236
Narrator: With British
casualties escalating,

514
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:09,236
Churchill is quickly promoted

515
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,236
and discovers he has what it takes

516
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,737
to lead men into battle.

517
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:20,236
For a man of Churchill's ambition,

518
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:23,737
it's the first step towards redemption.

519
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:28,236
In his heart, what
Churchill always wanted to be

520
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:30,737
was the great warrior, the great hero.

521
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:37,404
Here he was commanding a mere 800 men,

522
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:39,571
whereas he dreamed of directing

523
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,737
the battle destinies of millions.

524
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:03,236
Narrator: The fight seems unending...

525
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:06,236
Mail!

526
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:10,738
Narrator: Until Germany
unleashes a secret weapon.

527
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,236
Incoming!

528
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:16,236
[Explosion, gas hissing]

529
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:17,237
Gas!

530
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:20,236
Move! Move!

531
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,236
Out of the way!

532
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:23,236
Go!

533
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:25,236
[All coughing]

534
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:28,236
Go, go, go, go!

535
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:31,737
[All coughing]

536
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:58,640
The fight between the
Central and Allied powers

537
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:01,975
has become the bloodiest
war in human history.

538
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,640
By 1917,

539
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:08,640
nearly 7 million British, French,
and German soldiers have been killed.

540
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,460
- Gas!
- Go.

541
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:16,141
[All coughing]

542
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,350
It was a war of attrition.

543
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:21,640
You had to kill as many
of the enemy as you could

544
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,640
so you could possibly advance.

545
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,640
Chemical warfare just enabled that

546
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:30,640
in a very horrific way.

547
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,142
For a way to alter the course of the war.

548
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:35,975
So they look to the one country

549
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:39,851
that could finally tip
the scales in their favor.

550
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,640
Until now, President Woodrow Wilson

551
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:55,640
has kept America out of the war.

552
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:58,640
Wilson recognized that the American people

553
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:00,641
did not want to get involved in a war,

554
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:03,640
particularly if it's a war
far away involving people

555
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,640
and for causes that we
had nothing to do with.

556
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:10,640
Frankly, the American
people did not see themselves

557
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:12,641
at immediate risk.

558
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,640
Narrator: But with hostilities escalating,

559
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:20,046
a peaceful solution seems
less and less likely,

560
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,909
and Wilson's advisors urge him

561
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,141
to begin preparing military forces.

562
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:33,640
Among them is the 35-year-old
Assistant Secretary of the Navy

563
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:35,640
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

564
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,640
Mr. President, I recommend
an immediate allocation

565
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,640
of more funds to our naval resources

566
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:42,975
if we want to maintain
military preparedness.

567
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:47,808
Wilson found himself being
drawn closer and closer to war.

568
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,640
In the spring of 1915,

569
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,640
the British liner the lusitania was sunk,

570
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:53,640
and on board were over a hundred Americans.

571
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,640
Now, this was a big deal.

572
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:57,975
Until this time, it
had been a European war.

573
00:39:57,976 --> 00:39:59,640
But now in this European war,

574
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:02,640
Americans were getting killed.

575
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:05,640
Narrator: American resentment
grows against Germany,

576
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:09,640
and on February 26, 1917,

577
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:13,142
it to finally reaches a boiling point.

578
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:16,141
Mr. President, I think you
should look at this right away.

579
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:28,640
Narrator: The United States intercepts

580
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:31,640
a secret telegram from Germany

581
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:34,640
intended for the Mexican government

582
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,476
containing a shocking proposal.

583
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:40,640
The Germans are offering to fund

584
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:43,641
a Mexican invasion of the United States

585
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:47,640
that would allow the country
to reclaim the border states

586
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:52,141
of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

587
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,142
The German ploy was,

588
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:58,593
preoccupy America with a war with Mexico,

589
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:01,201
and therefore you keep them out of Europe.

590
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:03,640
Well, this incensed a lot of Americans,

591
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,640
and rightfully so.

592
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,640
Narrator: The U.S. government
releases the contents

593
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:09,350
of the secret message,

594
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,640
and almost instantly,

595
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:14,640
anti-German protests
erupt all across America.

596
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,350
The Zimmermann telegram

597
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,350
was one of the stupidest things

598
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,640
the German government ever did.

599
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,640
Texas didn't care about the war in Europe.

600
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,640
Now all of a sudden,

601
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:26,640
the Germans are trying
to return Texas to Mexico?

602
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:27,640
Enough with Germany.

603
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:30,640
They need to be taught a lesson.

604
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:33,640
Narrator: President Wilson
signs the declaration of war

605
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:36,640
in April of 1917.

606
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:39,640
Germany's plan to keep
America out of Europe

607
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:42,141
completely backfires.

608
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:46,640
The Americans may finally be ready for war,

609
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:49,851
but their military isn't.

610
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,142
The U.S. has a standing army

611
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,975
of only 100,000 men

612
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:59,640
while the German army has 4 1/2 million.

613
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:03,946
The United States hurries
to build its military,

614
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:09,141
and those few with fighting
experience are rushed to France.

615
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,640
George S. Patton

616
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:26,141
has been presented with a huge challenge...

617
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,640
To command a Battalion of American men

618
00:42:32,641 --> 00:42:36,141
using the latest form
of military innovation...

619
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:47,141
The tank.

620
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:55,640
Some American Generals were
really resisting the tank

621
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,641
because they didn't want to
get rid of the horse cavalry.

622
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,640
George Patton understood the
power of the new technology

623
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:04,640
of mobile and armed warfare,

624
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:07,141
and he invested a lot in that.

625
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:14,640
Narrator: The tank is already
being used on the Western front

626
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:18,640
but with little success.

627
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:21,142
It runs out of gas too quickly,

628
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:23,517
gets stuck in the mud too easily,

629
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,808
and its sheer size

630
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:26,640
makes it difficult to incorporate

631
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:29,640
in military maneuvers.

632
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:34,640
But where others see an
insurmountable challenge,

633
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:38,640
Patton sees a chance
to prove that his tanks

634
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:42,640
can break the stalemate.

635
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:45,640
I think innovation comes between the ears.

636
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:47,640
It's not about the gizmo.

637
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:50,427
It's about how you think about
using technology and so forth.

638
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,985
You have to give credit
to the people like Patton

639
00:43:52,986 --> 00:43:55,481
that experienced World War I, that had been

640
00:43:55,482 --> 00:44:00,511
thinking about how to employ new things.

641
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:11,986
Narrator: Patton knows the stakes are high.

642
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:14,486
[Explosion]

643
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:19,695
But with his Battalion of tanks,

644
00:44:19,696 --> 00:44:21,985
he's determined to win the war...

645
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:23,320
[Explosion]

646
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:26,363
Or die trying.

647
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,301
Narrator: The global war rages in Europe...

648
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,550
[Gunfire]

649
00:44:34,551 --> 00:44:39,909
As the Allies fight to hold their ground
against Germany and the Central Powers...

650
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:43,666
in the sprawling system of trenches.

651
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:53,165
Things are ugly in World War I.

652
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:56,042
Europe was staggered, exhausted,

653
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,165
many cities in rubble.

654
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:01,165
Starvation and disease were widespread.

655
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,165
You know, the Red Cross
couldn't even keep up

656
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,165
with what was going on.

657
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,680
If you were the Allies in Europe,

658
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:09,891
you needed the reinforcements...

659
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:12,341
The new energy, the new blood.

660
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:21,083
To aid in the fight, the Allies
recruit a new country to their side.

661
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:25,165

Their first major offensive

01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:55,586
and one Allied nation

994
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:59,084
feels completely cut
out of the negotiations.

995
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:02,726
Japan entered the war in 1914,

996
01:06:03,413 --> 01:06:05,523
contributing thousands of troops

997
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:08,024
and millions of dollars to the war effort.

998
01:06:10,524 --> 01:06:13,025
They come to Versailles with one goal:

999
01:06:13,026 --> 01:06:14,691
To be treated equally.

1000
01:06:14,692 --> 01:06:17,524
But Allied leaders completely ignore Japan

1001
01:06:17,525 --> 01:06:20,523
throughout the proceedings,

1002
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:22,523
and for Japan,

1003
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:24,523
it's the ultimate insult.

1004
01:06:24,524 --> 01:06:26,502
The Japanese, who'd
been on the winning side,

1005
01:06:26,503 --> 01:06:29,088
get this slap at the peace conference.

1006
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:33,858
So the Japanese became alienated

1007
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:38,523
from the United States and
from the Western powers,

1008
01:06:38,524 --> 01:06:41,523
and it was a fairly
straight line from there

1009
01:06:41,524 --> 01:06:43,523
to the belief that,

1010
01:06:43,524 --> 01:06:45,662
"if we're gonna get any respect,

1011
01:06:45,663 --> 01:06:48,629
it's going to be by fighting
are way to respect.

1012
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:57,523
Narrator: The attention shifts

1013
01:06:57,524 --> 01:07:00,523
from Wilson's plan for a lasting peace

1014
01:07:00,524 --> 01:07:04,523
to a plan focused on punishing Germany,

1015
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:05,691
forcing them to pay

1016
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:08,523
for the devastation they've caused.

1017
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,523
The reparations that
were demanded of Germany

1018
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:13,524
were astronomical.

1019
01:07:13,525 --> 01:07:15,523
It was a matter of,

1020
01:07:15,524 --> 01:07:18,364
"we're gonna squeeze as much
out of Germany as we can."

1021
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:20,532
Well, there were some on the American side

1022
01:07:20,533 --> 01:07:24,684
who said, "we are making
the next war inevitable."

1023
01:07:24,685 --> 01:07:26,684
Wilson worked against that.

1024
01:07:26,685 --> 01:07:31,186
Wilson wanted a somewhat
more reasonable peace,

1025
01:07:31,187 --> 01:07:35,684
and he wanted the Germans
to feel that they had a stake

1026
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:38,685
in the continuation of
the Versailles system.

1027
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:42,684
The problem with the treaty
as it was finalized was,

1028
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:44,684
Germany had no stake in that system.

1029
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:47,685
It had every interest in
overturning the system.

1030
01:07:47,686 --> 01:07:49,685
Narrator: Despite Wilson's best efforts,

1031
01:07:49,686 --> 01:07:52,684
he is unable to convince the other Allies

1032
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:55,185
to buy into his plan for peace.

1033
01:07:56,685 --> 01:08:00,394
After six months of intense negotiations,

1034
01:08:00,395 --> 01:08:03,185
the Allies finally have a treaty.

1035
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:06,684
But the final agreement

1036
01:08:06,685 --> 01:08:09,684
is far from the fair and equitable plan

1037
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,561
Wilson had originally hoped for.

1038
01:08:12,562 --> 01:08:14,684
The losers, Germany principally,

1039
01:08:14,685 --> 01:08:15,684
they were there.

1040
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:17,684
They didn't get to speak.

1041
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:19,684
They weren't asked to contribute.

1042
01:08:19,685 --> 01:08:21,684
They were basically...

1043
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:24,561
they had a gun put at
their heads figuratively...

1044
01:08:24,562 --> 01:08:25,684
almost literally...

1045
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,684
and said, "you're gonna
sign on the dotted line."

1046
01:08:27,685 --> 01:08:29,852
It was very much a Victor's peace.

1047
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,684
The victors dictated
the terms of the peace.

1048
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:36,185
They made out like bandits.

1049
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:45,684
Narrator: Europe is finally at peace.

1050
01:08:45,685 --> 01:08:49,394
But while most of the world celebrates,

1051
01:08:49,395 --> 01:08:51,321
Germany is ordered to pay the Allies

1052
01:08:51,322 --> 01:08:53,283
over 80 Billion dollars.

1053
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:57,684
The modern equivalent
of nearly 1/2 a trillion dollars,

1054
01:08:57,685 --> 01:09:00,892
a debt they won't pay off until 2010.

1055
01:09:01,435 --> 01:09:03,684
As a result,

1056
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:05,684
the government quickly goes bankrupt,

1057
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:08,185
leaving millions of Germans impoverished.

1058
01:09:12,685 --> 01:09:13,684
The economic devastation

1059
01:09:13,685 --> 01:09:18,185
completely transforms the
country and its people.

1060
01:09:19,685 --> 01:09:21,852
Germany immediately is struggling

1061
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:23,684
with a question of survival.

1062
01:09:23,685 --> 01:09:24,685
For ordinary Germans,

1063
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:27,828
the war did not end in November 1918.

1064
01:09:28,057 --> 01:09:30,137
For ordinary Germans the
battle for survival,

1065
01:09:30,138 --> 01:09:31,684
the daily struggle for food,

1066
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:33,684
the effort to find shoes and clothing

1067
01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:36,185
stretched on into the 1920s.

1068
01:09:37,686 --> 01:09:41,019
Narrator: As the anger
and starvation spread,

1069
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,186
tensions rise throughout the country.

1070
01:09:43,187 --> 01:09:45,186
[Indistinct shouting]

1071
01:09:45,187 --> 01:09:48,684
Germany is in a state of near Civil War.

1072
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,561
The left and the right

1073
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,394
are fighting with each
other in the streets.

1074
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:54,186
Paramilitary groups clash.

1075
01:09:54,187 --> 01:09:58,185
Germany is a country
divided against itself.

1076
01:10:01,685 --> 01:10:05,684
When World War I came to an end,

1077
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:08,382
this is not a treaty.

1078
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:12,883
This is an armistice that'll
probably last 20 years...

1079
01:10:15,718 --> 01:10:19,760
Meaning we have not really
defeated the German spirit.

1080
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:25,883
We have not really solved this problem.

1081
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:37,608
Narrator: With the fighting stopped,

1082
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:41,109
the treaty for peace
is signed at Versailles.

1083
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:44,608
[Cheers and applause]

1084
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:47,608
And for the first time in over four years,

1085
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:51,318
Europe is at peace.

1086
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:54,608
While celebrations erupt around the world,

1087
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:58,110
Germany is in a state of unrest,

1088
01:10:58,111 --> 01:11:02,109
and many are convinced
that the peace won't hold.

1089
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:13,109
Among them is Winston Churchill.

1090
01:11:14,944 --> 01:11:18,110
Having just returned to
England from the front lines,

1091
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:21,776
he sets out to reestablish
his political career,

1092
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:26,318
narrowly winning reelection
to his old seat in parliament.

1093
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:28,608
There were a lot of doubts about Churchill.

1094
01:11:28,609 --> 01:11:31,318
He seemed erratic in his judgments.

1095
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:33,943
His decision in respect
to the Gallipoli campaign

1096
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:37,608
had disastrous consequences.

1097
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:41,110
But it was in war that he proved
his leadership credentials,

1098
01:11:41,111 --> 01:11:44,609
and that's what transformed him.

1099
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,608
Narrator: Churchill returns to government

1100
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:50,444
convinced the German
threat hasn't gone away.

[Whistle blowing intermittently]

Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur

one man sees the end of fighting

1127

as an opportunity.

as a newspaper journalist.

is now in disarray.

1132
01:13:08,944 --> 01:13:11,608
The Italians came out of
the war on the winning side

1133
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:15,608
but failed to gain the territory
they had expected to gain,

1134
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:18,608
and there's a sense of outrage about this

1135
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:19,943
amongst Italian nationalists,

1136
01:13:19,944 --> 01:13:23,608
a sense almost that Italy has lost the war

despite being on the winning side.

1138

Narrator: Mussolini uses his newspaper

1139
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:32,110
to convey his view of a new Italy,

1140

that under a strong leader
the country can regain

existing institutions.

1155
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:25,109
He favored the use of violence to do this.

1156
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:30,608
Narrator: To make his vision a reality,

1157
01:14:30,609 --> 01:14:35,485
Mussolini forms a band of
disgruntled former soldiers

1158
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:37,608
called the Blackshirts

1159
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:41,608
who terrorize his political opponents

1160
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:45,109
and begin preparing
for an armed revolution.

1161
01:14:46,609 --> 01:14:47,608
In a matter of months,

1162
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,608
Mussolini has launched a movement

1163
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:54,109
that is about to change the fate of Italy.

1164
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:08,608
Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler.

1165
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:10,608
Sir.

1166
01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:13,608
Sit down.

1167
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,608
- So you're looking for work.
- Yes, sir.

1168
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:16,608
I am ready for duty.

1169
01:15:16,609 --> 01:15:18,609
I understand.

1170
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:22,608
Unfortunately, I have nothing.

1171
01:15:22,609 --> 01:15:23,608
Nothing?

1172
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:25,608
There is no work.

1173
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:28,608
The war is over.

1174
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:32,608
There has to be something.

1175
01:15:32,609 --> 01:15:36,109
After all I've done,
after all I've given...

1176
01:15:39,777 --> 01:15:42,608
There is a new political group in town:

1177
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:44,609
The German Workers' party.

1178
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:47,608
We need to find out more about them

1179
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:50,608
and what their intentions are.

1180
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:54,109
- Yes, sir.
- Try to not stand out.

1181
01:16:00,488 --> 01:16:02,608
The Versailles Treaty caused
the economic conditions

1182
01:16:02,609 --> 01:16:06,608
which gave rise to extremism.

1183
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:09,608
You find in history that
when an economy is terrible,

1184
01:16:09,609 --> 01:16:11,608
it gives rise to all kinds

1185
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:16,109
of different extremist organizations.

1186
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,608
Narrator: Hitler is assigned to infiltrate

1187
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:26,943
the German Workers' party,

1188
01:16:26,944 --> 01:16:29,608
one of many anti-government organizations

1189
01:16:29,609 --> 01:16:32,109
that have formed in the wake of the treaty.

1190
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:35,110
[Door creaks]

1191
01:16:38,609 --> 01:16:42,110
For months, he attends secret meetings

1192
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:45,110
held at undisclosed locations
throughout the country.

1193
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:49,819
They signed away our army.

1194
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:55,109
The Versailles Treaty is not my treaty.

1195
01:16:56,609 --> 01:16:58,608
It was as if nothing had happened,

1196
01:16:58,609 --> 01:17:03,109
as if we are forgotten.

1197
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:07,608
Narrator: But Hitler soon realizes

1198
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:09,608
they are radical nationalists

1199
01:17:09,609 --> 01:17:12,608
intensely loyal to the fatherland,

1200
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:15,484
and many of them harbor extremist views

1201
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:17,496
of German superiority.

1202
01:17:18,609 --> 01:17:22,110
Views that are no different from his own.

1203
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:24,608
There was never really an effort

1204
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:26,608
to deal with all the damage

1205
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:29,109
that had occurred during World War I.

1206
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:34,318
The failure to do that

1207
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:36,608
I think is what ultimately
produced the seeds

1208
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:40,110
for Hitler and Nazism.

1209
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:45,110
Germany as a whole is dead.

1210
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:50,109
It has nothing left in its heart.

1211
01:17:51,609 --> 01:17:54,608
There are riots on the streets.

1212
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:58,109
There is no Germany left to fight for.

1213
01:17:59,486 --> 01:18:03,110
Germany must break apart.

1214
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,608
It is only through this
that we can survive.

1215
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:08,609
No Germany?

1216
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:11,608
Yes, there's nothing left to fight for.

1217
01:18:11,609 --> 01:18:13,608
"There's nothing left to fight for"

1218
01:18:13,609 --> 01:18:15,609
are the famous last words of every turncoat

1219
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:18,776
in the history of warfare.

1220
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:22,608
The weak among us turn to such excuses

1221
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:24,608
and abandon our pride and hope

1222
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:26,318
when it is only unity

1223
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:28,611
that separates the
victors from the defeated.

1224
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:32,608
Clearly you have stopped fighting.

1225
01:18:32,609 --> 01:18:36,608
But we are still fighting
Germany's great war, our war,

1226
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:39,608
for what we deserve:

1227
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:42,318
A united Germany,

1228
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:45,109
a strong, proud Germany.

1229
01:18:45,609 --> 01:18:49,608
Germany is a sleeping giant,

1230
01:18:49,609 --> 01:18:51,608
and once we rid our nation

1231
01:18:51,609 --> 01:18:53,609
of the spineless frauds among us

1232
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:55,776
and alongside the criminals of Versailles,

1233
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:59,608
we will once again know greatness.

1234
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:03,109
[Applause]

1235
01:19:27,955 --> 01:19:31,954
Narrator: After four years of war,

1236
01:19:31,955 --> 01:19:33,954
a tenuous peace holds.

1237
01:19:33,955 --> 01:19:36,954
[Birds cawing]

1238
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:40,455
But anger and resentment are spreading...

1239
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:45,716
and shots are about to be fired again.

1240
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:49,623
[Applause]

1241
01:19:57,955 --> 01:20:01,954
Adolf Hitler leaves the German army

1242
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:03,954
to fully devote himself

1243
01:20:03,955 --> 01:20:06,455
to the anti-government Workers Party.

1244
01:20:07,955 --> 01:20:10,954
Our Germany is dead,
and you have conspired...

1245
01:20:10,955 --> 01:20:13,954
Narrator: His popularity and fiery rhetoric

1246
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:15,954
make him stand out in the group.

1247
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:18,954
You have bled her with your corruption.

1248
01:20:18,955 --> 01:20:22,400
Narrator: And he's promoted
to the head of propaganda.

1249
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:30,954
We will call ourselves the
National Socialist Party!

1250
01:20:30,955 --> 01:20:33,954
[Cheers and applause]

1251
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:35,954
Narrator: Under Hitler's leadership,

1252
01:20:35,955 --> 01:20:37,954
membership in the National Socialist Party

1253
01:20:37,955 --> 01:20:40,573
quickly expands

1254
01:20:40,955 --> 01:20:45,077
as Hitler experiences his
first taste of real power.

1255
01:20:49,955 --> 01:20:51,954
There are many reports from fairly early on

1256
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:54,954
about Hitler's charisma as a speaker,

1257
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:57,954
and he gradually came to realize

1258
01:20:57,955 --> 01:21:00,954
that he was indeed a powerful speaker...

1259
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:02,955
far more powerful than
anyone else around...

1260
01:21:02,956 --> 01:21:07,954
and began to use that as an asset.

1261
01:21:07,955 --> 01:21:10,954
Narrator: To cast all
Germany under his spell,

1262
01:21:10,955 --> 01:21:11,954
Hitler needs an image

1263
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:15,954
that will burn into the minds of millions.

1264
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,954
Nowadays we'd call it a logo of course.

1265
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:19,955
It was designed personally by Hitler,

1266
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:21,954
and it may be that he put

1267
01:21:21,955 --> 01:21:24,954
some of his artistic impulses into this.

1268
01:21:24,955 --> 01:21:28,954
The essential part of it
ultimately went back to India,

1269
01:21:28,955 --> 01:21:33,954
but it was taken up as a symbol
of racism and anti-semitism

1270
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:35,954
combined with the red
background for socialism

1271
01:21:35,955 --> 01:21:37,954
and the red, white, and black colors

1272
01:21:37,955 --> 01:21:40,455
for the old Kaiser Reich.

1273
01:21:58,754 --> 01:22:02,954
Narrator: While Hitler is still in
the early stages of his revolution,

1274
01:22:02,955 --> 01:22:07,954
Benito Mussolini has already
amassed an army of followers

1275
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:11,455
and is ready to take Italy by force.

1276
01:22:18,955 --> 01:22:22,571
For seven days in October of 1922

1277
01:22:22,572 --> 01:22:26,071
in a massive show of his popularity.

1278
01:22:27,955 --> 01:22:32,957
Mussolini leads a march of
30,000 Blackshirts into Rome.

1279
01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:35,954
With the people behind him,

1280
01:22:35,955 --> 01:22:39,954
Mussolini and the Blackshirts
storm the Royal Palace,

1281
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:44,455
forcing the King of Italy to hand
over control of the government.

1282
01:22:46,955 --> 01:22:50,954
Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922.

1283
01:22:50,955 --> 01:22:53,954
His successful march on Rome

1284
01:22:53,955 --> 01:22:59,954
was eased by the process of
expanding ego and adulation

1285
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:02,954
by the people around Mussolini

1286
01:23:02,955 --> 01:23:04,954
and then eventually most
of the public opinion

1287
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:07,455
in the country.

1288
01:23:08,955 --> 01:23:12,455
This is a dangerous process.

1289
01:23:14,832 --> 01:23:15,954
Narrator: In just months,

1290
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:18,954
Mussolini has been transformed
from newspaper journalist

1291
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:22,455
to the most powerful man in Italy.

1292
01:23:27,955 --> 01:23:30,954
600 miles to the north,

1293
01:23:30,955 --> 01:23:35,831
Adolf Hitler is watching
everything Mussolini has done,

1294
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:40,455
and he wants that same
ultimate power for himself.

1295
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:43,455
So he amasses an army of his own.

1296
01:23:44,955 --> 01:23:47,664
Hitler does seem early to have been

1297
01:23:47,665 --> 01:23:49,715
very impressed by Mussolini

1298
01:23:49,716 --> 01:23:51,954
and indeed by the march on Rome.

1299
01:23:51,955 --> 01:23:53,949
His rise to power was modeled on what

1300
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:56,885
the Italian Fascists had done in Italy.

1301
01:23:57,734 --> 01:24:00,644
On November 8, 1923,

1302
01:24:00,955 --> 01:24:05,954
Hitler leads the Nazis
into a Munich beer hall

1303
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:08,455
where top government officials are meeting.

and you have conspired to kill her!

You have crushed her
with your incompetence.

1309
