1
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,435
Here it is, gentlemen. The big problem.

2
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,318
13-13 Experimental Battery.

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,949
I can tell you now,
we've had orders to solve it from the top seat.

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,996
You mean WC?

5
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,389
WC. The top seat.

6
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,476
As you know, we've tried everything.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,711
Brilliance, outstanding personality,
sheer naked courage.

8
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,631
The time has come to try something else.

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,076
- Oh? And what's that, sir?
- Sheer bloody ignorance.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,475
How long are you going to be, then... sir?

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,950
How long? When one is sent for
by one's brigadier

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,670
to discuss a mission which is so hush-hush
that even oneself doesn't know what it is,

13
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,673
- one might be hours.
- Permission to pop down the NAAFI, sir.

14
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,116
- I beg your pardon?
- Permission to pop down the NAAFI, sir.

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,556
Corporal, the enemy is poised
to strike across the Channel.

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,679
The country is fighting for its life
and you want to pop down the NAAFI?

17
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,036
- Well, in that case, I'll forget it.
- I'm very pleased to hear it.

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,076
I beg your pardon... sir.

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,510
Who are you, and what the devil are you doing?

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,556
Captain Melly reporting, sir.

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,234
Brush yourself down!
Follow me to the conference room.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,429
(Horn honks)

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,035
(Insistent honking)
- All right! All right! Why the bloody fanfare?

24
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,350
Watch it, mate. New commanding officer.

25
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,112
Blimey!

26
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,399
Corporal... that man. He was wearing lipstick.

27
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,436
Lipstick, sir? Where?

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,592
- On his face. Where do you think?
- It must be a burn or a scar, sir.

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,274
- I hope you're right.
- So do I.

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,670
Frilly curtains? Baskets of flowers?

31
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,273
- <i>Brassieres?</i>
- <i>Pardon, sir?</i>

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,749
- Knickers!
- Same to you... sir.

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,230
(Belches)

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,716
- Captain Melly.
- No, you must have come to the wrong place.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,472
My name's Bull.

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,596
No, no. <i>I'm</i> Melly. S Melly.

37
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
Pity. Have a drink.

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,277
Now, look here, Bull. I'm your relief.

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,113
- <i>And there are certain things that...</i>
- My relief?

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,668
Oh, you little beauty!

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
I could kiss you!

42
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,238
My re! Oooh, my relief!

43
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,312
I've got to go. My relief...

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,960
He actually kissed me!

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,719
(Engine fires up)
- My case!

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,472
(Car accelerates)
- I say!

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,278
<i>My case!</i>

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,638
(Belches)

49
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,195
(Shouts)
Welcome to 13-13 Anti-Aircraft Battery, sir!

50
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,676
All right.

51
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,320
Sergeant Major Bloomer, sir.
"Tiger" to the troops.

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,958
I can do that!

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,792
- Sergeant Major Bloomer, do you think?
- Sir?

54
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,438
- Get inside.
- Me, sir?

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,751
- Yes, <i>you,</i> sir! Get inside at the double!
- Hargh!

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,273
Drop your trousers!

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,432
But, sir, we has only just met.

58
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,512
Drop 'em! That's an order!

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,794
Hah!

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,670
- I see.
- Do you, sir?

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,837
Sergeant Major, may I ask you a question?

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,037
Sir, may I pull up my trousers?

63
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,509
What? Oh, yes. Yes. Get 'em up.

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,556
What I want to know is...

65
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,838
what men in this unit would wear
the kind of underwear I've seen on the line?

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,717
Good Lord!

67
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,756
Some of them are wearing skirts too!

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,956
They is not men, sir.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,996
Well, what the blazes are they?

70
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,516
Women, sir.

71
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,636
You mean, <i>female?</i>

72
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,757
Yes, sir. Was sir not told, sir?

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,991
This is one of these new mixed batteries.

74
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,756
So, that's what the brigadier meant when
he said that this battery was an experiment.

75
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,718
Experiment, sir?
They does not need to experiment.

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,712
They gets at it right away and all the time.

77
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,958
(Chattering)

78
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,716
All right, then. Section, halt.

79
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,150
Oh, come on! Come on. Put each other down.

80
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,117
(Moaning)

81
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,156
Hang about! Hang about!

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,471
We don't want to give our new CO
the right idea, do we?

83
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,709
(Laughter)

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,915
Right, right turn.

85
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,870
- What's next?
- Right dress, Leonard.

86
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,837
Oh, yeah. Er... right dress.

87
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,232
Two inches shorter
and he could see right up my skirt!

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
- What's your name, Sergeant?
- Willing, sir.

89
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,236
- And yours?
- Able, sir.

90
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,993
Well, Willing and Able, will you kindly tell me

91
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,119
why it is necessary for you all
to be squashed up like sardines in a tin?

92
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,270
It's just our way of keeping warm, sir.

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,316
On the hottest day of the year?

94
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,470
We've known it hotter than this, sir.

95
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,997
Dress properly! What do you think this is?
A love parade?

96
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,038
Hee-hee-hee! Very witty, sir.

97
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,793
You speak when you're spoken to.
Do you hear me?

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,758
Adjust your dress!

99
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,036
No, no, no! One arm's length apart.

100
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,317
- Did you demonstrate this, Sergeant Major?
- Frequently, sir!

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,356
- Then do it again on me.
- Hah!

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,516
Parade. Doing as I do!

103
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,909
Right dress!

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,594
As you were. Watch me. Watch me!
Right dress!

105
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,190
Doing as I do! As you were! As you were!

106
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,317
Did you not you see what I was doing?
Right dress! As you were!

107
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,836
Not as they were.
Leave them as they are, Sergeant Major.

108
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,229
But, sir, as they are is horrible, sir!

109
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,153
You're ruining my shoulder, Sergeant.

110
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,196
Sorry, sir.

111
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,236
It comes of gripping balls, sir.

112
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,675
- Eh?
- Always has one of these to hand, sir.

113
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,470
- Fingers of steel, sir. Fingers of steel.
- Put it away. Let's get on with the inspection.

114
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,474
You up there, what's your name?

115
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,516
Oh, erm... Ready, sir.

116
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,352
Ready.

117
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,829
Ready, Willing and Able.

118
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,275
- This is ridiculous!
- (Mumbles)

119
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,788
- What <i>are</i> you doing?
- Twitching, sir!

120
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,156
I can see that, Sergeant Major,
but <i>why</i> is he twitching?

121
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,196
(Mumbles)

122
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,276
It's my woor-uhhhhh...

123
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,828
Woorghhhh! It's my nerves, sir.

124
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,876
Trying to twitch your ticket, eh?

125
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,635
Well, it won't work, Bombardier.
You're in the Army for the duration.

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,676
Twitch your way out of that!

127
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,478
Oohhh... eerrrggh!

128
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,755
- Ready!
- (Screams)

129
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,796
Twitch off!

130
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,791
It's wasted on me, boy.

131
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,836
Good Lord!

132
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,836
Good heavens!

133
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,388
Good man. And what's your name?

134
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,358
Shorthouse. Gunner Shorthouse, sir.
It's my name.

135
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,196
And what is your name, my man?

136
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,236
Er... woman?

137
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,199
Jennifer Ffoukes Sharpe, sir.
The Sharpe with an E and two Fs in the Ffoukes.

138
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,474
How do you do?

139
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,278
(Fingers crunch)

140
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,590
She too is a ball squeezer, sir.

141
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,116
Do your shoelace up
and look sharp about it, Sharpe!

142
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,275
(Snarls)

143
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,828
- Ooooh!
- Oh, Tiger!

144
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,876
I think you're wonderful.

145
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,633
When are you going to savage me?

146
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,075
If only you was a man, I would sort you out!

147
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,876
Well... you seem to have put your foot in it.

148
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,157
Not so much my foot, sir. More my big toe.

149
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,673
What's wrong with it?

150
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,196
Sprained it, sir, didn't I?
When I... erm... fell out of bed.

151
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,113
- Pushed out of bed more like!
- Pushed out?

152
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,634
- (Both giggle)
- What are you laughing at?

153
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,274
Well, I'm happy, sir.

154
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,113
Happy? What, here?

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,351
He might have sprained something else,
mightn't he?

156
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,640
- Are you trying to be funny, Gunner?
- Me, sir?

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,995
You, sir. Why are you blinking like that?

158
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,753
- I'm not blinking, sir. You are.
- I never blink.

159
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,195
- Neither do I, sir.
- You blinking well do!

160
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,955
Sergeant Major, which one of us two
is blinking here?

161
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,874
There is only one blinking man blinking here,
Gunner, and that's bloody <i>you!</i>

162
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,518
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

163
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,479
And if I catch you again on parade
wearing my moustache... that moustache,

164
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,074
you'll be on charge for impersonating an officer.

165
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,109
Ooooh!

166
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,997
Later, sir. Later.

167
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,075
Who are you?

168
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,358
- Easy, sir.
- Quite possibly. What's your name?

169
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,635
That is it, sir. Alice Easy.

170
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,119
Oh.

171
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
Well, do your top button up.

172
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,796
I can't. They won't let me.

173
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,474
- Who? Who won't let you?
- Them.

174
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,988
Oh, nonsense. Do 'em up... erm... it up.

175
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,632
Good gracious me!
Stand to attention, you're on parade!

176
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,312
Put those shoulders back!

177
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,198
Oh, I do hope you're regular, sir.

178
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,236
Regular?

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,959
- I've been regular for 18 years.
- Oh, good.

180
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,271
- That means I can have it back tomorrow.
- (Swallows hard)

181
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,954
- You'll have it back when I'm ready.
- That's all right.

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,190
No need to strain yourself.

183
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,240
You are a shower!

184
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,714
A shambling shower!

185
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,031
And I mean to shake you up
more than somewhat!

186
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,076
- Sergeant Major?
- Hah!

187
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,914
Dismiss this shambling shower from my sight.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,149
Hah!

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,595
Parade! Right turn!

190
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,636
As you were! As you were!

191
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,631
You stupid f...

192
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,077
<i>How is I expected to use the proper words</i>
<i>with women present?</i>

193
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,116
Never mind. Never mind.

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,236
Just f...

195
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,594
Forget it.

196
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,311
Go away.

197
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,036
(Stomach gurgles)

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,839
Ah, yes, sir. They gives me a headache too.

199
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,071
It's not a headache. It's the stomach.
There's a button in it.

200
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,436
What you might now call a belly button, sir.
Hee-hee hee-hee!

201
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,476
Oh, shut up!

202
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,109
20 year I've been a sergeant major
and nobody told me to shut up before.

203
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,430
I is the person what tells people to shut up, sir...

204
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,351
- Shut up!
- Hah!

205
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,436
Now, Sergeant Major,

206
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,275
what, in your opinion, is the thing most
calculated to make things hot for this shower?

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,752
Well?

208
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,315
What's the matter with you, man?
Have you been struck dumb?

209
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,152
- I asked you a question.
- Sir.

210
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,755
- Have I got permission to break the silence?
- Of course you have.

211
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,479
Very well, sir. Kindly repeat the question.

212
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,112
I repeat, what in your opinion, is the thing most
calculated to make things hot for this shower?

213
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,350
- Only one thing in my book, sir.
- Yes. Yes.

214
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,079
- Firing squad.
- Ah, yes. That's it.

215
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,474
What sort of a suggestion is that,
Sergeant Major?

216
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,199
The only one I has to offer.
I has tried everything else.

217
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,751
Well, thank you. That's been a great help.
I shall have to think for both of us.

218
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,196
I've got it.

219
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,829
- We're going to have an air raid.
- My God, sir! They <i>will</i> panic.

220
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,115
- This is just a practice.
- They'll still panic.

221
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,156
Yes, they will, won't they?

222
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,196
- The wind.
- Not me, sir.

223
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,070
No, Sergeant Major. The wind is what you
and me are going to put up them.

224
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,878
(Burps)

225
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,633
- Gives me the wind just to look at it.
- Leonard...

226
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,438
- What?
- I've got this feeling.

227
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,829
There's a time and a place for everything.

228
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,151
- Not <i>that</i> kind of feeling.
- I didn't know you had any other.

229
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,356
No! Listen!

230
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,830
I've got this feeling that that new bloke's
going to make trouble for us.

231
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,673
That pipsqueaker?
He's too little to be awkward.

232
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,116
Squash him into the ground.
Not worried about him.

233
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,156
I'm more worried about this.

234
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,438
- Do we eat it or rub it in?
- You can bounce it off the ceiling for all I care.

235
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,956
Right, Sergeant Major.
They should be starting on their pudding.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,911
Now! Now, Sergeant Major!

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,752
- Sir?
- I said now.

238
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,796
- There is no need to shout, sir.
- What?

239
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,872
- There's no need to shout!
- What are you mumbling about?

240
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,996
- There's no need to shout!
- Who is?

241
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,593
- I said now!
- Hah!

242
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,797
(Air raid siren wails)

243
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,236
Here. What's that?

244
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,437
- No, it can't be.
- It can't be what?

245
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,398
- What I think it is.
- What do you think it is?

246
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,914
It's an air raid.

247
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,030
ABLE: Get a move on!

248
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,871
I'll say one thing for them, Sergeant Major...

249
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,916
they certainly know how to run.

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,959
Oh, yes, indeed, sir. Of course,
they is running in the wrong direction.

251
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,396
- What?
- The gun emplacement is over there, sir.

252
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,155
- Well, why are they running that way, then?
- Air raid shelter, sir.

253
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,471
- They built it. They calls it the snoggery.
- I don't care.

254
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,836
There's an air raid on.
This is an anti-aircraft battery unit!

255
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,876
Is it?

256
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,916
(Whines like an attacking bomber)

257
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,475
Rat-a-tat tat! Rat-a-tat tat!

258
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,869
(Aeroplane attacks)

259
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,916
(Aeroplane fires)

260
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,956
Bang!

261
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,474
MELLY: <i>Bang!</i>

262
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,958
I could have sworn someone said "bang".

263
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,555
Oh, Leonard. Ooh, what a lovely idea.

264
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,075
(Laughs) Lovely.

265
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,469
I said bang!

266
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,235
You heard what the officer said,
you horrible shower! He said bang.

267
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,436
Don't you realise there's an air raid on?

268
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,829
(Stammers)

269
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,273
Course we do.

270
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,759
Well, then?

271
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,674
Well, you shouldn't be out in it. Come in here
with us, sir. There's plenty of room.

272
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,513
Yes, do join us, Tiger.

273
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,876
I'm not coming in there.
<i>You</i> are coming out here.

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,554
With an air raid on? There's ladies present.

275
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,359
- You can't have them out in an air raid.
- No, you can't.

276
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,398
There is no air raid.

277
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,233
- B-B-But you said there was.
- It's a mock air raid.

278
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,311
ALL: Oooh!

279
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,914
I mocked it and you made a mockery of it!

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,437
That's nice, isn't it? You're having a mockery
while we're having our grub.

281
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,796
- I was just enjoying my spotted dick.
- Yeah.

282
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,110
Shut up!

283
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,112
All right. Carry on, Sergeant Major.

284
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,668
- Carry on what, sir?
- Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

285
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,478
Sir.

286
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,755
- (Captain Melly mutters)
BLOOMER: <i>Right!</i>

287
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,230
Get outside on the double!
Move yourselves! Move yourselves!

288
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,276
Get the lead out of your pants!

289
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,839
Knickers, Tiger. Knickers.

290
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,353
<i>What?</i>

291
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,873
Ladies wear knickers.

292
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,509
Pants or knickers, shift your ar...

293
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,397
What's inside 'em.

294
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,359
Now, look...
20 years I've worn this crown on my sleeve.

295
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,590
(All hum sad tune)

296
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,990
You wouldn't like to be the cause of me losing it,
would you?

297
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,594
<i>I mean, after all that... serving...</i>

298
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,240

Oh, Tiger...

300
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,348
You all heard what the sergeant major said!
All out! Or I'll break you in two.

301
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,631
BLOOMER: <i>In two lines. Move yourselves.</i>
<i>Move yourselves!</i>

<i>Come on! Come on! Come on!</i>

303
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,718
Now, you dozy lot,

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,191
when I say "man the gun",
I want you to double off to the emplacement.

305
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,999
Now, man the gun!

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,716
(Whispers)

307
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,792
Oh, for heaven's sake. All right.
Woman the gun as well.

Load!

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,958
It's a gun, sir.

314
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,632
It's made of wood.

315
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,278
It's not a real gun yet, sir.

316
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,834
A gun emplacement without a real gun?

317
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,388
With respect, sir. Remember there's a war on.

318
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,436
Real guns is hard to come by.

319
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,193
Permission to carry on with the gun drill. Fire!

320
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,554
Bang!

321
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,629
What the devil's going on now?

322
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,154
We're dead, sir. A round exploded in the breach.

323
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,708
It's the ammunition we're being sent.

324
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,552
(Melly farts)

325
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,596
- Anything wrong, sir?
- (Farts again)

326
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,719
- You've gone white.
- It's that damn button.

327
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,155
Are you taken short, sir?

328
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,471
(Stomach gurgles)
Keep your voice down, Sergeant Major.

329
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,118
(Stomach gurgles)

330
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,833
You just carry on doing
whatever it is you're doing.

331
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,469
(Melly farts loudly)
- No.2 detachment, take post!

332
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,236
(Melly farts continuously)
BLOOMER: <i>Go to bearing 90-2E-20!</i>

333
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,876
(Toilet flushes)

334
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,749
BLOOMER: <i>Halt!</i>

335
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,549
<i>Now, this time, just for me, let us get it right!</i>

336
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,195
Parade... dis-miss!

337
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,473
That was lovely. Good. Thank you very much.

338
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,516
Get out of my sight!

339
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,075
That includes you, Ffoukes Sharpe! Look sharp!

340
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,431
Silly boy.

341
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,915
Aarrghh!

342
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,269
You may not frighten the enemy,
Sergeant Major,

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,954
but, by heaven, you certainly frighten me.

344
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,032
It's not my fault, sir. That was hers.

345
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,993
- It was entirely hers, sir.
- What are you talking about? Whose fault?

346
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,548
(Mouths) Oh, Tiger.

347
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,316
Private Ffoukes Sharpe, sir... is after me.

348
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,628
After you? What for?

349
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,349
- She has designs on me, sir.
- Get this bloody thing off me!

350
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,317
Sir!

351
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,830
- Oh, I sees your predicament, sir.
- And I <i>feel</i> it. Get it off!

352
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,876
Steady, sir. Resist me.

353
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,918
Resist me, sir.

354
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,558
You is not resisting.

355
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,949
Pulling out.

356
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,508
Sergeant Major, we're getting nowhere fast.

357
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,036
Perhaps you should er... clench your cheeks, sir.

358
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,031
They are clenched.

359
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,156
That is true, sir. Forward march.

360
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,799
Right. Clench the table, sir.

361
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,838
Now, grit your teeth
and we will have it off in a minute.

362
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,275
A bit of leverage.

363
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,270
Aaaaahh!

364
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,038
Brace yourself, sir.

365
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,110
Is it off?

366
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,191
- Can't you feel the difference, sir?
- No.

367
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,236
It must be your bum is numb.

368
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,236
Permission to un-numb bum, sir.

369
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,276
Get on with it!

370
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,634
Aarrghh!

371
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,030
That will soon bring the blood back
to your cheeks, sir.

372
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,793
Cruel to be kind, sir. Cruel to be kind.

373
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,348
If you're going to talk about
being cruel to be kind,

374
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,989
you may as well know,
that as far as that shower outside is concerned,

375
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,036
that I intend to be cruel to be cruel!

376
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,629
- I is very worried, sir.
- <i>You</i> is very worried.

377
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,952
- I is worried about you, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant Major. Very decent.

378
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,032
I think you is going to cause trouble
and they will not like it.

379
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,079
The likes and dislikes of the men
under my command are neither here nor there!

380
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,630
Sir, if you does not know
the difference between here nor there,

381
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,473
you does not know the difference
between men and women.

382
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,516
Some of the men in this camp is women.

383
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,512
They are all men to me.

384
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,433
Oooh, I wish they was, sir. I wish they was.

385
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,988
I'd have them saluting till their arms dropped off.

386
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,517
I'd run them till their legs dropped off
and I'd rant and roar till their ears dropped off!

387
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,118
As from tomorrow, I intend to start a series
of what I call my agony parades.

388
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,638
In that case, sir, tomorrow morning, the only
parade you is likely to see is sick parade.

389
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,832
(Trumpet fanfare)

390
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,350
- Right. Who's first?
- A-a-a-a-a!

391
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,000
- What do you think these are, Nurse?
- Come on, then.

392
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,036
Oh! Oh, Nurse.

393
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,270
Oh, Nurse. I need assistance.

394
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,318
Oooh! Oh. Oh!

395
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,715
All right. Drop your trousers.

396
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,997
But, sir, it's my ears, my nose, my throat...

397
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,993
- My throat and my knees. My feet... oooohh!
- I'll be the judge of that. Drop 'em.

398
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,840
Nurse, two aspirins, please.

399
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,430
Right. Next!

400
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,594
Here, Shaw. What did he say to you?

401
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,355
He said, "Drop your trousers,"
had a look and gave me two aspirins.

402
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,877
What sort of a doctor's he? Here we are
pretending we've got different complaints...

403
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,269
Hey, Shorthouse, what did he say to you?

404
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,510
He said, "Drop your trousers," had a look...

405
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,751
- And he gave you two aspirins.
- No, he gave me half an aspirin.

406
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,479
- All right, drop your trousers.
- Aaaerrhhee!

407
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,279
I was... (Stammers incoherently)

408
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,396
Haabbeeerrr!

409
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,358
Have you noticed
anything strange about me, sir?

410
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,318
Yes, you haven't dropped your trousers.
Two aspirins, Nurse.

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,356
Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

412
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,910
Hey, he told me to drop my trousers
and he gave me two of these...

413
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,956
aschooo... sprins!

414
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,070
All right. Drop 'em.

415
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,159
Nurse, two aspirins, please.

416
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,309
- Where are they?
- They is all sick, sir.

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,789
- All of them?
- I told sir so, did not I, sir?

418
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,632
Hee-hee hee-hee!

419
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,473
Well, never mind. I've had a word with the MO.

420
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,950
Those are my orders.

421
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,077
Right, Sergeant Major.
Let them know that we're here.

422
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,630
13-13 Battery, get on parade!

423
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,875
I want you to run them into the ground.

424
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,916
What about the females, sir?

425
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,673
As far as I'm concerned, this is a unit.
One piece.

426
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,910
My duty is to make it an efficient unit.

427
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,231
I am unaware of males or females.
To me, they're all alike.

428
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,959
They are the same. Right, Sergeant Major?

429
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,314
Give 'em hell.

430
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,870
Ah-haaah! Come on!

431
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,718
BLOOMER: <i>That is not the way!</i>

432
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,556
That is not the way.
When one of your comrades is a short arse,

433
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,509
like Shorthouse here, a taller man
climbs up on him. Down, Shorthouse.

434
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,876
- But, Sergeant Major.
- Do not "but, Sergeant Major" me!

435
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,916
Get down. Watch me.

436
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,558
Right. Steady. Up!

437
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,556
Give me your hand!

438
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,357
Now, pay attention.

439
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,715
You cannot go under the wire.

440
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,552
You has to go over the wire,

441
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,838
which means that one of you
has to lie on top of the wire

442
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,195
and let the rest of them walk over him.

443
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,196
Right. One volunteer.

444
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,032
- You!
- Me?

445
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,076
Move yourself!

446
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,439
That is not the way. That is not the way! Fall out.

447
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,475
Move yourself!

448
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,516
Watch me. Watch me. Haarrgghh!

449
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,120
Charge!

450
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,596
Next.

451
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,909
No, no, no, no, no! That is not the way.

452
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,956
You must not stop to think.

453
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,591
- Are you sure this rope's safe, Sergeant Major?
- Safe? Of course it's safe. Watch me.

454
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,596
(Tarzan call)

455
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,276
Well done, Sergeant Major.

456
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,590
Fingers of steel, boy. Fingers of steel.

457
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,316
Right.

458
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,356
Right, Gunner. Your turn now.

459
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,679
(Squeals of laughter)

460
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,596
Drown the lot of you.

461
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,796
Sergeant Major...

462
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,075
- Yes, ungrateful...
(Door opens)

463
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,636
Come on, Sergeant Major. Wake up.

464
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,676
On your feet...

465
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,069
I'm talking to you, Sergeant Major!

466
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,197
- Sergeant Major!
- What are you up to, boy?

467
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,312
- Come on!
- Serge... Sergeant Major!

468
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,476
- Oh, it's you, sir.
- God!

469
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,476
Have you gone mad, Sergeant Major?

470
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,835
You sort of walked into my nightmare, sir.

471
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,354
I thought you were short arse, sir. I'm sorry.

472
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,516
And so you damn well should be, man.

473
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,035
- You dropped your hat, sir.
- Where is it?

474
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,076
Right, Sergeant Major.

475
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,790
Sergeant Major, now you're on your feet,
I'm going to blast their blasted evening.

476
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,270
- What have you got in mind, sir?
- A surprise kit inspection.

477
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,316
Men's hut first.

478
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,356
# Tango

479
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,990
- Get those pants down.
- Not bloody likely.

480
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,676
# Tango

481
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,519
- Having a musical soiree, are they?
- Sounds more like a tango, sir.

482
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,556
Oh, come on, Sergeant Major.

483
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,711
Aarrghh!

484
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,078
Enemy approaching.

485
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,754
Operation Scarper!

486
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,673
You is covered in shh... something distasteful.

487
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,911
- I'm aware of that.
- Are you going to change or what, sir?

488
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,956
I mean, there's... a bit of a pong.

489
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,436
Sergeant Major, when I start something,
I go through with it,

490
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,476
come hell and high water!

491
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,516
And whatever this is.

492
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,673
Tell them I'm here!

493
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,709
Commanding officer!

494
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,395
Your nostrils, Sergeant.

495
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,472
My nostrils, sir?

496
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,915
They're twitching.

497
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,039
It's like, suddenly, there's a funny sort of smell
come into the hut, sir.

498
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,355
Why do you think that is, Sergeant?

499
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,000
Well, it's like suddenly...

500
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,310
someone's come in who's covered with sh...

501
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,999
Ooh, something nasty, sir.

502
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,036
Yes, someone is.

503
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,109
Me!

504
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,276
Now, Sergeant...

505
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,229
...how do you suppose that occurred?

506
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,436
I...

507
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,476
I can't say, sir.

508
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,915
- I can. Trip wire.
- A trip wire, sir?

509
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,356
It tripped me right in it.

510
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,634
- Right into the?
- Yes.

511
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,073
(Gasps)

512
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,628
How do you suppose...

513
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,790
it got there?

514
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,836
What, you mean the er?

515
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,596
- You know the officer means the trip wire!
- I'm doing the talking, Sergeant Major.

516
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,636
Well?

517
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,356
Well...

518
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,316
Well, sir, that... that is a trap
for Nazi paratroopers, sir.

519
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,311
Am I a Nazi paratrooper?

520
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,550
No! No, sir. You're one of us.

521
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,551
I think.

522
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,073
Explain yourself, Sergeant.

523
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,918
Well, sir, in this hut,
we are usually otherwise engaged.

524
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,150
You know, kipping and things like that.

525
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,836
And... well, we thought some sort of
early warning system was necessary.

526
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,559
I mean, you can't trust that Hitler, can you, sir?

527
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,757
And this unit prides itself on being ever ready.

528
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,718
- Yes, Sergeant?
- Bombardier Ready, I wasn't talking to you.

529
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,031
I am addressing the commanding officer.

530
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,954
What is that man doing sitting at attention
on that man's shoulders?

531
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,912
Well, sir. That's presence of an officer, sir.

532
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,437
- But why sitting on someone's shoulders?
- Sir, Shorthouse has a fine head of hair.

533
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,752
We use him to keep the cobwebs down.
Ready, give the officer a demonstration.

534
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,990
My head! Ow, my head! He's banging it!

535
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,072
Careful! You're banging my... Ow!

536
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,515
READY: You're off balance!

537
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,989
Enough of that. Enough of that!
Get down, that man!

538
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,399
- Sergeant Major.
- Hargh!

539
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,677
Stand by your beds! This is an inspection!
Move yourselves!

540
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,398
<i>Come on! At the double!</i>

541
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,119
<i>Get properly dressed! Do yourself up, lad!</i>

542
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,829
Do your flies up, that man!
Your brains is catching cold.

543
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,195
<i>Lay it out! Lay it out!</i>

544
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,389
Hang properly to attention, that man!

545
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,674
- You call that laying it out?
- Give us a minute, Sergeant Major.

546
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,911
Never mind that, Sergeant Major.
What the devil is this?

547
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,073
Ah. Yes, sir.
You see, those, sir, are ear muffs, sir.

548
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,310
A trophy of war, that is, sir.

549
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,470
Ear muffs? Trophy of war?

550
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,792
Captured from one of them German ATS
during the retreat from Dunkirk, sir.

551
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,075
It says "Made in England".

552
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,229
<i>Atishoo!</i>

553
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,276
Who's that sneezing up in the loft?

554
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,557
- Him, sir.
- It couldn't have been. I've seen you talking.

555
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,270
- Yeah.
- He was talking and then... then he sneezed, sir.

556
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,316
I didn't see him.

557
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,870
No, sir. I would never sneeze
in the presence of an officer.

558
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,999
So, he sort of...
He threw his sneeze up... up into the loft.

559
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,197
- Didn't you, Ready?
- Yes, Sergeant.

560
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,272
- Are you a ventriloquist?
- Oh, no, sir. Church of England.

561
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,350
Do you pursue the ventriloquial art?

562
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,398
- In an amateurish sort of way, yes, sir.
- Do it again.

563
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,357
Er... again.

564
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,874
<i>You mean, you want me to...</i>

565
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,635
throw my voice and sneeze up in the loft again?

566
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,676
- Sir!
- Yes.

567
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,716
- <i>Atishoo!</i>
- I saw your lips move!

568
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,756
- I didn't.
- I did distinctly.

569
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,116
I should give it up, if I were you.
You're not very good at it.

570
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,720
The state of this hut's not very good either.

571
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,358
In fact, it's horrible.

572
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,070
In the time it takes me to shower,
you shower will clean this place up.

573
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,392
I want this floor polished from wall to wall.
Under the beds. Round the stove.

574
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,516
Polish it everywhere!

575
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,677
I want it so that I can see my face in it.

576
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,069
You heard what the officer said! Get on with it!

577
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,232
No. No. No. Something has got to be done.

578
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,035
- I know what he wants.
- What does he want?

579
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,270
He wants us to polish the floor, sarge.

580
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,312
Phoooorrr!

581
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,356
He's in it again.

582
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,393
You...

583
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,872
You... you... aarrgghhhhh!

584
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,435
What has happened?

585
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,798
He went through so fast,
I think he might have been taken short again.

586
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,314
Yes. A nasty friction burn you've got there.

587
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,550
What have you been doing? Arsing about?

588
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,677
A drop of calamine
will soon get to the bottom of this one.

589
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,911
- I will cancel the route march, sir.
- You'll do no such thing!

590
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,232
- No choice, sir. Your uniforms is at the cleaners.
- I know that. Arrghh!

591
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,438
You cannot go on a route march in your
underpants and with a burnt bum to boot.

592
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,638
Get me a battledress, Sergeant Major,
from battalion stores, you fool.

593
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,395
I've already rung the stores
and there's nothing in your size, sir.

594
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,436
This is a bit near the ground, Melly.

595
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,876
Get me a battledress, Sergeant Major.
I don't care how, but get it!

596
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,154
Sir.

597
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,711
What does he expect me to do? Knit him one?
The short arse...

598
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,429
That's it. Short arse.

599
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,193
Little Gunner Shorthouse. Hee-hee hee-hee!

600
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,669
My best battledress, Sergeant Major?

601
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,513
Do not bandy words with me, lovely boy.

602
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,478
Or I will raise my right leg six inches
from the ground,

603
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
place my No.10 firmly on the top of your head,

604
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,397
and press you straight through the floorboards!

605
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,469
Nice.

606
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,439
Best walking-out battledress, short arse, please.

607
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,954
What if he wants to go walking out,
Sergeant Major?

608
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,110
Then he will just have to stay in!

609
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,156
Oh, flippin' heck.

610
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,553
Only one man round here allowed to use bad
language, Gunner, and you is looking at him.

611
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,995
Get it out, lovely boy. Get it out.

612
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,669
- Pardon?
- The battledress. Get it out!

613
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,716
Sergeant Major.

614
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,873
I do not know about walking out in it.
It looks like you've been sleeping out in it.

615
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,474
Press it like it's never been worn,
stick three pips on,

616
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,632
bring it over the battery office in ten min-u-ets!

617
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,395
By the way, the whole of the mixed section
will parade at 0900 hours.

618
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,436
You is going walkies.

619
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,796
OFFICERS: Walkies?
- A route march! Hee-hee hee-hee.

620
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,197
I is looking forward to seeing you off
on them 12 foot-blistering miles.

621
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,752
I cannot wait to wish you luck,
as you wave me goodbye. Hee-hee hee-hee.

622
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,278
12 miles!

623
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,830
So you see, Tilly, I wanted to ask your advice.

624
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,559
I mean, you being a woman and all that.

625
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,596
- Oh, so you've noticed.
- Yes.

626
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,750
- A couple of times.
- Not now, Leonard.

627
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,831
We're on duty.

628
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,116
You see, the little perisher
is going to wear this on the march.

629
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,156
- Him?
- No, no. Not him. <i>Him.</i>

630
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,994
- Captain flippin' S Melly.
- Oh, Smelly himself.

631
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:36,029
So, with all your knowledge
of erm... sewing and that,

632
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,796
what can we do to sabotage
Shorty's walking-outs?

633
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,155
I don't want anybody sabotaging my walking-out.

634
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,552
A-a-a-a-a!
It's either your walking-outs or our feet.

635
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,075
Well, Till?

636
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,196
(Sighs) I don't know.

637
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,196
I just don't know.

638
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,308
- Built to withstand all the rigours of wars, these.
- But what are we going to do?

639
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,356
Wait a minute...

640
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,356
I'm waiting.

641
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,317
Anti-gas bleach.

642
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,073
- Anti-gas bleach.
- Anti-gas bleach?

643
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,674
Oh, Leonard. Get me some.

644
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,273
<i>Ready, get me some.</i>

645
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,673
- Have you got a match?
- Yeah. Your...

646
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,954
This'll make him hop a bit.

647
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,196
(Able chuckles)

648
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,278
Parade!

649
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,316
Right heel!

650
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,956
(Squeaking)

651
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,040
Parade, ready for route march, sir!

652
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,076
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

653
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,958
Mixed section, move to the left in column abrupt!

654
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,996
Left turn!

655
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,677
By the left, quick march!

656
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,669
Mixed section, halt!

657
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,636
(Squeaking)

658
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,951
What the devil do you think you're doing,
Sergeant Major?

659
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,873
Seeing you off, sir.
Somebody has to hold the fort.

660
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,554
A fort with only a wooden gun...

661
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,875
...doesn't need holding. Fall in at the rear.

662
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,191
With respect, sir.
I cannot do route marches with my feet.

663
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,874
Well, you certainly can't do one without them.

664
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,110
Hee-hee hee-hee.

665
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,156
- Fall in.
- Sir!

666
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,199
(Squeaking)

667
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,156
Mixed section and Sergeant Major...

668
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,276
...quick march!

669
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,989
(Laughter)

670
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,316
(Peals of laughter)

671
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,315
You seems to have come apart at <i>the</i> seams,
sir.

672
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,713
Mixed section, halt!

673
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,396
(Squeaking)

674
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,156
Left turn!

675
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,910
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

676
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,309
- Put them all on a charge...
- Hah!

677
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,109
- Every man, jack and woman of 'em!
- Sir!

678
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,556
You is all on a charge!

679
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,916
Er, what is the charge, sir?

680
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,756
Laughing...

681
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,796
on duty!

682
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,076
<i>Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Left!</i>

683
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,116
<i>Defaulters, halt!</i>

684
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,428
<i>Hats off!</i>

685
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,873
- March them in, Sergeant Major.
- One at a time, sir?

686
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,236
They're all on the same charge.
I'll see them all together.

687
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,189
Sir! Defaulters, opposite sex first.
Single file. Double march!

688
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,714
Left, right! Left, right! Move yourselves!

689
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,360
Left, right! Left, right! Mark time!

690
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,149
<i>Left, right. Left, right. Move yourselves!</i>
<i>Left, right! Left, right!</i>

691
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,231
Halt!

692
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,078
Where are you, sir?

693
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,550
(Gasps) Over here, Sergeant Major.

694
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,473
Can't see you, sir. Raise your hand, sir.

695
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,116
Will you kindly remove your?

696
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,236
I can't. I'm squashed.

697
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,073
Take a deep breath, Ffoukes... Ffoukes Sharpe.

698
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,880
Oh, never mind where I am, Sergeant Major.
Read the charge.

699
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,636
Hargh! Defaulters did, whilst on duty,
indulge in unauthorised laughter

700
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,793
in contravention of King's regulations
and War Office instructions, sir.

701
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,189
(Muffled reply)

702
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,114
I'm sorry, sir. We couldn't er...
We couldn't quite catch that.

703
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,796
Will you kindly remove those things from my?

704
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,917
I said you're all confined to camp for two weeks.

705
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,719
<i>Carry on, Sergeant Major!</i>

706
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,997
Sir! About turn!

707
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,358
Double march! Left, right! Left, right!
Move yourselves! Move yourselves!

708
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,314
Sergeant Major. Shut the door.

709
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,556
That'll teach 'em.

710
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,556
What are you shaking your head for?

711
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,871
- They will not mind being confined to camp, sir.
- Nonsense.

712
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,349
Every soldier minds being confined to camp.

713
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,795
Not when half of 'em is women, sir.

714
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,394
- They is happy here.
- Happy?

715
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,871
It has always been my proud boast, sir,
in all my time as a sergeant major,

716
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,511
in all my camps there has never been
a single sign of happiness... till now.

717
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,276
Why, man? Why?

718
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,672
- This lot have got everything they want here, sir.
- Such as?

719
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,150
A bit of this. A bit of that. A lot of that, actually.

720
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,912
A lot of what?

721
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,958
You know, sir. <i>That.</i>

722
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,393
Surely you don't mean a bit of the other?

723
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,358
This, that, or the other, sir.
They is at it all the time.

724
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,113
In and out of each other's quarters
like fiddlers' elbows.

725
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,432
Are they indeed? That <i>is</i> something
to which I'm going to put a bloody stop!

726
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,877
With respect, sir. We cannot stop them
without staying up all night.

727
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,428
That will not be necessary, Sergeant Major.

728
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,431
<i>Sir?</i>

729
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,476
We will build a chastity fence.

730
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,438
- A what, sir?
- A sort of a big belt.

731
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,555
Oooh!

732
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,710
Made of barbed wire.

733
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,116
Cor! That sounds a bit uncomfortable, sir.

734
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,349
Too-wit!

735
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,431
Too-hoo!

736
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,789
- Last one, Sergeant Major.
(Ripping)

737
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,236
Steady, man.
You caught me right in the... field dressing.

738
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,793
MELLY: Lift.

739
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,512
I think congratulations are in order,
Sergeant Major.

740
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,512
- Thank you, sir.
- Not you, you fool. Me.

741
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,831
- Come along. Let's get back.
- There's gratitude for you.

742
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,876
Sir.

743
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,633
- Private Easy?
- Yes, Sergeant?

744
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,676
Make the signal to Sergeant Able.

745
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,716
Code or plain language?

746
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,756
- Plain language.
- Right away.

747
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,550
- Ready?
- Sergeant?

748
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,677
Make to Sergeant Willing, message received...

749
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,716
and understood.

750
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,756
(Laughter)

751
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,512
Sergeant.

752
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,994
Alice, I don't think I can hold this pose
much longer.

753
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,996
- I'll get cramp.
- Really?

754
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,753
Oh, Leonard. What's keeping you?

755
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,796
Oooh!

756
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,836
I told you so, Sergeant.

757
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,229
- It's not only barbed wire, it's rusty.
- Rusty?

758
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,038
I'll get blood poisoning on my hooter!

759
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,475
- Shut up about your hooter!
- It's the only one I got.

760
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,509
- You don't think the girls have gone off us?
- It's got nothing to do with the girls.

761
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,637
This is a right load of old Smelly.

762
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,312
Smelly? Doowarrgghpree!

763
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,709
- Stop doing that.
- He can't do that to us.

764
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,075
- He's done it.
- But it's inhuman.

765
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,833
- He ain't human.
- He ain't going to get away with it.

766
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,354
- Double back and fetch a tin hat.
- What for?

767
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,112
- Do as I told you.
- But...

768
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,156
- Scarper!
- Yes, Sergeant.

769
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,310
Right. Here. Now, listen...

770
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,073
You all know the drill for this sort of operation.

771
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,073
I am asking for a volunteer.

772
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,116
Right, sarge.

773
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,196
Well done, son.

774
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,236
Congratulations.

775
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,276
Thank you very much, sarge.

776
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,590
- What for?
- You have just volunteered.

777
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,353
- Have I?
- Put your helmet on, cover yourself up.

778
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,715
No, not on your head. Cover your er...

779
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,076
- I don't understand. What do you mean?
- Show him, will you?

780
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,878
- Ooh!
- Just hold it right there.

781
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,076
- What for?
- So you don't do yourself an injury

782
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,310
- when you lays down across the wire.
- What?

783
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,269
- Shh! Come on, lads. The girls is getting cold.
- No! No, Sergeant.

784
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,715
- I'll do anything. Not on the wire.
- Shh!

785
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,951
READY: Don't throw me on the wire!
ALL: One... two... three...

786
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,996
Aarrghh!

787
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,876
Cor blimey, Ready.

788
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,916
What have you done?

789
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,956
(Whimpers) Nothing.

790
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,600
Ooh, ahh! My neck!

791
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,154
Keep your hand on your helmet,
otherwise you'll be ruined for life.

792
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,196
Here we go.

793
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,236
Careful, lads.

794
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,876
Wake up.

795
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,632
Wake up!

796
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,676
How are you feeling, son?

797
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,833
Just as though those explosions
are reverberating all through my body.

798
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,189
Just so long as your helmet's not damaged.

799
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,352
- Ooooh!
- There.

800
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,718
<i>Yeah. And I thought he was just a little basket.</i>

801
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,519
Well, what is he, then, sarge?

802
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,550
A cunning little basket.

803
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,314
(Cock crows)

804
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,516
(Hums)

805
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,834
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Sergeant Major.

806
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,798
You requested my presence
at this early hour, sir.

807
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,713
Yes. I did indeed. Why?
Did I interrupt your sleep?

808
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,872
- It doesn't worry me, sir.
- I should think not, indeed.

809
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,032
Well, now, it's coming up to the hour. Five...

810
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,590
four, three, two, one. Sound the reveille.

811
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,319
- Reveille?
- Yes. The wakey-wakey.

812
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,392
Get up and win the war.
When I'm on my feet, everyone is.

813
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,156
Beg pardon, sir, but I's found
you gets more out of this shower

814
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,358
if they is allowed to wake up...
sort of gradual, like.

815
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,318
Well, from now on,

816
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,868
they're going to wake up sort of sudden, like.

817
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,077
If they gets up on the wrong side, sir,

818
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,720
they can make your life a bloody misery all day.

819
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,634
Yes, well, I'm the man who makes lives
bloody miserable, Sergeant Major.

820
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,676
- Sound the reveille.
- Very well, sir.

821
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:18,319
I think I can safely say that
this is definitely going to give them the needle.

822
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,833
Hee-hee hee hee-hee-hee!

823
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,836
Stand by.

824
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,196
(Trumpet fanfare)

825
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,755
- Blimey! It's only half past six!
- What a liberty!

826
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,876
Here, turn that off!

827
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,996
Oh, my gawd! Give it a rest.

828
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,719
- What the hell was that?
- Sounds like reveille.

829
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,756
Well, turn the bloody thing off.

830
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,558
You can't turn off a tannoy, sarge.

831
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,234
Get on Ready's shoulders
and stuff something up it.

832
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,719
What can I stuff up it, sarge?

833
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,554
I don't know. Your head, your arse, your elbow.

834
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,200
Only hurry up. I'm trying to get some kip.

835
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,838
- Hey, Ready.
- What?

836
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,037
- Hand us my pillow.
- Can't you remember anything?

837
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,394
I can't see!

838
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,789
- Get it out of my face!
- There we are.

839
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,390
It's stopped. We'll take it back again.

840
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,712
Wakey-waaaakey!

841
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,313
Wakey-wakey, rise and shine.

842
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,358
You may break your mothers' hearts,
but you will not break mine.

843
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,359
How dare you stuff the commanding officer
whilst he is talking! Unstuff him at once!

844
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,112
Get down and get dressed.

845
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,033
And, the rest of you,
what does you think you is doing?

846
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,078
Well, we was trying to get some kip.

847
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,071
But you has had all night to kip.

848
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:42,393
Now, then, off your backs, on your feet
and get into them ablutions at the double!

849
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,598
Aeroplanes.

850
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,195
Hey, what's all this about, then,
Sergeant Major?

851
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,636
Aircraft recognition. These is your new pin-ups.

852
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,669
I bet none of you can tell the difference between
a couple of Heinkels and a pair of Bristols.

853
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,877
No, but I can recognise a Fokker
when I see one.

854
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,520
Good boy. That is why you is a sergeant.

855
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:18,469
TANNOY: <i>Attention, all ATS personnel.</i>
<i>I'm going to make men of you.</i>

856
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,156
As from this moment, skirts will not be worn.

857
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,198
TANNOY: <i>Skirts will not be worn.</i>

858
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,236
Ooh, that'll be a bit drafty.

859
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,313
TANNOY: <i>Battledress trousers</i>
<i>will be worn at all times.</i>

860
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,756
- <i>That is all.</i>
- Wait a minute!

861
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,030
Private Easy, did you hear what he just said?

862
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,395
Of course. That's what we're talking about.

863
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,630
No, no, no, Bombardier Murray.

864
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,314
He said, his exact words were,

865
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,470
"Battledress trousers will be worn.

866
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,516
That is all."

867
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,079
Yes.

868
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,878
So he did.

869
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,916
(Bloomer sings to himself)

870
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,996
Wakey-wakey! Rise and shine!

871
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,631
All ATS personnel taking breakfast,
fall in outside under Corporal Murray.

872
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,954
Come along, girls. Fall in.

873
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,277
How dare you come on parade
improperly dressed?

874
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,318
- We're only obeying orders, Sergeant Major.
- Or...

875
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,356
Orders? Whose orders?

876
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,149
His. Sir's. We're to wear battledress trousers
and that's all.

877
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,834
- The officer wouldn't give that order!
- His very words.

878
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,069
The dirty little...

879
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,718
Sergeant Major.

880
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,877
What the devil's going on here?
Why are these men half-naked?

881
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,191
Because, sir, you said they was
to wear trousers and that is all.

882
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,235
I did not.

883
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,470
ALL: Oh, yes you did, sir.

884
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,516
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you d...

885
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,875
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did!

886
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,234
Quiet!

887
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,629
- I'm going to make a couple of points.
- Ooh!

888
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,157
Sergeant Major, when I said, "That's all,"
I didn't mean that's all, I meant that's all.

889
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,879
That sounds like a lot of alls, sir.

890
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,191
The cold wind of change
is going to blow through this camp.

891
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,840
This I promise you. So you'd better take cover.

892
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,751
I have now... Do you mind, Sergeant Major?

893
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,950
I have now taken you apart.

894
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,270
And from now on, that is how you will stay.

895
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,596
Apart.

896
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,876
You will eat apart.

897
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,269
You will march apart.

898
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,316
You will live apart.

899
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,356
Left turn!

900
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,639
MELLY: <i>Worlds apart!</i>
- Right turn!

901
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,269
MELLY: <i>During gun drills,</i>
<i>which will now take place daily,</i>

902
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,318
<i>gas masks will be worn at all times.</i>

903
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,356
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

904
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,313
<i>There will be compulsory nights out</i>
<i>every night until 23:59 hours.</i>

905
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,356
<i>Transport will be provided.</i>

906
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,396
<i>ATS, Mondays,</i>

907
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,517
- <i>men on Tuesdays.</i>
- Look at him laughing at us. Look.

908
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,758
And so it will go on and on and on and on...

909
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,071
until the whole of Europe is ours!

910
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,558
How did he get into our army?

911
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,596
Sieg heil, Melly.

912
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,070
I've got it! I've got it.

913
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,515
- Whooerrpaaahh.
- So has he.

914
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,556
Well, take it outside.

915
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,279
And throw a bucket of water on it.

916
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,998
I've got it!

917
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,389
- I've got it!
- What a waste.

918
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,799
Poor devil.

919
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,638
Leonard.

920
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,359
Right, you lot. Over here.

921
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,989
Come on, move yourselves.
Now, this is the plan.

922
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,514
We are going to dig a tunnel.

923
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,718
We are going to dig a <i>tunnel!</i>

924
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,756
ALL: A tunnel of love!

925
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,756
It won't be as dark as that.

926
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,756
Cop hold of these.

927
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,713
Never thought I'd find a use
for my Army knickers.

928
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,836
- Or any other kind, dear.
- Cheeky!

929
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,876
Now, keep it up, girls.

930
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,315
The boys ain't half going to get a surprise.

931
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,236
(Barks)

932
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,956
(Barks)

933
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,596
Heel, Hitler. Heel.

934
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,070
- Come on, Sergeant Major. Security patrol.
- (Barking)

935
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,558
Is that the best the military police
could send you?

936
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,713
Yours may be bigger than mine, sir,
but I've been told mine's got more bite.

937
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,870
Oh, come on, Hitler.

938
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,349
Come on, Muscles.

939
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,199
Sh!

940
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,196
What's that?

941
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,236
What's what?

942
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,276
Sounds like somebody tunnelling.

943
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,396
Well, that's you, innit?

944
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,314
- What was that?
- What?

945
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,356
It sounded like somebody digging.

946
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,198
- That was you.
- Oh, yes. Of course it was.

947
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,714
- Check the padlock, Sergeant Major.
- Sir.

948
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,756
(Muscles barks)

949
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,038
(Muscles pees on his leg)

950
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,669
Sergeant Major, will you keep
that dog of yours under control?

951
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,429
I understand he's house-trained, sir,
but not outside-trained.

952
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,476
Oh, come on, Hitler. Come on.

953
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,279
(Muscles barks)

954
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,316
Shhh!

955
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,119
(Distant barking)
- Listen!

956
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,156
They're patrolling.

957
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,755
- Not a word. Pass it back.
- Shh! Pass it back.

958
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,638
(Muscles barks)
- Heel, Hitler. Heel.

959
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,551
Heel, Muscles.

960
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,352
(Dogs growl)

961
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,476
(Ready's teeth chatter)
- Quiet!

962
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,116
It's not me. It's my t-t-t-teeth.

963
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,359
(Muscles barks)
- Some old bones buried around here.

964
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,350
(Hitler barks)

965
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,228
- Aaarrghh!
- Pull yourself together. Get back at the double!

966
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,995
That was a close call.
I was nearly a dog's dinner.

967
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,394
Alice, hold them still.
How can I get anything in those?

968
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,549
Tilly, darling.

969
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,596
Guess who's here?

970
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,313
Leonard, dearest, move over. Your Tilly's cold.

971
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,359
Leonard?

972
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,669
Leonard!

973
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,116
Tilly! Where the hell are you?

974
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,916
Hey, sarge. Here.

975
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,596
Oh, no.

976
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,148
We must have tunnelled back into our own hut.

977
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,156
No! No, no, no, no, no.

978
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,993
Don't be stupid, stupid.

979
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,116
The girls must have had the same idea.

980
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,794
- So, they're in our hut.
- So, they're in...

981
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,836
Come on!

982
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,556
No!

983
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,636
- What do you mean no?
- Listen.

984
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,998
If we wait here, <i>they</i> will come to us.

985
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,910
Right?

986
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,039
We are going to sit here quietly
and they will come to us.

987
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,075
Yes.

988
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,916
- Hear anything?
- Only you.

989
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,116
(Trumpet fanfare)

990
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,391
Reveille? We've been at it all night.

991
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,436
Yes, and not even a nibble.

992
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,476
Well, it can't be.

993
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,556
(Cock crows)

994
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,756
TANNOY: <i>Wakey-waaaakey!</i>

995
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,796
Get st-uffed!

996
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,269
Stand at ease. Easy.

997
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,916
This is a great day...
for 13-13 Experimental Battery.

998
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,514
And an even better night for us.

999
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,797
Are you coming down my tunnel?
Or am I going up yours?

1000
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,519
As a result, Headquarters have at last agreed

1001
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,273
to send us that most desirable
piece of equipment

1002
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,999
to have handy in time of war, namely, a gun.

1003
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,718
May God protect us all.

1004
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,271
The Brigadier himself will be here tomorrow
for a full inspection

1005
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,316
and, I hope, to see us in action.

1006
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,669
(Drone of engine)
- Ah, here she comes.

1007
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,194
BLOOMER: <i>Company, atten-shun!</i>

1008
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,236
# Rule Britannia

1009
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,391
If he goes over our tunnel, he'll fall in.

1010
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,519
- Sergeant Major!
- Hargh!

1011
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,750
Culprits to my office at once.

1012
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,989
Sir!

1013
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,793
Right, you horrible stinking shower,

1014
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,953
I wants the guilty party,
on the word of command, male or female,

1015
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,508
to take one pace forward!

1016
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,273
The guilty party, one pace forward, march!

1017
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,993
The ground... cut from under our feet,

1018
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,878
and I am determined to get to the bottom of it.

1019
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,554
- Answer me! You!
- Yes, sir.

1020
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,629
Answer me!

1021
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,995
Well, I have, sir.

1022
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,036
Who is responsible? Answer me!

1023
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,076
- Moles, sir.
- What?

1024
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,076
Well, I think it was moles, sir.

1025
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,589
Who is responsible? You.

1026
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,750
I think it was moles, too, sir.

1027
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,400
Moles. Moles?

1028
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,472
You don't get your ordinary type
of mole round here, sir.

1029
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,154
These is all whopping great big 'uns, sir.

1030
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,514
How big?

1031
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,956
Oh, well... as big as that big dog of yours, sir.

1032
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,356
Moles... as big as Great Danes.

1033
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,795
Oh, no. Bigger, really.

1034
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,950
Bigger?

1035
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,838
- You know that hill outside the camp, sir?
- Yes.

1036
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,074
That's a molehill.

1037
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,516
Good Lord!

1038
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,273
- That hill must be 20 feet high!
- <i>Well, sir...</i>

1039
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,635
that just goes to show you, doesn't it?

1040
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,996
- Sergeant Major?
- Sir?

1041
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,548
- Have you ever seen these beasts?
- I has not, sir.

1042
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,358
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

1043
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,591
And if I may say so, sir,
if I had seen such an animal...

1044
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,832
you would need a gun as big as the one
that went down the hole to shoot it with.

1045
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,956
Thank you very much, Sergeant Major.

1046
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,355
Sergeants Willing and Able,
you have just told me a tissue...

1047
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,396
Bless you, sir.

1048
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,436
...of lies.

1049
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,476
The whole lot of you...

1050
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,315
are going to remove my gun from
its present hole and put it in its proper hole!

1051
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,356
<i>I don't care how you do it.</i>

1052
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,908
<i>But you are going to do it,</i>

1053
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,231
and you are going to keep on doing it
until it is done.

1054
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,912
Heave!

1055
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,798
- Shorthouse, are you heaving?
- I'm heaving.

1056
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,155
Look sharp, Sharpe! Heave!

1057
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,156
You ruin my gun...

1058
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,596
I will ruin you! Heave!

1059
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,352
(All shout at once)

1060
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,714
No, he ain't going to get away with it.

1061
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,756
Making us sweat like that.

1062
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,796
How do you mean, <i>us?</i>

1063
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,190
He ain't going to get away with it -
making <i>you</i> sweat like that.

1064
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,716
- But he is flippin' getting away with it!
- Not for long, son.

1065
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,950
It's a top brass inspection tomorrow, innit?

1066
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,793
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Brigadier's coming, isn't he?

1067
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,269
Yes, Sergeant.

1068
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,316
What about it?

1069
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,316
<i>This</i> about it, son.

1070
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,356
He has gone too far.

1071
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,434
So we are going to put into operation Plan B.

1072
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,836
Good Lord!

1073
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,799
- Melly seems to have turned that girl into a man.
- Jolly smart, eh, sir?

1074
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,077
You don't suppose sheer bloody ignorance
has worked, do you?

1075
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,119
- It couldn't be anything else, sir?
- He hasn't got anything else.

1076
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,949
Parade! Parade!

1077
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,996
Atten-shun!

1078
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,077
Good show, Melly.
You've got them all turned out like guardsmen.

1079
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,513
Thank you very much, sir.

1080
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,511
Do they all perform as well as they look?

1081
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,989
- I've put a stop to all that, sir.
- What?

1082
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,913
Oh, I don't mean
I've stopped them performing, sir.

1083
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,629
I've them stopped them... Well, erm...

1084
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,676
performing.

1085
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,153
- Don't follow, old boy.
- Oh, how can I put, sir?

1086
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,629
I erm... Ah!

1087
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,356
Oh, I see.

1088
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,396
Got yourself a hen coop, eh?

1089
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,436
Ha ha ha ha!

1090
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,238
Wittily put, sir.

1091
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,276
Yes, I rather thought so myself.

1092
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,351
Come along, Melly. Let's get cracking.

1093
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,589
Very good, sir.

1094
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,075
- Colours, Sergeant Major.
- Sir.

1095
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:30,234
(Bellows incomprehensibly)

1096
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,515
- A bit of a bloomer there, Melly.
- I...

1097
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,831
Whose flag is it supposed to be? Nica-ragua's?

1098
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,229
(Chuckles)

1099
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,276
Thank you, Carstairs.

1100
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,875
Excuse me, sir. Pull those knickers down!

1101
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,355
No!

1102
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,476
Not you!

1103
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,516
You, Bombardier. Get 'em down!

1104
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,231
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Some sort of innocent mistake.

1105
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,869
Pulling down knickers is rarely innocent
and never a mistake.

1106
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,997
- What?
- Oh, an epigram, sir.

1107
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,354
I say, sir!

1108
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,193
That was rather good.
What's next on the agenda?

1109
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,510
Things seem to be flagging round here.

1110
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,556
I thought a spot of gun drill, sir.

1111
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,596
All right. Let's shoot off.

1112
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,671
(Both chuckle heartily)

1113
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,716
(Laughs sarcastically)

1114
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,709
You f...

1115
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,473
Fall in at the gun emplacement!
Move yourselves!

1116
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,796
BLOOMER: <i>Come on. Move yourselves!</i>

1117
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,235
Get them bodies moving!

1118
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,228
13-13 Battery, at the double...

1119
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,716
...stop for nothing, take posts!

1120
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,356
Watch it! Aarrghh!

1121
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,391
Better get him out of there, Sergeant Major.

1122
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,436
Sir.

1123
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,552
Steady, sir. Excuse the familiarity, sir.

1124
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,276
(Back cricks)

1125
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,156
Aahh! Ohhh!

1126
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,391
Got yourself in a bit of a hole there, Melly.

1127
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,436
Hole! Ha ha ha ha!

1128
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,829
- Permission to carry on, sir.
- Please do.

1129
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,394
MELLY: <i>You two men there.</i>

1130
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,632
- It doesn't need two men to lift one shell.
- You couldn't call us two men, sir.

1131
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,994
More like one and a half.

1132
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,913
- It doesn't need one and a half.
- These things is heavy, sir.

1133
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,389
- A man could do himself a mischief.
- <i>Rubbish!</i>

1134
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,357
Come on. Hand it to me.

1135
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,837
- Over to you, Sergeant Major.
- Tiger, darling, let me.

1136
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,876
Don't say darling in front of officers.

1137
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,839
But I couldn't bear it if you strained something
before we'd even...

1138
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,069
you know...

1139
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,309
I do not know.

1140
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,356
Well, let me teach you.

1141
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,348
I find these things awfully exciting.

1142
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,396
I don't know why.

1143
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,512
- Take that thing out of there!
- She's rammed it up. Let it stay up.

1144
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,556
In that case, sir, gun loaded, sir.

1145
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,834
Bearing 270!

1146
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,876
(Rhythmic honking)

1147
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,716
Call Melly, will you?

1148
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,756
Sir. Captain Melly!

1149
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,353
Sir?

1150
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:50,275
Surely, in the interests of efficiency,
you shouldn't have someone with... those...

1151
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,316
doing... erm... that.

1152
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,231
Do you know, sir, you're right.

1153
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,993
Yes, well, I always try
and keep <i>abreast</i> of things.

1154
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,913
Oh, droll, sir. Very droll.

1155
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,592
- Hiscock?
- I beg your pardon.

1156
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,636
Gunner Hiscock! Replace those...

1157
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,910
...her, will you?

1158
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,877
Yes.

1159
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,757
Carry on, Sergeant.

1160
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,799
- QE 30.
- Gun ready for firing, sir.

1161
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,836
Right, stand by!

1162
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,391
Fire!

1163
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,391
(Phut)

1164
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,313
Hardly went off with a bang, eh, Melly?

1165
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,197
Carry out drill for misfire!

1166
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,996
Breach jammed, sir.

1167
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,116
Jammed? Get out of my way!

1168
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,476
Put up a bit of a black there, Melly.

1169
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,032
- Permission to take a shower.
- Where are you going to take them?

1170
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,076
Not this shower, sir.

1171
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,991
Hot shower.

1172
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,640
Yes. Well, I must admit, you do look a bit grimy.

1173
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,439
Carry on with the brigadier's inspection,
Sergeant Major.

1174
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,794
Hah!

1175
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,914
Shall we commence in the mess, sir?

1176
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,195
Seem to be in it already.

1177
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,236
Ha ha ha. Humpf!

1178
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,509
It will start working soon.

1179
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,632
He'll turn bright blue
as soon as he gets in the open air.

1180
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,676
Hee-hee hee-hee!

1181
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:00,148
If you could see your way clear, sir, to grant me
a transfer, I would be eternally grateful.

1182
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,357
I would do anything, sir.
Any mission you care to suggest.

1183
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,034
I could parachute into Germany. Kill Hitler.

1184
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,152
Captain Melly resuming duty, sir.

1185
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,834
- Melly?
- Sir?

1186
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,072
Melly, last time I saw you, you were black.
Now you've turned blue.

1187
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,037
Blue?

1188
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,270
Blue. Mirror.

1189
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,197
- Blue as a baboon's arse.
- Ha ha! Oh...

1190
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,956
Permission to have another shower, sir.

1191
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,238
- Granted.
- Carry on with the inspection, Sergeant Major.

1192
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,276
Hah!

1193
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,990
On the other hand, sir,
if you does not fancy me knocking off Hitler,

1194
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,073
how about that fat slob of an Italian
ice cream merchant Musso-bloody-lini?

1195
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,628
- Are you a coward, Sergeant Major?
- Me, sir?

1196
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,349
You want to go gallivanting off,
trying to kill Hitler and Mussolini

1197
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,193
and sneak out from under
this very tough job here?

1198
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,236
Only a suggestion, sir.

1199
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,993
Bloody ashamed, you should be. What's this?

1200
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,718
Games room, sir.

1201
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,788
What's the name of this game, Sergeant Major?

1202
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,838
- Unarmed combat... sir.
- Oh?

1203
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,469
What the sergeant major means, sir, is... Ahem!

1204
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:41,268
...is that you can never be sure
when them Nazi paratroopers might land, sir.

1205
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,316
And we must be ready for them.

1206
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,356
By fighting with ladies?

1207
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,319
Ah, sir, we heard... about them nuns, sir.

1208
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,871
You know, sir. Them nuns when the Frogs
was done. With Tommy guns up their habits.

1209
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:58,397
Those nuns, Sergeant Major,
were German soldiers in disguise.

1210
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,436
What we was doing, sir,

1211
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,992
was getting used to the feel
of fighting something in skirts.

1212
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,629
Mm-hm. What do you say, Carstairs?

1213
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,711
Mm-hm.

1214
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:16,237
- Can you explain that, Sergeant?
- Well, sir. This is erm...

1215
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,276
well, a mixed battery, sir.

1216
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:23,957
And er... well, in a <i>mixed</i> battery, you have to er...

1217
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,110
- Mix it.
- Mix it.

1218
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,192
Carstairs, you fancy yourself
at unarmed combat, don't you?

1219
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,589
I know a trick or two, sir.

1220
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,399
- Go on, then. Choose your opponent.
- Thank you, sir.

1221
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,316
<i>You. That man there.</i>

1222
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,875
- Me, sir?
- No, no. No! Not you, Bombardier.

1223
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,630
I never fight a man with his glasses on.

1224
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,199
I'll take them off, sir.

1225
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,750
No, no. It'll be too dangerous.
Thank you. Back into line.

1226
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,909
Sir.

1227
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,395
You. That man over there.

1228
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,913
Me, sir?

1229
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,956
Yes, you.

1230
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,231
Sir, why don't you try one of our young ladies?

1231
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,517
- Eh?
- Good idea. Why not try one of her ladies?

1232
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,275
TILLY: <i>Just to show how far advanced</i>
<i>in the game we are, sir.</i>

1233
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,193
- Ladies, well...
- Jolly good idea. Go ahead.

1234
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,874
- Ffoukes Sharpe!
- Pardon?

1235
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,916
- Sir!
- Sir.

1236
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,197
- If I was you, sir...
- Yes, Sergeant Major.

1237
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,236
How you wish you were me.

1238
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,359
- No, sir, I think I should warn you...
- Don't worry, I shan't hurt her.

1239
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,516
(Stifled chuckle)

1240
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,556
Right, Ffoukes Sharpe. En garde!

1241
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,991
What are they afraid of, what?

1242
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,638
Stand by, Sergeant!

1243
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,312
Oooh! Aarrghh!

1244
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,518
Thank you, madam.

1245
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,236
I wasn't ready, sir.

1246
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,558
Come along, Carstairs. I think we've both hung
around here long enough, don't you?

1247
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,914
Ha ha.

1248
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,791
Whoever perpetrated that blue joke
is going to suffer.

1249
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,076
Suffer! I'll murder 'em!

1250
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,997
I'll make dog meat of 'em.

1251
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,152
I'll show them who's wearing
the trousers around here.

1252
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,754
(High-pitched voice) Good afternoon, sir.

1253
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,636
I say, sir. That ATS private's
wearing a moustache!

1254
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,393
That's no ATS private, Carstairs. That's Melly!

1255
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,471
(Air raid siren)

1256
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,470
13-13 Battery, take post!

1257
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,313
Action stations, Carstairs. Action stations!

1258
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,277
Is this the real thing, Sergeant Major?

1259
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,272
Yes, lovely boy.
It is you against the Hun this time!

1260
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,553
Move yourselves! Move yourselves!
Come on! Come on!

1261
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,279
BLOOMER:
Sixpence for every one you shoots down.

1262
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,316
Two bob if it is a German!

1263
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,356
Come on! Come on! Move yourselves!

1264
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,396
<i>Move yourselves! Come on! Come on!</i>

1265
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,110
Here, did you see that?

1266
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,875
Leonard, you cannot expect a brigadier
to expose himself.

1267
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:11,591
I think perhaps we should go now.
Get those bloody guns ready!

1268
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,356
MELLY: Put those gas masks on!
No.1 detachment, take post!

1269
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,395
Right! Stand by!

1270
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,040
With respect, sir. You is improperly dressed.

1271
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,749
If it wasn't for you, Sergeant Major,
I wouldn't be in this shape.

1272
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,474
- I reckon they're Fokkers.
- Have you got it up?

1273
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,279
- I beg your pardon?
- The shell, man. The shell!

1274
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,954
- That's rammed up all right, sir.
- Then fire it!

1275
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,951
Fire!

1276
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,669
SPITFIRE PILOT: Bloody hell!

1277
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,115
Don't shoot at him. Shoot at them!

1278
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,272
<i>You dozy idle fool!</i>

1279
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,477
220-35-29!

1280
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,879
Fire!

1281
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:00,949
Fire!

1282
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,076
190-30-28!

1283
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,116
Shorthouse!

1284
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,876
Get that shell in the breach!

1285
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,556
Oh, for heaven's sake!

1286
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,194
- Get out!
- Fire!

1287
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,551
- We've got him, Sergeant Major.
- Let's hope it's one of theirs.

1288
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,757
- Aaaaaahh!
- Well done, lads! Again!

1289
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,355
Fire!

1290
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,156
It's a hit, sir. It's a hit!

1291
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,317
- Well done, Tiger.
- Thank you, Smelly... sir.

1292
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,277
Do it again! Do it again!

1293
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,793
MELLY: <i>Fire!</i>

1294
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,718
It's another hit, sir!

1295
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,153
Well done, Jock.

1296
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,593
Do it again!

1297
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,636
Right, stand back, you two!

1298
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,280
That's it. Fire!

1299
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,348
You've done it. You've done it, my lovely boys!

1300
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,753
- We did it! We did it!
- Leonard, <i>you</i> did it.

1301
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,796
- No, <i>we</i> did it, Till.
- We did?

1302
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,711
Take that message back to Hitler!

1303
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,028
Ahhh!

1304
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,836
A-haaaa!

1305
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,151
Go on, Tiger. It's your birthday!

1306
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,636
- I love you.
- You can tell him that as well.

1307
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,029
All right.

1308
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,509
Parade... stand at ease!

1309
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,034
Stand easy.

1310
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,513
<i>Now, I am sure that you is all dying to know</i>
<i>the state of your commanding officer.</i>

1311
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,391
And I is very happy to inform you
that apart from a cracked funny bone,

1312
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,951
sustained in the recoil, and a couple of
sprained fingers from tugging the toggle,

1313
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,793
he is in what might be described as rude health.

1314
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:23,753
In fact, he is coming out here now
to congratulate you as you so richly deserves.

1315
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,713
# And the same to you!

1316
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,511
Hooray!

1317
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,275
<i>And so it came about that through</i>
<i>the blunderings of one poor bloody officer,</i>

1318
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,033
<i>a certain person who shall be nameless</i>
<i>was able to create</i>

1319
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,795
<i>an everlasting symbol of encouragement</i>
<i>and devotion to duty,</i>

1320
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,553
<i>a symbol accepted throughout the entire world!</i>
