They told me they were going 
to kill me, so I couldn't report them.

What the hell's
a nun doin' out here?

35
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:01,884
I'm on a mission.
In Mexico a nun can travel safely ..

36
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,620
..among murderers and thieves.

37
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:07,824
I could have avoided these men
but instead, I came to ask for food.

38
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,961
- They give you any?
- No.

39
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:15,298
- Well, there's probably some leftovers there.
- I couldn't eat just now.

40
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,927
Well, you look like you could use
a shot of whiskey.

41
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,847
Whiskey? 
No ...Thank you.

42
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,560
- Your mule?
- Yes.

43
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,398
No provisions, no canteen?

44
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,620
Just how'd you figure on existing?

45
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:36,694
I was confident
the Lord would provide.

46
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:39,238
Three more like them?

47
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,699
He also provided you.

48
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,414
- Which way you headed?
- North.

49
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:50,624
North, huh?

50
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,794
Well, I'm headed south.

51
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:56,756
So I'll just help myself to 
those ponies and be on my way.

52
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,383
But, first we must 
cover them with stones.

53
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:02,430
We can't leave without giving them
a Christian burial of some kind.

54
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:06,602
After the way they treated you, 
you feel like covering them?

55
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,876
- Of course.

56
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,002
You got to be touched in the head.

57
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,856
Do you have a shovel?

58
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,611
Sister, raise your eyes to heaven.

59
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:23,116
Now, are they or are they not
God's creatures?

60
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:24,870
- But, of course they are.

61
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,404
- Well, why do you want to rob them 
of all this convenient meat?

62
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:29,873
Do you have a shovel?

63
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:32,488
Yeah, it's on my packhorse
over the hill.

64
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:36,879
Would you get it and cover them, please, 
for the sake of my soul if not your own?

65
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,051
Sister, I don't mind shootin' 'em for you but I'll 
be damned if I'm gonna sweat over 'em for you.

66
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:44,721
You're as stubborn as my mule,
you know?

67
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:46,848
Worse.

68
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:36,229
How are the blisters?

69
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:40,066
Other things in life have hurt more.

70
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:44,071
Thank you, Brother.

71
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:48,159
- It's Hogan.
- I'm Sister Sara.

72
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:54,915
Well, Sister Sara,
if you ever get tired of being a nun,

73
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:57,702
you can look forward to be 
an A-1 gravedigger, that's for sure.

74
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,830
Here you can have 
some of these beans.

75
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:04,091
Those fellas weren't much in a fight
but one of 'em wasn't a bad cook.

76
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,305
I couldn't eat anything they cooked
but I'll have some water, please.

77
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:12,475
- Here help yourself.
- Thank you.

- You really are touched!
- You give that back to me, please.

80
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,639
Sister, you wanna bless 'em,
you bless 'em dry.

81
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,268
I've obliged you 'bout all I'm
going to Sister and now I'll say goodbye.

82
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,979
You stay out of that sun now,
you hear?

83
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:02,274
Or you're gonna really be in trouble.

84
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,236
Goodbye. Thank's again.

85
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,405
God go with you.

86
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:45,067
Hey, you're in luck.
Looks like a French cavalry headed this way.

87
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:48,237
You can probably travel
along with them.

88
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:53,325
Please help me.
They're looking for me.

89
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,352
Why?

90
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,705
I was raising money for 
the Mexican army and they found out.

91
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,957
I had to run away in the middle 
of the night. Please!

92
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:08,842
Lady, if you weren't a nun
I'd let you save your own bacon.

93
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:12,219
All right, you do as I say and act fast.

94
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:16,306
And get rid of that cross,
it shines like a mirror.

95
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,084
You bring that last horse
and follow me.

96
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,321
Son of a bitch.

97
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:34,658
What are you doing?

98
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,119
I'm doing for you what...

99
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:40,372
no Holy Virgin's
in any position to do.

100
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,168
Hah!

101
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:52,635
We'll walk slowly so as not 
to stir up this stream bed ...

102
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,762
any more than we have to.

103
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:58,515
Why did you put that dead man
on the horse?

104
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:02,519
Because, a horse with a rider makes
a deeper print than a horse without a rider.

105
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:05,856
If we're lucky,
the French will follow those ponies.

106
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:09,192
Here. Eat this.

107
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,904
I told you to eat something
back there.

108
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:16,367
Your stomach keeps growling like that, 
you'll have the whole French army on us.

109
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:18,497
You know these little noises can 
only be heard a few feet away.

110
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,497
Why are you so angry with me?
What have I done?

111
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:26,377
Well... maybe a nun ought not
be so good-lookin'.

112
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,130
The way I look is of no importance.

113
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,299
I'm married to
our Lord Jesus Christ.

114
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:36,929
That's exactly what I'm steamed up about,
if you'll pardon my being frank.

115
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:41,142
- I'm not offended, Brother Hogan.
- Oh, don't "Brother" me.

116
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:45,229
Excuse me.

117
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:13,382
Soldats, concentrez-vous de ce côté.

118
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:15,509
Les autres, avec moi.

119
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:33,986
They split up, damn it,
and they're catchin' up.

120
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:42,286
I wouldn't just sit there, move.

121
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:03,140
We can't outrun 'em.
You can get in there.

122
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:06,727
I may not shoot all of them
but I will get their attention.

123
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,146
You wait a bit, then 
head on out the other way.

124
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:12,650
You've been a wonderful friend,
Mr Hogan. Go with God.

125
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:15,569
Leave Him out of this, huh?
Get movin'.

- I do.

Good. Your late gentlemen friends
donated us some beans and coffee.

But first I'll scratch up
some firewood.

146
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,229
It's hard to believe that rattlesnake
could taste so delicious.

147
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:02,356
Here. Ladies first.

148
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:07,820
Thank you.

149
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:11,282
So you were headed north.
Any particular place?

150
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:15,828
I want to try to find a Juarista
band, I'll be safe with them.

151
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,747
- Where were you comin' from?
- Chihuahua.

152
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:23,586
- Chihuahua? You live there?
- Mm-hm, for several years.

153
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:28,382
- French garrison in Chihuahua.
- Mm-hm, right next to the church.

154
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,389
You wouldn't by any chance know
how many soldiers in the garrison?

155
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:38,601
- More or less.
- About 200 and some cannon.

156
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:42,313
How do you know all that?

157
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:46,859
The French officers wanted 
to learn to speak Spanish

158
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:51,781
so my mother superior assigned
the task to me, I also speak French.

159
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:55,326
I went into the garrison
three times a week.

160
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,245
I hate them. Oh, how I hate them.

161
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:03,626
- Ain't it a sin for nuns to hate?
- Not if it's something evil.

162
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,712
The French army killing and 
torturing the Mexican people,

163
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:10,007
trying to force them to 
become one of their colonies.

164
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:13,304
- How big is the garrison?
- Two stories. 

165
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,304
Years ago, it use to be a monastery.

166
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:19,433
- One of those kind of buildings with an open patio?
- A beautiful patio...

167
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:22,812
- A balcony around the top floor and
 a staircase leading down? - That's right.

168
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:26,941
You say it's next to a church.
How far apart are they exactly?

169
00:22:26,982 --> 00:22:30,903
I don't know exactly, but in some places 
not more than ten or twelve feet.

170
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:36,158
From the roof of the church, is the top floor 
of the garrison higher or lower?

171
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,828
- Lower. Much lower.
- Oh.

172
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,997
- Sentries?
- Day and night at the front gate.

173
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,418
Sister Sara,
you're gonna slow me up some,

174
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:49,922
but I'm gonna take you to one of those
guerrilla bands you're lookin' for.

175
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:54,176
- Do you belong to one of them?
- Till I get paid, yeah.

176
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:57,596
Paid? You mean in gold?

177
00:22:57,638 --> 00:23:00,474
Well, let's put it this way, 
if they pay me off in tortillas,

178
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:03,185
I'm gonna shoot 'em right in the eye.

179
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:06,564
But the Juaristas are too poor
to hire anybody.

180
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:13,195
I made a deal to work out
a plan to take the garrison.

181
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:16,240
If it pays off,
I get half the French treasury.

182
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:20,119
Then you don't have any sympathy
for their cause?

183
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:23,831
Not theirs or anybody else's.

184
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,587
See, I spent two years
in a war in the States.

185
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:32,631
Right now,
all I'm interested in is money.

186
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:37,428
If money is all you care about,
then why did you fight in that war?

187
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:42,183
Everybody's got a right
to be a sucker once.

188
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,478
- Mr Hogan.
- Hmm?

189
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,147
The 14th of July is a French holiday.

190
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:52,610
By noon of that day last year
the entire French garrison was drunk.

191
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,781
- What's the date today?
- July the 6th.

192
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:58,908
Beautiful.

193
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:02,203
That information
puts gold right in my pocket.

194
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:04,330
This calls for a drink.

195
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:08,292
Well, I'll be leaving you
for a few moments.

196
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:12,296
Be careful not to go too far,
there may be another rattler.

197
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:14,632
I'll pray as I walk.

198
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:19,053
I'll keep my back turned.
Don't worry.

199
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,806
You're a real gentleman, Mr Hogan.

200
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,588
I guess you haven't had much
experience sleeping on the ground.

201
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,715
Oh, I'm very tired. I'll sleep.

202
00:24:56,757 --> 00:25:00,177
For somebody who's wore out,
you sure got a happy look on your face.

203
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:03,806
It was a miracle you found me
when you did, Mr Hogan.

204
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:08,185
Oh, that was no miracle, just an accident
and life is full of 'em.

205
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:10,604
No. It was a miracle.

206
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:15,401
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:17,945
Two men are ridin' along
side by side,

208
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:22,241
a bullet ricochets off a rock,
kills one of them but doesn't kill the other...

209
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:24,368
Just an accident, that's all, no miracle.

210
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,871
Then you believe
there are no miracles?

211
00:25:26,912 --> 00:25:31,083
Well, um... Now, you take
that fella this morning.

212
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,044
He could've picked up
that stick of dynamite

213
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:36,839
and thrown it back at me
before I shot him.

214
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,592
Now, that would have been a miracle.

215
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:44,680
It's nice to hear you laugh, ma'am.

216
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,018
You think nuns don't laugh?

217
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:54,648
I don't know. I never
spent the night with one before.

218
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,571
Good night, Mr Hogan.

219
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:02,948
Thank you very much again, for everything.

220
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:26,555
Hey, wake up, Sister.

221
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:31,310
- Time to get movin'.
- Couldn't I sleep a little longer?

222
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:35,272
Not if you want to travel with me,
you don't.

223
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:38,526
I'm so stiff.

224
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:43,239
I'm not accustomed
to riding like that.

225
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,366
Would you please help me up?

226
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:51,205
Thank you.

227
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:54,582
Oh, my every muscle is aching.

228
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:58,212
How can I possibly ride again today?

229
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:01,549
I ride from sunup to sundown.

230
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,843
You either keep up or you don't.

231
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:09,181
You'll feel better when you spend 
a few hours on your mule.

232
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:14,728
You make very good coffee.

233
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,149
A man on his own
has to take care of himself.

234
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:21,819
- So you're not married?
- Nope.

235
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:23,946
- Ever been?
- Nope.

236
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:28,200
- Want to be?
- Nope.

237
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:31,954
- Don't you want a woman of your own?
- What for?

238
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:36,959
Share your name, bear your children,
be a companion?

239
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:40,588
To ask me to quit drinkin',
quit gamblin', save my money

240
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:44,175
and to bitch about her
aches and pains all day? No, thanks.

241
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:47,428
- Must be a lonely life.
- It's a great life.

242
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,223
Women when I want 'em
and none with the name of Hogan.

243
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:55,519
How about you, ma'am? Haven't you
ever wanted to be a whole woman?

244
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,939
Have a man make love to you?
Have children?

245
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:01,192
I've chosen a different way of life.

246
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:06,614
What about when you get those feelings your god
gave every woman, including you?

247
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:10,618
- You know I've always wondered about that.
- Well, we're human, of course.

248
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:14,455
When we get those feelings,
we pray until they pass.

249
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,376
In your case,
just how much praying does that take?

250
00:28:19,418 --> 00:28:23,839
What about before you became a nun?
Did you ever have a man?

251
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:25,633
No.

252
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:28,969
- Ever been kissed by one?
- No.

253
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:33,099
Haven't you ever laid awake at night 
wondering what it would be like?

254
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,475
No.

255
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:37,978
All the women I've ever met
were natural-born liars

256
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,107
but I never knew about nuns till now.

257
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:43,651
You're right. I lied.

258
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,987
I'll say one thing, Sister.

259
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,532
I sure woulda liked to have
met up with you

260
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:52,535
before you took to them clothes
and them vows.

261
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:19,979
That limp's getting worse.

262
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:27,695
Stone bruised.

263
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:33,367
It'll take a week
for that to heal up.

264
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,289
Maybe the people in this village
will hide you out

265
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,666
until this animal comes around.

266
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,754
- Why couldn't I ride the packhorse?
- Because, he carries my equipment, that's why.

267
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,757
I ain't about to miss
bein' in Chihuahua on the 14th.

268
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:51,552
- Please, Brother Hogan...
- Look, I told you not to "Brother" me.

269
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:58,225
All right, Mr Mule. You know you were right.
You are as stubborn as my mule.

270
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:02,438
When we get up to that village,
Sister, then I'll say adiós.

271
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,065
This is where we part company.

272
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:27,004
- Now what are you doin'?
- I must say a prayer at this shrine.

273
00:30:27,046 --> 00:30:29,548
You said your prayers last night and this morning. 
You're going to wear them out.

274
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,676
It's a sin to pass a shrine
without praying.

275
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:35,971
- Not if you shut your eyes, it isn't.
- Please, Mr Hogan.

276
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:39,892
All right, it's a small shrine,
let's make it a small prayer.

277
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,986
Buenos días, hermana.

278
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:31,318
You see, Mr Hogan,
what a little prayer can do?

279
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,696
The Lord provided me 
with a kind gentleman

280
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:36,740
who accepted my mule in exchange 
for this creature of God.

281
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:39,577
Now I can still be with you.

282
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:41,704
Your mule for that burro?

283
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:45,583
Well, if that kind gentleman
traded you even,

284
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:48,961
you won't be meeting up with him
in heaven.

285
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,763
25 centavos la rebanada de papaya.

286
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,810
Gracias.

287
00:33:37,403 --> 00:33:40,114
This man lives in the hills there.

288
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:44,452
Three hours ago on his way to the
market he passed a French patrol.

289
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:46,579
Which way were they headed?

290
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,999
- ¿A qué dirección iba marchando?
- En esa dirección.

291
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,004
Get the supplies
we need and move out.

292
00:33:59,022 --> 00:34:02,996
<font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font> <i>horse whinnies<i/> <font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font>

293
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:11,604
- I want you up in that tree.
- What tree? Why?

294
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:17,359
Please, Mr Hogan, looking down
from heights frightens me.

295
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:18,944
Then look up.

296
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:23,783
I think there's a mountain lion
around here and I want you up here.

297
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,243
Excuse me, Sister.

298
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:47,932
What are you doing?

299
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:52,019
If you can't see him,
you can't shoot him.

300
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,992
How are you doin', Sister?

301
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:10,788
- Looking up.
- Good.

302
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,957
We won't talk now.

303
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:16,710
I'd like him to make his run
if he's going to.

Who the hell are these people?

308

310
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:59,628
Come on, get down from there.
Turn around, I'll catch you.

311
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:12,850
Amigos, ¿qué hacen ustedes
aquí de noche?

312
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:16,937
Venimos huyendo de los franceses
que están en la estación de Satevo.

313
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:19,565
Están esperando el tren
de Santa María.

314
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,692
What she say about Santa Maria?

315
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:26,155
They are running away from the French soldiers 
at Satevo waiting for a train for Santa Maria.

316
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,464
Santa Maria's the town I'm headed for.

317
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:31,774
Those Juaristas I had that deal with 
are hiding out there, somewhere.

318
00:36:31,786 --> 00:36:34,663
You got to find out why the French
are going there.

319
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:37,374
All right. You can be sure I will.

320
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:42,129
All right, Satevo's a long way away,
so let's get some sleep.

321
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,256
Muchas gracias, pobrecitos.

322
00:36:44,298 --> 00:36:48,677
- Hasta mañana.
- Adiós, hermana.

323
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,389
By the way, Sister,
I guess I owe you an apology.

324
00:36:52,431 --> 00:36:55,184
When I was trying to get you
up the tree there, I...

325
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:58,395
Oh, no apology is necessary,
Mr Hogan.

326
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:02,191
In emergencies,
the Church grants dispensation.

327
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:07,238
Anyways, it's no sin that you pushed me up
the tree with your hands on my ass.

328
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:13,452
Where'd you learn
that kind of English?

329
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:15,247
- What kind?
- Ass.

330
00:37:16,288 --> 00:37:18,374
Oh, in the convent.

331
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:22,253
Sister Harriet taught us
words for different parts of the body.

332
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:25,047
This part she called the ass.

333
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:29,427
Where is this Sister Harriet from,
anyway?

334
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:31,637
New Orleans. Why?

335
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:37,726
I'd sure as hell like to know
what she did before she became a nun.

336
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:41,689
En arme!

337
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,899

338
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:55,202
- Bonjour, ma soeur.
- Que Dieu vous bénisse.

Ma soeur. Ma soeur, s'il vous plaît.

353
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:03,330
- Venez avec moi.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

354
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:06,792
Please. An officer is dying.
Come with me, please.

355
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:09,920
- Prenez garde de son animal.
- Oui, mon capitaine.

356
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:16,218
Even though you are not a priest, you
can give him some spiritual comfort.

357
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:20,598
Our colonel is very, very ill.

358
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:27,855
Il est sur le point de mourir.

359
00:40:27,897 --> 00:40:31,442
Docteur,
permettez que la soeur le bénisse.

360
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,767
Deliver his soul
into your soul,

361
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:07,311
Mary Mother of God...

362
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:25,204
C'est toi. You filthy bitch!

363
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:28,289
Kiss the cross. Kiss the cross.

364
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,126
Sister, he was delirious.
You must forgive him.

365
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:35,964
I forgive him.
I forgive him with all my heart.

366
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:43,346
Now he is with God.

367
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:11,208
God damn it!

368
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:20,217
I don't see how
you can drink this stuff.

369
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,137
You're gonna get cockeyed drunk!
What happened down there?

370
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,307
I was recognised,
that's what happened.

371
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:31,020
- By who?
- I've never been so frightened.

372
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,147
I had visions of being shot.

373
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:36,358
- Who recognised you? What did he do?
- He died.

374
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,403
What the hell are you talking about?

375
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:42,907
I was asked to give spiritual comfort
to one of the colonels who was dying of fever.

376
00:42:42,948 --> 00:42:47,536
When I saw him I nearly fainted, he was one of 
the officers I taught Spanish at the fort in Chihuahua.

377
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:51,040
Oh, thank God none of the others
believed what he called me.

378
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:54,168
What did he call you?

379
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,295
A filthy Juarista.

380
00:42:56,337 --> 00:43:00,341
All right, so he died and you're safe.
Now, what did you find out?

381
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:04,095
They're waiting for a train
due today for Santa Maria

382
00:43:04,136 --> 00:43:07,640
so they can load it
with supplies and ammunition.

383
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:13,020
Well, you did all right, Sister.

384
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:16,690
Between here and Santa Maria
there's got to be a gorge.

385
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:19,443
Where there's a gorge
there has to be a trestle.

386
00:43:19,485 --> 00:43:22,780
Hell, all we got to do is make sure 
we get there before the train does.

387
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:24,323
Will you burn it?

388
00:43:24,365 --> 00:43:27,493
I'll blow it to hell and gone 
with the train on it!

389
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:31,372
Come on, get up. You're gonna have to ride,
or else I'll have to leave you.

390
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,870
- I am not intoxicated.

391
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,293
- You ought to be.That's a whole 
hell of a lot of whiskey before breakfast.

392
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:39,588
My faith in God
will turn it to water.

393
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:50,891
We'd better hurry. I've never seen
a train blown to hell and gone, before.

397
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:07,134
Put it away. These are Yaquis.

398

They're wild and pagan but
the Church has reached some of them.

I think so. I think so.

401
00:45:26,445 --> 00:45:28,697
Then tell me when you're on it.

402
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,882
Be very careful not to show any pain
or weakness.

403
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:56,434
- You have to stop that when 
you get closer. Are you on?

- About an hour.

414

All right. I want you to cut a groove

Gunpowder, that's right.

is near my heart

438
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:05,831
More whiskey.

439
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,073
That's the last bottle you got.

440
00:49:39,115 --> 00:49:41,117
Last one?

441
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:43,661
Oh, that's bad news, Sister.

442
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:48,707
I'm sorry I can't share any with you
but you've got to have a steady hand.

451
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,528
Cut the shaft off right there.

00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,822
- Cut it?

May I break it?

460
00:50:51,353 --> 00:50:54,607
All right. How much time's gone by?

461
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:58,235
- Over an hour.
- Oh, that damn train.

462
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:00,863
That train is on its way,
I know it is.

463
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:05,075
Remember what I told you
about accidents?

464
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:08,871
We didn't have to run across
those damn Yaquis but we did.

465
00:51:08,913 --> 00:51:12,249
No miracle,
just a rotten, lousy accident

466
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:15,169
that's gonna cost me my whole deal.

467
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:19,173
Get me up straight.
Get me up straight.

468
00:51:23,135 --> 00:51:25,971
You are a beautiful woman,
Sister Sara.

469
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:30,893
You feel like a beautiful woman,
you smell like beautiful woman.

470
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:35,106
- Please, Mr Hogan.
- I can't help thinking,

471
00:51:35,147 --> 00:51:39,318
that first time I saw you
and you were almost naked...

472
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,114
- You must forget that.
- I can't, my beautiful Sister.

473
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:45,783
I don't want to forget.

474
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:50,871
Every night when we bed down next to
each other I think of you that way

475
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:55,918
and I want to reach out and touch you
and hold you and feel you.

476
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,839
I forgive you because I know
that if you weren't drunk...

477
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,049
Maybe. Maybe so.

478
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:05,469
But you can't stop
a man from wishing.

479
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:08,055
I sure wish you weren't a nun.

480
00:52:08,097 --> 00:52:10,182
Please, Mr Hogan.

481
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,727
All right.

482
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:17,398
Get me some gunpowder
out of my saddle bag.

483
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:23,696
Don't come near me till I tell you.

484
00:52:32,913 --> 00:52:34,999
Pour some in your hand...

485
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,794
And leave the pouch there.

486
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:53,476
Fill the groove. Fill the groove.

487
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:03,694
That's fine.

488
00:53:03,736 --> 00:53:06,489
All right, now comes the hard part.

489
00:53:09,074 --> 00:53:11,285
Cuz ...we gotta time this perfect.

490
00:53:12,828 --> 00:53:15,581
As soon as I light the powder,

491
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:20,211
you drive the arrow through me
and pull it out the other side.

492
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,841
What do I hit it with?

493
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:31,013
Take the knife,
put the flat part over the end...

494
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,103
And hit it with the gun.

495
00:53:39,313 --> 00:53:41,524
And please, Sister Sara,

496
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:45,736
please hit it a straight blow,
not a glancing one, huh?

497
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,327
What if I don't hit it straight?

498
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:58,541
The hell with that,
my beautiful Sister.

499
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,378
The arrow will break off inside me.

500
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,132
Now, I know you're
an A-1 gravedigger but...

501
00:54:06,173 --> 00:54:09,427
All right.
What do I do with the moss?

502
00:54:09,468 --> 00:54:13,764
Plug the holes ...both sides.

503
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:16,725
Push it in about a half-inch.

504
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,644
All right.

505
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,815
One last swallow
and it's up to you, Doc.

506
00:54:32,074 --> 00:54:36,120
- Prayin' for me?
- Yes.

507
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:39,081
Well, then I must be drunk enough.

508
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:45,045
Damn my eyes,
I find that kind of touchin'.

509
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,054
One last thing, Sister.

510
00:54:54,096 --> 00:54:58,017
The powder will flare up
when I light it, so watch yourself.

511
00:54:58,058 --> 00:55:00,436
Now, you can load up the animals.

512
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:05,065
We'll be on our way as soon
as you get this stick out of me.

513
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:18,996
Ready?

514
00:55:33,427 --> 00:55:36,097
Ooh.

515
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,527
Mr Hogan!

516
00:55:53,948 --> 00:55:58,577
Mr Hogan... Mr Hogan, remember the train? 
The train with the French supplies.

517
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:00,913
You have to blow it up.

518
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:06,419
- How long since I been hit?
- Hours.

519
00:56:07,336 --> 00:56:08,879
What?

520
00:56:08,921 --> 00:56:12,425
- You fell unconscious.
- Why didn't you wake me up?

521
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:17,012
- I thought you were...
- You thought. You thought. The hell you thought.

522
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:20,724
You let me down, Sister.
You let me down.

523
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:24,979
Then why don't you get on your horse?

524
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,106
Because...

525
00:56:36,282 --> 00:56:40,453
You're too drunk to ride alone.
I'll have to get on with you.

526
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:43,622
Hold on to the mane.

527
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:55,468
Lean back against me. Lean back.

528
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,473
Tell your horse to get moving.

529
00:57:00,514 --> 00:57:04,518
I like being in the arms
of a good-looking nun.

530
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:07,938
How do you like it, Sister?

531
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,733
The Church allows this
for the sake of your safety

532
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:12,943
but you may not take liberties.

533
00:57:12,985 --> 00:57:16,947
I apologise, ma'am.
I most sincerely do.

534
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:42,431
Will you look at
that trestle? Couldn't be sweeter.

535
00:57:42,473 --> 00:57:46,769
- It's a miracle.
- A great place for an accident.

536
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:55,528
Is this small package of dynamite
powerful enough?

537
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:57,780
Not if you put it 
down here at the base

538
00:57:57,822 --> 00:58:01,200
If you put it up high
on those braces - pow!

539
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:09,792
How can you climb that trestle
with your shoulder...?

540
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:17,883
- Oh, no, oh no, Mr Hogan. No.
- Now, wait a minute.

541
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:21,637
- Wait a minute, remember I saved your life.
- I saved yours today, too.

542
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,056
Well, I saved yours twice from the French.
Now remember that.

543
00:58:24,098 --> 00:58:26,308
I saved yours twice - remember the arrow?

544
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:30,438
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
desert me in my hour of need?

545
00:58:30,479 --> 00:58:33,858
What about that deadly rattlesnake
when you were hiding from them soldiers?

546
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:36,110
That was easy, that was no risk at all.

547
00:58:36,152 --> 00:58:39,363
Did I or did I not come to you
in your hour of need?

548
00:58:39,405 --> 00:58:41,490
Now, this is my hour of need.

549
00:58:41,532 --> 00:58:46,620
What kind of need is your need?
All you ever have on your mind is money.

550
00:58:46,662 --> 00:58:49,165
What's more important than that?

551
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:52,585
My life.
If I climb that trestle, I'll fall.

552
00:58:52,626 --> 00:58:56,964
A fine psalm-singing hypocrite
you are.

553
00:58:57,006 --> 00:59:00,593
The French are gonna slaughter
a whole outfit of your Juaristas

554
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:03,345
and you're the only one
who can help 'em

555
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:06,724
and you won't climb one lousy,
stinkin' trestle.

556
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:12,188
That's right, Sister, you lean on it.

557
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:15,316
A little of that good,
old-fashioned Christian faith

558
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:17,735
will carry you up there like a bird.

559
00:59:17,777 --> 00:59:22,114
I know you're scared, Sara,
but those braces are easy to climb.

560
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:27,244
You just keep thinking of all those
Christian lives you are going to be saving.

561
00:59:27,286 --> 00:59:31,165
Have faith in that wonderful shiny cross
and God and all those saints

562
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:33,292
will be right up there with you.

563
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:37,171
Suppose they are up there with me when I climb up there 
you haven't told me how you'll set this off when I...

564
00:59:37,213 --> 00:59:41,008
Let me worry about that. I'll do it
with my rifle. Now you get going.

565
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:44,261
Surely that train's on its way.

566
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:06,742
Keep goin'.

567
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,169
I want the dynamite all the way up on top
so I can get a clear shot at it.

568
01:00:23,759 --> 01:00:26,387
That's it, Sister.

569
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:06,821
You're entitled,
you certainly are entitled,

570
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:10,950
but I never did see anybody
get used to hard liquor so fast.

571
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:14,745
I want to take a few practice shots
without ammunition.

572
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:18,791
You turn around and face the bridge.
Come on, turn around.

573
01:02:22,253 --> 01:02:24,338
Just like that.

574
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:30,761
Now, when I tell you to,

575
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:34,014
I want you to take a deep breath
and hold it.

576
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:37,768
Come on, grab the end of the barrel.
This ain't easy.

577
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,229
Take your fingers off the top of it.

578
01:02:42,273 --> 01:02:45,609
All right, now take a deep breath.
Hold it.

579
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:51,449
- You wouldn't have hit that dynamite.
- Yes, I would've.

580
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:54,882
- No, I saw the end of the gun move when 
you pulled the trigger. - Look, I'd have hit it.

581
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,830
Put out your hand.
Let's see how steady it is.

582
01:02:57,872 --> 01:03:00,624
Oh, you're still drunk,
you'll never hit that.

583
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:02,960
- I'll hit it.
- Put a bullet in it.

584
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:07,047
And let's see if you can hit
something about the same size.

585
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:11,260
That little rock over there,
the one on top of the big rock,

586
01:03:11,302 --> 01:03:14,263
let's see if you can hit that.

587
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:16,265
Will you cock this for me?

588
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:20,311
Pull down that lever as hard as
you can, then slam it shut.

589
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:27,026
Perfect. All right. Yeah.

590
01:03:29,862 --> 01:03:32,656
Now... take a breath.

591
01:03:39,663 --> 01:03:41,749
Now cock it again.

592
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:46,796
We'd better try it
with you sitting and me kneeling.

593
01:03:46,837 --> 01:03:49,006
Go ahead. Get down.

594
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:52,343
This ain't easy, now.

595
01:03:53,552 --> 01:03:56,222
All right, take a breath.

596
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:09,318
Can you shoot?

597
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,321
No, I can't shoot and you made 
me climb that thing for nothing!

598
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:15,991
Take it easy, just wait a minute.
I'm sobering up fast.

599
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:19,411
Meanwhile,
you fix me a cup of hot coffee.

600
01:04:19,436 --> 01:04:25,238
<font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font> <i>Train whistle<i/> <font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font>

601
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:28,796
I'll fix you some hot coffee!

602
01:04:33,843 --> 01:04:37,763
Sober up! You sober up,
you dirty bastard or I'll kill you!

603
01:04:37,805 --> 01:04:39,890
Sit up!

604
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,399
Now, tell me when to hold my breath.

605
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:53,446
Dear Mary, Mother of God, help this
no-good atheist to shoot straight.

606
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:55,406
Hold your breath.

607
01:05:02,746 --> 01:05:04,957
Hold your breath.

608
01:05:25,728 --> 01:05:27,813
What did I tell you?

609
01:05:30,775 --> 01:05:35,946
Did I or did I not
hear you call me a bastard?

610
01:05:35,988 --> 01:05:39,575
Well, I suppose whiskey
can make a man hear anything.

611
01:05:39,617 --> 01:05:42,036
Dear Lord, forgive him
for the impurity of his thoughts.

612
01:05:45,915 --> 01:05:49,877
Ah, there's the cantina I'm looking for.
I may need your help.

613
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:53,214
- Is it alright for you to go into a saloon?
- In times like this...

614
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:56,258
the Church grants dispensations,
I know.

615
01:06:22,701 --> 01:06:24,666
- Buenas tardes, senor. 
- Buenas tardes, hermana.

616
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:26,610
¿Habla inglés?

617
01:06:26,622 --> 01:06:30,418
- Yes, I am speaking English.
- Good. Tequila.

618
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:35,548
- Oh. Would you like something?
- Do you have lemonade?

619
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:39,385
I'll have lemonade.
You're gonna get drunk again, are you?

620
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:42,888
Oh, I never get drunk
unless I'm shot by Yaquis.

621
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:47,143
- Then why the tequila?
- Just to oil up my arm. That's all.

622
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:55,151
I don't think they've seen a nun
in here for quite some time.

623
01:06:55,192 --> 01:06:58,112
Not one like you, that's for sure.

624
01:07:03,033 --> 01:07:05,119
- Gracias.
- Hey!

625
01:07:05,161 --> 01:07:08,789
- Any of these men in here speak English?
- No, señor.

626
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:11,083
- You're sure?
- Sure. Me only.

627
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:17,131
Good. Well, I'd like to order a bottle
of French champagne, year 1789.

628
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:22,678
French champagne, 1789.

629
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,015
- What is it, señor?
- What's what?

630
01:07:26,056 --> 01:07:28,142
This "champagne"?

631
01:07:29,185 --> 01:07:33,272
Is there another 
El Gato Negro saloon in this town?

632
01:07:33,314 --> 01:07:36,192
- Are you the owner of this one?
- No.

633
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:39,487
- Well, who is?
- Mi padre. My father.

634
01:07:39,528 --> 01:07:42,698
- When does he get here?
- Psst.

635
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,825
Por favor, señor.

636
01:07:47,036 --> 01:07:49,205
That's swell, that's my luck.

637
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:52,833
They give me a code
and the man who has it isn't here.

638
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:55,795
He'll probably show up
on the 15th of July.

639
01:07:57,004 --> 01:08:01,217
Mr Hogan, you should be happy
you're still alive.

640
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:03,594
What do you want from your life anyway?

641
01:08:03,636 --> 01:08:06,138
A ranch? Cattle? What do you want?

642
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:08,265
A ranch?

643
01:08:09,475 --> 01:08:12,686
You mean get up at sunrise,
go to bed at sunset?

644
01:08:12,728 --> 01:08:17,066
Rear end in the saddle all day?
No, thanks, Sister, I'd rather be dead.

645
01:08:18,234 --> 01:08:22,154
No Sister, there's this town called
San Francisco that's booming.

646
01:08:22,196 --> 01:08:24,281
And if I get this stake,

647
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:28,744
Well, I'm gonna open up myself the biggest
gambling saloon in the whole area

648
01:08:28,786 --> 01:08:32,832
with long, red mahogany bars
and green felt tables

649
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:37,795
and we'll play roulette, dice, faro
and all those wonderful games.

650
01:08:37,837 --> 01:08:42,466
I realise that doesn't mean much
to you but to me, that's living.

651
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:45,636
Some men have strange desires.

652
01:08:47,263 --> 01:08:51,350
- Where the hell's your father?
- Señor, he is sick. Enfermo.

653
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,727
It's important I see him.
Where is he?

654
01:08:53,769 --> 01:08:56,605
Since three days now,
he cannot talk.

655
01:08:56,647 --> 01:08:58,858
All this time, no move.

656
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:01,735
- Does he understand you when you talk to him?
- Sí, señor.

657
01:09:01,777 --> 01:09:03,779
Does he understand English?

658
01:09:03,821 --> 01:09:08,951
Not so good like me but...
my mother, she with him.

659
01:09:08,993 --> 01:09:11,120
Un memento. Madre!

660
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:28,262
He no can speak.

661
01:09:28,304 --> 01:09:31,599
- May we see him?
- Bien, hermana.

662
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,268
Please to come.

663
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,955
Francisco.

664
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:02,963
Can you understand me, señor?

665
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:08,385
That means yes.

666
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:13,516
I need a bottle of French champagne,
year 1789.

667
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:20,773
I must see Colonel Beltran at once.

668
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:24,026
Can you take me to where his camp is?

669
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,616
What about your son?
Can he take me there?

670
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:35,121
Does anybody in this town
know where the camp is?

671
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:46,382
Don Ezekiel, el hacendado.

672
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:54,682
¿Horacio, el velero?

673
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:05,316
The Candle- maker. 
She says the candle-maker knows.

674
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:25,337
In Mexico when somebody die or is killed
on the road, we put crosses.

675
01:11:25,379 --> 01:11:29,300
So these crosses not make anybody
think anything.

676
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:31,719
Now, we go that way.

677
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:35,347
- How far, Horacio?
- Not far.

678
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,627
Put away your gun, gringo.

679
01:12:11,592 --> 01:12:14,637
Name's Hogan. Beltran's expecting me.

680
01:12:14,678 --> 01:12:17,515
You mean Colonel Beltran.

681
01:12:17,556 --> 01:12:21,936
Colonel, general, what difference
does it make? Take me to him.

682
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:29,276
Síganme.

683
01:14:46,705 --> 01:14:51,877
I have been waiting for you, Hogan.
What happened to you?

684
01:14:51,919 --> 01:14:54,255
I stopped a Yaquis arrow.

685
01:14:54,296 --> 01:14:57,508
- That means you never got to Chihuahua?
- Nope.

686
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:00,678
Sister Sara here saved me
a good part of the trip.

687
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,722
Sister? How?

688
01:15:03,764 --> 01:15:07,184
- Is the deal still on?
- I keep to my word. And you?

689
01:15:07,226 --> 01:15:10,563
Good. You get me a bottle of tequila

690
01:15:10,604 --> 01:15:14,358
and I'll lay you out a plan
as smooth as a baby's behind.

691
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,070
You tell me the plan,
I will tell you how smooth it is.

692
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:24,869
<i>The roof of the garrison
is lower than the roof of the church<i/>

693
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:28,414
<i>and on the 14th of July
you have promised us, Sister,<i/>

694
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:30,708
<i>all the Frenchmen will be drunk.<i/>

695
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:34,962
Not bad, Hogan. Not bad.
Thank you, Sister.

696
01:15:35,004 --> 01:15:37,089
Yeah, we make quite a team.

697
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:41,844
After we pull this off, we might go in
the garrison business again, right?

698
01:15:41,886 --> 01:15:46,140
If we follow what you did to
the train by capturing the garrison,

699
01:15:46,182 --> 01:15:50,352
- all of my people will take heart.
- How many men do you have?

700
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:53,856
40, but there'll be more
by the time we reach Chihuahua.

701
01:15:53,898 --> 01:15:56,817
- How many more?
- 50 to 60.

702
01:15:56,859 --> 01:16:00,738
- I thought you were a colonel of the Mexican army.
- I am.

703
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:04,909
Any army I ever heard about,
a colonel commands a full regiment.

704
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,287
Yes, and a parade but not after all the fighting
we've been through.

705
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:13,084
When you got me into this thing,
you told me you had no artillery.

706
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:16,921
- What about dynamite? You have any of that?
- None.

707
01:16:16,962 --> 01:16:21,050
Less than a hundred rifles,
a few machetes and not much more.

708
01:16:21,092 --> 01:16:24,220
Even drunk, the French are going 
to blow your heads off.

709
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:29,350
You don't know my men. 
Each one of them tough, courageous, a Mexican patriot.

710
01:16:32,812 --> 01:16:36,565
Isn't that sweet?
But I happen to be a Hogan patriot

711
01:16:36,607 --> 01:16:39,110
and I'd like to have some dynamite 
working with me.

712
01:16:39,151 --> 01:16:43,864
I will welcome all you can get, you show me 
the tree it's growing on, I'll have my men pick it.

713
01:16:43,906 --> 01:16:47,701
Probably plenty for sale
across the border in Texas.

714
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,621
Yeah, but that takes money.

715
01:16:50,663 --> 01:16:54,375
Even the food you ate
and that bottle were donated to us.

716
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:57,336
Bien.
We leave for Chihuahua tomorrow.

717
01:16:57,378 --> 01:17:01,048
You can come with us
and fight under my orders, my way,

718
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:04,510
or go back to that Texas bar
that I found you in.

719
01:17:08,431 --> 01:17:12,601
I'm in on this deal and no son
of a bitch is taking me out of it.

720
01:17:22,987 --> 01:17:27,908
If any other bastard spoke to me
like that, he would be dead.

721
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,286
But since you have helped Mexico,

722
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:35,207
I am giving you a chance to get on
your horse and leave this camp alive.

723
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:41,422
- Now get out of here fast.
- I ain't leavin' here.

724
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:48,137
Colonel, please. This ring,
it's gold. It'll buy dynamite.

725
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,724
Perhaps some of your people
have other things that could be sold.

726
01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:56,145
If someone shows me back to Santa Maria, 
I'll go from house to house tonight begging for help.

727
01:17:56,187 --> 01:18:00,357
Dynamite would save the lives
of some of my men.

728
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:04,820
I told you
I was staying in this deal, Colonel,

729
01:18:04,862 --> 01:18:10,409
cuz you know nobody over in Texas is gonna
sell a load of dynamite to a Mexican.

730
01:18:12,495 --> 01:18:16,248
I am asking you,
buy dynamite for us.

731
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:19,668
I'd love to.

732
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:23,714
Oh, Sister.
You better sew this back on.

733
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:31,555
You don't want to have those people
see you going around half-dressed.

734
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,186
This is better than
killing each other, no?

735
01:18:37,228 --> 01:18:41,857
I only figured there was gonna be
one funeral - Catholic.

736
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:46,612
Oh? I didn't know
that you were Catholic.

737
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:16,972

738
01:19:23,816 --> 01:19:27,987
- ¿Cómo le fue, hermana?
- Muy bien. Magnífico.

739
01:19:31,824 --> 01:19:33,826
Hogan.

740
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:37,913
Easy, Hogan. There are no
Yaquis arrows here, just a nun.

741
01:19:43,377 --> 01:19:46,046
- How did you do?
- I'm not sure.

742
01:19:46,088 --> 01:19:49,467
You must know if
you've got something worthwhile.

743
01:19:49,508 --> 01:19:52,845
I just don't know how much
it'll bring in Texas.

744
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,517
You don't?

745
01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:02,563
This will buy enough
dynamite to give my horse a rupture.

746
01:20:02,605 --> 01:20:05,649
You did real well for me, Sister.

747
01:20:05,691 --> 01:20:09,111
Uh... for the cause.

748
01:20:10,529 --> 01:20:15,409
Maybe this will buy you a bottle of
medicine to keep your arm well-oiled.

749
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:17,578
- Can you give this?
- I want to.

750
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,874
I like you better as a Juarista
than as a nun, little Sister.

751
01:20:24,543 --> 01:20:27,505
Well, I'll just see you in Chihuahua.

752
01:20:27,546 --> 01:20:32,843
Right. If we take the fort,
we'll owe ourselves a celebration.

753
01:20:32,885 --> 01:20:36,222
I might even put a little whiskey
in your lemonade.

754
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:39,517
- Mr. Hogan, there is something I'd like to talk to you about...
- They are bringing your horses now.

755
01:20:39,558 --> 01:20:43,312
My packhorse has some handguns
and some Winchesters.

756
01:20:43,354 --> 01:20:46,440
- I'm sure you'll know what to do with them.
- Gracias.

757
01:20:46,482 --> 01:20:49,568
A gift from some old friends
of Sister Sara's.

758
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:53,030
- Saquen las armas en la remonta.
- Could we talk?

759
01:20:53,072 --> 01:20:57,952
I can't, Sister. I need every second
to get where I'm going.

760
01:20:59,078 --> 01:21:01,163
Where are we gonna meet up?

761
01:21:01,205 --> 01:21:05,709
Just outside of Chihuahua riding
south, there is a little church.

762
01:21:05,751 --> 01:21:09,505
Be there as early as you can
on the morning of the 14th.

763
01:21:09,547 --> 01:21:11,465
Good riding.

764
01:21:11,507 --> 01:21:15,594
Don't let those French spend
that money before we can get there.

765
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:17,972
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye.

766
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:39,845
- Hello, Mr Hogan.
- How do, Sister?

767
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:43,933
- Glad to see you're back safe.
- Waiting for the dynamite, huh?

768
01:22:43,974 --> 01:22:46,519
- Uh ..huh. And you.
- What, me personal?

769
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,854
- Mm, I missed you.
- Yeah.

770
01:22:48,896 --> 01:22:53,776
Well, to tell you the truth, it felt kinda wrong the 
past few days not having your burro slowing me up.

771
01:22:55,027 --> 01:22:57,655
- Did it?
- Yeah, damn it.

772
01:22:57,696 --> 01:22:59,657
What's the matter?

773
01:23:01,075 --> 01:23:04,662
Well, you see,
there's a problem, Sister...

774
01:23:04,703 --> 01:23:08,499
I should have never met up with you
in the first place.

775
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:10,626
Come, Beltran's waiting.

776
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:47,872
Where have you been, Hogan? There are
only a few more hours of daylight.

777
01:23:47,913 --> 01:23:51,667
Well, I had to go to three towns to get it, but
I've got all the dynamite we need,

778
01:23:51,709 --> 01:23:53,586
plus plenty of cigars.

779
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:57,923
Ignacio. Agarra esa dinamita y
llévese a los hombres del campamento.

780
01:23:57,965 --> 01:24:00,468
Salimos para la iglesia enseguida.

781
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:02,803
My men will leave for 
the church in a few hours.

782
01:24:02,845 --> 01:24:07,349
- How many men do you have?
- Over 100. Let us go.

783
01:25:00,026 --> 01:25:08,232
<font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font> <i>church bell ringing<i/> <font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font>

784
01:27:46,777 --> 01:27:48,863
The garrison's on that side.

785
01:27:48,904 --> 01:27:52,408
They must be drunk already,
I don't hear any singing out there.

786
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:54,702
Agachados y en una sola fila.

787
01:27:54,743 --> 01:27:56,829
Hogan.

788
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:06,422
Préparez-vous!

789
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:10,509
En avant. Marche!

790
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:12,722
En avant. En avant.

791
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:34,200
Nobody's drunk.
Nobody's even drinking there.

792
01:28:34,241 --> 01:28:35,951
You got your calendars mixed up, Sister.

793
01:28:35,993 --> 01:28:39,114
- No, I didn't. It is their independence Day, July the 14th.
- What went wrong?

794
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:43,000
It is the train you blew up.
It put them on the alert.

795
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:46,629
To attack now would be suicide.
Surprise is impossible.

796
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:50,257
Without the element of surprise,
I would never attack superior forces.

797
01:28:50,299 --> 01:28:52,676
Instead of giving up so easy,
why don't you just listen to me.

798
01:28:52,718 --> 01:28:57,389
I am listening to you, but I have my mind
on my men, all you have on yours is money.

799
01:28:57,431 --> 01:28:59,642
Alright, listen, I think I know 
how we can get a surprise.

800
01:28:59,683 --> 01:29:03,604
Three streets from here there is a house.
It use to be the residence of the bishop.

801
01:29:03,646 --> 01:29:06,607
To protect him in the rainy season
there was a tunnel.

802
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:09,819
It led from the house to the garrison
when it used to be a monastery.

803
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:14,615
And after the bishop moved, the monks built a wall,
closing it up. I think you can break through.

804
01:29:14,657 --> 01:29:17,827
- Who lives in there now?
- Very good friends of mine.

805
01:29:17,868 --> 01:29:20,871
- Trustworthy?
- Yes. Very trustworthy.

806
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:23,499
Good, then I got something that'll work.

807
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:25,668
- What?
- Fire.

808
01:29:25,709 --> 01:29:28,921
Hey, when you were giving
those Spanish lessons,

809
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:32,967
you ever get a peek at
where they kept the garrison money?

810
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:50,109
They used to pay me from a strongbox
in the general's office.

811
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,653
Second floor in that building right over there.

812
01:29:52,695 --> 01:29:55,698
Was it iron or wood?
Iron.

813
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:58,868
Great. That means it won't burn.

814
01:29:58,909 --> 01:30:03,789
Now, I figure we separate
your men into four groups,

815
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,333
giving them coal oil and dynamite,

816
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:09,128
and let the first group
hit that main gate.

817
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:13,007
The second group goes through that tunnel 
that she is talking about into the courtyard.

818
01:30:13,048 --> 01:30:15,676
The third group
hits that gate over there.

819
01:30:15,718 --> 01:30:20,556
The fourth group, the fourth group made up of your
best riflemen, we'll have right up here.

820
01:30:20,598 --> 01:30:24,769
They can pick off the sentries
and set fire to the top of the garrison.

821
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:27,564
Of course this all has to happen
at the same time.

822
01:30:27,606 --> 01:30:31,274
First we shall wait for the cover of night. 
- Alright.

823
01:30:31,317 --> 01:30:33,460
And second, 

824
01:30:33,472 --> 01:30:36,530
some women and children carrying 
a piñata filled with dynamite

825
01:30:36,542 --> 01:30:39,908
might get close enough to that front gate.

826
01:30:39,949 --> 01:30:42,869
What's a piñata?

827
01:30:42,911 --> 01:30:46,164
It's an old Mexican way
of livening up a party.

828
01:30:46,206 --> 01:30:49,082
Come, come.

829
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:08,062
Atáquense, una monja.

830
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:16,612
- Sarita, baby!
- Rosanna!

831
01:31:16,654 --> 01:31:20,866
You are safe.
They didn't get you!

832
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:23,285
They didn't get my favourite girl!

833
01:31:24,995 --> 01:31:27,581
Sister Sara, this here's a cathouse.

834
01:31:27,623 --> 01:31:30,835
Oh, no, Hogan. This is no cathouse.

835
01:31:30,876 --> 01:31:34,797
It's the best whorehouse in town.

836
01:31:37,007 --> 01:31:39,760
Day and night, night and day, 
out there in that desert,

837
01:31:39,802 --> 01:31:41,887
you made a sucker out of me?

838
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:44,140
I didn't want to. You forced me to.

839
01:31:44,181 --> 01:31:47,184
What the hell are you talking about,
I forced you to?

840
01:31:47,226 --> 01:31:50,146
What is the first thing you said to me, 
when you saw the cavalry?

841
01:31:50,187 --> 01:31:53,315
You said, if I wasn't a nun,
you'd let me save my own bacon.

842
01:31:53,357 --> 01:31:57,153
After I told you about the garrison
you said if I wasn't a nun,

843
01:31:57,194 --> 01:31:59,737
you'd just as soon say adiós.

844
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:01,449
I wanted to be with you,
I wanted to be safe.

845
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:05,035
I tried to tell you that night at the camp
but you were too damn busy to listen.

846
01:32:05,077 --> 01:32:08,956
And what are you looking so surprised about,
you no-good atheist, move!

847
01:32:08,998 --> 01:32:12,793
It could be, you know,
I saved your bacon - again.

848
01:32:16,422 --> 01:32:18,507
Trae al resto de los hombres.

849
01:32:32,688 --> 01:32:35,191
Hogan, the piñata.

850
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:51,373
- Got the coal oil?
- Yes.

851
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:57,004
Alright, have them put this thing 
against the building outside the gate.

852
01:32:57,046 --> 01:33:00,508
- How long a fuse are you putting in?
- Approximately 30 seconds.

853
01:33:00,549 --> 01:33:02,927
That'll give them enough time 
to get on down the street.

854
01:33:02,968 --> 01:33:06,138
There are going to be
women and children, remember.

855
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,724
Any longer fuse might be seen.

856
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:11,811
Just don't make the children too young
and the women too old

857
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:13,938
and tell 'em not to trip.

858
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:17,108
Now, you fill the jar with candies and nuts,

859
01:33:17,149 --> 01:33:20,820
just like we do
at the birthday party.

860
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,989
- Colonel?
- Llévensela.

861
01:33:32,246 --> 01:33:35,992
<font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font> <i>Bats screeching<i/> <font face="Chiller" color=#00AA88>~</font>

862
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:40,381
Hogan, the tunnel is open.

863
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:31,140
Libérenlos.
My men will have them free.

864
01:34:34,685 --> 01:34:39,774
- ¿Por dónde los metieron?
- Por arriba. Por la escalera.

865
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:21,148
What?

866
01:35:22,233 --> 01:35:25,486
If we use dynamite,
the element of surprise is gone.

867
01:35:25,528 --> 01:35:29,073
They'd have to open the door
if they had another prisoner.

868
01:35:29,115 --> 01:35:31,200
The French want me very badly.

869
01:35:31,242 --> 01:35:34,203
Why don't you turn me over
and ask for a reward?

870
01:35:34,245 --> 01:35:36,372
Está bien.

871
01:35:36,413 --> 01:35:41,127
Even if they don't put you in here,
it will get Hogan inside the gate.

872
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:43,921
It is a chance to open this door.

873
01:35:50,469 --> 01:35:54,348
I don't like it.
We'll find another way.

874
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:57,268
- What other way?
- I don't know, let me think about it.

875
01:35:57,309 --> 01:36:00,771
- There's no time to think about it.
- I still don't like it.

876
01:36:00,813 --> 01:36:03,774
We have to get that
trap door open too, don't we?

877
01:36:03,816 --> 01:36:06,986
You know what you're talking about's
crazy, Sara.

878
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:11,157
Listen, Hogan, everybody's got
a right to be a sucker once.

879
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:26,172
How can we be sure we hit 'em
from different directions all at the same time?

880
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:29,300
I will put a man
in the belfry of the church.

881
01:36:29,341 --> 01:36:32,678
As soon as he sees you and Sara
entering the garrison,

882
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,806
he will ring the bells three times.

883
01:36:35,848 --> 01:36:39,935
The women with the piñata
will start up the street at a slow walk.

884
01:36:39,977 --> 01:36:43,481
From the time you enter the gate
and the bells ring,

885
01:36:43,522 --> 01:36:47,443
it will be four minutes
till the explosion.

886
01:36:48,986 --> 01:36:52,865
- Slow 'em up. Make it six.
- Bien. Six.

887
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:55,910
All right.
Let's go give a Spanish lesson.

888
01:36:55,951 --> 01:37:00,623
Quédense hasta que
el americano abra la alcantarilla.

889
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:27,233
Hold it.

890
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:31,695
I don't know how this is gonna
come out but I owe this to myself.

891
01:37:38,035 --> 01:37:41,163
- We'd better go.
- Bad time for a war.

892
01:37:42,373 --> 01:37:44,833
Bad time.

893
01:38:26,876 --> 01:38:29,128
Anybody in there speak English?

894
01:38:29,712 --> 01:38:33,591
Oui, monsieur.
What is it you wish here?

895
01:38:33,632 --> 01:38:37,428
I... have something out here
I think will interest you.

896
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:40,389
Sergent, ouvrez la porte.

897
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:45,978
Oui, monsieur?

898
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:50,566
Ah, mon Dieu, mais c'est Sara.
Entrez! Entrez!

899
01:38:51,984 --> 01:38:54,487
Come on, you little cottontail.

900
01:38:57,573 --> 01:39:00,075
Sergent, fermez la porte.

901
01:39:01,744 --> 01:39:05,498
The Général himself
will want to meet you. Un moment.

902
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:08,042
Oh, Captain, wait just a minute.

903
01:39:08,084 --> 01:39:12,004
I've just about had a bellyful
of this little Juarista.

904
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:15,132
She's been yapping at me
for three days now.

905
01:39:15,174 --> 01:39:18,385
If your general wants to socialise
that's up to him

906
01:39:18,427 --> 01:39:21,430
but I'd sooner have her locked up
while I'm talking to him.

907
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,766
Je regrette.

908
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:30,856
Entrez.

909
01:39:42,201 --> 01:39:45,621
They're gonna place
that piñata right outside.

910
01:39:45,663 --> 01:39:48,999
When I give you the signal,
you get ready to move.

911
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:53,295
This little cottontail sure does wish 
she had that cross back.

912
01:39:53,337 --> 01:39:56,090
Approchez, s'il vous plaît.

913
01:39:59,593 --> 01:40:01,679
Entrez.

914
01:40:10,271 --> 01:40:12,773
Passez, s'il vous plaît.

915
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:28,289
Excuse me, monsieur, but 
I'm certainly not laughing at you

916
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:30,958
but at this, this costume.

917
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,840
Come to think of it, we shall have
to shoot you dressed like that.

918
01:40:37,882 --> 01:40:44,221
Uh, well General, I understand that raisin' money
for the Mexican army is a crime...

919
01:40:44,263 --> 01:40:48,768
- So is shooting a lieutenant.
- Did that bastard die?

920
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:52,062
Yes, the lieutenant died
and you will, too.

921
01:40:52,104 --> 01:40:55,566
Monsieur, I am Général le Claire.

922
01:40:55,608 --> 01:40:57,902
My name's Hamilton, Général.

923
01:40:57,943 --> 01:41:01,489
- Tex to my friends.
- How do you do, monsieur?

924
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:05,117
How come you caught
this little pigeon for us?

925
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:09,205
Well, you see,
I have this spread up north

926
01:41:09,246 --> 01:41:11,874
and in rides this nun...

927
01:41:37,316 --> 01:41:40,945

932
01:41:53,165 --> 01:41:56,419
And when I heard that,
I said to myself,

933
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:00,965
"Tex, you just got to haul her
on down here and turn her in."

934
01:42:02,049 --> 01:42:06,303
I hate them damn Juaristas.
Do nothing but cause me trouble.

935
01:42:06,345 --> 01:42:10,558
They got my Mexes laying around
just praying for independence.

936
01:42:10,599 --> 01:42:13,352
You didn't know
we had posted a reward?

937
01:42:13,394 --> 01:42:16,147
- A reward?
- 200 gold francs.

938
01:42:16,188 --> 01:42:18,399
How about that?

939
01:42:18,441 --> 01:42:22,611
Certainly better than
a stab in the eye with a sharp stick.

940
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:27,658
Why don't you just lock her up
and send me on my way?

941
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,869
Lock her up? No, monsieur.

942
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:34,248
Condemned prisoners are entitled
to a last night of relaxation.

943
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:38,294
- Wine or cognac, Sara?
- Cognac, a full glass, please.

944
01:42:38,335 --> 01:42:42,089
Anything my sweet-tempered
little pigeon desires.

945
01:42:44,049 --> 01:42:47,094
Colonel, please bring 200 francs.

946
01:42:48,721 --> 01:42:51,974
- Oui, mon général.
- Monsieur Hamilton? Tex?

947
01:42:52,016 --> 01:42:56,687
Make mine smaller than the one you
poured her. I'm just a country boy.

948
01:42:56,729 --> 01:43:01,317
None of us can keep pace with Sara,
in cognac or any other way.

949
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:06,989
To your virtues
and especially your vices, Sara.

950
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:09,366
What a pity to bury them both.

951
01:43:25,591 --> 01:43:27,676
Excuse me, Monsieur Hamilton.

952
01:43:27,718 --> 01:43:30,888
A people who know how to sing -
the Mexicans.

953
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:34,809
- Are you familiar with that melody?
- Can't say that I am.

954
01:43:35,434 --> 01:43:40,648
Las Mañanitas, for birthdays
and weddings and whatnot. Lovely.

My, how touching.

959
01:43:54,036 --> 01:43:57,790
They know it is our independence day
and they come to toast us.

960
01:43:57,832 --> 01:44:01,585
- Do you know what a piñata is, monsieur?
- Can't say that I do.

961
01:44:01,627 --> 01:44:04,213
Come and see. A charming invention.

962
01:44:08,551 --> 01:44:11,804
They build a figure usually of an animal 
from papier-mâché

963
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,890
with a clay jar hidden
in the centre of the body.

964
01:44:14,932 --> 01:44:18,227
They fill the jar with candies,
nuts, fruits and little toys

965
01:44:18,269 --> 01:44:20,563
and suspend it from a limb of a tree.

974
01:45:10,154 --> 01:45:11,906
Over here.

975
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:19,872
Get back to the house and pour
yourself another... cognac.

- Where's Sara?
- Last door. Hall left. My room.

979
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:29,241
- Sara, open up.
- I'm taking a bath!

980
01:51:29,283 --> 01:51:31,160
Well, get out of the bath.

981
01:51:31,202 --> 01:51:36,207
Go away and will you come back later?
I want to be all dressed up for you.

982
01:51:36,248 --> 01:51:38,918
Who the hell
wants to see you dressed?

983
01:51:59,814 --> 01:52:02,650
The least you can do
is take off your hat.

984
01:52:02,691 --> 01:52:05,653
I haven't got time for that.

985
01:52:38,436 --> 01:52:41,063
Come on!
