me how to move a bottle.

No, you moved it.

367

Yes, because you
moved me to move it.

368
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,643
See, I moved it because you wanted
the bottle to move so much.

369
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,088
And that, you could say,
is how faith works.

At least some of the time.

371
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,251
And this is as much as I
need to move a mountain?

Well, in theory, yes.

But it's up to him.

374

He's the mover.

that if you do this list,

it'll make your faith powerful.

In order to make
this list work for you,

391
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,605
I'm gonna add
one essential item.

392

It's your choice, Pepper.

What does that Jap
have to do with anything?

Everything.

397
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,121
Your faith won't work
if you have

398
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,521
even the slightest
bit of hatred in you.

399

takes to bring my dad back.

Yes, but only
if it's God's will.

404
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,244
Why wouldn't God
want to bring my dad back?

I don't know.

406
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,361

nothing's impossible, right?

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,401
Yeah.
