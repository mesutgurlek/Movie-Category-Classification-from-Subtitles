00:36:57,766 --> 00:37:02,044
Come on, don't worry.
We know what it's like to have the blues.

308
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:08,159
You remind me of a soldier
who came here because of...

309
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,756
Because of something stupid.
That was his secret. Get it?

310
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:16,164
He kept it deep inside,
but it ate away at him.

311
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,357
One morning, it weighed so heavily
on his mind

312
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:22,605
that he went straight to the police and
spilled his guts like an idiot. Get it?

313
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:27,639
- It was too much for one man to bear.
- Why are you telling me all this?

314
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:32,523
It's to remind you that
you must always trust your friends.

315
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:37,357
If that guy had talked to his friends,
he wouldn't have messed up.

316
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,797
What do I care about your story?

317
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,998
Don't get mad. It's just a story.
It's of no importance.

318
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:49,402
And I knew a guy who was always bugging
people with question after question.

319
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:53,599
And one day, he was found
with a knife stuck in his belly.

320
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:56,195
- You're saying this for my benefit?
- No.

321
00:37:56,406 --> 00:38:00,797
No, it's just a story.
It's of no importance.

Leave it.
He's over there, it's about to start...

323
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:36,318

I'm not doing well, sir.

Explain yourself.

Sir, I no longer wish
to stay with the 3rd bandera.

There's a guy... er...
Sorry, an individual who...

354
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,996
Er... I don't know...
I think I'm a pretty good legionnaire.

355
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:40,401
I signed up to get some peace.
And I have the right to that pea...

maintain the discipline you chose to accept.

- I always do my duty, sir.
- I know. You're a good soldier.

Sir, please transfer me to the 4th bandera
so I can leave with them for the south.

00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:15,604
It is the 3rd bandera, yours,
which is leaving.

367

Ah?

368
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:21,558
Well... Then I ask that legionnaire Lucas
be assigned to a different company.

369
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:22,755
Is that all?

370

You brawled yesterday
like a common porter.

371

That does not incline me to grant favors
to legionnaires who get drunk,

I don't wish to know.

374

If we had to account for the pasts of
everyone in the Legion,

Since I know that
I'm leaving for the south.

380

Legionnaire Lucas will be reassigned.
He will not leave.

Don't you care what I'm thinking?

I'll tell you anyway.

the crosswalks in the streets of Paris.

Are you mad at me because
I'm telling you about crosswalks?

397
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:40,080
No, buddy, I'm not mad at you.
On the contrary.

398
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:44,279
No, I feel good.
As good as it gets.

399
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:26,642
You can breathe easy.
Lucas won't be making you miserable.

400

Why do you think Lucas
makes me miserable?

Don't bother.
You must have had your reasons.

Anyway, things will be nice and quiet
in the desert.

No more Fernando Lucas and
his smart ass mug.

You don't mess around, do you?

411
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:09,085
If you still have the heart for it,
you can join the military police after.

No one will come looking for me here.

- Yes sir, captain.

419

comforts and luxuries.

They've stuffed our heads.

00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,563
Ultimately, we'll wind up building
more roads for tourists.

427
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:15,960
I'm fed up.
I'm a soldier, not a road contractor.

even as we speak.

- I don't know, sir. I'm a bachelor.

I'm not staying here
5 more minutes!

01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:55,194
Everything I've earned in 3 years.
It's all yours.

611
01:08:55,406 --> 01:08:59,399
- We can afford to take a great big car.
- Yes.

612
01:08:59,606 --> 01:09:01,801
- Can I bring along all my treasures?
- Yes.

613
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:04,520
My clocks, my fabrics,
my belts.

614
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:06,603
Yes, but before then, you must...

615
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:10,003
- I'll do anything you want.
- Very well...

616
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:13,642
That man downstairs
is my greatest enemy.

617
01:09:13,846 --> 01:09:16,997
I knew it! I guessed it
the moment he saw you.

618
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:18,525
Then, listen...

619
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:23,801
Tomorrow, I leave for the mountains.
I'll be away for a few days.

620
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:27,396
During this time, Lucas,
that's his name, Lucas,

621
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:31,997
he must come back here.
And come back often.

622
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:34,197
Above all, don't tell him
that you're my wife.

623
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:38,797
On the contrary, make him believe that
you hate me, you think I'm a brute.

624
01:09:40,006 --> 01:09:41,405
Make him talk.

625
01:09:41,606 --> 01:09:46,475
And try to find out where he comes from,
and what he really thinks of me.

626
01:09:47,406 --> 01:09:49,124
And if he stays mum?

627
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:52,395
You'll be nice to him.

628
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,836
All he asks of you...

629
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:56,639
you will do.

630
01:09:57,926 --> 01:10:00,394
Sometimes you have to give a lot

631
01:10:00,606 --> 01:10:03,404
before a man loosens his tongue.

632
01:10:04,206 --> 01:10:08,245
But he must talk. You hear me?
He must!

633
01:10:14,206 --> 01:10:16,959
[Bugle.]

634
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:40,395
- What time is it?
- My watch is 42 francs late.

635
01:10:40,606 --> 01:10:43,803
It's in hock. Wait.
It must be 5 o'clock.

636
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,681
5 o'clock.
That's when Fernando Lucas...

637
01:11:00,086 --> 01:11:03,044
Do you know Rue Saint-Vincent in Paris?

638
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:08,518
You don't know Rue Saint-Vincent?

639
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:13,324
At number 25, there's a little villa.

640
01:11:15,006 --> 01:11:18,157
That's where I killed a man.

641
01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:22,881
There's a reward of 50,000 bills
for whoever finds the killer.

642
01:11:23,806 --> 01:11:26,240
I'm sure that Lucas...

643
01:11:35,406 --> 01:11:39,194
As far as I can look back,
I've always been alone.

644
01:11:39,406 --> 01:11:40,885
So, when he came along...

645
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:44,635
Him or another,
what difference could it make?

646
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:49,916
But since, there are days when the shadow
of Gilieth blocks out the sun.

647
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,676
You're right.
Gilieth is extremely dangerous.

648
01:11:55,206 --> 01:11:56,878
But I know just the words

649
01:11:57,166 --> 01:12:00,363
to make him crawl into the ground.

650
01:12:01,206 --> 01:12:03,037
Do you know Europe?

651
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,122
I would like to know it.

652
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:12,160
If I go back there,
would you come join me?

653
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:16,484
I'm not rich, but
you won't be unhappy.

654
01:12:16,686 --> 01:12:19,598
My trade can become a profitable one.

655
01:12:19,806 --> 01:12:22,718
But you're a soldier.
Can you become a sergeant right away?

656
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:24,564
I can do better than that.

657
01:12:24,766 --> 01:12:27,883
I'm not a soldier like Gilieth.

658
01:12:29,006 --> 01:12:32,840
I may want to leave now, but when he
returns, I won't want to.

659
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:36,994
My will runs away in front of him
like water through a sieve.

660
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:39,879
If you help me, I will rid you of him.

661
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:43,795
- Forever?
- Forever.

662
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:45,758
Speak. I will obey.

663
01:12:46,806 --> 01:12:47,875
Listen...

664
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:51,284
When he returns, ask him:

665
01:12:51,486 --> 01:12:54,398
"What were you doing in Paris,
a year ago,

666
01:12:54,606 --> 01:12:57,803
"at dawn, Rue Saint-Vincent?"

667
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:02,003
- That's funny!
- What were you doing...

668
01:13:02,206 --> 01:13:05,835
What were you doing in Paris,
a year ago,

669
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:09,800
- at dawn...
- Rue... Rue Saint-Vincent.

670
01:13:10,006 --> 01:13:11,439
Rue Saint-Vincent.

671
01:13:22,806 --> 01:13:26,879
As you say those words, be sure to
look into his face carefully

672
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:31,796
and what he tells you,
you'll need to repeat word for word

673
01:13:32,006 --> 01:13:36,158
to someone...
And that will be the end.

674
01:13:37,286 --> 01:13:40,517
Are you a police chief?

675
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:43,319
So what?

676
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:58,716
I work faithfully for society.

677
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,840
I'll never dare to ask this of Gilieth.

678
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:05,482
You won't need to fear him
anymore.

679
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:07,764
You'll be free.

680
01:14:08,086 --> 01:14:11,158
I'll marry you
and I'll take you to my country.

681
01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:13,800
The men are coming back tomorrow.

682
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:15,200
Will you help me?

683
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:17,878
Force is on our side.

684
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:20,999
And tomorrow,
Gilieth will sleep in jail.

685
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:25,882
For now at least.
God will take care of the rest.

686
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,635
They've waited enough. They won't send
another dime. We must find a solution.

687
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:39,202
- And quickly. Lest you lose your position.
- My position!

688
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:43,081
They should come be in my position.
They'll see how easy it is.

689
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:47,879
Anyway, I'm close to my goal.
Take a look.

690
01:14:50,406 --> 01:14:52,715
He's going to "Breadboard's."

691
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:56,763
In a few minutes, I'll be set.

692
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,754
I'm going to know.

693
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:01,036
Ah finally, I'm going to know.

694
01:15:03,926 --> 01:15:05,518
"Ask him:

695
01:15:05,726 --> 01:15:08,559
'What were you doing, a year ago,

696
01:15:08,766 --> 01:15:12,315
'in Paris, at dawn, Rue...

697
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:13,961
'Rue...'"

698
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:17,638
- Rue Saint-Vincent.
- That's it!

699
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:23,194
- Do you want to know?
- I don't care.

700
01:15:23,406 --> 01:15:25,920
- You don't care that I killed a man?
- I don't care.

701
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:29,198
- Don't you want to know why?
- You must have had your reasons.

702
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:32,284
Peace be with you and with us.

703
01:15:36,526 --> 01:15:40,155
This won't be easy. It'll take a while.
Don't stray too far away.

704
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:52,759
Come, Mulot.

705
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,035
Here comes rat face!

706
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:04,594
So, did everything go okay?

707
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:05,955
May I?

708
01:16:06,326 --> 01:16:10,842
- Give me a drink.
- Don't bother sitting down.

709
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:13,482
We were waiting for you.

710
01:16:15,526 --> 01:16:18,120
Now that you're here,
we're going to step outside.

711
01:16:18,326 --> 01:16:21,159
I need to ask you
a few explanations.

712
01:16:21,366 --> 01:16:23,118
You can speak here.

713
01:16:23,326 --> 01:16:26,318
No! If you're a man,
you'll go outside with me.

714
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:29,756
Okay... okay...

715
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:34,724
Just be careful with your movements.

716
01:16:34,926 --> 01:16:36,439
We're being watched.

717
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:39,160
Say goodbye to Slaoui.

718
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:48,275
Come on, Aischa.
Say goodbye to the gentleman.

719
01:16:50,766 --> 01:16:51,994
I can't.

720
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:53,844
You can't?

721
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,715
Then spit in his face.

722
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:13,636
- Very nice, Aischa.
- Go on, walk in front.

723
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:16,076
And not one word
or I'll shoot you down.

724
01:17:16,726 --> 01:17:17,954
Ass.

725
01:17:26,846 --> 01:17:30,202
- Where are we going?
- Never mind. We'll be out of sight.

726
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:34,318
As long as you're alive,

727
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:38,155
always keep this coin
in memory of Aischa.

728
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:48,880
So you want to
cash in on the 50 grands?

729
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:51,805
50,000 bills,
that's a nice loot.

730
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:57,721
Assuming I don't make you bleed
like a pig.

731
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:09,041
I killed that guy
on Rue Saint-Vincent.

732
01:18:09,246 --> 01:18:10,725
I, Pierre Gilieth.

733
01:18:10,926 --> 01:18:14,919
The son of a bitch didn't deserve to live.
I executed him, you hear?

734
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:19,438
One less piece of garbage, trust me.
And I'd do it all over again.

735
01:18:20,126 --> 01:18:21,115
So what?

736
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:24,123
Get up.

737
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:25,839
You disgust me.

738
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:31,405
The ground is wet.
You might catch cold.

739
01:18:32,926 --> 01:18:35,520
I've often thought about you.

740
01:18:35,726 --> 01:18:40,277
I knew that one day
you'd show yourself to be a snitch.

741
01:18:40,486 --> 01:18:42,602
Well? What are you going to do?

742
01:18:43,926 --> 01:18:46,645
You'll sleep in jail tonight, Gilieth.

743
01:18:46,846 --> 01:18:49,440
That's interesting.

744
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:53,116
Don't you see what our lives
are like here?

745
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:56,079
Don't you get that men who made
this choice deserve to be left in peace.

746
01:18:56,286 --> 01:18:59,119
But that's not enough?
They still need cops on their tails!

747
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:03,524
To watch their binges, spy on their sleep,
stalk their loneliness!

748
01:19:03,726 --> 01:19:08,083
- You'll sleep in jail tonight.
- Is that what you thought?

749
01:19:10,326 --> 01:19:11,395
Oh!

750
01:19:12,726 --> 01:19:14,239
Here's your knife.

751
01:19:14,486 --> 01:19:17,080
You might need it.

752
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:24,244
Listen carefully.

753
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:26,323
My life is over now.

754
01:19:26,526 --> 01:19:31,316
I had been planning
to escape to the south with Slaoui.

755
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:35,758
But that plan's worthless now.
I'd be caught before I got there.

756
01:19:38,326 --> 01:19:39,645
And there's something else now.

757
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:42,521
I won't end up like a louse.
You hear, copper?

758
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:48,916
With just one move,
I can wipe you out like an eraser.

759
01:19:49,126 --> 01:19:51,321
And then, I'm free.

760
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:54,723
But I'm going to surprise you.
I'm not a murderer.

761
01:19:54,926 --> 01:19:58,885
I don't care about your hide.
I'm letting you go.

762
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:03,364
See that? If you talk,
there's one for you

763
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:08,805
and another for me. Now you can
go rat me out. Good day.
