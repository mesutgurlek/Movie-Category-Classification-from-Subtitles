No, no. My home is here,

also known as Henry Faber.

to private school there.</i>

constantly against authority</i>

<i>and was often flogged for it.</i>

00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,096
Look, I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.

658
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,355
You're a damn fool, you know.

659
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:00,857
Lucky to be alive.

660
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,030
Why were you out in the storm
in the first place?

661
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,950
Because I had no idea
it was going to be so severe.

662
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,737
Give me two. I want to sleep.

663
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:14,662
I can do that.

664
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,593
Good night.

665
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,728
Would you like some more soup?

666
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,058
No, thank you.

667
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,772
It was delicious.

668
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:41,069
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?

669
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:44,936
Do sit down.

670
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,540
Where do you live, Mr. Baker?

671
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:57,753
I used to live on that boat.

672
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,498
Suppose I am a damn fool.

673
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,343
I moved from London about a month ago.

674
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,674
Really?

675
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,138
I haven't been to London for years.

676
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,548
When were you last there?

677
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,136
Four years ago.

678
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:14,682
And that was to have a baby.

679
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,515
- You've been here for four years?
- Yes.

680
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,890
My goodness. I hope you have friends here.

681
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:22,518
Well, there's Tom,
who takes care of the lighthouse,

682
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,360
and the ferry comes
every other Monday with our supplies.

683
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,990
- That's all?
- Yes.

684
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,525
Cheers.

685
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,703
Cheers.

686
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,989
What do you do if there is an emergency?

687
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,656
Well, there's a radio transmitter
at Tom's cottage,

688
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,133
but that's really
more to do with the lighthouse.

689
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:49,552
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.

690
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,758
Well, you see,
David and I had a motor accident

691
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,216
on the day we were married.

692
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,095
That's how he lost his legs.

693
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,399
He was training to be a fighter pilot,

694
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,482
and then after the accident, he...

695
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,614
Well, we both wanted to run away,

696
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,744
and so we came here.

697
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,949
Seemed like a good idea.

698
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,827
Might have been a mistake.

699
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,500
Well, you can't blame him
for wanting to run away.

700
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,000
No, I don't.

701
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,165
It's terribly sad.

702
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,335
No, it was our fault completely.

703
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,468
We'd had a bit to drink,

704
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,302
and we were driving much too fast,
and then suddenly there was this lorry...

705
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,675
No, I meant it was terribly sad

706
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,307
because you're so unhappy now.

707
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,765
Is it that obvious?

708
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,030
I do love him, you know.

709
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,737
The way he used to be.

710
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,086
Times when he's suddenly like the old David

711
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,336
and he and Jo and I
go and have a picnic on the cliff

712
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,589
or something like that...

713
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,762
He spends most of his time now with Tom.

714
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,802
I think they just sit and drink.

715
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,226
The first year that we were here,

716
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,194
my parents came to visit.

717
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,609
Oh, I can't tell you...

718
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,029
He was silent,

719
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,489
and he hid from them, and...

720
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,867
I feel sad for Jo, really.

721
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:44,035
He keeps asking about
his Granny and where she is.

722
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,294
He's a nice little boy.

723
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:46,834
Oh, isn't he?

724
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,588
And he's so clever.

725
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,295
And he's very brave.

726
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:54,595
And lucky.

727
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:55,835
Why do you think?

728
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,215
To be so loved.

729
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,640
(LAUGHS) No.

730
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:00,965
No. I'm his mother.

731
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,679
All parents love their children.

732
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:04,887
No, no.

733
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,229
No, not all.

734
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,771
No.

735
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,605
Some parents...

736
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,442
Some parents use their children,

737
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,823
set goals for them.

738
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,113
Goals they weren't able
to attain in their lives.

739
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,776
Hardly love, do you think?

740
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,696
No, hardly.

741
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,130
I wonder why you go on

742
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,550
if it's not working.

743
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:41,136
I suppose, if I were perfectly frank,

744
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,270
I'd admit that I couldn't bear the idea

745
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,600
that all the years of trying were wasted.

746
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,477
I really don't think

747
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,402
I could bear that.

748
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,659
Oh, dear, four years on this island,

749
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:00,409
and I've become such a bore.

750
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,374
Tell me, Mr. Baker, are you married?

751
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,500
No.

752
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,830
What, through choice or bad luck?

753
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,826
Do you think it's good luck to be married?

754
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:13,344
(LAUGHS) Well, yes, normally.

755
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,263
Sometimes I imagine myself married...

756
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:20,927
To another man?

757
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,925
(GLASS SHATTERS)

758
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:27,348
You've hurt yourself.

759
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,103
I'm awfully sorry.

760
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:48,621
You're very beautiful.

761
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,892
Please don't.

762
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,960
We tied up Friday afternoon nice and early

763
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,837
to keep out of that bloody storm.

764
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,296
It's Sunday.

765
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,206
Why did you not let us know she was gone?

766
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,875
I haven't been down here since!

767
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,343
McKilliam.

768
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,797
Could that boat have survived the storm?

769
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:26,804
Not a chance.

770
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,387
Why do you think I left her here?

771
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,472
If he were on it,

772
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,926
where could he be now?

773
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,855
At the bottom of the sea, the bloody fool.

774
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:34,857
Aye! Good riddance to bad rubbish.

775
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,557
He'd be drowned.

776
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:39,067
I'll believe that when I see the body.

777
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,151
Good morning.

778
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,119
I've saved you some coffee.

779
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,239
Do you take black or white?

780
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,325
No, thank you.

781
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,736
I'll make you some breakfast.

782
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,038
No. I'll wait for lunch.

783
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,078
It's lamb stew for lunch, I'm afraid.

784
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,293
David says it won't be long

785
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,496
before we all turn into sheep.

786
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,585
Where is he?

787
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,920
David? He's just gone out with Jo

788
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,755
to check on the flock.

789
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,592
(ROOSTER CROWING)

790
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:13,766
Good morning, Lucy.

791
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,599
Good morning.

792
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,270
You don't despise me, do you?

793
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:20,606
No.

794
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,820
How could I?

795
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,400
Oh, you could.

796
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:24,777
I could.

797
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,953
It can't happen again.

798
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:29,405
It won't.

799
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,449
Do you regret it?

800
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,245
Oh...

801
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,549
Let's go out.

802
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,465
(SEAGULLS CAWING)

803
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,938
You'll be gone soon,

804
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,864
now the storm's over.

805
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,319
(SCOFFS) Not in that, I won't.

806
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,763
I don't even know what you do.

807
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,008
I'm a writer.

808
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,052
A writer? Are you really?

809
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:33,926
Good Lord.

810
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,600
What do you write about?

811
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:38,444
The war.

812
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:42,266
No, not battles and killing,

813
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,324
but isolation.

814
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,108
The feeling some men have

815
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:51,244
of being suddenly separated
from every other man.

816
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,620
But I thought war was meant

817
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,120
to bring people closer together.

818
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,202
Well...

819
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,120
Not me.

820
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,751
And you?

821
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,387
Is there a woman in your book?

822
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,221
I shall put you in it.

823
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,149
- No, really, is there?
- Yes.

824
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,730
