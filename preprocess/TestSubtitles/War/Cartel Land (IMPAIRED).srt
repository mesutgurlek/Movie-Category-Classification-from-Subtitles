169
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,687
<i>All roads lead to one spot</i>

170
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,959
<i>I left home</i>
<i>when I was 15,</i>

171
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,695
<i>I was tired</i>
<i>of the physical and mental,</i>

172
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:29,200
Emotional, whatever you want
to call the abuse by my father.

173
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:32,570
<i>So I tried to drown out the feelings and everything out</i>

174
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,939
<i>With alcohol and drugs.</i>

175
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,676
<i>I tried meth</i>
<i>for a year or so,</i>

176
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:41,345
<i>Couldn't even</i>
<i>control myself.</i>

177
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,581
<i>And one day</i>
<i>I stopped at a bar</i>

178
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,349
And had
a few too many.

179
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:50,020
And I was passing this semi,
and somebody was coming head on.

180
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,356
And I got in front of the semi
and started sliding sideways,

181
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:56,527
And I remember looking up at him and
he just threw his hands up and said,

182
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,395
"can't do anything, sorry."

183
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,368
<i>The truck rolled six times</i>
<i>and I climbed out</i>

184
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:09,773
<i>Looked down and there was my wallet</i>
<i>and the pictures of my two kids,</i>

185
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,576
<i>And so I said,</i>
<i>"okay, I got it."</i>

186
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,647
So 18 years ago
I quit everything.

187
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:23,821
Realized that I needed
to deal with, uh, my issues.

188
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,092
And so, I dealt with them.

189
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:39,136
<i>Once I got cleaned up</i>
<i>I was working construction,</i>

190
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:43,307
<i>But back in late '08 when the</i>
<i>economy started falling apart</i>

191
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,909
<i>I lost my job overnight,</i>

192
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:48,846
<i>I lost my house,</i>
<i>I had to sell everything.</i>

193
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,384
<i>I hit the road for a year,</i>
<i>year and a half,</i>

194
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:59,023
<i>But everywhere I went there was illegals</i>
<i>working on every construction job.</i>

195
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,125
A lot of them are doing
work under the table,

196
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,828
They're not paying taxes,
they're sucking into the system.

197
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,565
<i>So I said,</i>
<i>"well I got to</i>

198
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,033
Try to help and do
something about this."

199
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:13,704
So that's how arizona border recon came in existence.

200
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,645
<i>I took the last of my savings,</i>

202
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,852
<i>I would drive the roads,</i>
<i>find the trails,</i>

203
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,289

They're articulate, they're intelligent,
and everything else.

01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:26,226
And I told him
I had him to thank,

679
01:34:26,228 --> 01:34:31,464
<i>Because everything</i>

So the cycles can change,

It just takes somebody
to change them.

<i>they're changing</i>

<i>But they're not</i>
<i>doing anything.</i>

686
01:34:50,652 --> 01:34:53,920
They're doing the same thing,
but just with a different look.
