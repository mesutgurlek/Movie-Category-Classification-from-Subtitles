Yes, sir.

157
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,954
The sniping last night came
from a street two blocks away.

158

The entire quarter
is to be sealed off.

159
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,638
We shall take a leaf
from the fisherman's book.

160
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,150
First, we'll mark out a wide perimeter, then
we'll start combing the outlying streets.

161
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,510
That should set the fish in motion.

162
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,154
Of course, they'll try to make off
in the opposite direction,

163
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,510
but we'll have roadblocks there
to cut them off.

164
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,790
By the time we've closed the net,

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,468
we'll have them exactly
where we want them.

Excuse me, general, what about
the civilian population?

168
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,789
The latest estimate, this section of the
city contains about 80,000 inhabitants.

169
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,152
One can hardly talk of a normal
civilian population in this place.

170
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,193
I regard the experience to
be gained from this operation

Now he enters my sight looking as though he
just exhumed his grandmother with his bare hands.

194

Absolute cleanliness, that's what
I demand from the people around me.

General Tanz,
forgive me,

201
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,550
but just as a matter
of curiosity,

202
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,718
what do you feel is the exact
purpose of this exercise?

203
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,150
You've read the memorandum.
Oh, yes. Yes, I have...

204
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,918
And what does
the memorandum say?

205
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,918
That phase one is intended
to intimidate the population

206
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,509
to search houses,
to find and arrest resistance.

207
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,551
Then that is the exact purpose
of the exercise.

208
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,115
An excellent plan, by the way. Much
like my own when I first came here,

209
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,392
only I was never given the
ultimate authority to implement it.

210
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,754
But am I to understand that if there
is resistance during phase one,

211
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,748
you would then go to phase two
and even to phase three,

212
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,871
which would mean
the destruction of the entire city?

213
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,640
You are to understand
exactly that.

Well, uh, isn't that
somewhat excessive?

Excessive.

You will be aware that we are
30 miles from Moscow.

We are moving ahead

Every available soldier is needed
if we are to conquer Russia.

Yet here in Warsaw,
three divisions are rotting,

because of a few thousand criminal
Poles and Jews hiding in slums.

to see me.

310
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,473
Yes, sir.

311
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,432
Show him in.
Thank you, sir.

312
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,674
[KNOCKING]

313
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,552
Come in.

314
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,718
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal.
Reporting as ordered, sir.

315
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,399
At ease.

316
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,031
Well, it's a distinguished record,
corporal.

317
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,196
I see from your
press clippings,

318
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,789
Otto is obviously keeping
a scrapbook for you.

319
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,197
I see that you are
"the reincarnation of Siegfried,

320
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,710
a German hero
from the golden age. "

321
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,797
Do you feel like Siegfried?

322
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,072
Well, I'm not at all certain, sir,
how Siegfried felt.

323
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,511
Well, that's a sensible answer. I
see they've given you the Iron Cross.

324
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,517
He killed 40 Russians
single-handed, sir.

325
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,234
Splendid.
Well, now, as to your future,

326
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,877
I imagine that, as a university man,
you'd want to become an officer.

327
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,719
Therefore, I shall be happy
to send you to...

328
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,592
Erm...

329
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,314
You don't want to go
to officers school?

330
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,317
I should prefer to remain
a corporal, sir.

331
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,397
Actually, general,
he doesn't mean that.

332
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,556
What he means is...
What do you mean?

333
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,228
I mean, I don't want
to become an officer. That's all, sir.

334
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,917
I'm shattered.

335
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,872
My world is toppling.

336
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,834
What is the point of being a general
when corporals prefer to be corporals?

337
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,156
He's still a bit shaky,
after the hospital.

338
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,873
Yes, apparently.

339
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,038
Now, your cousin suggested
that you join us here at headquarters,

340
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,437
but I should think you'd be anxious
to get back to the fighting.

341
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,151
No?
No, sir.

342
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,591
General, what he really means is...
Leave us, sergeant.

343
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,952
I, um...

344
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,310
I don't seem
to understand you, corporal.

345
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,592
I want to survive, sir.
I want to live through the war.

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,109
Well, naturally. We all do.

347
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,915
But we are soldiers, we must fight.
Yes, sir. And I have.

348
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,519
And you don't want to go back.

349
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,554
Is this the " reincarnation
of Siegfried"?

350
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,595
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have a horror of death.

351
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,836
Even in a good cause?

352
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,958
Let me see now...

353
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,914
According to your papers,
in civilian life you were

354
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,395
a student at Dresden?

355
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,239
Music conservatory,
yes, sir. I studied piano.

356
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,560
Music, piano, yes. Yes.

357
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,389
Yes. I think I have
an assignment for you.

358
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,149
But one which requires great courage.
Only a man who has killed...

359
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,191
How many was it? Let me see.

360
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,915
Yes, 40 Russians single-handed,
would be equal to the task.

361
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,395
Now, what about Chopin,
wasn't he Polish?

362
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,158
Didn't he write the <i>Polonaises</i>?

363
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,828
Can you play them?
Yes, madam.

364
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,792
You don't sound
very enthusiastic.

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,991
Well, madam,
they were patriotic pieces,

366
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,997
celebrating the glory
of Poland.

367
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,794
Well, the glory of Poland isn't
precisely what we're here to celebrate.

368
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,036
No, madam. So I thought
that perhaps we might play...

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,673
Wagner.

370
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,599
I remember the Führer saying to me
after a performance of <i>Parsifal</i>,

371
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,791
"There's no such thing
as too much Wagner. "

372
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,592
After <i>Parsifal</i>?

373
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,439
I must say, it's unusual
to find a fighting man

374
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,995
who also knows about music.
Thank you, madam.

375
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,634
Oh, no, don't thank me,
wait until I've thanked you.

376
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,035
And I won't until
after the soiree.

377
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,276
[###]

378
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,758
I dislike being a bore, major.
You never bore me, Engel.

379
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,918
But I can't help wondering
what you're trying to prove.

380
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,839
Just what do you think you're doing?
My job.

381
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,235
But if you say anything to
any of them, he'll know...

382
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,714
The murderer will know
that you're after him.

383
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,638
That's the point of the exercise.

384
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,400
Good evening, sergeant.
Sir.

385
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,953
But look, sir, why do you care
who killed that bitch?

386
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,435
She's better off dead anyway.

387
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,950
Have you ever heard
of the Eumenides?

388
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,276
The what?
Greek mythology.

389
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,029
A number of disagreeable ladies,
sometimes known as the Furies.

390
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,357
They believe that spilled blood
calls out for vengeance.

391
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,437
That's how justice began.

392
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,269
Well, we don't want it to end,
do we, just because there's a war on?

393
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,591
Wait for me here.
I'm afraid I won't be long.

394
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,712
Mad.

395
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,879
MAN:
Grau.

396
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,630
Colonel Mannheim.
What on earth are you doing here?

397
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,193
You must be out of your mind.

398
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,517
If the generals won't see me,
I must come here to see them.

399
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,950
Well, God help you, Grau.
I won't.

400
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,152
Better have some champagne.
You'll need it.

401
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,031
You may be right, sir.

402
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,952
General Tanz, to my mind
you're a model man in every respect.

403
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,276
Except one.
You've not married.

404
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,109
May I ask why not?
No opportunity. Greatly regret it.

405
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,709
Well, perhaps you've allowed
opportunities to slip by.

406
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,151
My dear, General Tanz is a young man
whose life has been spent as a soldier.

407
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,238
His generation has been denied
the pleasures of domesticity.

408
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,000
We live in a period which makes
great demands upon us.

409
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,397
Consequently, there is little time for
what is commonly known as private life.

410
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,034
Quite right. Champagne, general?
Water.

411
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,152
Water?
A glass of water for General Tanz.

412
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,396
Ah. Here comes Ulrike.

413
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,556
You remember her from Berlin.
Good evening, general.

414
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,955
She's been with me over
a year now, as a soldier.

415
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,435
An excellent soldier.
Thank you, Father.

416
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,030
I must say, I still find it hard to get
used to the idea of young girls in the army.

417
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,153
We're building a new world order, and women
should not be exempt from playing their part.

418
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,998
I knew you would understand,
general.

419
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,270
Ulrike has now decided
to become a nurse

420
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,836
in a military hospital run
by an order of nuns in Bavaria.

421
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,792
We're very proud of our girl.

422
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,877
Tell me, general, is it true
that in the battle of Leningrad

423
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,550
you used frozen bodies instead
of sandbags for your artillery?

424
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,797
The story is exaggerated.

425
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,638
Oh, I am sorry.

426
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,877
Some soldiers lie and rot
in the battlefield.

427
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,550
I thought it most imaginative, putting
the dead to work, you might say.

428
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,239
Nobody rots with me.

429
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,196
Your water, general.

430
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,958
Thank you.

431
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,353
My compliments. I liked the bit
about the frozen bodies.

432
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,278
Oh, thank you, general.
Be careful.

433
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,631
Ulrike has a most original
way of expressing herself.

434
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,354
Needless to say, I shall
miss not having her with me.

435
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,232
Then why let her go?

436
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,193
Come along, general,
let's have some supper.

437
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,152
You'll join us, too,
Kahlenberge?

438
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,999
Courage.
Is not enough.

439
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,996
How dare you speak like that
to General Tanz?

440
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,191
It serves you right, Mother,
for what you're doing to me.

441
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,233
Whatever I do is for your own good.
I think only of you.

442
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,908
Only of me?
You have changed.

443
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
When did I begin
to interest you so much?

444
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,152
Good evening.

445
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,238
You've become vicious.
Yes, it's the war, Mother.

446
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,829
Well, the nuns will soon
improve your manners.

447
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,314
Suppose I refuse to go?

448
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,354
You will be ordered to go. I have seen
to that already. You have no choice.

449
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,199
You really are a terrible
woman, Mother.

450
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,789
I suppose we deserve
each other.

451
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,228
Colonel Mannheim!

452
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,273
Good evening.
Yes, I'd love to dance with you.

453
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,429
In my memoirs,
I keep a record of everything.

454
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,712
Yours will be the place of honor
in the Warsaw chapter.

455
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,876
GRAU:
General von Seidlitz-Gabler?

456
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,311
Sir.
Oh, yes, you are Major...?

457
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,193
Grau, Intelligence.
Under Colonel Mannheim.

458
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,038
I tried to see you today.

459
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,516
In fact, I tried to see each of you,
without much success, I'm afraid.

460
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,472
I'm sorry, major, but general
officers are sometimes busy, you know?

461
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,795
Of course.

462
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,479
What was it you wanted
to see us about?

463
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,955
Last night,
a prostitute was murdered.

464
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,676
A prostitute? That's an
occupational hazard, isn't it?

465
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,712
When you hear the details, I'm sure
you'll agree it's a unique case.

466
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,070
Unique?
You can't be serious.

467
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,556
We live in an age in which bodies lie
around streets like cobblestones.

468
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,239
What's so unique
about this case?

469
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,953
All right, all right,
come to the point, major.

470
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,115
Last night, a woman
was murdered.

471
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,233
Yes, general, in Bulkowa Street,
number 27, fourth-floor apartment,

472
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,036
Maria Kupiecka, a prostitute,
also one of our agents.

473
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,630
She was stabbed to death most
brutally. Cut to pieces, in fact.

474
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,230
A charming story.
But what has that to do with us?

475
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,955
Preliminary investigation has
established that each of you was...

476
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,277
well, unaccounted
for last night.

477
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,914
To whom should we be
accountable, major?

478
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,236
I fail to see what my...

479
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,718
What our movements should have to do
with you or with this woman's death.

480
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,753
Well, the murderer was seen
leaving the woman's room.

481
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,951
In that case,
you must know who he is.

482
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,390
Not exactly. The face was not
visible, but the uniform was.

483
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,478
It was the uniform
of a German officer.

484
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,353
In fact, a German general.

485
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,589
This is a serious charge.
I hope you know what you're doing.

486
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,789
Oh, yes, sir, my duty.

487
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,592
Then consider your duty
done, major. Good night.

488
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,110
Are you, by any chance,
using perfume?

489
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,551
I occasionally use a strong
eau de cologne after shaving.

490
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,432
Good night, sir.

491
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,758
I will, of course, want to see each of
you tomorrow, if I may, in line of duty.

492
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,632
It is quite possible
we've been misled,

493
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,991
but we don't want to leave
any loose ends dangling, do we?

494
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,078
Until tomorrow.
Good night, generals.

495
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,835
Astonishing behavior!

496
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,110
Who invited him?
Not I.

497
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,153
Socially, Major Grau
has not been a success.

498
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,918
I'm sorry, general.
I should have had him arrested.

499
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,510
Why? He was merely
doing his duty.

500
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,913
Yes.

501
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,633
Well...

502
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,356
Now, there are some officers
I should like to present to you.

503
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,151
Some sauerbraten, general?

504
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,790
Make yourself comfortable,
inspector.

505
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,877
This is my third restaurant
in Berlin.

506
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,993
That's if you count the sausage shop I had
down by the station right after the war.

507
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,236
We were really on our arse then.

508
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,876
Now look, Germany is booming.
We made it.

509
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,594
Well, come along, inspector,
do sit down.

510
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,590
One large Munchen, please.

511
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,556
Now, then, you asked me
about General Kahlenberge.

512
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,150
Well, I don't suppose there was
anyone who knew him better than me.

513
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,278
Hartmann's doing
a good job, isn't he, sir?

514
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,074
Yes. What?

515
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,511
Oh, yes! Apparently.

516
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,836
OTTO: <i>Of course, inspector,</i>
<i>as I said before,</i>

517
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,395
<i>I haven't seen Hartmann</i>
<i>since the war. </i>

518
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,478
<i>Don't want to see him,</i>
<i>after what he did. </i>

519
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,992

<i>extraordinary effect on women. </i>

520
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,599
<i>I don't know why. </i>

521
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,872

522
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,559

523
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,548
<i>But whatever it was he had,</i>

524
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,558

525
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,637

526
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,197
<i>I remember once in Paris,</i>

527

<i>Well, anyway, you didn't waste time,</i>
<i>not with knowing maybe tomorrow</i>

528
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,716

529
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,354
<i>Oh, worry, I didn't mean that</i>

530

531
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,430
Nice.
I'd forgotten how nice.

532
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,517
Would you say there
were no girls in Russia?

533
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,190
Girls? I was too scared.

534
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,438
I'm hopeless when I'm scared.

535
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,437
Well, it's a good thing
I don't scare you, isn't it?

536
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,077
Yes, it's just that this room
makes me nervous.

537
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,429
Nervous?
Mm.

538
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,710
Oh, you have no sense of history.

539
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,434
Do you realize this used to be
the bed of the king of Poland.

540
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,755
Did it really?
Mm-hm.

541
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,234
It's like sleeping on the floor.

542
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,793
It's freezing in here.

543
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,197
Ah, but the king and the queen
never slept. They just made love.

544
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,356
They were never cold.

545
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,638
Do you like the war?

546
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,999
Do I like the war?

547
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,395
Good God, no. Do you?

548
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,958
If it weren't for the war, I'd be on the
marriage circuit now, living on some army post,

549
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,549
making conversation
with dreary young officers.

550
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,672
Instead of making love
with dreary young corporals.

551
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,270
Oh, not dreary. Not at all.

552
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,315
In fact, the best so far.
Oh?

553
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,080
Do you specialize in corporals?
No.

554
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,316
Only heroes like you.

555
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,872
Just think, all this bravery
in my arms.

556
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,355
It must be very inspiring.

557
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,196
What's the matter?

558
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,038
You know, we mustn't like
each other too much.

559
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,391
Why? Because I'm a corporal
and you're a general's daughter?

560
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,115
No. It's because...

561
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,557
It's a man, a girl, a war.

562
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,952
Two boys I knew
are already dead in Russia.

563
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,878
It's funny.

564
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,355
In the dark,
you feel just like them to me.

565
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,152
And you like this war?

566
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,239
No. I like this.

Good morning,

What's it like having people

Well, what do you think it's like?
Terrible.

Yes.

I'm glad...

Well, I'm glad that you're here.
So am I.

583
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,391
But you'll be going back soon,
I suppose?

584
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,989
Not if I can help it, I won't.

585

Can you bear the truth?

Impossible.

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,796
When they opened fire on us
at Voronezh, I ran away.

589
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,956
It's as simple as that.

590
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,835
Then, I've no idea how, I was hit.

591
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,953
It was like a door slamming in
my head, and I thought I was dead.

592
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,151
Next thing I remember
waking up in the hospital

593
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,954
and there was this general
congratulating me

594
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,436
on having killed 40 Russians
single-handed.

595
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,950
You see, they were all killed
that day, the whole company.

596
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,993
Everyone was killed except me,
and I suppose

597
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,317
it didn't look too good in dispatches,
a whole company being wiped out,

598
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,318
so they decided
to make a hero of the survivor.

599
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,158
The one who ran away.

600
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,273
So now what do you think
of all that bravery?

601
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,318
Well, that's a lovely story.
I think it's marvelous.

Marvelous?
Yes.

Mm-mm. It will never end.

610
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,434
Well, what happened?

611

Did you see them?

Generals Gabler and Kahlenberge are
in conference and cannot be disturbed.

613
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,077

00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,232
<i>But at the last moment, the general</i>
<i>decided to come a few days early. </i>

773
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,149
<i>So I sent a messenger to 7th Corps</i>
<i>headquarters at Versailles</i>

774
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,670
<i>to say that we would be in Paris</i>
<i>on the 17th. </i>

775
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,111
<i>I think you know why I'm giving you</i>
<i>the exact dates. </i>

776
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,995
<i>As it turned out, it was a good thing</i>
<i>we arrived when we did. </i>

777
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,438
<i>However, there were those</i>
<i>who were not at all pleased</i>

778
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,870
<i>to learn of our early arrival. </i>

779
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,672
Thank you, that will be all.

780
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,110
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

781
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,838
Oh, I shall be with General Gabler
in the War Room.

782
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,551
What about my pass?
Is it all right?

783
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,035
For God's sake, relax!

784
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,395
Operation Hartmann, phase one,
will begin tomorrow, 18 July, at 0915

785
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,238
when the lance corporal
reports to the railway station.

786
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,395
With a car.

787
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,477
With a car duly requisitioned
from the motor pool.

788
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,116
Phase two, the lance corporal will then
meet the secret consignment from Berlin.

789
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,788
Then?
Then phase three.

790
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,151
A 24-hour pass for the lance corporal
will begin tomorrow at noon.

791
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,588
You've got it?
Here.

792
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,439
A corporal and
a general's daughter.

793
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,712
You know, you really are
asking for trouble.

794
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,070
But it's your funeral, not mine!

795
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,032
OFFICER: The British second army
has been advancing towards the left,

796
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,950
trying to cut off two of our panzer
divisions from our main supply route.

797
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,120
During the last 48 hours,
the enemy has succeeded

798
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,232
in crossing the Ohm River,
here and here.

799
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,238
However, we were able
to stop them here,

800
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,317
with help from the
12th SS Panzer Division,

801
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,475
which is counterattacking
at the moment.

802
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,999
Well?

803
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,955
Now what do we do?
To be precise, what do you do?

804
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,118
We. You're in this too.
General Gabler.

805
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,029
The field marshal will see you at 4:00.
Thank you, major.

806
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,839
I admit that
it's inconvenient for you.

807
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,759
It's a good deal more
than that. Why?

808
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,033
Just why is General Tanz arriving
three days earlier than was planned?

809
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,550
You suspect something odd?
He comes straight from Hitler.

810
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,796
Isn't that odd enough?

811
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,319
I want to hear this.

812
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,432
The American 1st Army
occupied the town of Saint-Claude.

813
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,237
Our troops are withdrawing to
new positions south and southeast.

814
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,590
GRAU: General Gabler,
General Kahlenberge.

815
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,351
I never had the opportunity
to thank you for my promotion.

816
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,515
I'm sorry. Grau,
Intelligence, Warsaw 1942.

817
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,678
Oh, yes, yes.
Good to see you again, colonel.

818
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,270
You once had the vision
to transfer me to Paris.

819
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,471
We do our best to give pleasure,
colonel. Good day.

820
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,717
I understand we're soon
to be joined by General Tanz.

821
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,434
Quite like old times.

822
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,757
Excuse me.
I just wanted to greet you.

823
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,793
General.

824
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,671
Tiresome fellow.
Strange, isn't it?

825
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,190
Everybody seems to be aware
that Tanz is coming here.

826
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,674
I don't like it.

827
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,950
I don't like it at all.
Obviously not.

828
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,515
It's always disagreeable
when the cat gets back

829
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,188
to find the mice
have been playing.

830
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,197
We could, of course,
distract the cat

831
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,551
by suggesting that he take
a few days off to play a little too.

832
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,352
Particularly after all...

833
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,348
After all that you've been through, my dear
general, these past few months in Russia,

834
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,357
I know it must have been
perfect hell for you.

835
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,551
I want 4,000 men
by the end of the week.

836
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,715
And you shall have them.

837
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,388
Your Colonel Sandauer has been working
closely with General Kahlenberge.

838
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,558
We are scraping the sides of
the barrel, but you'll have 4,000.

839
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,876
Meanwhile, why don't you
take a few days off?

840
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,038
Rest a bit, see the sights
of Paris. It's your first visit.

841
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,710
I want only combat troops,
no decaying old men or children.

842
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,718
Yes, sir. We are making good
progress, General Kahlenberge and I.

843
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,434
After all, it may be your
last chance to see Paris.

844
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,438
It may be anyone's
last chance. Such a pity.

845
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,789
A necessity.

846
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,877
But of course.
Of course it's necessary.

847
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,230
Stern measures, the only thing
people respect.

848
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,317
All I'm suggesting is that
you leave everything to us.

849
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,478
A commander does not...
And your excellent Colonel Sandauer.

850
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,148
We've arranged a suite
for you at the... Kahlenberge?

851
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,112
At your hotel.
At the Excelsior.

852
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,915
You'll have a car, a driver and
whatever else strikes your fancy.

853
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,238
One must relax occasionally, general.
I can't afford to.

854
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,399
You give me no alternative
but to compel you to enjoy yourself.

855
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,272
Must I order you?

856
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,870
Because if I must,
I'm afraid I shall have to.

857
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,433
Yes, sir.

858
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,949
Evidently, you are not
ready for me.

859
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,078
Very well.

860
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,874
I shall devote one day
to seeing the city.

861
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,517
I shall return to headquarters at
0800 hours on the morning of the 19th.

862
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,870
Heil, Hitler.

863
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,275
GABLER:
Heil Hitler.

864
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,153
Well, that wasn't so bad.
You now have one day's grace.

865
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,191
We need two, until the 20th.

866
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,879
Come and have dinner with
me and Eleanore tomorrow.

867
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,513
Ulrike's arriving.
This is bad luck.

868
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,429
Naturally, she forgot to say
which train she'd be on.

869
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,272
I assume you are with us now.
In spirit, of course, but...

870
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,358
You'll have to make up
your mind. Soon.

871
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,872
Making up one's mind is one
thing, speaking it is another.

872
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,877
You worry too much.

873
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,313
Patience is one of
the few virtues that I possess.

874
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,719
At ease.

875
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,754
Sergeant, get me the military
governor's office on the telephone.

876
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,631
Corporal?
Sir.

877
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,717
I have an assignment for you.

878
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,433
Come in.

879
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,150
Get me the military
governor's office.

880
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,998
For General Kahlenberge.

881
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,236
You're to stay with him
every minute of the day.

882
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,715
24-hour call, do you understand?
Yes, sir.

883
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,911
He may want to go out at night.

884
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,669
Do you know anything which
might interest General Tanz?

885
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,269
Nightclubs or girls,
that sort of thing.

886
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,629
A few, sir.

887
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,354
But I don't really know
what the general's taste is, sir.

888
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,677
Let us hope that whatever it is,
it is not you, corporal.

889
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,953
However, if it should be, remember
that you're serving the fatherland.

890
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,752
I'll try to remember, sir.

891
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,918
Should he ask you to take him to his
headquarters, you are to telephone me.

892
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,350
Either here or at my hotel.
Yes, sir.

893
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,472
You'll report to Colonel Sandauer
for specific instructions.

894
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,119
Sir?

895
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,038
What is it, corporal?

896
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,355
I'm sorry, but I was supposed to have
a 24-hour leave starting tomorrow.

897
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,596
That's impossible.

898
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,150
Could I have one hour free
in the morning, sir?

899
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,873
No.

900
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,713
Sir.

901
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,638
Hartmann?
Sir?

902
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,879
This is important.

903
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,793
All right.
Now, where were we?

904
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,468
Oh, yes. Childhood diseases?

905
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,677
Measles.

906
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,996
I can't remember.
Nothing serious, I think.

907
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,553
Chickenpox.

908
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,352
Bed-wetting?

909
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,511
No, sir.
Fear of the dark?

910
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,119
No, not particularly.

911
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,231
Venereal disease?

912
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,875
No, sir.
Good.

913
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,878
Now, what about books?
Books?

914
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,469
Do you read books?
Yes, sir, I read books.

915
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,434
What?
<i>War and Peace. </i>

916
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,596
Nietzsche,
<i>The Decline of the West</i>.

917
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,997
Books on psychology,
pathology?

918
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,192
No, not much.

919
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,356
Show me your hands.

920
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,476
All right. Now, you'll have a room
assigned to you in the general's hotel.

921
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,194
He'll want to see
the principal sights of Paris.

922
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,790
You will prepare an itinerary
and submit it to me.

923
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,118
When not in the field,
the general goes to bed at 11:45.

924
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,595
He seldom drinks or smokes,

925
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,553
so you will probably have
an early evening.

926
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,991
Now, this is my private number,

927
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,872
in case you should need me.

928
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,593
Need you, sir?

929
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,588
If anything out of the ordinary
should happen, ring me immediately.

930
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,109
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

931
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,958
Good luck.

932
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,312
Thank you, sir.

933
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,635
Incidentally, avoid all cemeteries,
tombs, any mention of death.

934
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,394
Yes, sir.

935
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,034
Sir?

936
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,879
Inspector Morand, please.
Third floor, room 158.

937
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,675
Who shall I say is here?
Thank you. I can find my own way.

938
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,238
[SPEAKS FRENCH]

939
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,633
Welcome, Colonel Grau,
to the spider's web.

940
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,114
How did you know it was me?

941
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,675
What other German colonel
would enter unannounced?

942
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,235
Almost any SS colonel would.

943
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,590
Actually, I saw you reflected
in the window.

944
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,712
Impossible, it's too dirty.

945
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,196
I hope you're not allergic to dust.
Old crimes, colonel.

946
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,597
They generate
a good deal of dust.

947
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,915
Unsolved crimes.

948
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,671
The dust has settled.

949
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,189
We can always unsettle it.

950
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,152
Is that why you came?
Do sit down, colonel.

951
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,079
I must apologize for the heat,
but it's nearly August,

952
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,157
when most Parisians
leave Paris.

953
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,999
Let's hope Germans have
the good sense to do the same.

954
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,873
Saint-Lô fell to the Allies
this morning.

955
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,116
BBC?

956
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,595
Coffee?
No, thank you.

957
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,276
You have dossiers
on everyone, don't you?

958
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,597
On everyone interesting.
German as well as French?

959
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,792
At the specific request
of German Intelligence,

960
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,232
we keep an occasional eye
on interesting Germans.

961
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,873
Like me?

962
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,198
I have always found you interesting.
Thank you.

963
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,311
What about German generals?

964
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,879
Well, what about them?

965
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,548
Generals are interesting?

966
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,548
Then, to the degree that they are
interesting, we keep an eye on them too.

967
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,038
Good. Here are the names of three generals.
I want to know everything about them.

968
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,231
Everything may be too much.

969
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,476
What specifically
are you looking for?

970
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,150
One of them is a murderer.

971
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,952
Only one?

972
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,038
But murder is the occupation
of generals.

973
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:30,792
Let's say what is admirable on the
large scale is monstrous on the small.

974
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,032
Since we must give medals
to mass murderers,

975
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,994
let us try to give justice
to the small entrepreneur.

976
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,512
Nicely put. I shall be glad
to help you if I can.

977
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,759
I realize that nothing is free in
this world, even between colleagues.

978
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,678
Especially between colleagues.

979
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,632
In exchange
for your information,

980
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,356
I shall arrange for the release from
prison of three French resistance.

981
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,198
Thank you.

982
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,109
Have you a favorite suspect?
Not really, no.

983
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,833
You see, on the night
of the murder,

984
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,793
each general
had something to conceal.

985
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,468
The night of the murder was...?

986
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,990
December the 12th,
1942, Warsaw.

987
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,193
And just as I started my investigation,
I was transferred to Paris.

988
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,630
By the murderer?
Possibly.

989
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,354
For two years, I've wanted
to reopen the case.

990
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,836
Now I can. As of today,
all three are in Paris.

991
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,758
General Gabler.

992
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,235
He's partial to the sort
of girl who was killed.

993
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,876
Oh, a girl. A crime
of passion, as we say.

994
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,755
Passion, yes, but only in the sense
of your distinguished Marquis de Sade.

995
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,478
Oh, a sex crime, I see.
Is that why this case excites you?

996
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,109
The girl was also
a German agent.

997
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,153
She may have been killed
because of something she knew.

998
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,033
That's why Kahlenberge
intrigues me the most.

999
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,913
He seems to have no private life

1000
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,350
and yet he disappears
from time to time.

1001
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,915
No one knows where or why.

1002
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,758
And General Tanz?

1003
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,234
A perfect maniac.

1004
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,514
<i>I saw him destroy</i> <i>an entire quarter of
Warsaw</i> <i>for the sheer pleasure of it. </i>

1005
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,076
<i>On the Eastern front,</i>
<i>he was known as The Butcher. </i>

1006
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,794
<i>He lost most of his division</i>
<i>in Russia. </i>

1007
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,117
<i>He revels in death. </i>
<i>Which is why, in a curious way,</i>

1008
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,993
<i>I don't think he's the man</i>
<i>I'm looking for. </i>

<i>a city whenever he chooses</i>

Hartmann?
Yes.

1013
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,238
I'm Sergeant Kopatski,
the general's orderly.

1014
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,873
For the time being, that is.

1015
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,789
I forgot to take his laces out before
cleaning his shoes this morning.

1016
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,638
For God's sake,
where are your gloves?

1017
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,400
You'll get finger marks on it.
I haven't got gloves.

1018
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,716
They never told me.
Take mine.

1019
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,400
These are the general's
holiday rations.

1020
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,718
One bottle of cognac, one Thermos
of coffee at 40 degrees centigrade,

1021
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,273
two hundred cigarettes.

1022
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,391
Does the general drink?

1023
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,955
Like a sponge,
only he never shows it.

1024
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,832
Put the briefcase
on the back seat.

1025
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,632
On the right side.

1026
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,354
Whenever he leaves the car,
clean out the ashtrays.

1027
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,073
He smokes like a chimney.

1028
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,032
Clean everything in sight.

1029
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,276
Clean everything out of sight,

1030
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,799
including the engine.

1031
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,878
If you don't, he'll tear
your head off.

1032
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,355
It's now one second to 9:00.

1033
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,516
Here he comes.

1034
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,634
I've given him full
instructions, sir.

1035
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,274
Name?
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal, sir.

1036
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,755
Show the general your hands.

1037
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,672
Well, don't stand there like a fool.
Put your gloves on.

1038
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,835
He seems to know Paris.

1039
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,315
He's prepared an itinerary of the
sights of the city. I have endorsed it.

1040
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,078
I shall see you tomorrow morning
at headquarters.

1041
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,235
Yes, general.

1042
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,953
Sergeant Kopatski
is relieved as my orderly.

1043
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,879
This morning he smeared
polish on my shoelaces.

1044
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,833
Fourteen days confined to barracks.
Yes, general.

1045
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,831
We've just passed
the Place Vendôme, sir.

1046
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,636
The column is 142 feet high
and was erected in 1810.

1047
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,879
It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon
captured at Austerlitz.

1048
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,638
There's a statue of Napoleon
on the top.

1049
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,632
In front of us, sir,
the Tuileries Gardens.

1050
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,913
The Tuileries Palace used to be
in the middle of the gardens.

1051
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,633
In 1792, at the time
of the French Revolution,

1052
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,716
the Paris mob attacked
the palace,

1053
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,912
forcing the king and queen
to escape.

1054
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,394
It was burnt down in...

1055
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,318
in 1871.

1056
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,595
We are now coming
into Place de la Concorde.

1057
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,156
One of the most beautiful squares
in Paris.

1058
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,516
It was here, in the middle
of the square

1059
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,030
that Louis XVI
and Marie Antoinette

1060
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,794
were beheaded
during the revolution.

1061
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,919
The guillotine was there, in the
centre, where the obelisk is now.

1062
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,037
Keep your eye
on the road, corporal.

1063
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,878
Yes, sir.

1064

[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

1065

Fräulein Gabler?
Yes.

1066
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,592
I'm Sergeant Kopke
from your father's headquarters.

1067
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,077
How did they know
which train I was on?

1068
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,599
They didn't.

1069
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,518
May I?

1070
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,679
You see, I'm Hartmann's cousin.

1071
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,872
We got no secrets, Hartmann and me.
More like brothers, really.

1072
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,311
He's all right, isn't he?
All right? Never better.

1073
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,149
No, it's just at the last moment he
was assigned to drive General Tanz.

1074
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,511
Only for today. That's
why he couldn't meet you.

1075
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,551
Well, how are things
in the fatherland?

1076
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,830
Any cities left

01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,474
A few, yes, here and there.

1078
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,956
There's one good thing about Paris.
It's an open city, no bombs.

1079
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,230
I hate bombs.

1080
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,069
This way, Fräulein Gabler.
I have a car for you just outside.

1081
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,077
I'll take you
to your father's hotel.

1082
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,998
Hartmann's staying there too.

1083
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,033
With General Tanz,
just for tonight.

1084
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,675
So I suppose you'll run
into him sooner or later,

1085
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,757
in the lobby or something.

1086
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,155
The gallery is shut
to the public, sir.

1087
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,955
But special permission has been
granted for you to see the paintings.

1088
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,196
Most of them have been
confiscated and assembled here

1089
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,595
before being sent to Germany.

1090
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,192
General Tanz.
You've been notified.

1091
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,597
Yes, corporal.
Here's all the information.

1092
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,636
On your right, sir,
paintings by Boucher,

1093
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,149
the 18th-century
French master.

1094
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,396
All these paintings
have been selected

1095
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,273
for <i>Reichsmarschall</i> Goering.

1096
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,118
What's in there?

1097
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,150
Paintings requisitioned from private
collections by the <i>reichsmarshcall. </i>

1098
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,634
What kind of paintings?

1099
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,877
Modern, sir,
and some impressionists.

1100
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,399
Decadent?

1101
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,636
I suppose so, sir.

1102
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,198
HARTMANN:
Light.

1103
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,073

painted while in an insane asylum
during the last years of his life.

1113
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,559
Here, sir, a painting by Cézanne.

1114
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,193
How dare you touch me?

1115
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,630
Excuse me, sir, but...

1116
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,559
Never do that again!
