MY DEAR,
I WAS JUST GOING--

THEN YOU'LL BE
UPSET ALL NIGHT.
HERE. TAKE A PILL.

309

LIFE WITH YOU IS
JUST ONE BLASTED
PILL AFTER ANOTHER--

UH, MY LOVE.

311

HA HA HA! JUST LIKE
A CHILD--BENJI.

ABOUT TO BE MARRIED,
ISN'T SHE?

316
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,305
THAT'S SPLENDID.
YOU MUST LET ME CHOOSE
HER TROUSSEAU.

FOR DUTY
WITH THE POLITICAL

JUST BEEN BEGGING ME
TO FIND HIM A WIFE.

MOST ADMIRE IN A WOMAN?

OF SILENCE.

00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,856
I SEE.

454
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,358
NOW I UNDERSTAND
THE STRANGENESS
OF YOUR BEHAVIOR

455
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,427
FOR SOME TIME PAST.

456
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,864
BUT YOU
MUST REMEMBER...

457
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:09,366
THAT YOU LOVED
GEOFFREY WHEN
YOU ACCEPTED HIM.

458
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,368
HE'S BEEN AWAY
A LONG TIME,

459
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,370
AND NOW
THAT HE'S BACK,

460
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,373
YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT THAT LOVE
IS STILL THERE

461
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,876
AND THIS IS
MERELY A PASSING
INFATUATION.

462
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,378
I WISH
YOU WERE RIGHT, FATHER.

463
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,881
I'VE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT
AGAINST IT,

464
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,382
BUT I LOVE HIM.

465

I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF YOU

EVER SINCE

IS BEST FOR YOU.

A SPLENDID FELLOW,

LOVES YOU
WITH ALL HIS HEART.

470
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,895
YOU CAN'T
WANTONLY HURT HIM.

471
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,397
OH, I DON'T WISH
TO HURT GEOFFREY.

472
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,900
OF COURSE YOU DON'T,
MY DARLING.

473
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,902
THERE, NOW.
DRY YOUR EYES.

474
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,904
LET'S FORGET THIS
LITTLE INCIDENT,

AND PROMISE
WHEN YOU MEET HIM
TONIGHT,

476
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,876
YOU'LL TREAT HIM
AS THOUGH NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED.

I'LL TRY, FATHER.

00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,383
WILL YOUR HIGHNESS
EXCUSE ME?

481
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,884
WHY, OF COURSE.

482
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,886
SOME BEAUTIFUL
LADY IS WAITING,
NO DOUBT.

483
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,888
YES, NO DOUBT.

THE GALLANT
CAPTAIN VICKERS

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,560
ONCE SAVED MY LIFE,

487
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,562
AND AS YOU KNOW,
IN MY COUNTRY,
SIR CHARLES,

488
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,564
FRIENDSHIP CAN BE
CLAIMED BY FRIENDLY
ACTIONS ALONE.

489
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,566
YES. IN THIS
TREACHEROUS LIFE,

490
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:18,569
IT'S DIFFICULT
TO KNOW WHICH IS FRIEND
AND WHICH IS FOE.

491
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,571
BUT IN THE END,
ONE FINDS OUT,

492
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,573
AND THE WISE MAN
ACTS ACCORDINGLY.

493
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:23,574
YES.

494
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,576
AHEM. YES.
ARE YOU STAYING LONG

UNLESS WHAT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?

499
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,652
I SOMETIMES THINK,
SIR CHARLES,

500
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,154
THAT A GREAT
GOVERNMENT RESEMBLES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

501
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,857
WHO, INTOXICATED
WITH THE POWER
OF HER OWN BEAUTY,

502
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,159
IS APT TO
WITHDRAW FROM
A SINCERE SUITOR

503
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,161
THE FAVORS SHE'S
ALWAYS GRANTED,

504
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,163
AND WHEN SHE FINDS
THIS SUITOR

505
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,165
CONSOLE HIMSELF
WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY,

506
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,667
REGRETS
HER COLDNESS.

507
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,935
INTERESTING. AND WHAT
DOES SHE DO THEN?

508
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,938
SHE CLAIMS THE PRIVILEGE
OF ANY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AND CHANGES HER MIND

509
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,274
BEFORE SHE'S LOST
HER SUITOR FOREVER.

510

DO YOU NOT AGREE?

511
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,278
THE ONLY GREAT GOVERNMENT
I'M ACQUAINTED WITH

512
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,780
IS SINGULARLY MASCULINE.

513
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,782
IT MAKES UP ITS MIND,

514
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,785
AND ONCE HAVING REACHED
A DECISION, ADHERES TO IT.

515
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,953
I'M AFRAID WE'RE
LOSING OURSELVES

516
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,955
IN A FLIGHT
OF FANTASY.

522
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,803
YOU ARE THE FIANCE

523
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,104
YOU ARE RIGHT.

I CONGRATULATE YOU,

ON THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE

I SAW MISS CAMPBELL AND HIM
DANCING TONIGHT.

528
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,946

WAS ANYTHING BUT DIPLOMATIC.

I WAS VERY STUPID

IN ANY CASE.

00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,376
YES, OF COURSE.

761
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:54,677
SIR.

762
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,145
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO WAIT A BIT, PEARSON,

763
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,580
BUT GOOD WORK
ALL THE SAME.

764
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,984
NOW, WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY
ABOUT GOING BACK
TO CHUKOTI?

765
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,986
WE NEED
SEASONED OFFICERS
UP THERE.

766
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,420
I WOULD LIKE IT IMMENSELY,
PERSONALLY, SIR.

767
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,955
HE'S GOING TO BE
MARRIED SOON, SIR.

768
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,490
SO I UNDERSTAND.

769
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,325
WELL, WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO

770
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,994
ABOUT GETTING YOU
AN EXTENDED LEAVE
LATER ON.

771
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,495
WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.

772
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,063
WELL, THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.

773
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,070
PERRY.

774
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,175
[PERRY]
YOU SENT FOR ME, SIR?

775
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,511
PERRY, YES. SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
WON'T YOU?

776
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,413
THANK YOU, SIR.

777
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,019
THE VICKERS ARE
AN OLD ARMY FAMILY.

778
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,020
YES, SIR.

779
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,522
I KNEW YOUR FATHER
AT ZANDA, PERRY.

780
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,026
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
GEOFFREY HAVE COME
ALONG ADMIRABLY,

781
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:47,030
THOUGH AS BROTHERS,
I EXPECT YOU'VE HAD
YOUR LITTLE DIFFERENCES.

782
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,531
HMM?

783
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,701
YOU KNOW,
BROTHERS RARELY AVOID
THESE LITTLE THINGS...

784
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,537
BUT THEY'RE
USUALLY TRIFLES.

785
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,538
TRIFLES, SIR?

786
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
CERTAINLY.
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

787
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,043
WELL, THAT IS, IT'S
RATHER DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN,

788
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:02,045
BUT, DON'T YOU
THINK, SIR,

789
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,047
WE'RE ENTITLED
TO SETTLE
OUR OWN PROBLEMS

790
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,682
IN OUR OWN WAY?

791
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,319
YES. YES, PERHAPS SO.

792
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,055
NOW, GOVERNOR GENERAL
DELHAUSSY

793
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:16,059
REQUIRES THE PRESENCE
OF A POLITICAL MAN
ON THE FRONTIER

794
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:18,061
TO HANDLE THE SURISTANI
SITUATION.

795
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:19,529
I'VE SELECTED YOU.

796
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:21,931
YOU MEAN I'M TO GO
UP TO CHUKOTI, SIR?

797
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,567
NO. YOU'LL BE
STATIONED AT LOHARA.

798
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,571
CHUKOTI WILL BE
THE SPEARHEAD OF ANY
POSSIBLE MILITARY MANEUVERS,

799
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:32,075
BUT YOUR DUTIES
WILL BE THOSE
OF AN OFFICIAL OBSERVER.

800
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:33,576
IS THAT FINAL, SIR?

801
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:35,678
I MEAN, THAT I'M
TO GO UP TO LOHARA?

802
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,581
FINAL. YOU'LL HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO THERE

803
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,584
THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.

804
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,089
YOU'LL LEAVE
WITH A CARAVAN
IN THE MORNING.

805
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,490
THAT'S ALL.

806
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,059
YES, SIR.

807
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,794
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

808
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:23,292
PERRY. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
HAVE GONE, OLD LAD.

809
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,595
ELSA CAN'T LOVE
BOTH OF US,
YOU KNOW.

810
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:27,096
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

811
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,097
WELL, THEN...

812
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,599
LOOK HERE, GEOFFREY.

813
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,602
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS THING SETTLED
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

814
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,103
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,
SO WHY PRETEND WE ARE?

815
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,606
ALL THE CARDS
ARE STACKED ON YOUR SIDE--

816
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,107
OLD CAMBPELL'S FOR YOU,

817
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,109
THE FACT THAT YOU
GOT THERE FIRST,
EVERYTHING.

818
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,611
I'VE ONLY ONE CLAIM--

819
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,346
ELSA HAPPENS TO LOVE ME,
AND ONLY ME,

820
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:46,015
AND AS LONG
AS THAT'S TRUE,
I'M GOING TO FIGHT ANYONE.

821
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,984
PERRY, I KNOW
YOU'RE WRONG.

822
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,986
WE CAN'T LET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COME BETWEEN US NOW,

823
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,254
AND BESIDES, YOU--

824
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:52,355
I'LL GET OVER IT.
I KNOW.

825
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,990
WELL, GET THIS
INTO YOUR HEAD.

826
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,992
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
MY OWN MIND AND ELSA'S.

827
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:58,361
I WOULDN'T
HANG ON TO ANYONE
WHO DIDN'T LOVE ME. I--

828
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,497
[MAN]
THIS IS WHERE WE
TURN OFF FOR CHUKOTI. VICKERS!

829
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,498
COMING.

830
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,000
PERRY, OLD LAD--

831
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,069
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO SAY.

832
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,082
[MAN]
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!

833
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,076
[BUGLING]

834
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,781
[MAN SHOUTING ORDERS]

835
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,286
EYES LEFT.

836
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,142
HALT!

837
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,589
REPORTING OUR RETURN
FROM CALCUTTA, SIR.

838
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,090
GOOD, MAJOR VICKERS.
ANY CASUALTIES?

839
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:10,092
YES, SIR.
ONE MAN WOUNDED.

840
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,361
WE WERE FIRED ON
SEVERAL TIMES,
BUT WE EXPECTED THAT.

841
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,230
DID YOU RETURN FIRE?

842
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:15,932
NO, SIR.

843
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:18,968
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS
ARE TO MAINTAIN PEACE.

844
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,103
PRETTY DIFFICULT ORDERS
TO FOLLOW, SIR,

845
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,172
PARTICULARLY WHEN
THEY'RE FIRING ON US.

846
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,442
YES. WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN SOLDIERING
AS LONG AS I HAVE,

847
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,811
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IT'S BEST TO FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDLESS.

848
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,012
YES, SIR.

849
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:34,016
BY THE WAY,
IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL

850
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,118
FOR AN OFFICER
TO APPEAR BEFORE HIS
COMMANDANT'S DAUGHTER

851
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,587
IN SUCH A CONDITION.

852
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:39,088
RUN ALONG
AND CLEAN UP

853
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,590
AND COME BACK
TO MY OFFICE.

854
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:41,691
YES, SIR.

855
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,531
TROOP,
FACE LEFT ABOUT!
WALK MARCH!

856
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,682
ASK MISS CAMPBELL
TO COME TO MY OFFICE
IMMEDIATELY.

857
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,024
HALT!

858
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,695
FALL OUT THE OFFICERS.

859
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,065
PREPARE TO DISMOUNT!

860
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,702
DISMOUNT!

861
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,707
DISMISSED.

862
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,513
CAPTAIN SAHIB!

863
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,015
PREMA!

864
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,516
UP YOU GO.

865
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,084
THANK YOU, SAHIB.

866
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,920
LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU BACK
A NEW SALUTE.

867
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,087
WATCH.

868
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,925
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

869
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,092
LIKE THIS.

870
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,599
TRY IT ON THE GENERAL.

871
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:08,177
WELL, MISS CAMPBELL
LEFT WITH THE FIRST PATROL
THIS MORNING, SIR.

872
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,846
CONFOUND IT!

873
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,616
WELL, UH, YES.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL.

874
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,060
WHY DIDN'T ELSA
TELL ME OF THIS?

875
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,563
THAT GIRL'S
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO ME. OUTRAGEOUS!

876
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,733
SHE KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL YOU
WERE ARRIVING TODAY.

877
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,034
PARDON, SIR?

878
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,537
ELSA LEFT FOR LOHARA
THIS MORNING.

879
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:38,507
LADY WARRENTON
MIGHT BE ILL, SIR.
SHE MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR HER.

880
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,776
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF,
AND WHAT IF SHE WERE?

881
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:42,244
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

882
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,050
[LADY WARRENTON]
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME--

883
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:49,552
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY.

884
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,121
A NICE CUP OF HOT TEA
WILL REALLY REFRESH YOU,
MY DEAR.

885
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:56,325
I'LL NEVER FORGET MY
APPALLING HONEYMOON TRIP
WITH DARLING BENJI.

886
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,861
YOU REMEMBER, DEAR?
BENJI!

887
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,731
YES, DEAR? BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE, DEAR.

888
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:04,066
HERE'S SOME NICE COLD WATER
TO TAKE WITH YOUR PILL.

889
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:07,069
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
DRINK A LITTLE TOAST
TO OUR DELIGHTFUL GUEST.

890
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:10,072
KEEP ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN.

891
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,574
I HOPE
YOU AND SIR BENJAMIN

892
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,576
DIDN'T MIND MY COMING
UNINVITED LIKE THIS.

893
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:15,044
CERTAINLY NOT.
DELIGHTED.

894
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,545
MIND?
WE'RE ENCHANTED.

895
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:19,081
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT
RAVISHINGLY HANDSOME
FIANCE OF YOURS?

896
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,083
YOUNG VICKERS.
DUE HERE TODAY.

897
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,618
NO, BENJI,
YOU'RE ALL MUDDLED.

898
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,820
ELSA IS ENGAGED
TO THE OTHER BROTHER,
GODFREY.

899
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,322
GEOFFREY, DEAR.

900
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,090
SOME CAKE?

901
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,558
NO, THANK YOU.

902
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,094
SO THE BROTHER IS COMING.
WELL, WELL, WELL.

903
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:33,596
THAT IS A COINCIDENCE.

904
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,599
MY DEAR, YOU REMEMBER
THE APPALLING BALL
IN CALCUTTA?

905
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:40,102
WELL, I WAS CONVINCED
THAT YOU AND HE WERE, UH...

906
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:41,637
SO TO SPEAK.

907
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,739
[SIR BENJAMIN]
PAY NO ATTENTION TO
MY WIFE, MISS CAMPBELL.

908
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:46,108
SHE HAS TWO OBSESSIONS
IN LIFE--

909
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,910
GIVING ME PILLS
AND SCANDALOUS INTRIGUE.

910
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:51,113
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SAHIB.

911
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,115
THANK YOU.

912
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,116
LADY WARRENTON.

913
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:55,618

914
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,685

915
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:59,121
<i>ELSA! WHY,
THIS IS A SURPRISE.</i>

916
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,990
HOW ARE YOU, PERRY?

917
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,691
[SIR BENJAMIN]
GOOD TRIP,
MY BOY?

918
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:06,629
DON'T BE ABSURD, BENJI.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GOOD TRIP IN INDIA.

919
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,632
ONE EITHER TRAVELS IN
COMPARATIVE DISCOMFORT
OR IN COMPLETE DISCOMFORT.

920
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,133
MINE WAS COMPLETE.

921
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,636
YOU TWO CHILDREN
WANT TO BE ALONE, I KNOW.

922
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,205
YOU MUST TELL ELSA
ALL ABOUT GODFREY.

923
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,273
GEOFFREY, DEAR.

924
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,774
ALL ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

925
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,278
THOUGH, WHY YOU'RE NOT
GREEN WITH JEALOUSY OF HIM

926
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,114
FOR ANNEXING THIS ADORABLE
CREATURE, I CAN'T IMAGINE.

927
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,549
COME, BENJI.

928
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:29,151
OH, PLEASE DON'T
DISTURB YOURSELF,
LADY WARRENTON.

929
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,686
ELSA AND I
WILL TAKE A STROLL.

930
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:31,687
SHALL WE?

931
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:32,855
YES.

932
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:36,625
NO, NO, NO.
NOT OUT THERE.
NOT ON THE VERANDA.

933
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,562
THERE. IN
THE SUMMER HOUSE...

934
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,564
WHERE THE BIRDS
ARE SINGING

935
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,132
AND THE FLOWERS
ARE BURGEONING.

936
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,701
ACROSS THE VERANDA
AND DOWN THE WALK.

937
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,141
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOUR CONSTANT INNUENDOS
ARE INTOLERABLE.

938
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,643
YOU FULLY EMBARRASSED
YOUNG VICKERS
AND THE CAMPBELL GIRL,

939
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,145
NOT TO MENTION ME.

940
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,147
WHY CAN'T YOU RESIST
POKING YOUR NOSE

941
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,849
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE AFFAIRS?

942
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:01,650
IS NOTHING SACRED
TO YOU?

943
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,719
YES, BENJI, DEAR.
YOUR LIVER.

944
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,158
IT'S WONDERFUL OF YOU
TO COME HERE LIKE THIS.

945
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,161
WHEN I SAW YOU JUST NOW,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
POSSIBLE.

946
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,163
WHY DID YOU
TAKE SUCH A RISK?

947
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,664
I HAD TO.

948
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,667
I'VE TRIED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET YOU.

949
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,536
I'VE EVEN TRIED
TO HATE YOU,

950
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,005
BUT I LOVE YOU.

951
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:24,974
I ALWAYS HAVE,
AND I ALWAYS SHALL.

952
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,375
DARLING.

953
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,545
POOR FATHER.
YOU SEE, HE'S RIGHT
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.

954
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:32,548
HE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TRY TO GET OVER IT.

955
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,550
I DID TRY...
FOR THREE MONTHS,
BUT I FAILED,

956
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,053
SO I THREW AWAY
ALL COMMON SENSE
AND CAME HERE TO YOU

957
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:41,624
TO MAKE SURE THAT--
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO FACE EVERYTHING WITH ME.

958
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,060
MY LOVE FOR YOU
IS EVEN STRONGER,

959
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,062
MORE A PART OF ME
THAN EVER.

960
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,564
I WAS SURE OF IT.

961
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,065
TOMORROW I MUST GO
BACK TO CHUKOTI

962
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:52,067
AND TELL
FATHER AND GEOFFREY

963
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:57,006
THAT WHATEVER HAPPINESS

SIR BENJAMIN'S
COMPLIMENTS, SIR.

00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,322
YOU'VE HAD A SCRAP.

973
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:49,959
WE WERE FIRED UPON
BY THE SURISTANIS
IN KOHRUD PASS.

974
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:51,026

YES, SIR. MY PATROL

00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:56,065
BUT WE LOST A MAN--

00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,166
WENTWORTH?

978

THAT'S ALL, BARCLAY.

00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,774
WELL, SIR. THE KHAN--
THAT IS, IF I MAY...

981
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:07,443
YES, OF COURSE.
GO ON.

982
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:10,713
WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, WE RAN
ACROSS A CARAVAN COMING
DOWN FROM THE PASS.

983
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,114
THERE WAS A HINDU MERCHANT.

984
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,617
HE'D JUST BEEN
TO VISIT THE SURISTANIS,

985
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,286
AND HE HAS IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT THE SURISTANIS ARE
PREPARING FOR AN ATTACK.

986
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:19,121
AN ATTACK?

987
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,322
YES, SIR.
ON CHUKOTI.

OH, COME,
COME, NOW, BARCLAY.

THAT BARCLAY'S
INFORMATION

994
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,637
IS ACCURATE, SIR.

00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,707
ALL RIGHT.

997
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,143
WHY THIS GARRISON?
WHY CHUKOTI?
ANSWER ME THAT, VICKERS.

998
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,646
THE KHAN'S
WISE ENOUGH
TO KNOW, SIR,

999
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,648
THAT AN ATTACK
ON CHUKOTI NOW

1000
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,650
WILL IGNITE
THE ENTIRE FRONTIER.

00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,318
WHY,
THE INFERNAL SCOUNDREL.

1002
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,121

THE HOME GOVERNMENT'S
FEELINGS ABOUT A BORDER WAR.

THAT'S IT EXACTLY, SIR.

1004

ALSO THE FACT THAT

GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA.

1264

SOLUTION WOULD BE
AN EVACUATION.

01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:57,077
BUT THE LARGEST
OF THE FRENCH MAN-OF-WAR.

1524
01:31:57,079 --> 01:31:59,713
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
OUR RESOURCES, GENERAL.

1525
01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:01,314
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

1526
01:32:01,316 --> 01:32:03,550
WE HAVE SEBASTOPOL
UNDER SIEGE,

1527
01:32:03,552 --> 01:32:06,319
AND OUR FORCES HAVE
THE RUSSIANS AT BAY,
SO TO SPEAK.

1528
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:07,854
BESIDES, SO FAR,

1529
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:11,825
NO REAL OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTACK SEBASTOPOL
HAS PRESENTED ITSELF.

1530
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,970
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.

1531
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:39,986
LORD RAGLAN
CAN'T BE DISTURBED

1532
01:32:39,988 --> 01:32:42,489
WHILE THE WAR COUNCIL'S
IN SESSION.

1533
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:44,491
TAKE IT UP WITH
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.

1534
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:45,992
YES, SIR.

1535
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:47,193
WAIT.

1536
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:58,605
ALL RIGHT. CARRY ON.

1537
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,041
YES, SIR.

1538
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:11,484
MY PLAN TO WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE

1539
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:13,987
IS PERFECTLY CLEAR
TO ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN.

1540
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:15,889
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ISSUE
THE ORDERS, SIR CHARLES.

1541
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:16,990
VERY GOOD.

1542
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:19,559
I THINK THAT'S ALL
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.

1543
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,511
SOME PAPERS
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE, SIR.

1544
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:40,013
HMM?

1545
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:42,015
WELL, THESE
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.

1546
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,516
PRESENTLY WILL DO.

1547
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:46,086
SIT DOWN.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A DISPATCH.

1548
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:52,525
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
ARMY OF THE CRIMEA.

1549
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:54,027
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY,

1550
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:56,596
FIELD MARSHAL
THE EARL OF RAGLAN, K.C.B.,
COMMANDING...

1551
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,399
THE MAJOR GENERAL

1552
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:04,971
SIR BENJAMIN WARRENTON, K.C.B.,
NO. 1174.

1553
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:11,077
ON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,

1554
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:13,580
YOU WILL WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE

1555
01:34:13,582 --> 01:34:17,417
TO A POINT
3 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST

1556
01:34:17,419 --> 01:34:19,919
OF ITS PRESENT POSITION...

1557
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:21,488
BY ORDER.

1558
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:37,504
LIGHT BRIGADE'S
MOVING BACK, SIR?

1559
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:40,473
YES.
WHAT'S SURPRISING
ABOUT THAT?

1560
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:42,108
VOLONOFF COMMANDS
THE RUSSIAN
ARTILLERY POSITION

1561
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,411
ON THE HEIGHTS
ABOVE THE VALLEY
OF BALAKLAVA.

1562
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:46,579
SURAT KHAN'S
WITH HIM.

1563
01:34:46,581 --> 01:34:49,382
WE KNOW THAT.

1564
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,950
DON'T YOU THINK
THE MEN OF THE 27th,
THE MEN FROM CHUKOTI,

1565
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:53,219
OUGHT TO BE GIVEN
A CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM?

1566
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:54,954
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1567
01:34:54,956 --> 01:34:56,623
EVERY BRITISH SOLDIER
WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE

1568
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,591
TO AVENGE
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,

1569
01:34:58,593 --> 01:35:01,561
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1570
01:35:01,563 --> 01:35:03,463
MAY NEVER BE
ANOTHER CHANCE, SIR.

1571
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:04,931
YOU MUST KNOW
THAT THE RUSSIANS

1572
01:35:04,933 --> 01:35:07,667
HAVE THEIR STRONGEST BATTERIES
SITUATED ABOVE THE VALLEY.

1573
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:09,969
IT WOULD TAKE
AT LEAST FIVE REGIMENTS
FOR THE ASSAULT.

1574
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:12,038
OH, NO, VICKERS,
IT'S SUICIDE.

1575
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,941
THAT VALLEY,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IS A VALLEY OF DEATH.

1576
01:35:14,943 --> 01:35:16,810
IT WOULD BE
WORTH IT, SIR.

1577
01:35:16,812 --> 01:35:18,211
600 MEN ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN CENTER

1578
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,713
WOULD KEEP
THE ENEMY OCCUPIED

1579
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:21,381
WHILE THE COMBINED
FRENCH, TURKISH,
BRITISH FORCES

1580
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,049
ATTACK SEBASTOPOL.

1581
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:27,020
SEBASTOPOL TAKEN,
THE CZAR MUST SUE
FOR PEACE.

1582
01:35:27,022 --> 01:35:30,857
YES. THE ENTIRE
CRIMEA SITUATION
HINGES ON SEBASTOPOL,

1583
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:34,194
BUT THIS IS NO TIME
TO CONSIDER PERSONAL
FEELINGS, VICKERS.

1584
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,029
YOUR PLAN IS
ADMIRABLY DARING,

1585
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:37,297
BUT THAT'S JUST IT.

1586
01:35:37,299 --> 01:35:39,165
IT'S TOO WILD.

1587
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,438
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO DELIVER THIS ORDER
PERSONALLY

1588
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,174
TO THE COMMANDER
OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.

1589
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:50,043
IS THAT CLEAR?

1590
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:51,778
YES, SIR.

1591
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:26,933
WHY, WHAT'S UP, VICKERS?

1592
01:38:26,935 --> 01:38:28,468
WHAT? NOTHING.

1593
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:30,470
YOU DO LOOK RATHER ODD,
YOU KNOW.

1594
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:32,472
CONFOUND YOU, BENTHAM.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
WILL YOU?

1595
01:38:32,474 --> 01:38:35,375
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.

1596
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,634
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THESE BATTLES

1597
01:39:01,636 --> 01:39:03,670
ARE THE FINEST
OF TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.

1598
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:05,204
WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN,

1599
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:07,407
APART FROM THOSE WHO DIED
FROM THE COLD AND SICKNESS.

1600
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,876
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPERATIVE
THAT UNLESS--

1601
01:39:09,878 --> 01:39:11,711
ORDERS FROM GENERAL
HEADQUARTERS, SIR.

1602
01:39:11,713 --> 01:39:13,212
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN.

1603
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:14,514
HIS EXCELLENCY'S
COMPLIMENTS.

1604
01:39:14,516 --> 01:39:16,582
THANK YOU.
WELL, HOW ARE THINGS
OVER AT HEADQUARTERS?

1605
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:18,584
THEY'VE BEEN
PRETTY DULL HERE.

1606
01:39:18,586 --> 01:39:20,053
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.

1607
01:39:20,055 --> 01:39:21,454
THAT'S FROM
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

1608
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:22,956
WELL, SIR.

1609
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,429
"UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
THE LIGHT BRIGADE WILL ADVANCE

1610
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:32,131
AND TAKE THE ENEMY POSITION
ON BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS."

1611
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,300
IT'S COME AT LAST.

1612
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:35,935
YOU EXPECTED IT?

1613
01:39:35,937 --> 01:39:37,770
FOR WEEKS, VICKERS.
FOR WEEKS.

1614
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:39,872
SO YOU THOUGHT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS WERE
THE ONLY ONES IN THE KNOW,

1615
01:39:39,874 --> 01:39:41,641
BUT I, TOO, KNEW
THAT SURAT KHAN

1616
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:43,576
WAS WITH VOLONOFF
ON THE BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS.

1617
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:45,445
THE 27th--
THE MEN KNOW, SIR?

1618
01:39:45,447 --> 01:39:47,213
CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE'D BE NO HOLDING THEM.

1619
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:48,414
DO YOU MIND
IF I TELL THEM?

1620
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:49,615
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE COMING WITH US?

1621
01:39:49,617 --> 01:39:51,250
OF COURSE.
IT'S MY REGIMENT.

1622
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:54,420
BESIDES, THIS
IS MORE THAN JUST
A FIGHT FOR ME, SIR.

1623
01:39:54,422 --> 01:39:56,289
AND TO ME, TOO,
MY BOY.

1624
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:59,225
DO YOU THINK THAT I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO SLEEP SINCE
THAT AWFUL DAY AT CHUKOTI?

1625
01:39:59,227 --> 01:40:01,260
AND NOW, AT LAST...

1626
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:04,230
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SPOKE TO MY BROTHER
HERE IN YOUR OFFICE?

1627
01:40:04,232 --> 01:40:05,732
CERTAINLY NOT.

1628
01:40:05,734 --> 01:40:07,233
ORDERLY...

1629
01:40:07,235 --> 01:40:09,168
GO TO
CAPTAIN VICKER'S BILLET

1630
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,970
AND REQUEST HIM
TO COME HERE AT ONCE.

1631
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,105
[MAN]
YES, SIR.

1632
01:40:12,107 --> 01:40:14,007
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
ACTION AT LAST.

1633
01:40:14,009 --> 01:40:17,410
COME WITH ME.
I TRUST ALL THE UNITS ARE
READY TO MOVE OUT AT ONCE.

1634
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:42,902
OH, I--I THOUGHT
SIR BENJAMIN SENT FOR ME.

1635
01:40:42,904 --> 01:40:46,105
NO. I SENT FOR YOU.

1636
01:40:46,107 --> 01:40:47,640
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS DISPATCH
TO GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

1637
01:40:47,642 --> 01:40:49,242
AND WAIT THERE
UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS.

1638
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:51,344
WAIT AT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS?

1639
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:54,113
BUT I'VE HEARD
THE REGIMENT'S
MOVING FORWARD.

1640
01:40:54,115 --> 01:40:55,615
IF I HAVE TO WAIT
AT GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,

1641
01:40:55,617 --> 01:40:57,183
I'LL BE OUT OF THE FIGHT
ALTOGETHER.

1642
01:40:57,185 --> 01:40:58,985
YOU'LL DELIVER IT
PERSONALLY TO
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.

1643
01:40:58,987 --> 01:41:00,887
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1644
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,889
I BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME OUT OF THIS
DELIBERATELY

1645
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:04,323
BECAUSE OF ELSA.

1646
01:41:04,325 --> 01:41:06,793
NO. NO. ELSA'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

1647
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:08,694
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE NOW, YOU KNOW.

1648
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:10,763
YOU'RE
WITH YOUR REGIMENT
AT THE FRONT.

1649
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:12,698
YOU'LL OBEY MY ORDERS
IMMEDIATELY.

1650
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,834
IF I REFUSE?

1651
01:41:14,836 --> 01:41:17,203
YOU'LL BE
COURT-MARTIALED.

1652
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:24,343
I SEE--
DISGRACED EITHER WAY.

1653
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:27,680
VERY WELL.

1654
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:44,330
BUGLER, SOUND ASSEMBLY.

1655
01:42:12,826 --> 01:42:14,694
MEN OF THE 27th,

1656
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:16,329
SURAT KHAN IS ON THE FIELD

1657
01:42:16,331 --> 01:42:18,598
WITH THE OPPOSING
RUSSIAN FORCES,

1658
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,733
THE SAME SURAT KHAN
WHO MASSACRED

1659
01:42:20,735 --> 01:42:22,635
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
OF CHUKOTI.

1660
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:25,104
OUR CHANCE HAS COME.

1661
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:26,873
SHOW NO MERCY.

1662
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,941
LET NO POWER ON EARTH
STOP YOU.

1663
01:42:28,943 --> 01:42:30,576
PROVE TO THE WORLD

1664
01:42:30,578 --> 01:42:32,278
THAT NO MAN CAN KILL
WOMEN AND CHILDREN

1665
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,714
AND LIVE TO BOAST OF IT.

1666
01:42:34,716 --> 01:42:37,116
MEN OF THE 27th,

1667
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:40,453
OUR OBJECTIVE IS SURAT KHAN!

1668
