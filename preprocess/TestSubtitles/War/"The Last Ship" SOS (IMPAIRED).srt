Probably 'cause I'm from Reno.

647
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:57,254
Huh.

648
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:04,695
Hey, Tex? Yeah, boss?

649
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:09,132
I am afraid.

650
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:12,069
To die?

651
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,775
To never see my wife.

652
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:21,011
And my kids.

653
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:45,535
I know what you're doing.

654
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,745
Playing it over and
over again in your head.

655
00:35:54,747 --> 00:35:59,283
Every second, every moment.

656
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:02,386
What you could've done differently.

657
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:11,395
I tripped.

658
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:14,598
If I hadn't, I'd still be
on the R.H.I.B. with them.

659
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,169
Then you'd be lost out there.

660
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,938
And what good would that do us?

661
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,808
Maybe they wouldn't be lost.

662
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,644
Maybe I could've done something.

663
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:38,021
A thousand hours of training
for five minutes of pure chaos.

664
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:42,492
And then a thousand hours
of second-guessing yourself.

665
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:46,596
That's the job...

666
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,598
For all of us.

667
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:55,038
Man: Saberhawk One, final approach.

668
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,974
Get her down and locked.
[Speaks indistinctly]

669
00:36:57,976 --> 00:37:01,211
- Skin down.
- Woman: Roger, Saberhawk One.

670
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:03,880
I just came from the lab.

671
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,883
The girl has a gene mutation
that makes her immune.

672
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:09,686
Dr. Scott injected her blood
into the monkey and if it works,

673
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,823
we may have the vaccine.

674
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:17,294
Well, everybody did their job.

675
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:19,529
The doctor is wondering
if she can join us in here.

676
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:24,701
She's concerned about the
captain and Tex, obviously.

677
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,592
X.O., the Russians are talking.

678
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:34,644
<i>[Man speaking Russian]</i>

679
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:37,347
They're still searching the water.

680
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,850
<i>[Russian continues]</i>

681
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:41,551
He thinks the Americans have drowned.

682
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:42,652
<i>He thinks?</i>

683
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:44,454
- What exactly did he say?
- Shh, shh.

684
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:45,741
Do they have a body?

685
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,524
I don't know. The radio
keeps cutting in and out.

686
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:48,859
I missed some of the words.

687
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,461
- Well, what words did you get?
- They said "drowned."

688
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,664
I swear to God, if you're lying to me,

689
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,099
I will strap you to a torpedo.

690
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:57,734
It's what I heard.

691
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:01,538
Sir, Helo just landed.
Standing by to refuel.

692
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,246
We can't trust anything we hear.

693
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,882
The Russians know we're listening.

694
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:14,618
They could be deliberately
feeding us bad intel.

695
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,186
Sir, if you mean to do this,

696
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,927
then I recommend we have
a Helo fly low zigzag

697
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:20,441
to make it harder for
someone to track it.

698
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,829
- That'll burn a lot of fuel, sir.
- Yes, it will.

699
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:25,729
But it means we've got enough time
to make one more short pass.

700
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,169
I concur. Head for that reef.

701
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:40,076
(_)

702
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:42,772
(_)

703
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:46,240
(_)

704
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:49,252
Man: All stations
report. I'm on instruments

705
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:51,488
on altitude 100 feet
on air speed 90 knots.

706
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,089
Negative contact.

707
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:55,692
Man: Roger. Visibility nil.

708
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,581
They're out there. They've
got to be out there.

709
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,249
Man: This is Saberhawk One.

710
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:21,618
We see something reflecting on
the surface to the southwest.

711
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,454
Taking a closer look. Over.

712
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:25,666
Man: Dropping down to 90 feet.

713
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:32,729
Roger. Right side, light chop.

714
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:44,407
[Helicopter approaching]

715
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:46,510
You hear that?!

716
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:53,216
Hey! Hey! We're here! We're here!

717
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:57,320
Don't tell me, you're
pissed at slattery now?

718
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:58,788
Son of a bitch.

719
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,693
Man: In sight, engaging
automatic approach,

720
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,830
standby to lower the harness. Roger.

721
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,633
[Pinging]

722
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:18,083
[Blades whirring]

723
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:20,769
Aah! Whoo!

724
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:22,496
You first!

725
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:26,558
Not a chance! You
first, Captain! I insist!

726
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:35,834
[Helicopter blades whirring]

727
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,987
What is that?

728
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,488
What the hell?

729
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,789
It's not them.

730
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,891
Man: Roger. No sign of survivors.

731
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:08,133
Come on.

732
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,200
