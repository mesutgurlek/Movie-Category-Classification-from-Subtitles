<i>Previously on "Vikings"...</i>

2
00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:03,311
I'd like to know
what will happen to me.

3
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:05,710
I see that an eagle hovers over you,

4
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:08,280
but I also see that you yourself
are the eagle.

5
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:10,485
A good sign from the gods.

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,552
Jarl Borg must pay the price
for what he did to my family.

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,788
We cannot go west without his ships.
We need him.

8
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:18,557
- What is your name?
- Porunn.

9
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,641
Do you have a boyfriend?

10
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,629
I hope you were
telling me the truth, Rollo.

11
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:27,299
Everything I do, I do for Rollo.

12
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,134
And you need my help.

13
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,236
You're a greater man than I am.

14
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:33,738
I realised what could
be gained by inviting you.

15
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:36,908
(Doors burst open, struggling grunts)

16
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,344
The eagle is your destiny, Jarl Borg.

00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,146
(Pained grunt)

18
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,446
I will draw a Blood Eagle
upon your back.

38

Are you going to proceed
with the execution of Jarl Borg?

39
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:30,521
I am.

40
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,425
I understand your reasons.

41
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,093
At the same time,

42
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,163
without Jarl Borg's ships
and warriors,

43
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,500
we cannot hope to mount
a successful raid on Wessex.

(Wet, squishy sounds
as rat is gutted)

45
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,373
We will find another ally.

- When?
- Soon.

47
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,278
I have sent out word.

48
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:56,881
Are you suggesting that my brother
should reprieve Jarl Borg

49
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,817
as if nothing has happened?

50
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:02,621
No. I am merely
asking you stay your hand

51
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,456
until another ally is found.

52
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:07,058
The execution of Jarl Borg
made public

53
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,294
would surely discourage and deter

54

No, you will be a wonderful father.

No, Helga, I'll be the worst father!

Shh. Shh. You're... You're right.

No, I'm f... I'm a fool.

There is no one else for me now.

as they surely will,

115
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,699
for we are such friends to them.

116
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,368
- Yes.
- Yes.

117
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:04,805
And all of our friends...
Ragnar and...

118

No, not Ragnar.

119
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,580
- But, but he...
- No.

I said, not Ragnar.

121

Everything here is for Ragnar.

122
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,960
I've known him a long time.

123
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:24,149
I helped him rice, I built his ships.

124
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:27,898
And now he is Earl, Earl Ragnar,

125
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,434
and our little world waits upon him

126
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:33,504
and eats from his hand.

127
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:36,407
But he cannot have everything.

128
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:40,010
He cannot have you and me.

129
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,415

00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,251

(Sharp inhale and heavy sigh)

133
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:03,167
What is troubling you?

134
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:07,605
What is troubling me
is that you do not trust me.

135
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:09,974
I don't trust you?

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,611
That night you captured Jarl Borg,

137
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,013
you told me nothing
of what you meant to do.

138
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:18,983
I sent someone to find you.

139
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:22,119
They could not find you.

140
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,223
Where were you?

141
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,285
I was with Porunn.

142
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,835
So it was your decision.

143
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:41,573
You chose to be with her,
rather than me.

144
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:49,147
I only ask to be kept in
your confidence as your son.

145
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:56,354
I will be the judge of how far
I take you into my confidence.

146
00:08:56,422 --> 00:09:01,125
But as a father,
I will give you some advice.

147
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:05,663
Think with this...

148
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,400
Not with your...

SIGGY:
What is wrong?

154
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,454
ASLAUG:
I have never had such a pregnancy.

155
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,123
So much pain.

156
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,860
I am afraid.

157
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:40,265
Afraid of what?

158
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,136
When Ragnar
came to the farmhouse,

159
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,305
he wanted to have sex.

160
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,707
I told him
if he forced himself on me

161
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:51,288
in the first three days
of his return,

162
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,879
I would bear him a monster.

163
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:02,620
I do not know what made me say
the things I said to Ragnar.

164
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:07,625
I spoke them,
but the gods chose them.

165
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,632
(Wind howls)

166
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,904
(Approaching footsteps)

167
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,149
SIGGY: (Whispering)
As agreed.

168
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,608
(Coins clink)

169
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:31,616
(Blows out candle)
(Door rattles open)

170
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,766
What do you want?

171
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:37,773
Have you come here to gloat?

172
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:43,188
I look forward to my execution.

173
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:49,126
Have you ever seen anyone
being blood-eagled before?

174
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:54,981
I'm told it is the worst,
most painful death of all...

175
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,949
but astonishing.

176
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,331
Truly astonishing
to those who watch.

177
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,994
(Water churns and splashes)

178
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,625
(Shackles clank)

179
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:16,152
(Gulping greedily)

180
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,712
(Panting)

181
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:24,128
I will take no pleasure in your death.

182
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,447
Once, you would not have said that.

183
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:36,704
Certain things have changed.

184
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:40,436
They've changed because Ragnar Lothbrok
has humiliated you.

185
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:46,157
It's only the start
of his real ambitions.

186
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,251
Meaning?

187
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:51,763
Meaning Ragnar Lothbrok
wants to be king.

188
00:11:53,499 --> 00:12:00,004
Isn't that obvious to you,
King Horik?

189
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,343
Why would he stop
at assassinating me?

190
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,846
He's Ragnar Lothbrok.

191
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:12,557
His fame eclipses even yours.

192
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:22,600
Let us say I believe you.

193
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:25,937
What would you have me do?

194
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,474
I would arrange for my escape.

195
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:37,215
And then I would kill Ragnar Lothbrok
and make his brother Earl.

196
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:42,320
That's what I would do if I were you.

197
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,492
(Retreating footsteps)

198
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:50,895
(Rat squeaks)

199
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,668
I've brought you something.

200
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:02,407
(Shackles clank)

201
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,556
(Snake hisses)

202
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:14,419
RAGNAR: I've had dreams
of the Priest Athelstan.

203
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,488
He comes to me,
but I do not know where he is...

204
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,092
in Valhalla or in Hell?

205
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,262
SEER:
He is in neither place.

206
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,231
RAGNAR:
Then he is alive?

207
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,102
(Blowing dust)

208
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:45,783
SEER: He is physically alive,
but his spirit is tormented.

209
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:49,053
He does not know himself.
I see that.

210
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,991
RAGNAR:
You must tell me where he is.

211
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:59,697
(Wind gusts, parchment rustles)

212
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,199
SEER:
He is with a man you know.

213
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:02,800
(Raven croaks)

214
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:07,905
A foreigner. A king.

215
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,081
(Snake hisses, Seer exhales)

216
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,286
(Wings beat)

217
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,056
(Fighting grunt, weapons clank)

218
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,714
(Men cheering)

219
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:38,121
ROLLO:
(Speaking Old Norse)

220
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:41,891
(Fighting grunts,
Rollo speaks Old Norse)

221
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:46,095
(Men cheer, laugh, and applaud)

222
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:53,903
(Lively chatter fills the hall)

223
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,146
(Rollo exhales heavily,
trying to catch his breath)

224
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,982
What are you going
to do about Jarl Borg?

225
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,484
You know exactly
what I'm going to do.

226
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,653
Then why haven't you done it?
What're you waiting for?

227
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,922
I told the king that I would wait.

228
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,993
I don't understand, brother.

229
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:19,028
Why do you keep making
concessions to Horik?

230
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:22,465
Because he is the king.

231
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,338
(Chatter and laughter)

232
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,506
Why won't you talk to me?

233
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:32,909
There is not much to say.

234
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,745
We have everything
to say to each other.

235
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:38,014
You can tell me
about your whole life.

236
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:40,283
And I can tell you about mine.

237
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:42,018
There is not much to say about my life.

238
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:45,388
I've always been a servant.

239
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,827
Wait.

240
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,803
I thought you might be thirsty.

241
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,706
Thank you, Princess Aslaug.

242
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:06,576
You are kind.

243
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:08,978
I feel sorry for you.

244
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,047
It is all the same with we women.

245
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:14,317
We just give birth
to the slaughtered.

246
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:19,889
BJORN:
Rollo said that she is just a slave

247
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:23,059
and I can have her any time.

248
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,512
Your uncle is heavy-handed
when he speaks to others

249
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,112
about the heart.

250
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:29,899
But, the truth is,

251
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:32,568
he feels the pangs as deeply as you.

252
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,238
But warriors don't show their heart,

253
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,742
until the axe reveals it!

254
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:42,078
You are so wise, Floki.

255
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,113
FLOKI:
(Chuckles)

256
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:48,651
I'm not wise at all.
I'm just a joker.

257
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,887
(Kiss)

258
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,425
- Helga.
- Siggy.

259
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:57,794
You are with child.

260
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,262
Yes.

261
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,030
Floki must be happy.

262
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,769
He's not happy?
Why is he not happy?

263
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,761
It's complicated.
Floki is complicated.

264
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,711
Will you marry?

265
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:18,681
Yes. Yes, we will.

266
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:21,384
With Earl Ragnar's blessing?

267
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:24,954
My love does not think
that he needs Earl Ragnar's blessing.

268
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:28,458
Only that of the gods.

269
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:32,795
(Hall buzzes with chatter
and laughter)

270
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,284
I have some interesting news.

271
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:48,028
Floki is angry with Ragnar.

272
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,342
HORIK:
Floki? Floki loves Ragnar.

273
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:56,730
SIGGY:
Hmm.

274
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,912
Ragnar Lothbrok is no longer alone

275
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:15,282
in attacking our shores.

276
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:22,022
Mm. Yet for me...

277
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,860
he is still the greatest
disturbance to our world.

278
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:29,430
I agree,
and very likely to return here.

279
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,765
AELLE:
Mm.

280
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,034
ECBERT:
We must be prepared for him.

281
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,062
If you and I and our kingdoms
are allied together,

282
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,538
we will be stronger.

283
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,373
If his army lands in Northumbria,

284
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:41,308
I will come at once to your aid,

285
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:44,979
and trust that you will do
the same for me.

286
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,723
(Fire crackles)

287
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:53,170
(Chair scrapes, thuds on the floor)

288
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,728
Leave it.

289
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,933
All of you, leave.

290
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,869
(Retreating footsteps)

291
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,507
Mhh.

292
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:13,080
Mercia is a neighbor of mine,
as it is of yours,

293
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:16,617
so you know very well
what is happening there.

294
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:18,919
Since the death of King Offa,

295
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,422
the kingdom has fallen into turmoil,

296
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:24,792
with several members of his family
competing for the throne.

297
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,195
Offa's son and heir has been
murdered by his own sister,

298
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:30,764
and it seems there is no end

299
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,301
to the violence and the chaos there.

300
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:38,138
It suits neither of us
to have such an unstable

301
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:41,175
and tumultuous neighbor.

302
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:45,946
But... if you and I joined together,

303
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,283
not only against the Northmen,
but also against Mercia,

304
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:52,119
we should surely overcome it.

305
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,054
AELLE:
Mm.

306
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,457
We could then divide
Mercia up between us,

307
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:59,118
as we saw fit.

308
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,261
What do you say?

309
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:09,970
I say, after we have conquered Mercia,

310
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:13,507
what is to stop you from turning
on your smaller ally?

311
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:17,711
(Sighs, considering)

312
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:25,085
At the moment, King Aelle,
very little.

313
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:33,494
That is why I am proposing
the formal marriage

314
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:36,864
of my oldest son and heir,
Aethelwulf,

315
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:40,971
to your beautiful daughter, Judith.

316
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:44,638
Now then, what do you say?

317
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,142
Now I say...

318
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:51,970
let us drink to our alliance...

319
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,516
(Goblets clink)

320
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,685
And may the devil never
cast it asunder, hm?

321
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:00,220
(Chuckles)

322
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,991
(Slurps)

323
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,450
(Distrustful chuckles)

324
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:15,351
FLOKI:
(Grunts with effort)

325
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:22,525
Hey, papa!

326
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:27,697
(Sword scrapes)

327
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:33,803
(Stream babbles,
birds chirp and caw)

328
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:39,809
(Priests sing in Latin)

329
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:10,439
MEN:
Yay! All right!

330
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,775
(Guests laugh and cheer)

331
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:15,711
(Water splashes)

332
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,414
FLOKI AND HELGA:
(Giggle happily)

333
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:21,150
(Guests cheer,
Floki giggles excitedly)

334
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:30,660
(Laughter)

335
00:22:30,727 --> 00:22:32,728
(Cheers, laughter, and applause)

336
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,497
BISHOP:
Do you, Aethelwulf, son of Ecbert,

337
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,066
before all these witnesses
here gathered,

338
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,835
take this woman, Judith,
daughter of Aelle,

339
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:43,272
as your lawful wife,
to have and to hold,

340
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,075
from this moment
until death parts you?

341
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:47,343
I do.

342
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:48,911
PRIESTESS:
Helga...

343
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:53,582
You must hold this sword
in trust for your son,

344
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,852
and now you must present
this new sword to the groom.

345
00:22:58,655 --> 00:23:00,289
The sword transfers

346
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,091
the father's power of protection
over the woman,

347
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,493
to her new husband.

348
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:09,265
(Laughter)

349
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:11,701
BISHOP: Do you, Judith,
before all these witnesses,

350
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:15,337
take this man, Aethelwulf,
to have and to hold,

351
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:19,308
and forsaking all others,
to serve and obey,

352
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,611
from this time henceforth,
until you die?

353
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,180
I do.

354
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:26,415
PRIESTESS:
Now the rings.

355
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:32,154
Floki, do you swear to the gods

356
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:34,957
that you want to marry this woman?

357
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:39,427
I swear,
with the gods as my witnesses.

358
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:44,800
Helga, do you swear to the gods

359
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:47,203
that you want to marry this man?

360
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:50,005
I do swear.

361
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:56,838
BISHOP:
Let these rings be a permanent sign

362
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,648
that you are united
in holy matrimony,

363
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,341
in the eyes of these people,
and in the eyes of God.

364
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,004
ALL:
Amen.

365
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,862
PRIESTESS:
Then you are married.

366
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,855
(Floki giggles, everyone cheers)

367
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,832
(Laughter and cheers erupt)

368
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,583
(Rain patters heavily)

369
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,582
(Hooves thud)

370
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:36,467
- Rollo Lothbrok?
- Yes.

371
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:38,523
I have come to talk to your brother...

372
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,910
upon important business.

373
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:43,983
And what business would that be?

374
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:47,719
Believe me, your brother
would want to hear me.

375
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,042
(Throwing grunt, hard whack)

376
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,368
RAGNAR:
Ooh!

377
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:53,869
(Laughs drunkenly)

378
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,073
You son of a whore.

379
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,392
One more.

380
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:02,378
TORSTEIN:
Wait. My turn.

381
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:05,114
(Spits then grunts)

382
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:07,550
RAGNAR:
All right.

383
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:10,886
(Preparatory exhale)

384
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,988
- Torstein?
- Here! I'm here.

385
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:16,158
Is your shield up?
It is so dark in here!

386
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:20,162
(Loud thwack)
Ha!

387
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:23,632
RAGNAR AND TORSTEIN:
(Laugh drunkenly)

388
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,901
This is my brother.

389
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:28,604
RAGNAR AND TORSTEIN:
(Laugh)

390
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:30,739
RAGNAR:
And you are?

391
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:37,346
You sent word that you needed
a new ally to attack Wessex.

392
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:40,349
The word reached us

393
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,084
and we are happy to say that
we can provide such an ally.

394
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:43,752
RAGNAR:
(Scoffs)

395
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,424
An Earl with enough ships and men
to make your raid a great success.

396
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:51,505
His name is Earl Ingstad.

397
00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:55,531
Earl Ingstad?

398
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,333
Earl Ingstad.

399
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:58,934
(Arrow strikes shield,
torstein pants)

400
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:00,603
Never heard of him.

401
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:03,339
TORSTEIN:
(Laughs drunkenly)

402
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,808
Why is he not with you?

403
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:09,778
He did not want to waste
the journey.

404
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:13,849
He wanted to be certain
that you were still in need of an ally.

405
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:16,118
When can I meet him?

406
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:17,786
You can meet him at any time.

407
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:19,622
- Yes!
- He is ready to attend.

408
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:21,824
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

409
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:24,526
TORSTEIN:
(Laughs drunkenly)

410
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:26,729
(Doors shut)

411
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:30,199
(Wind howls fiercely)

412
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:38,007
We have found a new ally.

413
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:42,344
Earl Ingstad... Whoever he is.

414
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,713
When will he arrive?

415
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:46,482
A few days.

416
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:52,221
And then Jarl Borg will be executed.

417
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:59,161
That cannot come too quickly
for my liking.

418
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:02,932
(Clothes rustle)

419
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:07,202
(Door creaks open)

420
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:11,006
(Rats squeak)

421
00:27:14,945 --> 00:27:18,781
(Door bangs shut)

422
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:27,623
(Passionate gasps and moans)

423
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:28,691
You're hurting me!

424
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,695
You're hurting me!

425
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:35,150
Why do you do it?

426
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,804
Why do you sleep with King Horik?

427
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:45,674
(Sharp inhale, exhales slowly)

428
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:50,946
I do it for you.

429
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:58,253
(Choked gasp)

430
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:02,324
Please!

431
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:06,161
(Exhales sharply,
gasping for breath)

432
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:19,708
What can King Horik do for me
that my brother cannot do?

433
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:27,493
Right now they are allies...
long may they remain so...

434
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:29,585
but in the event that
they should fall out,

435
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:33,922
you should be able
to choose between them.

436
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,304
Horik is a king.

437
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:40,378
Never forget that.

438
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:43,755
Never doubt how much power he has.

439
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:50,606
What have you decided?

440
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,474
I have decided to take your advice.

441
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:55,310
I will set you free.

442
00:28:55,412 --> 00:29:00,549
There are those here
who will help me.

443
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:04,787
People who only pretend
to be loyal to Ragnar.

444
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:10,626
(Shackles clank)

445
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:14,430
And then?

446
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,469
And then we will kill Ragnar Lothbrok.

447
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:31,464
BJORN:
I want to ask you something.

448
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:36,903
What is a Blood Eagle?

449
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:47,747
The offender gets down
on his knees...

450
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:53,719
and his back is opened with knives.

451
00:29:56,223 --> 00:30:01,252
And then, with axes,

452
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:06,173
his ribs are chopped away
from his spine.

453
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:12,247
And then his lungs

454
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:15,684
are pulled out of these huge,
bleeding wounds

455
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:19,088
and laid upon his shoulders,

456
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:21,757
so they look like the folded wings

457
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:24,326
of a great eagle.

458
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:32,634
And must he stay like that, suffering,

459
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:36,672
until he dies.

460
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:43,879
(Bathwater churns)

461
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:54,665
If he suffers in silence,
he may enter Valhalla.

462
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:58,393
But if he screams,

463
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:04,233
he can never enter its portals.

464
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:11,673
(Quick, loud knocking,
door creaks open)

465
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:17,813
Earl Ingstad is here.

466
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:19,982
(Bathwater sloshes)

467
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,317
Where is he?

468
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:25,921
He would not enter the great hall.

469
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,790
He chose instead
to remain in the woods.

470
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,195
(Door closes)

471
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:36,732
(Horses gallop, whinnying)

472
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:49,978
(Horse whinnies,
hooves thud softly)

473
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:57,152
(Horse snorts,
hooves thud softly)

474
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,791
Earl Ingstad?

475
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,335
(Sighs)

476
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:18,273
Earl Ingstad!

477
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:24,947
You bear a strong resemblance
to my ex-wife.

478
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:27,259
If I had given you my true name,

479
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:30,013
you might have turned me away.

480
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:34,656
How is Bjorn?

481
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:39,228
He is happy.

482
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:42,331
He is looking forward
to going to England.

483
00:32:42,432 --> 00:32:45,000
As am I.

484
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:52,206
So you are truly an Earl?

485
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:57,012
Yes. We are equal.

486
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:03,986
I'm sure this is difficult for you.

487
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:05,754
It is not difficult at all.

488
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:07,656
How many ships?

489
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:09,091
Four ships.

490
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:12,728
Over a hundred warriors.

491
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:21,870
So will you accept me as an ally?

492
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:24,006
RAGNAR:
(Clears throat)

493
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:25,540
That depends.

494
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:26,642
On what?

then it's a no.
