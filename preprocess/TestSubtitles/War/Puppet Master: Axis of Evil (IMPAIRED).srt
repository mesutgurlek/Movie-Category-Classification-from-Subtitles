1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,242
Hey. How's it going, Danny?

2
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,377
It's going great, Uncle Len.

3
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,479
Good, good, good.

4
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,147
I'm going to need those chairs

5
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,448
for the wedding reception
tomorrow night.

6
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,083
They going to be ready?

7
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,318
They'll be ready.

8
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,287
Good, good.

9
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,727
Is everything okay, Danny?

10
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,596
Yeah.

11
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,798
I was just...

12
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,267
You know, listening
to the party upstairs.

13
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,270
It just sounded like fun.

14
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,971
Yeah.

15
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,608
It's a group of soldiers
shipping out tomorrow morning.

16
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,143
They deserve to have some fun
their last night here.

17
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:26,146
Just wish I was
going with them.

18
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:30,083
I know.

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,487
Well, you be thankful
that that polio didn't leave
you with more than a limp.

20
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,190
For a while there,
none of us thought you
were going to make it.

21
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,192
Sometimes I wish I hadn't.

22
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,660
Oh, you don't mean that.

23
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,863
Think of what
that would've done.

24
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,334
But now all I am
is a useless cripple,

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,869
a useless 4-F cripple.

26
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,338
Useless?

27
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,340
[chuckles]

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,313
Look at
this fine workmanship, Danny.

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,717
This is a gift.
Look what you can
do with your hands?

30
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,354
Yeah, but I'd rather have
a rifle in my hands,

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,256
going after the Japs
or the Krauts.

32
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,358
I know.

33
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,263
Is Mr. Toulon
still staying here?

34
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,232
Yeah, he's
in his room upstairs.
Wonderful old man.

35
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,568
He was in Europe, you know.
He was fighting the Nazis.

36
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,102
Well, that's what he says,

37
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,137
but sometimes I think
he's prone to tall tales.

38
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,673
No, Uncle Len, it's true.

39
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,644
You know,
the Nazis killed his wife?

40
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,547
Mr. Toulon said the Nazis
wanted to steal his puppets,

41
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,816
so now he even has
a special hiding place

42
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:40,254
so they don't fall
into the wrong hands.

43
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,089
It's because he has
a secret.

44
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,558
He can make them move
without the strings.

45
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,328
[laughing]
No, Uncle Len,
it's true, really.

46
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:50,931
I've seen it.

47
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,266
Come to think of it,

48
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,001
maybe he has some work
for you. Huh?

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,470
Maybe you could help him
with those puppets of his,

50
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,972
repairing them, fixing them up,
that sort of thing.

51
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,041
Have you thought of that?
I guess you're right.

52
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,477
I suppose I could ask him.
You should.

53
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,447
After you're done here,
I'm not going to have
any work for you,

54
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,648
not for a while anyway.

55
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,452
And if I worked
for Mr. Toulon,

56
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,287
Your mother
needs to see you, Danny.

57
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,623
She misses you.
So does your brother.

58
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,391
Yeah, I know.
I miss them, too,
but...

59
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,259
But...

60
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,161
But you don't want
to be cooped up here

61
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,830
with your old uncle,
either, huh?

62
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,934
Well, you'd rather be
overseas fighting.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,802
Hopefully the war
will be over soon

64
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,071
and we won't need
to fight anymore.

65
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,441
I'm going to let you get
back to your work, Danny.

66
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,609
I'll tell the cooks to have
dinner prepared for you
in the kitchen

67
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:40,848
when you're done, huh?

68
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,417
[both laugh]
How would that be, huh?

69
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,487
Thank you, Uncle Len.
Okay.

70
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,494
[footsteps pattering]

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,897
[panting]

72
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,607
[panting, grunting]

73
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,956
[panting]

74
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,615
[screams]

00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,483

[cocks]

[fires]

79
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,594
Mr. Toulon?

80
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,996
You all right?

81
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,004
Mr. Toulon?

82
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,881
Oh, my God.

83
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,433
[people chattering]

84
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,007
[door opens]

85
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,075
What the devil?

86
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,945
[gasps]
Danny.

87
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,579
Mom.

88
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,248
Great to see you.

89
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,983
I didn't think you'd be
back till next week.

90
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,184
Your Uncle Lenny said...

91
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,453
Oh, yeah, we finished early.

92
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,854
What's all this?

93
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,256
Oh, it's just something
I'm working on.

94
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,991
I'll take it over to my room.

95
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,294
Oh, leave it.
Let me have a look at you.

96
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,230
I swear you've gotten taller.

97
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,398
Mom, I've only been gone
for three weeks.

98
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,134
But for sure
you've lost weight.

99
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,803
Sit down.
Let me get some food in you.

100
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,472
Nonsense.
Leave it.

101
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,442
Sit down.
I'll fix you up
a quick lunch.

102
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,430
Look out!
[laughs]

103
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,271
Did that Uncle Len spoil you
with that 20-year-old Scotch
of his?

104
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,439
Come on, you know
I didn't get any Scotch.

105
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,840
What?

106
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,978
Oh, that's right.
You're an Ovaltine man.

107
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,181
Very funny, very funny.

108
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,615
Don't ship out
for another week.

109
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,251
Do you know
where you're going yet?

110
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,252
Not yet.

111
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,254
I hope not Japan.

112
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,558
It would be like we live
there already,

113
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,094
Oh, hush, Donny.

114
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,196
They're Chinese,
not Japanese.

115
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,598
What's the difference?
[both giggle]

116
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,200
They've never given us
a lick of trouble

117
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,401
in all the years
we've been here.

118
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,436
Yeah, well, after the war,

119
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,072
I'm going to make enough money
to get you out of Chinatown.

120
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,573
[chuckles]

121
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,443
I'm hoping
they send me to Europe.

122
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,711
Wow, the Jerries.

123
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,313
Yeah, I'd love to get
my hands on them.

124
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,914
It's cold over there
right now, though.

125
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,882
I'm going to freeze
my ass off.

126
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,320
And you've got to watch out
for those Panzer tanks
of theirs.

127
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,356
[Don]
Oh, yeah.
Enough talk about the war.

128
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,225
What else is there
to talk about?

129
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,492
How about baseball

130
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,328
or this nice weather
we're having?

131
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,064
Mom, come on. The war is
what matters right now.

132
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,099
[sighs]
I just don't like
to think about it.

133
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,036
That's all.

134
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,237
Getting hurt over there.

135
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,938
I'll be okay, Mom.

136
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,174
God willing.

137
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,981
Look, you know I wish
I was going over there
with you, right?

138
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,716
I know, little brother.

139
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,652
Think about what
that would do to Mom.

140
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,254
You know, the Mitchells
down the street,

141
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,523
they got three boys serving...

142
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,959
Yeah, and have you seen
Mrs. Mitchell lately?

143
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,894
Looks like she's aged
30 years.

144
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,198
We can't do that to Mom.

145
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,568
Handle what better, dear?

146
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,237
No, no, I don't
want to be stuck here.

147
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,474
Look, I love you, Mom,

148
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,008
and I'd be going over
to serve

149
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,243
if I wasn't
a goddamn cripple.

150
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,711
Hey.
Danny.

151
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,046
Well, it's true.

152
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,048
You may think
your leg is a curse,

153
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,451
but to me it's a blessing.

154
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,589
Well, the Army doesn't know
what they're talking about.

155
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,425
Honey.
Nobody's saying
you can't, Dan.

156
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,527
Just the way the ball bounced.

157
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,430
You have to do what you can
from here in the home front.

158
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:17,104
Like what,
restoring furniture?

159
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,938
No, no, I think
you got something.

160
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:23,443
Why don't you build
a special chair for Hitler?

161
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,312
He goes to sit down, and wham!

162
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,447
A spear goes
right into his ass.

163
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,450
Don.

164
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,435
[Don]
You he could make these things
move without strings?

165
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,872
[Danny]
I saw it.

166
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,276
I don't know. There's
nothing cheap about it.

167
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,878
That's why I think
he killed himself.

168
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,681
Because he didn't want
to hand over his secret
to those Nazis.

169
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,883
Nazis?

170
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,786
Come on, you're telling me
that Nazis made the trip
all the way here

171
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,623
to take some little puppets
from an old man?

172
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,326
That's a little far-fetched
even for you, little brother.

173
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,428
It's not the puppets
that they wanted.

174
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,965
It's the secret
to whatever makes them move.

175
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,769
Yeah, well,
I think you've been reading
too many of those pulps.

176
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,740
Huh.

177
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,814
What's this?
[chuckles]

178
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,550
Oh, that's one Mr. Toulon
was trying to repair.

179
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,587
[chuckles]
Six arms, huh?

180
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,390
That's what we need
against the Krauts.

181
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,292
[imitates gunfire]

182
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:49,162
Take that, you dirty Nazis.

183
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,830
[chuckles]

184
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,132
I don't even need a gun
to kill those bastards.

185
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,668
You know how great I am
at sneaking up on people.

186
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,804
Please, you don't
have to remind me.

187
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,672
I stained my shorts
when you got me earlier.

188
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,543
Yeah.
If they send me to Japan,

189
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,747
I'll use my skills to sneak up
on those Japs in the jungle...

190
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,048
[makes whooshing noise]

191
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,550
And slit
their yellow throats.

192
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,819
Yeah, I bet you would.

193
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,754
[mock gasping]

194
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,389
Hey, there's a Duke double bill
downtown tonight.

195
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:21,428
You want to go?

196
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,430
Come on, forget the puppets.

197
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,564
They're not going anywhere.

198
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,666
Let's have some fun together.

199
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,501
I'm only here
for another week.

200
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,770
Call up that cute girl
of yours. What's her name?

201
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,104
Beth.

202
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,374
Beth. She's a dame, huh?

203
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,443
Hey, have her bring her sister
if she's got one.

204
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,346
Hm?
All right.

205
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,994
[knock on door]

206
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,371
Yes?

207
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,808
We are looking
for Roland Tomasi.

208
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:46,012
Tomasi is dead.

209
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,491
Leave your dramatic
gestures to me.

210
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,561
[snickers]
A woman?

211
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,097
Your astonishment
is refreshing.

212
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,568
I would advise
against using your weapon.

213
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,874
We're here to contact Tomasi.
What happened to him?

214
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,646
As you know,
Tomasi was a traitor
as an American,

215
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,583
a fascist sympathizer,

216
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,585
a fifth columnist

217
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,687
willing to ally himself

218
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,690
with the Germans,
such as yourself,

219
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,092
as well as the Japanese.

220
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,662
However, his treachery
extended extended to those

221
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,732
he allied himself with.

222
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,435
When he betrayed me
in a simple matter,

223
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:21,508
well, he met
with an unfortunate end.

224
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,276
I have taken over his plan

225
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,382
to strike at the heart
of the American war effort.

226
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:33,352
You're willing to stay
if you wish,

227
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,957
or you may leave unharmed.

228
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,430
Klaus and I could
just as easily take over
this plan as you.

229
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:47,967
You mean
if you kill me and my men,

230
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,504
but more likely
we'd all kill each other.

231
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,973
What purpose would that serve?

232
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,778
The Germans and the Japanese
are not friends,

233
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:02,782
yet we share a common enemy.

234
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,585
Perhaps we can work together.

235
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,022
Sake?

236
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:18,598
To making the American swine
bleed.

237
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,745
Let me ask you something.

238
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,549
Why is a Japanese woman...

239
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:40,653
And I mean a beautiful
Japanese woman...

240
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,590
Hiding in an opera house

241
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,025
in the heart of Chinatown?

242
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,729
What better place
for a Japanese to hide?

243
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:53,833
Americans can't tell
any of us apart anyway.

244
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,607
Your English
is very practiced,
very convincing.

245
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:05,612
May have to do something
with the hair,

246
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,380
but it might work.

247
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,818
Yes, it might just work.

248
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,694
You all have
these little holes.

249
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,796
Why is that?

250
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,942
Oh, no, Beth.

251
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:38,838
I'm late, I know.
Again. My lunch hour
is almost over.

252
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,308
Sorry.

253
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,044
Chocolates.

254
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,947
Well, at least
that's something to eat.

255
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,782
I really am sorry, Beth.

256
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,217
I just got to working
on those puppets

257
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:56,222
and kind
of lost track of time.

258
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,690
Like Pinocchio, huh?

259
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,559
Don't be silly.

260
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:01,928
What's this?

261
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:08,000
Ben? Anybody I should be
worried about?

262
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,902
He's just one of the guys
on the floor

263
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,238
thanking me for getting
his hours shifted around.

264
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,373
Mm-hm, you sure that's all?

265
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,843
Because I think I see your nose
growing there, Pinocchio.

266
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,013
Hush, you're my man,
and you know it, Danny Coogan.

267
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,082
See?

268
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,724
So you're been playing
around with puppets, huh?

269
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,860
Is that your excuse, Coogan?

270
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,361
Hello, Mr. Gifford.

271
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,063
You're late
for your lunch date

272
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,665
because you're playing
around with puppets.

273
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,767
No, it's not that.

274
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,201
Oh, save it.

275
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,103
You'll learn
your lesson soon enough

276
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:49,575
when some quicker guy
is on the draw.

277
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:53,012
Yeah, I know.

278
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,148
I'm trying to run a plant.

279
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,818
I'm doing something
for the war effort.

280
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,121
What happens if my invoices
don't get filed

281
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:05,457
and one of my secretaries
keels over from starvation?

282
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,695
It's okay, Mr. Gifford,
really. I don't mind.

283
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,030
Yeah, well, I do.

284
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,032
I don't like you, Coogan.

285
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,935
A young guy like you
should be fighting
in the war,

286
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,137
not playing
with stupid puppets.

287
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,939
I would be fighting,
Mr. Gifford.

288
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,909
I want to be fighting,

289
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,013
Oh, stop bawling.

290
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,682
I lied about my age
so I could go over to France

291
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,183
and fight for my country,

292
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,620
so stop whining
about your goddamn leg.

293
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:36,923
Why, you...

294
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,059
Yeah. You better think twice,
Coogan.

295
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,729
Lucky you got your girl here

296
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:49,869
to save your ass.

297
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,404
You got 10 more minutes,
Beth.

298
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,942
Yes, Mr. Gifford.

299
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,877
Don't mind him, Danny.

300
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,278
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

301
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,947
Yes, he does.

302
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,849
What do you mean?

303
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,885
He's right.

304
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:07,153
But your leg.

305
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,188
I should've lied,
like he did.

306
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,023
I should find
some way around it

307
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,826
instead of sitting around here
feeling sorry for myself.

308
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:28,274
Danny, don't.

309
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,210
That jerk Gifford
is right about Beth.

310
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,481
She's not going to wait around
for a guy like me.

311
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,717
What does a great girl
like that want with
a cripple anyway?

312
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,823
She had flowers on her desk
from some guy at the plant,

313
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,258
probably some guy
with big muscles,

314
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:49,361
who's really handsome,
some guy who's going
to do his time at the plant

315
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,131
and go over and serve,

316
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,066
some guy way better than me.

317
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,736
Look at me.

318
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,605
There's a war going on
out there,

319
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,740
and I'm stuck here talking
with a bunch of stupid puppets

320
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,910
all because of this game leg.

321
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,796
I should be able
to fix you right up.

322
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:31,971
What is that?

323
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,998
Oh, my God.

324
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,200
You are alive.

325
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:21,880
[both laughing]

326
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,349
How do you...
How do you like it?

327
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,353
What island?

328
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,554
Uh...

329
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,427
You've got to be quiet, okay?
We're going to surprise her.

330
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,697
Look, I'm even
on time for lunch.
Can you believe it?

331
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:42,068
You've got to be still now,
all right?

332
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,143
What is it?

333
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,445
What's wrong?

334
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:40,026
[laughs]

335
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:44,096
Hey, honey.
Wow, you're right on time
for lunch.

336
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,897
Let me call Ripley's.

337
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,766
Who was that guy?
Who?

338
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,302
The guy who was just in here.
Who was that?

339
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,671
That's Ben.
I told you before.

340
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,274
He's one of the guys
that works on the floor.

341
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,744
He just needs somebody
to talk to sometimes.
That's all.

342
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,346
Yeah, well...
There's nothing
to be jealous about.

343
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,514
Well, I bet you
his name isn't Ben.

344
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,617
What are you talking about?
Your friend?

345
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,519
He's one of the guys
who killed Mr. Toulon

346
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,920
up an the inn
a couple weeks ago.

347
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,256
Remember
I told you about it?

348
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,558
Yes, but Ben?

349
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,992
His name isn't Ben.

350
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,194
He's a Nazi.

351
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,130
[laughs]
Don't be ridiculous.

352
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,831
I saw his face, Beth.

353
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,101
He bumped into me
when I was going
to help Mr. Toulon.

354
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,635
I mean, he looks
a little bit different,

355
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,971
but that's definitely him.
I'm sure of it.

356
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,407
Ben, a Nazi?

357
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,076
You're being paranoid,
honey.

358
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,510
I'm not being paranoid.

359
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:34,346
All of his papers
are in order.

360
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,148
I checked them myself.

361
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,085
Besides, he's not from Germany,
silly.

362
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,019
He's from Burbank,
for heaven's sake.

363
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,057
What's in the bag?

364
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,426
Nothing. I mean,
what does it matter?

365
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,161
You don't believe me anyway.

366
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,263
Danny, don't be like that.

367
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,032
Come on, just show me.

368
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,569
He's a Nazi,
and I'll prove it to you.

369
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,338
Danny.

370
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,454
[Man]
Big Ben.

371
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,289
Brooklyn Dodgers going
all the way this year.

372
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,525
Oh, I've got to go
with St. Louis.

373
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,059
[groans]
You've got to be kidding me.

374
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,294
Bunch of rummies,
those guys.

375
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,462
We'll see about that.

376
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,231
Want to make it interesting?

377
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,266
Let's talk tomorrow.

378
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,602
Yeah, yeah.
Have a safe night.

379
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,709
Heil Hitler.

380
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,380
I knew it.
Hitler-loving Nazi scum.

381
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,584
For nearly a week,

382
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,453
you have been entrenched

383
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,356
within the enemy's
own back yard.

384
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,324
No difficulties?

385
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,559
None.

386
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,627
I've even made a few friends.

387
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:41,267
All I have to do is badmouth
us Krauts

388
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,468
or especially you Japs,

389
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,537
and I fit right in.

390
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,606
Oh, and talk about baseball,

391
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,808
and this is the toughest part.

392
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:54,813
Strikes, runs, errors...

393
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,615
Damn ridiculous sport.

394
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,652
It all sounds promising,
very promising.

395
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,056
So were you able
to procure the item?

396
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,427
I've been flirting
with the cute girl
that sits in the office.

397
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:12,163
And she suspects nothing?

398
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,732
She's quite taken by me.

399
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,236
What can I say?
It must be my good looks.

400
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:23,809
You Germans
are far too satisfied
with yourselves.

401
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,346
Confidence.

402
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,014
After charming the girl,

403
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,450
it was an easy thing
to snoop through her office

404
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,552
when she was out
with her boss.

405
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,010
Good, very good.

406
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:03,782
This appears
to be the loading bay.

407
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,753
Let's see
what you guys can do.

408
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,425
And this...

409
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,561
That is a storage room
that's always locked.

410
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,563
No one is allowed in there.

411
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,900
It must be where
they are keeping their
secret ingredient.

412
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,669
Ingredient?

413
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,072
Yeah.
Tomasi had a theory

414
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:32,344
the Americans are planning
to use a new material.

415
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,646
We do not know
what it is called,

416
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,548
but it doesn't matter.

417
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:43,422
This new material

418
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,857
and the secret storage room

419
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:50,596
appears to be right
next to the break room.

420
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,532
Perfect. Perfect.

421
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:57,869
[rattles]

422
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,063
[speaks German]

423
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:33,605
It is a simple device,

424
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:36,608
but powerful.

425
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:40,746
Set the timer and walk away.

426
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,767
A perfect fit.

427
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,403
In two days,
when you go to work,

428
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,506
leave it in the break room,

429
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:10,576
set the timer, and exit.

430
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:14,012
The explosion will ignite
the storage room,

431
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,115
detonating this secret
material with it.

432
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,151
Setting off
a chain reaction.

433
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,822
The entire facility,
the workers,

434
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,592
and all the new bombs inside

435
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,427
will be engulfed in moments,

436
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:33,499
crippling their war efforts.

437
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,735
I admire your planning,
lovely Ozu.

438
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:42,073
And you, Max,
on your subterfuge.

439
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,877
The puppets.

440
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,847
[screams]

441
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,117
Get them.

442
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,097
Get that boy!

443
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:14,773
The puppets.
Puppets?

444
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,174
The old man's puppets.

445
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:19,745
Toulon's, the one
we were sent here to find.

446
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,580
He killed himself...

447
00:41:21,647 --> 00:42:07,092
A true coward...

448
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,695
Looks like you got in
a pretty good lick.

449
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:15,701
Damn Nazis.

450
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:24,309
Honey? What's
all the noise in here?

451
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,512
Uh, nothing, Mom.
I'm sorry if I woke you.

452
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,814
I heard you come home.
It's late.

453
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,685
Is everything okay?

454
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,320
All right.

455
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,555
Well, be sure you're home
for dinner tomorrow night.

456
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:39,557
We're having
a little celebration
for your brother.

457
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,959
He ships out soon, you know.

458
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,961
Yeah, I know. I'll be here.

459
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,731
All right, good night.
Night.

460
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,182
[sighs]

461
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,084
Came out okay, too.

462
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,865
These are blueprints

463
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,734
to the plant
where Beth works.

464
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,535
That Nazi's
been imitating a Yank

465
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,505
so he can get access
to the plant.

466
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,240
He's planning on blowing it up.

467
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,478
We've got to find a way
to stop them.

468
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,613
I knew I could
count on you guys.

469
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,893
What are you doing up?

470
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,095
I couldn't sleep.

471
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,898
Oh, wow.

472
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,033
That sandwich looks great.

473
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,868
Did you leave some for me?

474
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,036
Yeah, there's plenty.

475
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,137
Oh, good.

476
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,538
Hey, Don,

477
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:04,442
can I talk to you really quick?

478
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:08,313
Hey, little brother, let me
get some of that grub in me,

479
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,982
and them I am all ears
for you, okay?

480
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,151
Oh. [Laughs]
Excuse me, madam.

481
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:17,355
It's nice to meet you.
[laughing]

482
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,124
You've been drinking.

483
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,926
Just a few.

484
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,830
Went down to the Duke
double bill downtown.

485
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,397
Again?
We just saw that last week.

486
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,868
And then... then we went
to McGinty's.

487
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:32,670
Oh, that's where I saw
this girl.

488
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:35,373
Whoo, her name was Gale, and...

489
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,908
Or Marsha.

490
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,077
Uh...
[laughs]

491
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,679
Anyways, little brother,

492
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,248
the gams on this girl...

493
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,184
I mean, they were
up to her neck.

494
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:48,419
Whoo-hee-hee.
Shh.

495
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:52,924
Oh... Oh, shh-shh.
Don't wake Mom.

496
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,627
Hey... Hey, how's your girl?

497
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,329
How's that going?

498
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,831
I don't know.

499
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,900
What? What's wrong?

500
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,502
I just don't think
it's going to work out.

501
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,705
All those guys
down at the plant, they
all got their eye on her.

502
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:10,375
So what?

503
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,243
You've just got to make sure

504
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,713
that you're the only one
she's thinking about.

505
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,916
One of those other guys
gets in the way,

506
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:19,818
you just pow. [Chuckles]

507
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,719
Show them who's boss,
right?

508
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:28,860
Yeah, I guess so.

509
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,763
Don't you forget that.
Okay?

510
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,099
Sure, Don.

511
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:35,533
Mm.

512
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,470
Now, what is it you wanted
to tell me about those dolls?

513
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,872
They're puppets.

514
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,841
Oh, sorry.

515
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,976
Those puppets.

516
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,145
What about them?

517
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,047
Oh, forget it.
I'll tell you later.

518
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,816
You sure?
Yeah.

519
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,818
All right.

520
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:56,221
Mm.

521
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,502
No, he's right.

522
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,438
Even though I can't
go overseas and fight,

523
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,074
I can still do my bit
right here at home.

524
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:19,811
Somebody's got to stop those
guys from blowing up the plant,
right?

525
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,781
You guys with me?

526
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,361
[knock on door]

527
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:37,996
Come in.

528
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,967
Hey, sweetie.

529
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:49,074
Wow, you look great.

530
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,508
And for my own
special soldier.

531
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,844
Thanks, honey.

532
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:58,549
[Beth]
Are you okay?

533
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,351
Oh, yeah.
Look, forget about all that.

534
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,720
I'm sorry
I was being such a jerk.

535
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:08,693
Oh, come here, though.
I need to show you something.

536
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,095
Yeah.
There are bigger problems.

537
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,530
What do you mean?

538
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,135
It looks like a blueprint.

539
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:19,637
Uh-huh, to the plant.

540
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,740
But... [sighs]...
How did you get this?

541
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:25,010
From your new friend Ben.

542
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,778
What?
Yeah, I followed him
last night,

543
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,048
after he got off work,
and he went to this
opera house in Chinatown,

544
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:34,886
not that far from here

545
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,455
and three Japs.
One of them
was this dragon lady,

546
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,457
and they're all
in this together, Beth.

547
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,959
In what together?

548
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,593
They're planning
on blowing up the plant.

549
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,062
They had a bomb.

550
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:52,870
You're really serious,
aren't you?

551
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:54,805
And they're planning
on putting it here,

552
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,541
near the field depot.
When?

553
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,976
Two days from now.

554
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,911
Look, I overheard everything.

555
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,149
If this is true,
you've got to tell somebody.

556
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,117
Yeah, and who's
going to believe me?

557
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,986
I have enough trouble
getting you to believe me,

558
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,287
let alone anyone else.

559
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:12,190
I'm the boy who cried Nazi.

560
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:13,858
So what are you going to do?

561
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,426
[sighs]

562
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:18,863
I'm going down there,
to that opera house.

563
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,365
Danny.
Don't worry.

564
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,100
I'm just going to take
some pictures.

565
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,035
I'll make somebody believe me,

566
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,503
and I'll be all right.

567
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,904
I've got help.

568
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,074
Who?

569
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,044
They won't hurt you.

570
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,113
Oh, my God.
How are they moving?

571
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,416
It's Toulon's secret.
I found it.

572
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,588
It's all right.

573
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:48,393
Yeah, go ahead.

574
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:00,071
I'm so sorry, Danny.

575
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:06,911
Sorry for what?

576
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:09,780
Look, I need you to stay here
and help Mom with the party.

577
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,949
If she wonders where I am,
just make up some excuse.

578
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:13,551
I'm worried you're be hurt,
Danny.

579
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,953
With these guys helping me,
I'll be all right,

580
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:18,956
and don't worry.
Like I said, I'm just going
to take some pictures.

581
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:35,240
* [slow jazz]

582
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,610
[scratches]

583
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,212
Infernal racket.

584
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:17,014
[speaks German]

585
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:20,118
I take it you are upset.

586
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,420
Stay calm, Buddha.

587
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,226
Klaus!

588
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:31,796
What's happening here?

589
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,269
Nothing more.

590
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:41,072
Isn't that right,
my dear Klaus?

591
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,408
We don't have time
for this nonsense.

592
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,310
Our mission
may be in jeopardy.

593
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,313
Because of the boy?

594
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,181
He can't know anything.

595
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:54,785
If he does,
he must be taken care of.

596
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,321
How?

597
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,324
I've been on the phone
with the Bodega Bay Inn.

598
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,293
It seems our boy
was restoring furniture
for them

599
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,529
during his stay.

600
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:08,133
His address...

601
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,368
here in Los Angeles,

602
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,970
not far from where we are.

603
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,706
Once again, fate at work.

604
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,981
Get the boy and his puppets.

605
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:26,484
Let nothing stand in our way.

606
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,653
Heil Hitler.
F r der F hrer.

607
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:39,864
Perhaps we should celebrate
our upcoming victory, Ozu.

608
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,634
What did you
have in your mind,
my dear Max?

609
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:47,772
Maybe something to unite
our partnership.

610
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,075
Do not mistake me

611
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:53,144
as a Western harlot

612
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,680
or one of your German whores

613
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,882
who find your arrogance
arousing.

614
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,686
Have I made my point clear,
my dear Maximilian?

615
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:28,746
How's it coming in there,
dear?

616
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:32,850
Let me take those.

617
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,185
Well, if you think so.

618
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,753
I know so. Go on.

619
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,555
Okay. Um...

620
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,590
[gasps]
You frightened me.

621
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,726
What are you doing, sneaking
around like Béla Lugosi?

622
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,561
That's what I do, Ma.

623
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,163
Don, you weren't supposed
to be home until 6.

624
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:47,865
You ruined the surprise.

625
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,668
Oh. Oh, look at that.

626
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,670
It's nice. Thanks.

627
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,572
But what's
Danny going to think?

628
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,874
What do you mean? He knows
we're having the party.

629
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:58,643
Yeah, but he wishes
he was going over there

630
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,578
to fight with the rest of us.

631
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,847
This is just going to remind him
that he's not going.

632
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,649
You guys should have
the party for him, too.

633
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,885
We are. I've got
a few surprises for him.

634
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:09,654
I'm going to wear
a new dress that I bought.

635
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,156
Plus I made him
his favorite apple pie.

636
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,991
Ooh.
The pie!

637
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:16,494
I've already taken
the pie out, hon.
It's perfect.

638
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,830
You're a life saver.

639
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:25,736
Where is Danny anyway?

640
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,037
Wood staining stuff?

641
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,640
You know, whatever he uses
for his job.

642
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,311
Oh, yeah, hammer and nails,
all that technical jazz.

643
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:36,481
You.

644
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,751
We'll call you
when it's ready.

645
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:44,188
You guys are shipping me out
before I get shipped out.

Oh, that must be the mailman

649
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,430
with that package
from Aunt Jane.

650
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,233
Yes? Can I help you?

[whispers]
With these pictures,

655
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,922
Bring these bastards down
in no time.

656
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,944
Oh, no.

657
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,450
Mom.

658
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:22,487

00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,663
I'm sorry that I wasn't here.

Don. Don!

663
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,626
Don, hang on.
I'll go get help. Hang on.

664
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:05,530
No, there's no time,
little brother.

665
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,032
He took Beth.

666
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,467
I know that.

667
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,869
You stay still.
Save your strength, okay?

668
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,605
You go get them.

669
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:17,508
You... go get them.

670
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,109

Don?

675
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,422
Don?

676
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,723
[weeping]
No, Don.

677
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:54,078
I'm going to get
those bastards, Don.

678
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,014
And you're going to help me.

679
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,086
So part of you
can keep on living, okay?

680
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,678
Just as long as you don't mind
being inside a Jap.

681
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:41,986
Please work.

How do you feel?

687
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:32,803
You know, we can really
use those sneaking skills
of yours.

688
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:38,809
Here.

689
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:51,221
Wow.

00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,297
[grunting]

691
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:12,009
Stop! Touch her again,
it'll be the last thing
you remember.

692
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:21,018
I apologize
for their conduct.

693
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,688
You're no better
than they are.

694
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:26,090
To you, perhaps,
it may seem that way,

695
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,624
but, again,

696
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:29,426
I apologize.

697
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,395
I don't care
about your apologies.

698
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:35,099
By now, of course,
you know my name is not Ben.

699
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:38,035
You're a Nazi,
just like Danny said.

700
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,837
A soldier following orders.

701
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,071
For Hitler.

702
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,107
The leader
of the new world.

703
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,910
Not if our boys have
anything to say about it.

[floor board creaks]

705
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,949
What's going on here?

706
01:00:52,016 --> 01:00:54,852
Your men are savages.

707
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,021
They are men

708
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,957
with the needs and desires
of men.

709
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:04,061
I see,

710
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:06,063
Yet the desires of you men,

711
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,265
your animals, must be granted?

712
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,934
Is that it?

713
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:14,171
Don't be jealous.

714
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:17,975
It does not
befit a leader.

715
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:30,620
We tied the girl here
in the center of the stage

716
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,024
so that no one can
attempt to free her
without our seeing.

717
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:37,928
I understand,
but does that mean
she must be toyed with?

718
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,029
Why do you care?

719
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:41,198
She's nothing but bait.

720
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,401
Does not
a dead worm on a hook
still attract a fish?

721
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:47,537
She is not a worm.

722
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:51,241
You seem to have developed
feelings for this little tramp.

723
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:54,745
Do not let this cloud
your judgment.

724
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:11,028
I hope you don't expect me
to thank you.

725
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:14,098
No, I don't expect you
to understand, either.

726
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,533
What don't I understand?

727
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,938
You can never understand
the cause of which
I am fighting for.

728
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:23,007
The slaughtering
of innocent people

729
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,975
by a mad dictator?

730
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:28,112
That's not a cause.
That's evil.

731
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,915
You'll never defeat
freedom and democracy.

Perhaps in a different time

733
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,059
and a different life

734
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:44,795
we could've meant something
to each other.

735
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:46,163
I'd rather be dead.

It is going well here,

749
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:03,393
Yes, he will be killed.

750
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,964
As will the two Germans.

And we will take

the one the Germans
are so eager to control.

Yes, it will belong
to Japan...

to the Emperor.

755
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:26,950

Hello, Commander?

You'll never win the war.

758
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,070
You might kill me and Danny.

759

Even if you blow up the plant,
you still won't win.

01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,310
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

761
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:57,481
I bet if she did,
she'd be ashamed of you.

Not that you care, of course.

763
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,951
You've probably been

And here I thought
my wardrobe was extravagant.

to be quite useless.

Don's still here in spirit,

and he wouldn't want us
crying right now.

We'll both cry about it later,
okay?

to get you out of here.

but now it's over for you.

Are we not come
from the same cloth, Ninja?

811
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:06,850
Aah! Aah!

812
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,485
[yells]

813
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,153
No!

814
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,080
[footsteps running]

815
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:49,859
The F hrer
will be very pleased.

816
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,466
Looking for something?

817
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,902
Where's the bomb?

818
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,638
There's no way we're going
to let you blow up the plant.

819
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:03,940
Where is it?

820
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,542
[click]

821
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,443
[ticking]

822
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:11,981
The timer's counting down!

823
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,983
Yeah,

824
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,619
and he'll flip the switch
and set it off

825
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,186
before the timer goes, too,

826
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:20,189
unless, maybe,
you want to be blown up.

827
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:22,125
Isn't that what
your kamikaze pilots do?

828
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:27,564
They blow themselves up
for the cause.

829
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,132
[speaking Japanese]

830
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,734
Dedicated and brave.

831
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,338
[Danny]
Okay.

832
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:39,008
To nosedive your airplane
into the belly of a battleship.

833
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:43,446
But brave?
I don't know about that.

834
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:45,615
Think about it.

835
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:47,917
We aren't the ones
holding the bomb.

836
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,754
Order it to move away
from the bomb.

837
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:56,660
No.

838
01:14:56,726 --> 01:15:00,229
Besides, I don't think
he likes you very much,

839
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:03,032
and I know he doesn't like
the German.

840
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:06,269
After all, the Germans killed
his master, Mr. Toulon.

841
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:21,918
The sorcery
is truly powerful.

842
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:24,487
And that's why you'll never
get your hands on it.

843
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:26,522
[Max]
Do not be so confident.

844
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,858
[clicks timer off]

845
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:32,061
You've done well
up to this point, boy,

846
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:36,032
much better
than I ever could've
expected from a cripple.

847
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,868
But victory is far
from assured.

848
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:40,336
You'll still never
get the secret.

849
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:44,941
Once again you speak
before victory is in hand.

850
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:48,411
Danny,
he's got the puppet.

851
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:52,582
I knew our alliance
would prove to be
fruitful, my dear.

852
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:55,819
Step away, dear.

853
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,589
Lay down your sword.

854
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:10,734
I should've known
that Nazis cannot be trusted.

855
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,435
You have no code of honor.

856
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,839
Well, I have the puppets
and the gun, so stay back!

857
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,042
The serum
that's in those puppets

858
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,544
will only last
a limited time.

859
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:23,012
Where's the rest of it?

860
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,013
It's hidden.

861
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,615
Then you will
take me to it.

862
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:26,750
Like hell.

863
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,752
Oh, but you will.

864
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,754
First I will do things
to your girl

865
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,889
that you have never
even dreamt of doing.

866
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:37,794
Then I will hurt her, badly,
all while you watch.

867
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:39,128
And if that
is not good enough,

868
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,497
then I will begin
torturing you,

869
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:44,400
and if anyone
who knows torture,
it is we Nazis.

870
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:48,337
Our doctors have devised
such unimaginable techniques

871
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:51,140
used in the death camps
of Auschwitz and Dachau.

872
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:54,043
Yeah, how to torture
innocent civilians.

873
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,780
Oh, we torture soldiers, too.

874
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,882
In our prisoner-of-war camps

875
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,518
we torture many
of Allied soldiers,

876
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:06,823
men who served their country
more nobly than you,

877
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:11,194
men of true value
and integrity,

878
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:16,032
strong specimens,
not worthless cripples
like you!

879
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,735
[blade whooshes]

880
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:20,636
[liquid gurgling]

881
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:04,881
She's gone.

882
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:08,051
She took the puppets with her.

883
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,286
Except for Ninja, Blade,
and Pinhead.

884
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:15,091
If it's war that Jap wants,

885
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:17,693
we'll give it to her.
