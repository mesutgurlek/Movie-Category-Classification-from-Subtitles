BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE, ADOLF HITLER.

IF...THEY THOUGHT OF HIM AT ALL.

187
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:50,268
BUT IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS,

188
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:55,006
WALL STREET WOULD CRASH...

189
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,750
AND TAKE THE GERMAN ECONOMY

DOWN WITH IT.

191
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:04,680
AND WITHIN A YEAR, THE NAZIS

192
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,714
WOULD BE ONE OF THE LARGEST

ARYAN.

751
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:59,752
WOMEN LIKE MRS. LENGER WERE

752

ENCOURAGED BY THE REICH TO HAVE

AS MANY CHILDREN AS POSSIBLE.

WAS GOING TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS,

756

01:13:03,024 --> 01:13:04,706
AS THOUGH THESE PLANES WERE

838
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:06,887
FLYING AGAINST A WORLD POWER.

839
01:13:11,947 --> 01:13:15,452
YOU, UP THERE, I HATE YOU.

840
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,106
I DO NOT KNOW IF I WILL

841
01:13:21,108 --> 01:13:22,742
SURVIVE YOUR DOWNFALL,

842
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:26,280
BUT THIS I DO KNOW...

843
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:30,422
THIS IS A CARICATURE OF GERMANY...

844
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:37,407
SMEARED BY A MALIGNANT APE,

845
01:13:37,445 --> 01:13:39,979
ESCAPED FROM A LEASH.

846
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,745
>> Narrator: IT WAS THE SUMMER OF 1938.

847
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,714
AND CELEBRATION WAS IN THE AIR.

848
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:15,901
HERE IN MUNICH, THE THIRD REICH

849
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:18,691
WAS PREPARING TO CELEBRATE THE

850
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:22,369
NAZIFICATION OF GERMAN CULTURE.

851
01:14:25,105 --> 01:14:28,093
200 MILES NORTH, IN LEIPZIG,

852
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:30,415
WALTER LENGER AND HIS WIFE

853
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:32,769
WERE CELEBRATING THEIR BIRTHDAYS.

854
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,604
HE TURNED 40...

855
01:14:36,636 --> 01:14:41,540
AND SHE, 30.

856
01:14:42,448 --> 01:14:44,927
AND IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL OF BERLIN,

857
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:51,444
JEWISH JOURNALIST, BELLA FROMM,

858
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:53,700
WAS ALSO CELEBRATING.

859
01:14:54,196 --> 01:14:56,110
>> Fromm: WHEN I FOUND MYSELF

860
01:14:56,112 --> 01:14:59,371
OUTSIDE THE AMERICAN CONSULATE,

861
01:14:59,373 --> 01:15:01,985
THE AMERICAN VISA IN MY HAND,

862
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,679
I HAD TO SIT DOWN ON THE STONE STEPS

863
01:15:07,231 --> 01:15:09,849
AND CRY IN MY GRATEFUL HAPPINESS.

864
01:15:13,463 --> 01:15:17,345
I'M GOING AS SOON AS I CAN.

865
01:15:18,717 --> 01:15:22,208
I MUST MANAGE TO GET OUT OF GERMANY

866
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,120
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.

867
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,804
>> Narrator: IT WAS THE 9th OF JULY, 1938.

868
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,015
BY SPECIAL WILL OF THE FUHRER,

869
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:56,548
THE CITY OF MUNICH WAS HOSTING A

870
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:00,463
72-HOUR FESTIVAL DEDICATED

871
01:16:00,495 --> 01:16:02,731
TO GERMAN ART.

872
01:16:07,995 --> 01:16:10,290
IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE MANY

873
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:13,319
THOUSANDS OF VISITORS,

874
01:16:13,321 --> 01:16:17,277
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THE IDEAL GERMANY--

875
01:16:17,845 --> 01:16:19,771
RENDERED IN PAINTINGS,

876
01:16:19,773 --> 01:16:22,533
SCULPTURES AND ETCHINGS,

877
01:16:23,702 --> 01:16:28,706
ALL HAND-SELECTED BY HITLER HIMSELF.

878
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:35,685
>> Pope: I WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH

879
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:38,372
THE HOUSE OF GERMAN ART.

880
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:41,075
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES.

881
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,330
THE TREND IS EROTICISM:

882
01:16:49,944 --> 01:16:51,867
TO GIVE GERMAN MEN THE INCENTIVE

883
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:54,877
TO HAVE MANY GERMAN CHILDREN...

884
01:16:56,814 --> 01:16:59,658
AND THE GLORY OF THE GERMAN FARMER

885
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,762
WHO FEEDS THE NATION'S WARRIORS;

886
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:12,290
AND, OF COURSE,

887
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:15,552
HEROISM IN BATTLE.

888
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:29,219
CONCLUDING THE 3-DAY ART ORGY IS

889
01:17:29,221 --> 01:17:31,724
A 6-MILE LONG PROCESSION

890
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:35,766
CELEBRATING 2,000 YEARS OF GERMAN CULTURE

891
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,189
WITH FLOATS DRAWN BY ARMY HORSES

892
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:41,052
AND THOUSANDS OF MEN

893
01:17:41,054 --> 01:17:42,662
AND WOMEN IN COSTUME.

894
01:17:45,565 --> 01:17:48,472
IT GOES ON FOR THREE SOLID HOURS.

895
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:56,808
AT THE END, THE SYMBOL OF

896
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,331
THE THIRD REICH:

897
01:17:59,365 --> 01:18:01,266
THE SOVEREIGN GERMAN EAGLE.

898
01:18:09,203 --> 01:18:11,369
BUT THE CLIMAX,

899
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:12,961
WHICH BRINGS THE GERMAN SPECTATORS

900
01:18:12,963 --> 01:18:14,424
TO THEIR FEET,

901
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:19,773
IS THE GOOSE-STEPPING SOLDIERS.

902
01:18:22,648 --> 01:18:23,931
IT IS AN ADMISSION OF THE

903
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:25,974
FUHRER'S RESTLESS PLANS...

904
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,341
FOR WORLD CONQUEST.

905

HITLER WILL MOVE TO INVADE

907
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:46,392
NEIGHBORING CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

908

>>Announcer: GERMANY IS ONE OF THE MOST

909
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,137
POPULAR TOURIST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

910
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,123
THE NEW NATIONAL TRAVEL OFFICES

911
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:23,091
RELIEVE THE TOURIST OF THE USUAL

912
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:25,192
TRAVEL WORRIES.

913
01:19:28,925 --> 01:19:30,660
>> Narrator: BUT IF YOU WERE A GERMAN JEW,

914
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,593
LIKE BELLA FROMM,

915
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:36,345
MOVING AROUND GERMANY WAS DIFFICULT...

916
01:19:42,026 --> 01:19:44,490
AND GETTING OUT USUALLY MEANT

917
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:46,865
GIVING UP EVERYTHING YOU HAD.

918
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:57,549
>> Fromm: I DID NOT SPARE MONEY

919
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:59,462
ON MY TRAVEL,

920
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,558
BECAUSE I'D HAVE TO LEAVE IT

921
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,662
IN GERMANY ANYWAY.

922
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,839
TO GET OUT, I HAD TO PAY NEXT

923
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:14,123
YEAR'S TAXES IN ADVANCE,

924
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:17,008
EVEN THOUGH I WILL NOT BE IN GERMANY

925
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,990
AT ALL.

926
01:20:20,171 --> 01:20:24,944
BUT NO PRICE IS TOO MUCH.

927
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,344
THIS IS A COUNTRY TO GET OUT OF...

928
01:20:27,376 --> 01:20:30,445
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT NAKED.

929

01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:14,429
IN MUNICH WAS IN FULL SWING.

932
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,761
BUT IN A FEW MINUTES,

933
01:21:25,828 --> 01:21:27,803
HITLER HIMSELF

934
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:31,841
WOULD PUT AN END TO THE FESTIVITIES.

935
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:42,286
>> Pope: SUDDENLY,

936
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:44,145
THE ROLLER COASTERS STOP.

937
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:55,938
ON THE LOUDSPEAKERS, THE FUHRER

938
01:21:56,003 --> 01:21:58,409
IS RAGING AGAINST CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

939
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,948
NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A LARGE

940
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,542
CROWD CHANGE FROM ELATION TO GLOOM

941

SO INSTANTANEOUSLY.

942
01:22:26,412 --> 01:22:28,447
>> Narrator: HITLER HAD DEMANDED

943
01:22:28,513 --> 01:22:30,815
THAT CZECHOSLOVAKIA CEDE A LARGE

944
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:32,715
PORTION OF ITS GERMAN-SPEAKING

945
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:35,616
TERRITORY TO THE THIRD REICH.

946
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,053
IF CZECHOSLOVAKIA REFUSED,

947
01:22:45,118 --> 01:22:47,954
GERMANY VOWED TO INVADE.

948

SEPTEMBER 27th...

HERE IN BERLIN, GERMAN SOLDIERS

PREPARED FOR AN INVASION.

952
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:34,034
IN ONLY A FEW HOURS, THEY WOULD

953
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:37,055
ROLL TO THE CZECHOSLOVAKIAN BORDER.

954
01:23:42,903 --> 01:23:44,837

ANY IDEA WHAT THEY ARE

956
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:48,604
BEING FORCED INTO?

957
01:23:54,423 --> 01:23:57,718
NO, I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT.

958
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:03,443
WE WANT PEACE.

959

GORGEOUS BOAT.

01:24:33,293 --> 01:24:35,853
IT IS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR ME TO BELIEVE.

963
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,746
THEN, WHEN I DO BECOME ACUTELY

964
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:43,563
AWARE OF MY GOOD FORTUNE,

965
01:24:43,563 --> 01:24:47,690
I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY, REMEMBERING

01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:06,142
THIS BABY GIRL WAS BORN IN THE TOWN

972

OF HALBERSTADT, OUTSIDE BERLIN.

973

WIBKE KLAMROTH'S MOTHER AND FATHER 

974
01:25:17,644 --> 01:25:20,590
ARE ENTHUSIASTIC NAZIS,

975

BUT IT IS ONLY SEPTEMBER OF 1938.

976
01:25:29,802 --> 01:25:33,438
THE THIRD REICH WILL LAST FOR

977

ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS.
