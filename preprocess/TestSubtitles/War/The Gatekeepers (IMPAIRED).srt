00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,242
But in the Shin Bet back then,

310
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,704
there was no such concept
as an illegal order.

311

Not only did the Shin Bet fail.

312

The Cabinet and the
Prime Minister failed,

they oversee the Shin Bet.

Did the Prime Minister know
about the premeditated murder,

316
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:28,398
the plan to kill the terrorist
caught on the 300 bus?

317
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,652
Did the head of Shin
Bet have the authority

318
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,863
to do that, to make
those decisions?

319
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,577
MOREH: Under what circumstances did
Shamir give you permission to kill?

320
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:45,040
There were one or two cases,
when I couldn't find him,

321
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,917
and it had to be done.

322
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,585
What had to be done?

323
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:54,675
We had to deal with Arabs who
were about to launch an attack,

324
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,593
or that launched an attack.

325
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:01,765
He said, "if you can't find
me, decide on your own."

326
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,768
When did you realize
that you had to resign?

327
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,564
I offered my resignation
to Shamir the next day.

328
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,524
He said, "Don't you dare."

329
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:15,779
<i>He was afraid that if I resigned,
he'd have to resign, too.</i>

us to the wolves,</i>

333
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,046
<i>"we'll drag you down with us."</i>

334
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,968
They kept telling me what
to do and how to respond.

335
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,470
I didn't do anything
without coordinating it.

336
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:46,310
I never imagined that after
a year of coordinating,

337
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:52,316
they'd drop the issue
and say, "We didn't know."

338
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,572
I don't take politicians
seriously anymore.

339
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,740
Because?

340
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,951
Because I saw that
they couldn't be trusted.

341
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:06,497
They abandon the wounded in the field.
That's not for me.

Only because of the results.

So, if there was no

What about the morality of it?

367
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,683
With terrorism
there are no morals.

368
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,269
Find morals in
terrorists first.

369
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,230
And if he surrendered?

370
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,274
It's not a moral problem.

371
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:59,276
Then what is it?

372
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:05,115
It's a tactical problem,
not strategic.

373
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,579
So for you, the decision to
kill the two terrorists...

You keep painting it black and white.
There are decisions that...

I'm trying to understand
the morality of it.

378
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,966
There is no morality
in a case like that.

379
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,802
In the war against terror,
forget about morality.

380

found out that since 1978-9,

625
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,374
they were planning an
attack on the Temple Mount

626
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,169
to blow up the
Dome of the Rock.

00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,520

to get rid of that Dome.

<i>would be directed at

<i>This would result in
the collapse of the Dome.</i>

638
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:13,443
The consequence of blowing up the
Dome of the Rock, even today,

639
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:18,282
is that it could lead to total

These people decided to do it

646
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:45,100
that this would be
the War of Armageddon

647

that would usher in the
Messiah and a Jewish kingdom.

01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:15,754
As far as the extremist rabbis are
concerned, the system proved itself.

762
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:42,364
Rabin's assassination
brought me to the Shin Bet.

763
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:46,493
<i>A year earlier,
I turned Rabin down,</i>

764
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:48,662
<i>when he asked me to be
head of the Shin Bet.</i>

765
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,833
<i>After Yitzhak Rabin's assassination,
I realized I had no choice.</i>

766
01:03:53,250 --> 01:04:00,132
It was obvious the Shin Bet
faced a serious crisis

767
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,510
and everyone in
the Shin Bet knew it.

768
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:07,973
Everything about the Shin
Bet's operations collapsed.

769
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:11,518
Security surrounding the
Prime Minister collapsed.

770
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:14,855
The intelligence that should have
prevented the assassination collapsed.

771
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,065
The Shin Bet's strong suit,

772
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:21,069
preventing Palestinian
and Islamic terror,

773
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:23,030
could no longer
provide the goods.

774
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,949
The organization was
down for the count.

775
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:39,880
The Shin Bet needed new tools
and they had to be developed.

776
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:44,676
We also realized that
we were relying on force,

777
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,802
rather than our brains.

778
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:58,649
<i>We began to implement
an organizational shift,</i>

779

to people sitting in offices</i>

780

<i>in front of their
computer monitors.</i>

781
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:16,708
We prevented more
attacks each year.

782
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:20,045
We achieved greater
security every year.

783
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:21,296
How did it happen?

784

It had a lot to do with changes
we made in the Shin Bet,

785

but the truth must be told.

The more significant
achievement

787
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,853
was cooperation between
us and the Palestinians.

Rabin to reach an agreement

799
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:30,532
after Rabin was gone,
the desire,

01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:25,305
and behind the missing door,
no one was thinking for me.

1062
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:56,837
You see that void,
that lack of initiative,

1063
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,716
that willingness to let
things take their course,

1064
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:05,512
without you stepping
in and saying,

1065
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:08,223
"This is as far as it goes,
in this direction or that."

1066
01:29:09,475 --> 01:29:12,686
You can't make peace
using military means.

1067
01:29:13,437 --> 01:29:18,734
Peace must be built
on a system of trust,

1068
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:21,361
after, or without
using military means.

1069
01:29:21,445 --> 01:29:23,739
In the end you must build
it on a system of trust.

1070
01:29:24,364 --> 01:29:28,452
As someone who knows the
Palestinians well, I claim that

1071
01:29:29,578 --> 01:29:31,288
there should be no problem

1072
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:33,874
building a system of trust
with them, a genuine one.

1073
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:38,754
For Israel, it's too much of a luxury
not to speak with our enemies.

1074
01:29:39,296 --> 01:29:43,050
As long as they decide not to
speak to us, I have no choice,

1075
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:46,428
but when we decide not to speak,
I think we're making a mistake.

1076
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:48,972
MOREH: Do you support
speaking to anyone?

1077
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:54,728
Anyone we can, even if they answer
rudely, I'm for continuing.

1078
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:59,316
There is no alternative.

1079
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:01,401
To what?
To talking.

1080
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:05,405
Hamas? Islamic Jihad...

1081
01:30:05,531 --> 01:30:06,615
Including everyone.

1082
01:30:06,698 --> 01:30:09,326
I said everyone,
so it includes...

1083
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:16,083
Even Ahmadinejad, whoever.
I'm always for it.

1084
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:20,629
It's a trait of a professional intelligence
operative to talk to everyone.

1085
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:22,965
Things get clarified.

1086
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:28,428
I see you don't eat glass.
He sees I don't drink petrol.

1087
01:30:28,512 --> 01:30:30,180
That's how it is.

1088
01:30:32,141 --> 01:30:33,725
<i>MOREH: I want to
read something that.</i>

1089
01:30:33,809 --> 01:30:38,355
<i>Professor Leibowitz,
a critic of the Occupation,</i>

1090
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:41,191
<i>wrote a year after
the Six Day War, in 1968.</i>

1091

<i>"A state ruling over a hostile

a Shin Bet state,

1098
01:31:00,169 --> 01:31:03,839

suppress an Arab uprising on one hand</i>

1099
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:07,885
<i>"and acquire Quislings, or
Arab traitors, on the other."</i>

1100
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:13,307
What do you think about this prediction,
given where Israel is today?

1101
01:31:14,183 --> 01:31:16,477
I agree with every
word he wrote.

1102
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:20,814
Explain.

1103
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,316
There's nothing to explain.

1104
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,736
Every word he said
is etched in stone.

1105
01:31:25,903 --> 01:31:29,072
Is that what Israeli
society is like today?

1106
01:31:29,156 --> 01:31:33,452
I think it's an accurate depiction
of the reality that emerged

1107
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:35,913
from 1968 until today.

1108
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,208
I wouldn't say that
it became a Shin Bet state,

1109
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:45,672
but no doubt, our current
situation with the Palestinians

1110
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:49,343
undoubtedly created a reality
that is very similar

1111
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:53,430
to what Leibowitz wrote.

1112
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,932
(MAN BREATHING HEAVILY)

1113
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,366

<i>PERY: You knock on doors
in the middle of the night</i>

1117
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:23,020
<i>and wake a sleeping family,
all cuddled up in bed.</i>

1118
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:27,024
<i>The mother's tears</i>

1119
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:32,779
<i>or the last goodbyes of the suspect
you take from his family's embrace...</i>

1120
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:38,327
It's not easy. You see
the family suffering,

1121
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:42,289
those difficult moments
between parents and children,

1122
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:43,957
between children and parents.

1123
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:51,215
These moments end up
etched deep inside you

1124
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:56,303
and when you retire you
become a bit of a leftist.

1125
01:34:20,494 --> 01:34:26,166
We are making the lives
of millions unbearable,

1126
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,544
into prolonged human suffering.

1127
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:33,423
We leave the decision
about what's appropriate

1128
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:37,719
to a soldier who's spent
a few months in the army.

1129
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,724
A year earlier he finished
high school, at best.

1130
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:45,894
He's standing there facing
a father holding his baby girl

1131
01:34:45,978 --> 01:34:51,692
deciding, does he search him or
not, does he let him pass or not.

1132
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,070
It kills me.

1133
01:34:56,363 --> 01:35:00,033
The future is bleak.
It's dark, the future.

1134
01:35:00,117 --> 01:35:05,956
Where does it lead? To a change
in the people's character

1135
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:13,255
because if you put most of
our young people in the army,

1136
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:18,802
they'll see a paradox.

1137
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:24,850
They'll see that it strives
to be a people's army,

1138
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:29,104
like the Nahal unit, involved
in building up the country.

1139
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:32,107
On the other hand, it's a
brutal occupation force,

1140
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:35,986
similar to the Germans
in World War ll.

1141
01:35:36,862 --> 01:35:39,364
Similar, not identical.

1142
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:44,077
And I'm not talking about their
behavior toward the Jews.

1143
01:35:44,161 --> 01:35:48,248
That was exceptional, with its
own particular characteristics.

1144
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:53,754
I mean how they acted to the
Poles, the Belgians, the Dutch...

1145
01:35:55,631 --> 01:35:57,674
To all of them... The Czechs.

1146
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:05,182
It's a very negative
trait that we acquired,

1147
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:11,855
to be... I'm afraid
to say it, so I won't.

1148
01:36:12,815 --> 01:36:18,362
We've become cruel,

1149
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:20,739
to ourselves as well,

1150
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:25,452
but mainly to the
occupied population,

1151
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:32,835
using the excuse of
the war against terror.

1152
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:36,964
Clausewitz, who was wise
even though he wasn't Jewish,

1153
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:40,342
or at least we haven't
discovered his Jewish roots,

1154
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:44,221
said almost 200 years ago...

1155
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:48,892
I'm translating, but the
essence of what he said is,

1156
01:36:50,227 --> 01:36:55,357
"Victory is simply the creation
of a better political reality."

1157
01:36:55,899 --> 01:36:56,859
That's victory.

1158
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:01,905
Victory doesn't dictate that
we have to conquer Gaza

1159
01:37:02,156 --> 01:37:05,075
or Ramallah or
Nablus or Hebron.

1160
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:10,247
I think my son, who served for
three years in the paratroopers,

1161
01:37:10,873 --> 01:37:15,586
participated in the conquest of
Nablus at least two or three times.

1162
01:37:17,588 --> 01:37:21,341
Did it bring us victory?
I don't think so.

1163
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:28,640
Did it create a better
political reality?

1164
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:34,730
The tragedy of Israel's
public security debate

1165
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:40,235
is that we don't realize that
we face a frustrating situation

1166
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:42,946
in which we win every battle,

1167
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:45,115
but we lose the war.
