1
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,534
What time is it?

2
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:28,894
Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you up.

3
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:31,094
I'm cold. Come back to bed.

4
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:32,934
I can't. It's half six.

5
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:35,774
Give us a kiss.

6
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:49,134
I can't. I told you.

7
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:52,094
So this is what it's going to be
like when you and me is married?

8
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,654
I won't work. Not after the war.

9
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:57,054
This bleedin' war,

10
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,014
can't end bloody soon enough.

11
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,654
You're a wonderful girl.
You know that, Grace.

12
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,734
Couldn't live without you.

13
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,694
You're my best girl.

14
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,214
Harry...

15
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,134
What?
We need to talk.

16
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:25,414
What about?

17
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:27,454
You know what about.

18
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,534
We've already talked about that.

19
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,854
I know, but...
Not now, Gracie.

20
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:33,334
You've got to get to work.

21
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,374
Go on. Hop it.

22
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:42,294
Oi!
What?

23
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:45,054
You forgetting something?

24
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:48,454
I'd forget my own head, if
it wasn't screwed onto my shoulders.

25
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:50,574
You heard what the quack said.

26
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,534
You've got to look after yourself.

27
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:55,254
I tell you what,

28
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:59,374
how about you and me meet for tea
at the Corner House after work?

29
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:06,654
Can you afford it?
You can pay.

30
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,854
Harry!

31
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,374
Don't let Mr Johnson see you
on your way out.

32
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,334
BICYCLE BELLS DING

33
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,094
Thanks, Stan.

34
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:39,094
Have a nice day.

35
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,054
Bye-bye.

36
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:55,094
WOMAN: I thought you'd taken them
again. I know you.

37
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:04,214
Down in the dumps?

38
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:05,774
Cheer up, love.

39
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:08,574
It's not as bad as all that
down in this dump, eh?

40
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:13,814
Don't tell me old Adolf's had
another go at you.

41
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:16,014
I haven't seen him, not yet.

42
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,934
Someone ought to tell him
he's on the wrong side.

43
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,974
I reckon he'd go down a treat
in Berlin.

44
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:22,694
The trouble with Eddie is

45
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,654
he was wearing the wrong jersey
when the whistle went.

46
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:28,534
You all right, dear?

47
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,574
You're looking a bit peaky.

48
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,534
I'm just tired I think.

49
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:37,094
Come on, Grace.
You're gonna make us late.

50
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,694
MACHINERY RUMBLES

51
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:59,174
Sir.

52
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:11,654
So what's this, then?

53
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,334
It looks like a hairpin.

54
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,934
It doesn't look like a hairpin.

55
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,454
It IS a hairpin.
What's it doing here?

56
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:20,414
I'm sorry, Mr Baker, I missed it.
All right?

57
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:22,734
No. It's not all right, Miss Law.

58
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,814
You want this to fall into a machine
and make a spark?

59
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:29,014
You want to blow yourself
and the rest of us to smithereens?

60
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,454
It's one hairpin.

61
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,934
I didn't see it.

62
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,934
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:36,454
The next time I find one of these,

64
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:38,134
I'm docking you five shillings.

65
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,094
Now, get in there.

66
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:46,014
Come on, Grace. Wakey, wakey.

67
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:52,774
All right?

68
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,494
Grace, I might as well
get that other one now.

69
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:25,254
SCREAMING

70
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,494
I was wondering...

71
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,454
We all go to my parents
in Haslemere.

72
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:01,054
My sisters'll be there
and Martin of course.

73
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,294
I was wondering
if you'd like to come.

74
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,614
Edie...

75
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:08,774
Well, you haven't got any family,
have you? No.

76
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:12,094
Well, you don't want to be
on your own at Christmas.

77
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:15,134
I've spoken to Mother
and she'd love to see you again.

78
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,494
You'd just be there
as a friend of the family.

79
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,614
I'd love to.

80
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:22,374
Would you?
Yes.

81
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,094
Then that's settled, then.

82
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:28,334
You can leave me here.
No. I'll wait.

83
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,854
You don't want to be late.

84
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:34,254
Did you say you're meeting Mr Foyle
for lunch? Not exactly.

85
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,374
You go on. I'll see you tonight.

86
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:02,614
Good morning.
I'm afraid we're not open yet, sir.

87
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:06,614
No, I do understand. I was hoping
to make a reservation for Christmas.

88
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:09,334
We're fully booked, I'm afraid.
Oh, dear.

89
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:12,094
Are you Mr Tremayne?

90
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:15,334
Yes, that's right.
Jack said I should mention his name.

91
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,014
Jack?
Jack Bentley.

92
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,174
Ah. Jack.

93
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:19,974
He recommended you.

94
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:22,254
Ah. So you know Jack?

95
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,174
I do know Jack.

96
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:27,094
Mainly socially, but we do
a bit of business now and again.

97
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:30,094
Is that so, Mr...?
Black.

98
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,854
And what is your business, Mr Black?

99
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:34,774
Well, a bit of this, a bit of that.

100
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,614
Got to stay on your feet.
You know how it is? True enough.

101
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,254
Where did you see him exactly?

102
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:41,454
Smithfield.
Smithfield's a big place.

103
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,454
The Hind.

104
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,414
Ah. Yes, he's always in there,
isn't he?

105
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:47,494
He's always in there, isn't he?

106
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,734
Suggested I should ask you
about your special menu.

107
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,694
Did he give you a price?

108
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:57,054
Well, five bob's
meant to be the limit, isn't it?

109
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:59,254
Not for what we're offering.

110
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:03,374
There's a 7/6 cover charge plus an
extra three bob for the cloakroom.

111
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:07,094
You'd be offering something
VERY special for that, then.

112
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:10,374
We've got something you won't find
anywhere else. Is that right?

113
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:12,654
Would you like to take a look?
I'd love to.

114
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,694
Frank,

115
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,654
bring that package.

116
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,614
Have I seen you in here before?

117
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,494
No, I used to come in,
but not since you've been here.

118
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:26,334
How long has that been?
I came down this year.

119
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,654
London...you don't wanna know!

120
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,614
Now, you take a look at this.

121
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,254
Well, that's very special, isn't it?

122
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,574
See what I mean?
I do.

123
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:44,734
Good old Jack.

124
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,494
So I take it you're interested,
then?

125
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,654
I certainly am.

126
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,974
So, do we have a deal?

127
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:51,774
We do, yup.

128
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,574
How many of you will there be?

129
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:56,094
Oh, there's half a dozen of us.

130
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,894
I'll introduce you.

131
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:20,054
Happy to clear up here?
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,094
And what about the evidence?

133
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:24,134
Bring it all back.

134
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,094

What are you doing?

141
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,854
It looks like Christmas
has come early this year.

142
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:53,774
What do you mean? Well,
Mr Tremayne won't be needing it now.

143
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:55,774
Put that back!

144
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:57,774
What?
You heard me. Put that back now!

145
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:02,854
Come on. We're closing this place
down. No-one's gonna want this.

146
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,974
That's not the point.

147
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:06,534
What you are doing is theft.

148
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,014
It's exactly the same reason
we arrested Tremayne.

149
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:11,174
We arrested him for racketeering.

150
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,974
We're just cleaning up.

151

Oh, is that what you call it?

152
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:16,974
What's the matter with you,
Mr Milner?

153
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:19,694
You was never like this
before they made you sergeant.

154
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,654
How dare you speak to me like that,
Constable!

155
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:26,294
You can consider yourself cautioned.

156
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:29,374
And if one more item of food
goes missing from this kitchen,

you'll be spending Christmas

I'm never sure.

163
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,974
It's just that
I've been here an hour

164
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,854
and I've only got the afternoon off.

165
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:58,214
I want a word, if you don't mind.
All right.

166
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:00,294
Hilda Greenwood.

167
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,294
You're Mr Foyle?
I am.

168
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:03,774
You're the one I want to see.

169
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:06,054
Somewhere private.

170
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,294
It's important.
This way.

171
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,014
Brookie,

172
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:22,534
am I dreaming or is that a...?

173
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,054
It's a turkey, Miss Stewart.

174
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,134
It's an absolute whopper.

175
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:28,014
About 15lb, I should say.

176
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,534
I haven't seen a turkey like that
since before the war.

177
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:31,974
Where did they get it?

178
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,734
I've got a feeling
it came from Smithfield Market.

179
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,694
Your old stomping ground?
Mm.

180
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:38,814
You can't move up there now
for spivs.

181
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:41,974
They've even got tic-tac men out
to warn them if anyone's coming.

182
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,934
What will happen to it? I'm locking
it up until there's a trial.

183
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:47,734
Why? It hasn't done anything.

184
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:52,054
Evidence, Miss Stewart. I thought it
safest to put it behind bars.

185
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,254
We wouldn't want it flying away,
now, would we?

186
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,294
Peters! I want a word with you.

187
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,654
I bought it fair and square.
I've read the Poultry Order.

188
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:08,734
There's nothing to stop anybody
buying or selling turkeys.

189
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:12,494
For breeding.
I was going to breed, but it died.

190
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,614
What else was I meant to do?

191
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:16,894
Who did you buy it from?
I've told you.

192
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,374
At the market.
He's a registered breeder.

193
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:22,014
Really? This is the bill...

194
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:24,054
with a fake signature.

195
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,854
How was I meant to know that?

196
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:27,414
It's signed "W Churchill".

197
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:29,374
I didn't look at it.

198
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,974
Mr Tremayne,

199
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:36,014
men are dying
to bring food into this country.

200
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,414
You know what's happening.

201
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:40,654
You think they're doing it so people
like you can make a quick profit?

202
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,854
I was only thinking about
my customers.

203
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:47,734
Well, maybe you should be thinking
of 14 years. What?

204
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:51,174
But this is just between you and me
and these four walls. Right?

205
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,334
Yup.

206
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:56,054
I hadn't know Grace Phillips long.

207
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:58,134
But she was a nice girl.

208
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:01,254
Used to work in a hairdresser's
before she came over to us.

209
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:04,094
She'd only been with us
a couple of months

210
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,374
and she seemed so happy
at the start.

211
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:11,134
But then she changed. I could tell
she'd got something on her mind.

212
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,494
And then about a week ago,

213
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:18,734
I caught her on her own in the
ladies' room crying her eyes out.

214
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:20,774
I asked her,

215
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,894
"What on earth's the matter?"

216
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:26,294
But she wasn't very coherent.
It was all just tears, you know.

217
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,334
But she did say something to me.

218
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:32,614
"It's wrong to steal."
That's what she said.

219
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:34,654
Her exact words.

220
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,694
What do you think she meant by that?

221
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,654
Well, you tell me.
I've got no idea.

222
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,134
But a week later
there's this "accident",

223
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,094
and that's the end of it.

224
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:48,654
Now, I'm not saying anything,
Mr Foyle,

225
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,294
but you tell me.

226
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:52,494
A girl who's been perfectly happy

227
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,454
suddenly changes overnight.

228
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:56,934
She's scared.
She won't talk to anyone.

229
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:00,934
And then she makes a mistake,
and suddenly she's dead.

230
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,854
Now, they're all saying
it's an accident,

231
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:07,774
but I just think someone ought
to take a look. That's all.

232
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,734
For Grace.
COINS JINGLE

233
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,574
Thank you.

234
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:14,054
Ladies.

235
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:16,214
We've got ten more minutes,
Mr Baker.

236
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,214
All right, all right,
keep your hair on.

237
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,214
I'm just passing the hat round.

238
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:21,654
For Grace.
Grace?

239
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,174
Poor Grace. Not going to be
needing it now, is she?

240
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,414
No need to be like that.
She's got a mother.

241
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:29,014
Thank you. 70 years old.

242
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:30,814
All on her own.

243
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,654
I just thought some of us might like
to do something for her.

244
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:35,734
If you're not interested,
I won't force you.

245
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,214
I didn't mean it like that.

246
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,214
Here.

247
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,174
Very generous of you.

248
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,334
I take it
you're not going to the funeral.

249
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:50,414
You'll dock me half a day's wages
if I do. I don't make the rules.

250
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,494
You're all heart, Mr Baker (!)

251
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,534
You've got five minutes, not ten.

252
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:56,574
Enjoy your tea.

253
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,534
It's for Grace.

254
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,894
Morning.
How do?

255
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:11,534
Harry?
What is it?

256
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:15,534
I didn't expect to see you here.
Not after what happened.

257
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,894
I... I mean...you know.

258
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,854
Grace.

259
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,494
What else am I going to do?

260
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:26,134
Stay at home, I just think of her.

261
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,814
Does no good sitting on my own,
does it?

262
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,534
Might as well be here.

263
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,574
Of course, Harry. That's right.

264
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:35,534
I'm glad to see you.

265
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:40,094
So how's it going, then?

266
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,734
It's no bloody good.
These are all cracked.

267
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,974
And the ignition harness is useless.

268
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,214
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
Yeah.

269
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,374
Well, not for much longer.

270
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,374
You're still going ahead, then?

271
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:54,734
Not me. WE, Eric.

272
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:56,454
We're still going ahead, right?

273
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:58,934
I just thought
what with Grace and everything.

274
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,054
Grace doesn't make any difference.

275
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,534
Three days.
That's when we're going to do it.

276
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,534
Right.

277
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:08,934
You are still with me?
Of course I am.

278
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:11,534
Cos I wouldn't like to think
you've turned against me.

279
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,454
I'm with you, Harry, all the way.

280
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,174
All the way.

281
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,294
I like that!

282
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:20,334
Are you still working on that bike?
What do you mean, Mr Johnson?

283
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:21,734
You know what I mean.

284
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:24,854
That bike's been here since Monday,
and you've hardly started on it.

285
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,174
We've got a problem
with the ignition cables.

286
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:29,374
I know there's a problem
with the cables, Eric.

287
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:30,774
That's what it's here for.

288
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:33,174
Er...I'm not in tomorrow,
Mr Johnson.

289
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:35,174
I've got the funeral.

290
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,294
Yeah. Course.

291
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,054
I'm...

292
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:43,214
sorry about Grace, Harry.

293
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:47,454
What happened to her...
it was awful.

294
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,974
Well,

295
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,934
we've still got work to do.

296
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:56,934
Since you're here,
you'd best get on with it.

297
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,934
He never cared about Grace.

298
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,734
He doesn't care about anyone
except himself.

299
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,894
Old bastard.
"You might as well get on with it."

300
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,574
Get on with what?
This pile of junk's going nowhere.

301
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,894
Look what you've done.
That's really done it.

302
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,294
Just shut up, Eric.
Just shut up, all right?

303
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:36,894
Miss Stewart?
Brookie.

304
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,894
I was just looking at...

305
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,454
A real shame, isn't it?

306
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,254
It'll go off just sitting there.

307
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,094
In a couple of weeks, I suppose so.

308
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:48,854
When will the trial be?
The way things are at the moment,

309
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:50,694
not before the end of January.

310
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,654
Seems a terrible waste.
Yeah.

311
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,174
Sorry. Mr Foyle's ready to go home.

312
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,174
Oh, gosh. Right.

313
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,574
How did you get on?

314
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:09,214
Once he started,
he just wouldn't stop. Good.

315
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,694
Sir.
Ready? Yes, sir.

316
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:13,254
Good night.
Good night, sir. Good night, Sam.

317
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,494
Paul.

318
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,054
Jane!

319
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:44,974
They told me
you were still working here.

320
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:48,934
You've got a new desk sergeant.

321
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,694
What are you doing here?

322
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,094
In Hastings?
- No. Here.

323
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,814
I've come to see you.

324
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:56,254
Why?

325
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,894
I want to come home, Paul.

326
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:59,654
I want to come back to you.
Jane...

327
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:01,334
Stop.

328
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:03,774
It's been two and a half years.

329
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:06,614
I know. But we're still married.
I'm still your wife.

330
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,614
I know I was stupid.
I know I made mistakes.

331
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:11,734
But I want you to take me back.

332
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:19,754
Do you mind if I got myself
a cup of tea while I waited, sir?

333
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:23,434
Go ahead.
Just try to avoid getting recruited.

334
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:26,834
Don't worry, sir. Worker's Playtime
is definitely not for me.

335
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:48,634
Mr Foyle. Very good to meet you.

336
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,474
How do you do?
Come this way.

337
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:53,034
I'm Godfrey Watson,
Managing Director here.

338
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,594
Used to be an engineering firm,
didn't it?

339
00:20:55,594 --> 00:20:58,874
In happier times, yes.
It was converted in 1940.

340
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:02,034
Now it's high-explosive shells,
20,000 of them a week.

341
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:03,674
Do come in.

342
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,754
This is Edward Baker,
my works manager.

343
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,474
Please take a seat.
Thank you.

344
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,314
Would you like some tea?
I won't, thank you very much.

345
00:21:11,674 --> 00:21:13,514
A lot of women employed here.

346
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:18,914
Yes. About 40% of our workers here
are women.

347
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,354
Couldn't do without them.

348
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:22,794
Now we've trained up
a whole second army of women

349
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:26,194
on centre lathes, hand-millers,
routers, tapping machines.

350
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:28,114
And they're very good at it.

351
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:30,074
Some would say better than the men.

352
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,274
Cause problems?

353
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,554
Well, there's
a certain amount of rivalry. Yes.

354
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,874
What is it you're investigating,
Mr Foyle?

355
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:39,114
Well, I'm not investigating anything
as such.

356
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:42,434
Just want to know what you can tell
me about a woman who worked here.

357
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,074
Grace Phillips.
Ah, yes.

358
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:45,994
Her funeral's this afternoon.

359
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,714
It's... it's very sad.

360
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:49,674
Mm.

361
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:52,394
Many accidents?
One last year.

362
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,754
Two the year before.

363
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:56,674
It's dangerous work.
Everybody knows that.

364
00:21:56,674 --> 00:22:00,594
The slightest vibration
can cause an explosion.

365
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,914
Friction. A spark. Anything.

366
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,354
Even so, we've had only
four fatalities in three years.

367
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,874
Well below the national average.

368
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,514
We certainly don't expect to be

369
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,714
at the receiving end
of a police enquiry.

370
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,474
Could I see where she worked?
Yes, of course.

371
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:25,514
Was she a reliable sort of girl?

372
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,114
I didn't really get to know her.

373
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,514
Mr Baker?

374
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,514
She was a good worker, although
she hadn't been here that long.

375
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:34,474
Two or three months, maybe.

376
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:36,754
She was a bit highly strung.

377
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:39,594
Poor health record.
Saw the MO a couple of times.

378
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:41,714
Why was that?
I couldn't tell you.

379
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,674
But we can easily find out, though.

380
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,354
A lot of the girls come down
with minor complaints.

381
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:49,794
Nervous debility is the main cause
of sickness here, as you'd imagine.

382
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:53,114
Erm...we get respiratory,
digestive disorders

383
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:55,594
and skin ailments too, of course.
Is that right?

384
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:58,714
Girls like Grace are handling
a lot of poisonous materials.

385
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:00,834
Tetryl. Cordite. Trinitrotoluene.

386
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,794
TNT.

387
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,514
They can get a yellow discolouration
of the skin.

388
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:10,154
Particularly the ones in the
pellet and powder sections. I see.

389
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,994
We could let you have her
personal file, if that would help.

390
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:14,954
It would, thank you.

391
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,514
We've had to close off
the entire area.

392
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:23,914
There were a lot of chemicals around
when the blast occurred.

393
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:26,794
It'll take us a few more days
to clean it up.

394
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,914
We may lose a whole week
of production.

395
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,154
Poor girl.

396
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:40,074
I have to say, Mr Foyle,

397
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:42,594
if there's anything
you know about Miss Phillips

398
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,234
that you're not telling us,
then perhaps you should.

399
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:47,874
I know absolutely nothing.
That's why I'm here.

400
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,954
She was a very ordinary girl.
One of hundreds.

401
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,194
Mind if I join you?

402
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,154
No. Go ahead.

403
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:18,434
Look at that. Penny halfpenny
for a little bit of Swiss roll.

404
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,234
Profiteering, I call it.

405
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:23,994
Is that your car outside?

406
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,474
My boss's. Yes.

407
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:26,914
Who's he, then?

408
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:29,114
He's a police officer.

409
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,314
You're with the police?

410
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,714
Mm. In a way.

411
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:34,674
I'm a police driver.

412
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,794
You're here about Grace?

413
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,874
I was there when it happened.

414
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:41,994
You work in the shell filling room?

415
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,754
The suicide squad.

416
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:45,714
I'm a fully paid-up member.

417
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:48,674
So what happened?

418
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:50,914
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

419
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,874
I expect she dropped a fuse.

420
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:55,874
Mind you, I wasn't surprised.

421
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:58,394
Grace wasn't at all well
that morning.

422
00:24:58,394 --> 00:25:00,394
Half asleep on her feet.

423
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:03,394
If you ask me,
they should never have let her in.

424
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,234
But you weren't hurt?

425
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:07,194
No. I was lucky.

426
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:10,594
Just stepped out
to fetch some more fuses.

427
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:13,514
I wouldn't like to do your job.

428
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:16,314
I wouldn't mind doing yours.

429
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,634
Nice way to lady it through the war.

430
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:23,674
So what's it like here?

431
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,714
It's a man's job, isn't it?

432
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:30,914
But we do it just as well as them
and they resent us because of it.

433
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:33,034
They pay us half as much as the men
too.

434
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,114
Three pounds, three shillings
a week.

435
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,714
Aren't they glad to have you?

436
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:39,274
They're always picking holes
in what we do.

437
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:42,794
I can't tell you how often
I've thought about packing it in.

438
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:44,914
So why don't you?

439
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:46,754
Because I'm an idiot.

440
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,914
No. It's not that.

441
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,434
I've got my Billy out in Libya.

442
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,954
He's a gunner.

443
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,914
I like to think that what I'm making
here, he'll get to use out there.

444
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:02,154
Know what I mean?

445
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:04,114
It makes me feel part of it.

446
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,354
Is it long hours?

447
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:09,274
They've given us two hours off
this afternoon.

448
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,994
That's down to Grace.

449
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,514
The funeral.

450
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:17,074
Yeah.

451
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:21,274
The foreman doesn't like to give us
time off, normally.

452
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,434
He's organised a whip-round
for her mum

453
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,794
and a few of us thought
we ought to be there.

454
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:29,034
That tells you a bit about our work,
doesn't it?

455
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:32,754
Going to a funeral is
the high point of my week.

456
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:40,874
Is anything wrong, Mr Baker?

457
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:42,634
No, sir.

458
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,754
You seemed a little off-hand
with Mr Foyle.

459
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,714
Was I? I didn't mean to be.

460
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,954
Oh, I'm giving two of the girls
who knew her best

461
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:53,554
some time off to go to the funeral.

462
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,714
Are you sure that's a good idea,
sir?

463
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,954
Everyone's upset.
It'll be good for morale.

464
00:26:57,954 --> 00:26:59,874
Production's been affected anyway.

465
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:01,994
Well, even so.

466
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:05,674
I'm going myself
and I think you should be there too.

467
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:14,234
Sir, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

468
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,594
What's that?

469
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,874
Well, actually, it's this turkey.

470
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:20,554
I know it's none of my business.
That's right.

471
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:23,594
But I wondered if you were going
to leave it in the evidence room

472
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:25,194
until it rots.

473
00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:27,154
Where would you like me to put it?

474
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:30,754
What I mean is -
do you really need it for the court?

475
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:34,194
Yup, afraid so.
It's Christmas soon, sir.

476
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,594
And sardine pancakes are
all very well and good,

477
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:39,034
but they're not exactly festive,
are they? Well.

478
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:42,394
You don't think the judge would mind
if it was missing the drum-sticks?

479
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,154
You mean, eat the evidence?

480
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,754
Not all of it.

481
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:48,354
Just a leg or two.

482
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:50,634
What do you think the judge
will say about that?

483
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,514
No. Nothing we can do.

484
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:54,474
End of subject.

485
00:27:55,594 --> 00:28:00,194
You know, sir, quite soon,
it will begin to smell.

486
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,514
Sir...

487
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:14,194
Sorry to ask, but could I have
some time off this afternoon?

488
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,554
It's a personal matter,
but it's important.

489
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:18,194
Of course.
Thank you.

490
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:20,274
Everything all right?

491
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:22,234
Yes, sir.
Good.

492
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:27,314
Sam.
Sir.

493
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,874
You could do something for me.

494
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,674
Yes, sir? This funeral
this afternoon, Grace Phillips's.

495
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,634
I wondered if you'd mind...
Not at all. I'd be glad to.

496
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:43,114
Well, find out what you can,
see who's there.

497
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,074
Have a word with the mother
if possible.

498
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:47,874
St Paul's Church and cemetery.
You don't mind going?

499
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,874
Not at all.
I'll see what I can dig up.

500
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:51,874
Jolly good.

501
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:04,674
Only way to get a couple of hours
off in this place, a funeral.

502
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,554
We should have more of 'em.

503
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:09,994
(I wouldn't mind going to his,
for a start.)

504
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:26,114
Mr Johnson.

505
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,354
Mr Johnson!

506
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,354
Not going, Mr Johnson?

507
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:38,234
Oh, no. I didn't think
it was right for me to be there.

508
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,234
Why's that?
I didn't really know her.

509
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,074
You rented a room to her.

510
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,874
She used to say that
you were like a father to her.

511
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:46,234
When did she say that?

512
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,314
She said it often.

513
00:29:48,314 --> 00:29:50,314
But you please yourself.

514
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:52,954
I rented out a room. That's all.

515
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:54,954
Come on, Harry.

516
00:29:54,954 --> 00:29:56,954
Get on with you.

517
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:02,074
And I'll see you back here
first thing tomorrow.

518
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,674
Pastries?
Yes, please. No, thank you.

519
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:16,994
When you came back from Norway,
I know I was beastly to you.

520
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:19,954
It wasn't just your injury.
Please believe that.

521
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:23,394
We'd had so many plans together,
and everything had suddenly changed.

522
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:25,474
YOU'D changed.
And I was wrong.

523
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:27,354
I see that now.

524
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:30,034
But I've learned so much
being away from you.

525
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:33,674
The one thing I know is that I still
love you and I want to be with you.

526
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,634
I've met somebody else.

527
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,234
What?

528
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:39,834
Who?

529
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,514
Does it matter?

530
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:43,554
Well, yes. I'd like to know.

531
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:46,034
It's Edith.

532
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:48,034
Edith Ashford?

533
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:53,554
She always did give you the glad eye
even when we were at school.

534
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,114
Is she living with you?

535
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,474
Is she in OUR house?

536
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:58,794
It's not our house, Jane. It's mine.

537
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:01,554
No, she isn't. Not yet.

538
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:03,754
But you've asked her to?

539
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:05,514
It's none of your business.

540
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:08,554
Aren't you forgetting something?
We're not actually divorced.

541
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,434
It's been over two years.

542
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,354
But it's THREE years, isn't it?

543
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:15,314
The Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937.

544
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,354
I can come back if I want to -
and I do.

545
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,154
My sister doesn't want me in Wales.

546
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:22,554
I've got nowhere else to go.
So you can tell Edith.

547
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,514
You stay away from me, Jane.

548
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,474
And you stay away from Edith.

549
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:29,074
I'm warning you.
What?

550
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:30,914
It's over between us.

551
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:33,154
You're not part of my life.

552
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:35,274
So just keep away. Or else!

553
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:47,394
VICAR: As we contemplate
this young life,

554
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:51,114
brought to so sudden and premature
an end,

555
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:53,634
we have to remember
that Grace Phillips

556
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,994
gave her life for her country

557
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,674
in exactly the same way

558
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:00,634
as so many of our young men
are doing overseas.

559
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:03,314
We must salute her courage

560
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:06,594
and the courage of all the men
and women who worked with her,

561
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:09,354
supporting our troops.
(Grace.)

562
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:13,554
You wanted to say a few words?

563
00:32:13,554 --> 00:32:15,754
Yes, sir.

564
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:22,074
Grace was my best girl.

565
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:24,074
We was going to be married.

566
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:28,074
We was going to spend the rest
of our lives with each other.

567
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:30,274
I'm... I'm sorry.

568
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:32,434
But this is my fault.

569
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:34,514
Erm...

570
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:36,194
the thing about Grace was...

571
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:39,474
..she was happy where she was.

572
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,474
And then I had to go
and put my foot in it

573
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,634
and tell her
she could be doing her bit.

574
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:49,074
Doing something more.

575
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:51,034
And she believed me...

576
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,674
..because
that's the sort of girl she was.

577
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,874
I thought you'd look after her.

578
00:32:57,874 --> 00:32:59,994
She was ill that last day.

579
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:03,674
You know that,
and you still made her do it.

580
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:06,194
Wait a minute.
Why didn't you just send her home?

581
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:09,554
My lovely girl blown to bits
and me left on my own.

582
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,554
What am I going to do?

583
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,554
We didn't know she was ill.

584
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:16,994
We did everything we could
to keep her safe.

585
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,074
Gentlemen, this is neither the time
nor the place.

586
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:21,634
Harry.

587
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,714
Come on.
Let's drown our sorrows, eh?

588
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,554
Yeah.

589
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,994
I don't want to be here.
Not with THEM.

590
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:35,594
Shall we say the Lord's Prayer
together?

591
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,354
Our father which art in heaven

592
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:40,994
Hallowed be thou name

593
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,154
Thy kingdom come

594
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,274
Thy will be done

595
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,714
On earth as it is in heaven

596
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:48,074
Give us this...

597
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:05,394
SHOP BELL

598
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:07,794
Jane, dear, if you're going up,
pop the kettle on.

599
00:34:07,794 --> 00:34:09,354
I'm only going to be about ten...

600
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,634
Mollie, did you know about Grace?

601
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,554
Yes, it's terrible.

602
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,074
You didn't tell me.

603
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:16,954
I didn't know whether to or not.

604
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,834
You've got so much on your mind,
I didn't want to worry you.

605
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:21,594
Are you all right?
Yes...

606
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:23,314
Not really. No.
Did you see him?

607
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:25,834
Mollie, I have to go back out.
But you've only just..

608
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,794
Sorry. I have to see Paul.
What, again?

609
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:34,954
She used to be one of my best cutters
- Jane Milner.

610
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:36,834
I'm sorry, ma'am. He's not here.

611
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,314
Do you know where he is?
I imagine he's gone home.

612
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:43,234
Could you tell him I was here and I
want to see him? Certainly, ma'am.

613
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,754
Lovely, isn't it, sir.

614
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,914
Is it?
The smell.

615
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:54,554
Fresh turkey, sir.

616
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:56,194
Ah.

617
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,794
I haven't seen a bird like that
for two years.

618
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:01,074
Been talking to Sam?

619
00:35:01,074 --> 00:35:03,034
Miss Stewart, sir?

620
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:05,994
Not recently.

621
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:07,354
Good night.

622
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:09,314
Good night, sir.

623
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,834
It's only been three months.

624
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:15,394
Three months, three weeks
and two days.

625
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,634
It's just sometimes you talk
as if...

626
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,794
As if we're going to be together
for ever?

627
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:22,834
Of course we are.

628
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:25,714
We're going to muddle on
until Hitler throws in the towel

629
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:27,714
and then we're going to get married

630
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,914
and have as much milk as we want

631
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:31,834
and oranges and bananas and sweets

632
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,634
and all the other things
we can't get,

633
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,594
and we'll have a proper life.

634
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:39,434
You really think that?
Paul. I've told you.

635
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,514
I'm not going to let you go.

636
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:17,074
JANE: Certainly do not.
What do you mean?

637
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,074
What are you trying to...?

638
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:23,994
Why are you following me?
What do you want?

639
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:26,434
What are you doing?
This is ridiculous.

640
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,514
Get off me!

641
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:31,394
What are you doing?

642
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:33,354
No!

643
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:53,238
How did you get on yesterday?
- The funeral, sir? - Yup.

644
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:54,878
Well, strange, really.

645
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,518
Was it?

646
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,758
Well, there weren't many people
there.

647
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,038
People she worked with
and some of her family,

648
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:02,838
but not her mother, though.

649
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,038
Why was that, do you think?
I don't know.

650
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:06,638
Perhaps she couldn't face it.

651
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:09,918
Anyway, they had a collection
for her at the factory. Mm-hm.

652
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:12,198
Boyfriend?
There was a young man.

653
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:14,878
Good-looking.
He made a speech at the grave.

654
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:18,358
He said Grace should never have been
at work when they knew she was ill.

655
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:20,878
I'm afraid it wasn't much fun.
It's a funeral.

656
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:24,638
No. I mean...

657
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:26,518
there was something about HIM.

658
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:28,518
It was as if...

659
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:32,118
This is a horrible thing to say,
but it was as if

660
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:33,918
he was putting the whole thing on.

661
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,878
Like a performance.

662
00:37:37,398 --> 00:37:39,078
Well, thanks for going.

663
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:40,438
You know me, sir.

664
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:42,678
Always glad to be of service.

665
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,638
Funeral service included.

666
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:49,278
Sir.

667
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:51,398
Bad news, I'm afraid.

668
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:55,678
They found a young woman dead in
an alleyway just off the parade.

669
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:58,638
Killed some time last night.
Beaten around the head.

670
00:37:58,638 --> 00:38:00,078
Do we know who it is?

671
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,758
Yes, sir.

672
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:05,398
I've tried to keep it quiet,
but word gets around.

673
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,638
It's Mrs Milner, sir.

674
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:09,518
What?

675
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,198
Jane Milner?

676
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:13,158
Yeah, his wife.

677
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,918
His ex-wife, I mean.

678
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,678
I understand they were divorced.

679
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:19,238
But that's not possible.
She's in Wales.

680
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:21,838
There's no doubt about it,
I'm afraid, Miss Stewart.

681
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:24,278
She was here yesterday evening,
as a matter of fact,

682
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:26,678
asking for Mr Milner.
I saw her myself.

683
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,918
What time was that?

684
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,238
6:30 exactly, sir.

685
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:31,718
I made an entry in the book.

686
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:40,998
Where's he?

687
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:42,958
He's not in yet, sir.

688
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:46,598
It's the first time I've ever known
him to be late for work.

689
00:38:58,718 --> 00:39:01,678
Killed at around ten o'clock
last night, they think.

690
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:03,718
It appears that's the murder weapon.

691
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:08,518
You just missed the MO, sir.
He's been called to Hove.

692
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,678
He asked me to give you this.
Thank you.

693
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:14,318
Who found her?
A couple of young ladies, sir.

694
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,958
They work in Hardcastle's, the
drapery shop. On their way to work.

695
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,838
That's empty, sir.

696
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,798
Not a word about this to anybody
for the time being.

697
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:32,798
Don't you worry, sir.
You can count on me.

698
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,158
Sergeant Milner.

699
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,838
Where is everyone?

700
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:55,078
Er...
there's been an incident in town.

701
00:39:55,078 --> 00:39:57,038
What sort of incident?

702
00:39:58,238 --> 00:40:00,198
I couldn't tell you, sir.

703
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:18,078
What are you doing here, Miss Law?

704
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,518
I don't believe it's time
for your morning break.

705
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,358
They told me you were here,
Mr Baker.

706
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,718
If you want to see me,
you should come to my office.

707
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:27,758
I thought you might like to see me
more informally.

708
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:33,758
You see, the thing is,
what with Christmas coming up,

709
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:35,958
I was thinking of
taking some time off.

710
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,678
The factory doesn't close
for Christmas. You know that.

711
00:40:38,678 --> 00:40:41,518
You'll get a day and a half off
like everybody else.

712
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:43,278
I'd like three days.

713
00:40:44,238 --> 00:40:47,558
I'm sorry?
I think you heard me, Mr Baker.

714
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:51,198
Christmas Eve, Christmas Day
and Boxing Day.

715
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,838
Is that too much to ask.

716
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,638
Why are you asking me this now?

717
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:56,238
It's out of the question.

718
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:59,398
And you might like to think about
a Christmas bonus too. Miss Law.

719
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:01,118
Or...

720
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:03,078
I might start talking about
Grace Phillips.

721
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,438
What are you talking about?

722
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:08,958
I was at the funeral yesterday.
Remember?

723
00:41:10,158 --> 00:41:12,318
I got chatting to someone.

724
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:14,358
Turns out he was her cousin.

725
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:17,118
He had a lot to say.

726
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:19,198
What are you talking about?

727
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:21,718
Well, he told me about Grace.

728
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:24,638
And about her poor old mum.

729
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:28,758
Is it true the police were here,
Mr Baker?

730
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:30,878
Asking questions, were they?

731
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:33,238
They were making routine enquiries.

732
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:38,158
Well, they might not be so routine
when I talk to them.

733
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:41,398
I can't do what you ask.

734
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:44,038
You're in charge of the roster,

735
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,718
and when it comes to pay,
they'll do what you recommend.

736
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:50,598
You're blackmailing me.
I'm not doing nothing of the sort.

737
00:41:52,078 --> 00:41:54,238
I do a good job here.

738
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:56,918
I just want to get a bit more like
what I deserve.

739
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,838
I'll think about it.

740
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:02,798
You do that.

741
00:42:04,718 --> 00:42:06,758
I'd be careful if I was you,
Miss Law.

742
00:42:07,478 --> 00:42:09,118
A place like this.

743
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:10,838
And you with your husband away.

744
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:12,398
All on your own.

745
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,878
What are you saying?

746
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:16,678
I know all about you.

747
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:18,718
I know where you live.

748
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:20,678
You try put the finger on me.

749
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:24,598
You don't know me, Miss Law.

750
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:26,558
You don't know anything about me.

751
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,878
You don't know what I might do.

752
00:42:39,238 --> 00:42:40,758
You're sure it's her?

753
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:45,558
Can I see her?

754
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:51,038
You know she was here?

755
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:52,878
Yes, sir.

756
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:54,958
I saw her yesterday.

757
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:58,958
How was she...?

758
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,398
She was erm...

759
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:05,358
attacked with a brick.

760
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:08,238
When?

761
00:43:08,238 --> 00:43:10,198
Last night, about ten o'clock.

762
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,478
What can you tell me?

763
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:15,998
I had tea with her yesterday
afternoon at the Spread Eagle.

764
00:43:17,518 --> 00:43:19,598
That was the last time I saw her.

765
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,798
What did she want?

766
00:43:21,798 --> 00:43:23,758
It's difficult to explain.

767
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:27,638
Well, I hate to ask,
but in the circumstances...

768
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:33,078
Sir, I told you that
we were divorced,

769
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,038
but it wasn't true.

770
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:38,918
It would have been in a few months.

771
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:40,798
She was the one who left me.

772
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:44,038
But it turns out
that wasn't what she wanted.

773
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:47,518
She asked me to take her back.

774
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,798
Did she know about your erm...
current circumstances?

775
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,798
Edith.

776
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,758
I told her.

777
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,398
She was upset, angry.

778
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:04,838
She asked me if she could move back
into the house,

779
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,998
and I said that
that wasn't possible now.

780
00:44:07,998 --> 00:44:09,918
Where was she staying?

781
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:12,518
There's a hairdresser's
on the High Street.

782
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:14,838
She used to work there
before we were married.

783
00:44:16,518 --> 00:44:18,518
And...

784
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,918
Last night?
I was on my own.

785
00:44:21,918 --> 00:44:23,998
I left Edith around nine.

786
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:28,678
Sir, I know how this must look.

787
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:31,118
You have every right
to treat me as a suspect.

788
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:33,598
Well, I mean, I have absolutely
no doubt whatsoever

789
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:35,478
that you had nothing to do with this,

790
00:44:35,478 --> 00:44:39,038
but if we're not seen to be doing it
by the book. I understand.

791
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:43,998
Are you suspending me?

792
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:46,318
No, no, no, no, no. But obviously,

793
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:48,878
you can't be involved with
the investigation.

794
00:44:48,878 --> 00:44:51,118
And we're going to have
to take a look

795
00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:53,518
at your home and your office,
I'm afraid.

796
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:00,918
I do wonder why you felt it necessary
to lie about the divorce.

797
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:02,558
I suppose it was just easier.

798
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:05,278
After she left, I did write to her
suggesting we divorce,

799
00:45:05,278 --> 00:45:07,678
but she never replied,

800
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:09,558
so...

801
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:11,318
I just pretended that we were.

802
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:15,278
The more I said it,
the more I believed it.

803
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:16,838
Tell Edith?

804
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:18,838
No, I lied to her.

805
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:21,038
I just...

806
00:45:21,038 --> 00:45:22,958
I just wanted Jane out of my life.

807
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:27,438
She is now.

808
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:31,478
Sir, you can't think
for a single minute

809
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,638
that Mr Milner had anything to do
with the death of his wife.

810
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:38,038
What makes you think
I'll be answering this question?

811
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:40,838
Have I made it clear that
cases are not for discussion?

812
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,758
Yes, sir.

813
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:45,438
Do we discuss cases?
No, sir.

814
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:47,358
Will we be discussing this one?

815
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:49,318
No, sir.

816
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:01,638
I want everything put back exactly
where it was.

817
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:05,398
If you find anything that raises
an eyebrow, come straight to me.

818
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:07,238
Yes, Sergeant.
Sarge.

819
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:31,198
Oi. I don't want anyone
larking around

820
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:32,998
with Sergeant Milner's things.

821
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,958
You two back downstairs.

822
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:05,198
I know this is difficult,

823
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,158
but if you felt able to answer
a few questions I'd appreciate it.

824
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,598
Yes.

825
00:47:09,598 --> 00:47:11,038
Just give me a minute.

826
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,438
I'll be all right in a minute.
Of course.

827
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,638
Jane...

828
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:19,038
Jane was staying with me.

829
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:22,878
I couldn't understand
why she didn't come back last night.

830
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:24,398
I was very worried about her.

831
00:47:24,398 --> 00:47:26,638
You know where she went?

832
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:28,878
Yes. I do.
She went to see her husband.

833
00:47:31,158 --> 00:47:32,718
But of course you knew that.

834
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:34,598
He works for you.

835
00:47:35,718 --> 00:47:37,358
He did this, didn't he?

836
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:40,718
Have you arrested him?

837
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:45,078
Jane didn't have an enemy
in the world, apart from him.

838
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:47,878
He didn't treat her well.

839
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:49,958
Did she tell you that?

840
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:52,478
Why are you asking
all these questions?

841
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:54,398
She came back yesterday.

842
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:56,038
She'd seen him.

843
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,438
She was very upset.

844
00:47:57,438 --> 00:48:00,078
She said she was going to go out
and see him again.

845
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:03,598
And that was the last time
I saw her.

846
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:09,238
I know he's your friend
and you're trying to protect him.

847
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,598
But he killed her.

848
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,238
He killed her!

849
00:48:21,438 --> 00:48:23,318
Have you heard?

850
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:25,318
What's that, then, Eric?

851
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:27,798
The bogies are all over Hastings.

852
00:48:27,798 --> 00:48:31,678
They found some bird's been murdered
down near the parade.

853
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:33,598
That's terrible.

854
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:36,478
I tell you,
nobody's safe these days.

855
00:48:36,478 --> 00:48:38,238
So you don't know nothing about it?

856
00:48:38,238 --> 00:48:40,318
Why should I know anything?

857
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,678
I just thought you might have heard.
That's all.

858
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:44,478
No. It's all news to me.

859
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:46,878
SHOP BELL

860
00:48:46,878 --> 00:48:49,958
You want a cup of tea?
Yeah, if you're making a brew.

861
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:58,038
So who was that woman
who came here last night?

862
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:00,158
That was my wife.
What?

863
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:04,358
It's a joke, Eric. Who was that lady
I saw you with last night?

864
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,438
That was no lady. That was my wife!

865
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:08,398
Oh.

866
00:49:09,398 --> 00:49:12,238
What's the matter with you today?
What's made you so jumpy?

867
00:49:12,238 --> 00:49:14,238
I don't know.

868
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:18,598
You know, I was just thinking,
Harry...

869
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:25,718
What with all this business -
the police and everything -

870
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:28,078
maybe it's not the best time,
you know?

871
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:30,318
You getting cold feet?
No, no, no.

872
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:33,478
It's the right time, Eric.
Everything's set. I know.

873
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:37,398
And with the rozzers chasing after
whoever bashed in this poor woman,

874
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:39,758
they won't have any time for us,
will they? Right.

875
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:46,398
How did you know she was bashed in?

876
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:49,518
You told me.
Did I?

877
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:51,638
Well, I don't know.
I must have heard.

878
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:54,478
Come on. You really think
I had something to do with it?

879
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:56,078
I don't know her.

880
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:57,918
I don't even know who she is.

881
00:49:57,918 --> 00:49:59,878
She's got nothing to do with me.

882
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,958
I'm so sorry about Jane.

883
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,478
Thank you, Sam.

884
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:17,558
I can't believe it's happened.

885
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:20,238
There always seems to be
someone dying somewhere,

886
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:22,958
but you never expect it
to be someone you know.

887
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,318
If there's anything I can do to
help, you will tell me, won't you?

888
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:30,358
Of course. Thank you, Sam.

889
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,838
Sit down.

890
00:50:56,878 --> 00:50:58,798
Have you found anything, sir?

891
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,118
Well, I spoke to the woman
at the hairdresser's.

892
00:51:02,118 --> 00:51:03,558
Mrs Summersgill.
Mm.

893
00:51:03,558 --> 00:51:05,558
Was she helpful?
I wouldn't say so.

894
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,118
Er...we did find this.

895
00:51:10,118 --> 00:51:12,278
This was with your wife
when we found her.

896
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,638
Wondered if you recognised
the handwriting.

897
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,718
No, sir.

898
00:51:16,718 --> 00:51:18,798
It's postmarked Hastings.

899
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:20,758
Sent about a week ago.

900
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:24,798
Was there no letter with it?

901
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:26,758
There wasn't.

902
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,158
Could this be the reason
that she was killed?

903
00:51:32,518 --> 00:51:34,558
Unfortunately, we erm...

904
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,638
We also found this.

905
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,518
This is my shirt.

906
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:51,398
Taken from your house.

907
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:52,878
Why?

908
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,918
Well, why do you think?

909
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,398
Is this where I'm supposed to say,
I cut myself shaving?

910
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:02,878
Well, I'm very glad you didn't

911
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:05,038
because it's not your blood.
It's your wife's.

912
00:52:08,038 --> 00:52:10,158
It's ridiculous.

913
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:12,278
It must be a mistake.

914
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,758
There's no explanation.

915
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:19,318
Of course. That's not true.

916
00:52:20,518 --> 00:52:22,718
There can be only one explanation,
can't there?

917
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:31,078
Also...er...went to the hotel where
you and your wife were last seen.

918
00:52:31,078 --> 00:52:32,998
A few people there who...um...

919
00:52:32,998 --> 00:52:34,758
Heard us arguing.

920
00:52:34,758 --> 00:52:38,998
Well, arguing violently
is how it was described.

921
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:42,518
It was... It was heated,

922
00:52:42,518 --> 00:52:44,518
but it wasn't violent.

923
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:47,118
Well, whatever it was,
did you threaten her?

924
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:49,118
No.

925
00:52:49,118 --> 00:52:51,278
Not in so many words.

926
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:53,278
How many words do you need?

927
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,758
Sir,

928
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,638
I don't deny the argument.

929
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:00,718
But I can't explain the shirt.

930
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:06,798
What are you going to do?

931
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,583
Mr Foyle.
Yeah.

932
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:38,223
I know I shouldn't be here,
but I wonder if I might come in.

933
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,543
Yes.

934
00:53:46,943 --> 00:53:48,903
I...

935
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:52,583
I understand you've suspended Paul.

936
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:56,303
Um...

937
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:57,863
have you seen him?

938
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:00,263
I spoke to him yesterday,
but only briefly.

939
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:04,023
You can't really suspect him
of killing his wife, can you?

940
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:05,903
You know that would be absurd.

941
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:09,303
I know. You're going to tell me
you can't discuss it with me.

942
00:54:09,303 --> 00:54:11,703
But how can you be so cruel?

943
00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:14,383
He's been with you
for more than two years.

944
00:54:14,383 --> 00:54:15,903
He's totally loyal to you.

945
00:54:15,903 --> 00:54:17,463
He'd do anything for you.

946
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:21,223
Listen, I'm very sorry,
but I do think you should leave.

947
00:54:21,223 --> 00:54:22,823
No. Wait.

948
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:25,583
I'm sorry. I had no cause to speak
to you like that.

949
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,983
That wasn't why I came here.

950
00:54:26,983 --> 00:54:29,503
The truth is...

951
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:31,463
I'm desperately worried about him.

952
00:54:32,383 --> 00:54:34,823
You see, he...
he told me about the shirt.

953
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:36,503
You found blood on it.

954
00:54:36,503 --> 00:54:37,903
Her blood.

955
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:39,583
That's what he said.

956
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,983
Yes.

957
00:54:40,983 --> 00:54:42,903
They met, you know.

958
00:54:42,903 --> 00:54:45,263
He never denied that.

959
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:47,143
Maybe it got there...

960
00:54:48,943 --> 00:54:50,903
Somehow...

961
00:55:07,743 --> 00:55:10,583
Did you know that
they had never divorced?

962
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:12,583
I didn't know.

963
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:14,023
Not until last night.

964
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:16,343
He told me then.

965
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:17,743
Come as a shock?

966
00:55:18,703 --> 00:55:20,703
Paul lied to himself.

967
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:23,503
I don't think he lied to me.

968
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:25,543
He still lied.

969
00:55:31,063 --> 00:55:33,023
You're right.

970
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,023
I shouldn't have come here.

971
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:39,183
You know that
in any other circumstances,

972
00:55:39,183 --> 00:55:43,223
he'd have been arrested, suspended,
quite possibly put into jail.

973
00:55:43,223 --> 00:55:45,183
I know.

974
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:47,103
You're doing what you can.

975
00:55:47,103 --> 00:55:49,543
No, I'm doing
what I believe is right.

976
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:52,943
And I'm sorry I can't tell you
what you want to hear.

977
00:55:53,503 --> 00:55:55,823
You really think he's guilty?

978
00:55:55,823 --> 00:55:57,383
No, I don't.

979
00:55:57,383 --> 00:55:59,343
I think YOU do.

980
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:12,663
Terrible, isn't it, miss?

981
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:18,223
What is? A waste of good food -
and at a time like this, you know.

982
00:56:18,223 --> 00:56:20,343
It won't be long before it starts
to rot.

983
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,223
I wasn't even thinking about it.

984
00:56:22,223 --> 00:56:24,143
No. I suppose not.

985
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:26,423
This whole place is rotten,
if you ask me.

986
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:29,703
What they're saying about
Sergeant Milner, it's tripe.

987
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:32,063
I'm sure Mr Foyle
will get to the bottom of it.

988
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:34,223
I hope so. We all do.

989
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:36,103
By the way, for what it's worth...

990
00:56:37,183 --> 00:56:38,863
..I do have the key.

991
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,783
What for?
The evidence room.

992
00:56:40,783 --> 00:56:42,783
Just thought you'd like to know.

993
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:49,743
Everything all right, Miss Stewart?
Yes, thank you, Brookie.

994
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:53,823
No. Not really.

995
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:58,103
It really is a bleak midwinter,
isn't it?

996
00:56:58,103 --> 00:57:00,903
Well, we've just had some news
that might cheer you up.

997
00:57:00,903 --> 00:57:02,543
There was a witness.

998
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:03,903
What?

999
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:05,583
When Mrs Milner was killed.

1000
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,063
There was someone there,

1001
00:57:07,063 --> 00:57:08,983
and he's just been on the blower.

1002
00:57:10,543 --> 00:57:13,903
MAN: In a way, I'm quite grateful
to Herr Hitler.

1003
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:17,063
Him and his war

1004
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:18,783
have given me something to do.

1005
00:57:19,663 --> 00:57:21,623
Oh, yes, I saw her.

1006
00:57:22,503 --> 00:57:24,503
I was on my way home.

1007
00:57:24,503 --> 00:57:28,183
There are 12 of us fire guards
in this district.

1008
00:57:29,463 --> 00:57:31,423
Responsible job.
Yes.

1009
00:57:32,263 --> 00:57:35,183
Mind you,
we haven't had a raid for a while.

1010
00:57:36,383 --> 00:57:38,303
It's all reports, really.

1011
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,183
Weekly meetings.

1012
00:57:44,383 --> 00:57:46,463
I've never actually seen a fire.

1013
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:48,903
I drink a lot of tea.

1014
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:52,143
Do you want some?
No, I won't, no thank you.

1015
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:54,343
Would you be kind enough
to explain to me again

1016
00:57:54,343 --> 00:57:56,703
what exactly it was you saw?

1017
00:57:56,703 --> 00:57:58,663
I thought I already told you.

1018
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:01,263
Well, you told me
that you saw a young woman

1019
00:58:01,263 --> 00:58:04,143
and somebody was following her.
Oh, yes.

1020
00:58:04,143 --> 00:58:06,143
He was definitely following her.

1021
00:58:06,143 --> 00:58:08,703
I heard her calling out to him.

1022
00:58:08,703 --> 00:58:10,383
"Why are you following me?"

1023
00:58:10,383 --> 00:58:12,143
That's what she said.

1024
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:14,103
Did he say anything?

1025
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:16,583
I can't really remember.

1026
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,543
I don't think so.

1027
00:58:19,143 --> 00:58:21,303
If he did, I'd have heard his voice.

1028
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:24,863
I didn't know
he was going to kill her.

1029
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,383
I only read about that in the paper
this morning.

1030
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:30,423
I thought it was one of those,
you know,

1031
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,823
one of those husband and wife
arguments.

1032
00:58:33,503 --> 00:58:35,463
Did you see him?

1033
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,063
Oh, yes, I saw him,

1034
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:40,663
but of course it was dark.

1035
00:58:40,663 --> 00:58:42,663
Would you recognise him
if you saw him again?

1036
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:45,543
I wouldn't want to see him again.

1037
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:47,583
But if you did?

1038
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,583
Yeah, I suppose so.

1039
00:58:50,663 --> 00:58:53,223
I'd have to see him again
to be sure.

1040
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:56,623
Well, if we organised
an identity parade at the station,

1041
00:58:56,623 --> 00:59:00,023
would you be kind enough
to come down? I don't mind.

1042
00:59:00,023 --> 00:59:03,383
I don't mean now,
but I'll send a car to collect you.

1043
00:59:03,383 --> 00:59:05,143
Oh. Thank you.

1044
00:59:05,143 --> 00:59:07,103
Thank you.

1045
00:59:08,343 --> 00:59:10,103
Ready?
Ready, sir.

1046
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:11,823
Sorry to interrupt.

1047
00:59:11,823 --> 00:59:14,423
Sorry, I just get a bit bored
standing around.

1048
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:18,223
There's something in here
about Grace Phillips. Front page.

1049
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:21,063
Is that her?
Yes.

1050
00:59:21,063 --> 00:59:23,183
Poor girl. She was only 20.

1051
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,863
I've seen her before.

1052
00:59:32,263 --> 00:59:34,343
This is Grace, isn't it?

1053
00:59:34,343 --> 00:59:36,303
Yes.

1054
00:59:36,303 --> 00:59:39,063
That was taken before the war.
She changed her hair.

1055
00:59:40,503 --> 00:59:43,943
These days, it's all Victory cuts
from America.

1056
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:46,943
It's easier to wash and curl.

1057
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:49,583
All the girls want to look like
Veronica Lake.

1058
00:59:51,343 --> 00:59:52,983
You ever meet her boyfriend?

1059
00:59:52,983 --> 00:59:54,983
Well, not properly.

1060
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:57,383
But I did see him a couple of times

1061
00:59:57,383 --> 00:59:59,663
going in and out of the bank
next door,

1062
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,583
but he didn't come in here.

1063
01:00:03,143 --> 01:00:05,743
Jane and Grace were friends,
isn't that right?

1064
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,983
Yes, well, they were more than that.

1065
01:00:08,463 --> 01:00:10,143
They were cutters together,

1066
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:13,503
but Grace had been orphaned
when she was young

1067
01:00:13,503 --> 01:00:15,423
and she was all on her own.

1068
01:00:15,423 --> 01:00:18,223
She used to look upon Jane
as her big sister.

1069
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:22,263
Jane ever mention her
when she was staying with you?

1070
01:00:22,263 --> 01:00:26,783
Yes. Well, she saw the story in the
newspapers about Grace being killed

1071
01:00:26,783 --> 01:00:28,263
and she was terribly upset.

1072
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,183
Recognise this hand writing?

1073
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:37,063
Well, yes. That's Grace's.

1074
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:41,583
Mr Foyle, what has this got to do
with anything?

1075
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:45,663
Grace was killed in an accident and
you said that Jane was murdered.

1076
01:00:45,663 --> 01:00:48,023
I mean,
two completely different things.

1077
01:00:50,143 --> 01:00:53,103
You've found something,
haven't you, sir?

1078
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:54,943
Have I?

1079
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,023
I can always tell.

1080
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:57,703
You have a look.

1081
01:00:57,703 --> 01:01:02,583
A sort of "Cry havoc,
and let loose the dogs of war."

1082
01:01:03,623 --> 01:01:05,743
That's Julius Caesar.

1083
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:07,663
It's "slip".
What?

1084
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:10,743
It's, "Let slip the dogs of war."

1085
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:12,183
Is it really?

1086
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:13,623
Yes, it is.

1087
01:01:13,623 --> 01:01:14,983
Keep your eyes on the road.

1088
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:19,263
Oh, hell!

1089
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:30,023
Oh, my gosh.

1090
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:33,823
Radiator?

1091
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,983
Radiator.

1092
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,263
Is this as far as we go, then?
Seems so, sir.

1093
01:01:40,303 --> 01:01:42,583
Can you get as far as a garage?
I hope so.

1094
01:01:44,703 --> 01:01:46,623
Well, do your best.
I'm sorry, sir.

1095
01:01:47,823 --> 01:01:49,783
I'll walk.

1096
01:01:51,223 --> 01:01:53,343
You'll forgive me for saying so,
Mr Foyle,

1097
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:55,183
but this isn't a very good time.

1098
01:01:55,183 --> 01:01:57,783
We're just putting out
the Christmas payroll.

1099
01:01:57,783 --> 01:02:01,143
I'm sorry, Mr Watson, it's a little
difficult arranging a murder enquiry

1100
01:02:01,143 --> 01:02:04,143
around your wages schedule.
Murder? What you talking about?

1101
01:02:04,143 --> 01:02:06,463
Well, I'm afraid another woman
has been killed.

1102
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:10,023
A woman called Jane Milner.
Does that mean anything to you? No.

1103
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:12,663
A friend of Grace Phillips?
No.

1104
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:17,823
It seems on the morning Grace died,

1105
01:02:17,823 --> 01:02:20,623
she hadn't been feeling
particularly well, is that right?

1106
01:02:20,623 --> 01:02:21,903
Who told you that?

1107
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:26,863
It's true. Yes.

1108
01:02:26,863 --> 01:02:29,223
She did seem half asleep
that morning.

1109
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:31,503
You never told me this, Mr Baker.

1110
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:34,903
Well, no, sir. I didn't want
to trouble you with the details.

1111
01:02:34,903 --> 01:02:37,343
If she was so tired,
should she have been at work?

1112
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:40,663
That was my decision, sir.
And I stand by it.

1113
01:02:40,663 --> 01:02:43,103
It's easy enough to make judgments
in hindsight.

1114
01:02:43,103 --> 01:02:44,663
Anaemic evidently.

1115
01:02:44,663 --> 01:02:47,303
Taking a supplement
for iron deficiency.

1116
01:02:47,303 --> 01:02:49,423
Yes, she was tired.

1117
01:02:49,423 --> 01:02:51,903
Yes, she was under
a great deal of stress.

1118
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,663
But that's all there is to it.

1119
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:56,103
She made a mistake.
It does happen, Mr Foyle.

1120
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:58,463
There are munitions workers
all over the country

1121
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:00,783
missing fingers and worse.

1122
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:02,903
There's no way this
could be anything more

1123
01:03:02,903 --> 01:03:04,863
than a terrible accident.

1124
01:03:05,543 --> 01:03:08,823
She also mentioned something
about a theft.

1125
01:03:08,823 --> 01:03:10,743
What theft?

1126
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:12,983
First it's murder.
Now it's theft.

1127
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:15,383
There is no theft in this factory,
Mr Foyle.

1128
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:20,863
All the girls are searched for
anything metallic -

1129
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,783
hairpins, safety pins,
anything that might cause a spark.

1130
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:25,783
Cigarettes, lighters, matches too.

1131
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:28,823
On the way in and on the way out.

1132
01:03:28,823 --> 01:03:30,783
They're watched throughout the day.

1133
01:03:30,783 --> 01:03:33,463
We have passers,
over-lookers and inspectors.

1134
01:03:33,463 --> 01:03:35,783
So you have no idea what she meant?

1135
01:03:35,783 --> 01:03:37,223
Absolutely not.

1136
01:03:38,863 --> 01:03:41,903
Possible to speak to
a Hilda Greenwood?

1137
01:03:55,223 --> 01:03:57,063
Oh,

1138
01:03:57,063 --> 01:03:58,903
that was her handwriting.

1139
01:03:58,903 --> 01:04:00,703
What was inside it?

1140
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,623
It was empty.

1141
01:04:02,623 --> 01:04:04,583
"Jane Milner."

1142
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:07,143
She was the woman...

1143
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,703
That's right.
Oh, Lord!

1144
01:04:09,703 --> 01:04:13,503
They were friends evidently and
she got this just before she died.

1145
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,343
I don't understand
what you're saying, Mr Foyle.

1146
01:04:17,343 --> 01:04:19,183
I don't think I want to understand.

1147
01:04:19,183 --> 01:04:22,263
You thought Grace had been killed
deliberately. I never said that.

1148
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:23,863
Isn't that why you came to see me?

1149
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:26,943
She was frightened.
Isn't that what you said? Yes.

1150
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:28,983
About some stealing going on here.

1151
01:04:28,983 --> 01:04:30,823
That's what she said.

1152
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:32,503
But that's all she said.

1153
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:35,943
Oh, I wish I'd spent more time
with her now,

1154
01:04:35,943 --> 01:04:38,583
but you know how it is.
You're either late for your shift

1155
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,223
or you want to get out of here
as soon as you can.

1156
01:04:41,223 --> 01:04:43,223
I've told you everything I know.

1157
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:45,543
Right.

1158
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:48,503
Did you ever meet her boyfriend?
No.

1159
01:04:48,503 --> 01:04:51,023
Did she say anything about him?

1160
01:04:51,023 --> 01:04:54,103
She thought
he was going to marry her,

1161
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:55,583
silly little minx.

1162
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,983
There's one born every minute,
isn't there?

1163
01:04:57,983 --> 01:05:01,263
She used to say he was like
that actor in all those films.

1164
01:05:01,263 --> 01:05:04,383
You know. What's his name?
Jimmy someone.

1165
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:07,023
Stewart? Cagney.
Oh.

1166
01:05:07,023 --> 01:05:09,743
Yes, he hero-worships him.
That's what she said.

1167
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:12,423
She showed me his photo once.

1168
01:05:12,423 --> 01:05:14,063
A handsome enough devil.

1169
01:05:14,063 --> 01:05:17,143
He was the one who persuaded her
to come here, the war effort.

1170
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:19,903
All right for him.
He wasn't the one who got blown up.

1171
01:05:19,903 --> 01:05:21,983
He was at the funeral, wasn't he?

1172
01:05:21,983 --> 01:05:25,703
Yes, that's the only time
I ever saw him, really.

1173
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:27,703
I didn't like him.

1174
01:05:27,703 --> 01:05:30,743
There was something about him
that gave me the creeps.

1175
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:32,743
Don't suppose you know
where I can find him?

1176
01:05:32,743 --> 01:05:34,103
No.

1177
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:35,983
All she ever told me was his name.

1178
01:05:35,983 --> 01:05:37,583
And not even his full name.

1179
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,383
Harry.

1180
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:08,263
Hello!

1181
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:10,383
I'm sorry to bother you
but it's my car.

1182
01:06:12,543 --> 01:06:15,663
I wonder if you can help.
It seems I have a split radiator.

1183
01:06:15,663 --> 01:06:18,583
Oh, sorry.
I can't do nothing for you.

1184
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,943
This is a private garage
and we're full.

1185
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,503
Well, if you could seal it,
even briefly.

1186
01:06:23,503 --> 01:06:27,023
You see this is a police vehicle,
so it sort of takes priority.

1187
01:06:28,783 --> 01:06:31,063
You the police?
Yes.

1188
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,383
Do I know you from somewhere?

1189
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:39,703
I do, don't I?
You were at the funeral.

1190
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:42,343
You're Grace Phillips's friend.
What of it?

1191
01:06:42,343 --> 01:06:44,783
Well, you seemed so obviously upset.

1192
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:46,263
You were going to be married.

1193
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:47,783
Maybe.

1194
01:06:47,783 --> 01:06:49,423
I'm sorry.

1195
01:06:49,903 --> 01:06:52,303
Why was you there?

1196
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:54,703
Well, it is difficult to explain.

1197
01:06:54,703 --> 01:06:56,383
But you was there.

1198
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,343
And now you're here.

1199
01:06:58,863 --> 01:07:00,823
What's your game?

1200
01:07:00,823 --> 01:07:02,223
Nothing.

1201
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:04,063
I told you. My car's broken.

1202
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,663
Nice and convenient.

1203
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:07,823
I was near here
and I saw your garage first.

1204
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:10,863
But if you're too busy to mend it,
I'll take it elsewhere.

1205
01:07:10,863 --> 01:07:13,223
You're not going anywhere.
Now, wait a minute.

1206
01:07:13,223 --> 01:07:14,903
Harry? What's going on?
Trouble.

1207
01:07:14,903 --> 01:07:16,263
What?
She's a copper.

1208
01:07:16,263 --> 01:07:19,183
She's been following me.
No. I'm not, really.

1209
01:07:19,183 --> 01:07:20,743
I haven't, I promise you.

1210
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:22,223
Asking questions.

1211
01:07:22,223 --> 01:07:24,703
I just wanted to get my car mended.

1212
01:07:24,703 --> 01:07:27,343
Harry, she's got nothing to do
with us. Just let her go.

1213
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,783
We can't risk it.
What are you talking about?

1214
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:32,223
Oh, just shut your face!

1215
01:07:34,143 --> 01:07:36,223
Get out! Get out! Go, go!

1216
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:39,383
Out my way! Out! Get out!

1217
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:46,503
Harry, what have you done?

1218
01:07:49,423 --> 01:07:51,223
You bloody fool, Harry.

1219
01:07:51,223 --> 01:07:53,583
You shouldn't have got in the way.

1220
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:56,263
You shouldn't have got in the way.
You've hurt me.

1221
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,583
You've hurt me.

1222
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,591
You know, I went to see Mr Foyle.

1223
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:07,111
Why? Edie, you shouldn't have.

1224
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:10,191
I thought, I can't see
why he's doing this. He knows you.

1225
01:08:10,191 --> 01:08:11,871
He can't possibly think...

1226
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:13,551
He's only doing what he has to.

1227
01:08:13,551 --> 01:08:15,431
I'd do the same.

1228
01:08:15,431 --> 01:08:17,151
How do you think...?

1229
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:20,511
I mean, do you have any idea
how that blood got onto your shirt?

1230
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:22,111
I don't know.

1231
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:24,071
It has to be a mistake.

1232
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,351
Paul...

1233
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,751
Only that if you HAD killed her,
I could try to understand.

1234
01:08:30,751 --> 01:08:32,271
I mean...
No, Edie.

1235
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:33,791
You must never say that.

1236
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:34,831
Why?

1237
01:08:34,831 --> 01:08:36,871
Because murder is murder.

1238
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:40,351
I've met men like that,

1239
01:08:40,351 --> 01:08:42,991
and you must never believe,
even for a minute,

1240
01:08:42,991 --> 01:08:45,151
that I'm capable of that.

1241
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:48,671
I'm sorry.

1242
01:08:57,231 --> 01:09:00,231
Sir?
Is Sam back? No, sir.

1243
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:01,711
But Sergeant Milner's here,

1244
01:09:01,711 --> 01:09:03,831
and Mr Bradshawe's standing by.
Right.

1245
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:08,031
Ready for this?
If you think it'll help.

1246
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:09,951
I think it'll sort it out, don't you?

1247
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,751
Unless you'd rather...
No, sir.

1248
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:13,671
No, I want to do it.
Good.

1249
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:31,991
Mr Bradshawe, hello.

1250
01:09:31,991 --> 01:09:34,911
You understand what you've got to do?
Yes. I understand.

1251
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:37,031
Good. Take your time.

1252
01:09:37,031 --> 01:09:39,111
I understand what to do.
Good.

1253
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:13,631
(This is the man.)

1254
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,711
This is the man you saw in the alley?

1255
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:20,351
He was there.

1256
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:23,311
This is the man you saw
with the woman Jane Milner?

1257
01:10:23,311 --> 01:10:25,271
I'm sure it was him.

1258
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:31,671
Well, thank you, Mr Bradshawe.

1259
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:34,391
Would you be kind enough
to see Mr Bradshawe home?

1260
01:10:49,151 --> 01:10:51,631
He couldn't have seen me, sir.
I wasn't there.

1261
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,591
Mr Foyle.
Yeah?

1262
01:11:05,591 --> 01:11:08,711
Pardon my saying it, sir,
but you must have it wrong.

1263
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:10,431
Oh, yeah?

1264
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:14,031
Well, I haven't known Sergeant
Milner all that long, but...

1265
01:11:14,031 --> 01:11:17,391
a man less likely to murder his wife
is hard to imagine.

1266
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:18,791
Well, that's very helpful.

1267
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:22,231
Anything else you want to say before
I get you transferred? No, sir.

1268
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:24,271
Who did pick up Mr Bradshawe
from his home?

1269
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:26,111
Constable Peters, sir. As you asked.

1270
01:11:26,111 --> 01:11:28,111
I want to see him.
Right away, sir.

1271
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:32,231
Know why you're here?

1272
01:11:32,911 --> 01:11:34,951
No, sir.

1273
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:38,151
Well, it looks like
I'm going to need a new sergeant.

1274
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:39,991
Yes, sir. I suppose so.

1275
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:43,591
I understand you and Milner
trained together at Brighton.

1276
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,751
Joined the force about the same time.
He got promoted, you didn't.

1277
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:48,191
That's about right, sir.

1278
01:11:48,191 --> 01:11:51,431
Well, it's never too late.

1279
01:11:51,431 --> 01:11:53,551
Interested?

1280
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:55,311
To work with YOU, sir?

1281
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,671
Anyone would jump
at the opportunity.

1282
01:11:58,711 --> 01:12:01,951
I get the impression that

1283
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,351
you never liked Milner much, anyway.
Is that right?

1284
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,031
You want the truth, sir?

1285
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:07,991
Generally, I find it helps.

1286
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:11,071
I thought he was a bit hoity-toity.

1287
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:15,671
Yeah, he could be a bit unreasonable
sometimes, don't you think?

1288
01:12:15,671 --> 01:12:18,311
I mean that business
at the restaurant, for example.

1289
01:12:18,311 --> 01:12:21,311
I did think he came down on me
and the lads a bit much, sir.

1290
01:12:21,311 --> 01:12:24,951
You were only stealing food.
It was there for the taking.

1291
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:28,831
And he disciplined you and...um...

1292
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:32,111
..you thought you'd get
your own back?

1293
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:33,951
What do you mean, sir?

1294
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:36,271
Well, what I mean is...

1295
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:38,911
you picked Mr Bradshawe up,

1296
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,111
old, unreliable Mr Bradshawe,

1297
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:44,911
had bags of opportunity to describe
Milner to him,

1298
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:47,951
even perhaps help to point him out.

1299
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:52,671
No, sir. And it seems to me,
there are only two ways

1300
01:12:52,671 --> 01:12:56,111
that Milner's wife's blood
could have finished up on his shirt.

1301
01:12:56,111 --> 01:12:57,591
A) if he'd murdered her.

1302
01:12:57,591 --> 01:12:59,711
Well, that's...
And B)

1303
01:12:59,711 --> 01:13:01,671
if somebody had put it there.

1304
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,311
You brought the body in.

1305
01:13:07,311 --> 01:13:09,271
Not on my own, sir.

1306
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:10,951
You...

1307
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,911
searched his room.

1308
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:18,671
Look...

1309
01:13:18,671 --> 01:13:20,791
I never meant it to go this far.

1310
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:23,031
How far did you mean it to go?

1311
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,951
The hanging?
No, no, no, no.

1312
01:13:24,951 --> 01:13:26,831
It started as a prank. That's all.

1313
01:13:26,831 --> 01:13:29,391
He got at me, so I thought
I'd have one back on him.

1314
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:31,911
It was just a stupid joke.

1315
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,511
I just wanted to see him
sweat a bit.

1316
01:13:35,471 --> 01:13:38,391
But once it'd begun,
I couldn't stop it.

1317
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:42,431
I wasn't going to let him hang.
Of course I wasn't.

1318
01:13:45,951 --> 01:13:48,151
What are you going to do with me,
sir?

1319
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:54,031
You'll be charged with obstruction
and perverting the course of justice.

1320
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:56,311
For starters.

1321
01:13:57,111 --> 01:13:59,551
Would you be kind enough to leave
now, please?

1322
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:05,311
Sergeant Brooke!

1323
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:07,271
Mr Foyle, sir!

1324
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:10,551
He's mad, quite mad.

1325
01:14:25,071 --> 01:14:26,831
Sir.

1326
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:31,871
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

1327
01:14:33,351 --> 01:14:35,031
Who are you?

1328
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:37,031
Well, I'm a policeman. Who are you?

1329
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:38,631
This is my garage.

1330
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:41,711
I'm Neville Johnson.

1331
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:44,031
Was he like that when you found him?

1332
01:14:44,031 --> 01:14:45,591
That's a screwdriver.

1333
01:14:45,591 --> 01:14:47,071
Do you know him?
Of course I do.

1334
01:14:47,071 --> 01:14:49,791
That's Eric, Eric Clayton.
He worked for me.

1335
01:14:51,591 --> 01:14:53,191
This is...

1336
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:55,911
Harry done this, didn't he?
He did this to him. Did he?

1337
01:14:55,911 --> 01:15:00,031
I should have known. I never should
have employed the little bastard.

1338
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:01,511
Why's that?

1339
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:04,831
I always knew there was something
wrong with him. Sick in the head.

1340
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,711
A nasty piece of work.

1341
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:11,031
Did that have anything to do with
why he hadn't been called up?

1342
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:13,151
No, he said he was asthmatic.

1343
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:14,911
That's what he told me.

1344
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:18,351
I think... I think the forces
probably just took one look at him,

1345
01:15:18,351 --> 01:15:20,751
and decided
they could manage without him.

1346
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:22,671
I don't believe this.

1347
01:15:22,671 --> 01:15:24,471
I just don't believe this.

1348
01:15:24,471 --> 01:15:27,311
Where is he now?
Harry? Well...

1349
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:30,151
he gave me an address
on Helm Street,

1350
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,791
but he was never there.

1351
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:35,111
Spent most of his time
with his friend.

1352
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:37,671
Friend?
That girl, Grace Philips.

1353
01:15:38,991 --> 01:15:41,831
Of course
they were more than just friends.

1354
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:44,071
He thought I didn't know,

1355
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:46,631
but I had a good idea
what was going on in there.

1356
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:48,831
In where?

1357
01:15:48,831 --> 01:15:51,231
There was a flat at the back,
over the stables.

1358
01:15:51,231 --> 01:15:54,151
I mentioned to him and Eric
that I wanted to rent it out,

1359
01:15:54,151 --> 01:15:56,391
and the next thing I know
she appears out of nowhere.

1360
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:59,831
A munitions worker. Nice girl -
that's what I thought.

1361
01:16:01,231 --> 01:16:05,271
It was only later on that I realised
that they were together.

1362
01:16:05,271 --> 01:16:08,391
Of course by then, it was too late.

1363
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:10,111
But you let her stay?

1364
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,551
She paid the rent.

1365
01:16:11,551 --> 01:16:13,311
On the dot every week.

1366
01:16:13,311 --> 01:16:15,071
There was nothing wrong with her,

1367
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,591
except that she managed
to fall in with him.

1368
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,191
Can I see the flat?

1369
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:27,391
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1370
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:35,031
This is more or less
how she left it.

1371
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:38,831
I didn't quite know what to do
after she...

1372
01:16:40,071 --> 01:16:44,551
I thought a relation,
someone might come for her stuff.

1373
01:16:52,711 --> 01:16:54,511
What's that? Medicine?

1374
01:16:55,551 --> 01:16:57,671
I never knew she was ill.

1375
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:01,991
It's a supplement
for an iron deficiency.

1376
01:17:16,311 --> 01:17:18,391
That's his clobber.

1377
01:17:18,391 --> 01:17:20,071
Disgusting, ain't it?

1378
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:22,951
Young people nowadays,
they've got no sense of decency.

1379
01:17:22,951 --> 01:17:27,831
Well, I think she thought he was
going to marry her, didn't she?

1380
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:30,951
Well, I suppose he could turn on
the charm when he wanted to.

1381
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,311
After all, he fooled me.

1382
01:17:32,311 --> 01:17:33,711
When he first started work,

1383
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:35,911
I thought he was just
a good looking boy.

1384
01:17:40,591 --> 01:17:42,471
What's that you've got there?

1385
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:49,831
Ah, well,
that just goes to show you.

1386
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,911
That's exactly
what I was talking about.

1387
01:17:51,911 --> 01:17:53,831
I don't think
they were going to be used

1388
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:57,511
for what YOU think they were,
Mr Johnson.

1389
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:08,351
I'm sorry. We're closed.
Yes, I-I-I know.

1390
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,591
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to bother you.

1391
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:13,431
I just wondered whether I could...

1392
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:15,991
Well, the thing is...

1393
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,951
(SCREAMS)

1394
01:18:19,351 --> 01:18:22,271
I've already told you, Mr Foyle,
the last time you were here.

1395
01:18:22,271 --> 01:18:24,271
All the workers are searched.

1396
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:26,631
They're also scrutinised
every minute of the day.

1397
01:18:26,631 --> 01:18:29,191
Why do you need to ask again?
The last time I was here,

1398
01:18:29,191 --> 01:18:31,671
I wasn't aware she was involved
with a safebreaker.

1399
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:33,591
Really?
They shared a room together.

1400
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:36,751
We found wires, buttons,
tamping sticks, prophylactics.

1401
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:38,351
Condoms?

1402
01:18:38,351 --> 01:18:40,111
Condoms are filled with explosives

1403
01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:42,231
and placed between
the back of the door plate

1404
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:43,751
and the front of the lock cap.

1405
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:45,871
What he was short of
were the explosives.

1406
01:18:45,871 --> 01:18:47,751
You think they came from here?

1407
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:51,071
We do, through Grace. He might even
have been responsible for her death.

1408
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:53,671
He killed her? He couldn't have
got through the gate.

1409
01:18:53,671 --> 01:18:55,631
He wouldn't have needed to.

1410
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:02,991
What chemicals did she have access
to?

1411
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:07,071
Mainly cordite and TNT. Brought
from the storeroom over there.

1412
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:09,071
Everything measured and recorded.

1413
01:19:09,071 --> 01:19:10,831
Nothing else?

1414
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:13,431
We store a very small amount of
nitro-glycerine.

1415
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:14,951
Unstable. Horrible stuff.

1416
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,711
And that's putting it mildly.

1417
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:18,751
Assuming she could have got her
hands on it,

1418
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:21,951
she couldn't have smuggled it out of
here without blowing herself up.

1419
01:19:21,951 --> 01:19:24,191
She could have used a stabiliser.

1420
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:26,391
Still too dangerous.

1421
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,351
Right, well, thank you.

1422
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,991
Incidentally,
Grace Phillips's mother? Yes?

1423
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:35,871
The mother you took a collection for.

1424
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,151
What about her?
She's been dead 15 years.

1425
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,991
Is that true?

1426
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,391
How much did you collect?

1427
01:19:45,991 --> 01:19:47,951
Answer the question.

1428
01:19:49,311 --> 01:19:51,111
About 18.

1429
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:53,391
And you kept it?

1430
01:19:57,871 --> 01:20:00,591
Well, thanks again.
I'll leave you with that one.

1431
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,759
Sir, we got a call saying banging
had been heard coming from the bank.

1432
01:20:22,759 --> 01:20:24,519
I can't get hold of the manager.

1433
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,279
Incidentally, this is the bank

1434
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,519
that handles
the munitions factory payroll.

1435
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:31,279
A call from whom?
The solicitors at the back.

1436
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:33,199
Not the hairdresser?
No, sir.

1437
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:34,919
Have you been in there?

1438
01:20:34,919 --> 01:20:36,399
No, sir, not yet.

1439
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:38,119
Is it open?

1440
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:40,679
I don't think so. There doesn't seem
to be anybody there.

1441
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:42,359
Not even Mrs...?

1442
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:44,119
Mrs Summersgill, no.

1443
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,999
Do we know where Harry Osborne is?

1444
01:20:48,999 --> 01:20:50,799
No. sir, we don't.

1445
01:20:50,799 --> 01:20:52,759
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1446
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:58,239
Isn't this the place
where your wife used to work?

1447
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,199
And Grace.

1448
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,119
This is to do with the explosives,
isn't it, sir?

1449
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:05,599
Possibly. We should take a look.

1450
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:07,559
I don't mind going in, sir.
Neither do I.

1451
01:21:07,559 --> 01:21:10,839
Perhaps this isn't the best time
for you and Mrs... Summersgill.

1452
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:12,879
True.

1453
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:15,679
Sir, if he is in there, why don't
we wait until he's finished,

1454
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,479
and arrest him when he comes out?

1455
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:20,719
That'd be fine, if we knew for a fact
that she wasn't in there.

1456
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,199
Who the hell are you?

1457
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,679
I'm a policeman.

1458
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,759
How'd you find me?

1459
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:55,999
I came through that hole in the wall.

1460
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:58,519
Has Eric bought it?

1461
01:22:58,519 --> 01:22:59,919
He has.

1462
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:02,479
Then they'll hang me, won't they?
Perhaps.

1463
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:05,919
You on your tod?

1464
01:23:05,919 --> 01:23:07,519
Well...

1465
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:11,639
you like gangster films, don't you?
Isn't that right? Yeah.

1466
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:14,039
You probably know the answer
to that question.

1467
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:17,839
(AMERICAN ACCENT) You've got
the place surrounded. Yup.

1468
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:20,519
You think I'm going to give myself
up? There's just you.

1469
01:23:20,519 --> 01:23:24,439
Are you going to make me or
do you think you can talk me out,

1470
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:26,119
make me see reason?

1471
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:28,039
Well, you're wrong.

1472
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:32,879
Do you know what this is?
Tell me.

1473
01:23:32,879 --> 01:23:35,279
It's nitro-glycerine.
I smash this, we all die.

1474
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:37,079
What do you say about that, copper?

1475
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:38,719
Did Grace get that for you?

1476
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,479
That's right.

1477
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:42,199
How did she do that?
It was easy.

1478
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:45,879
They thought they were so clever
at the factory with all their narks.

1479
01:23:45,879 --> 01:23:47,879
She said she'd never be able
to do it,

1480
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:51,479
but in the end she just walked into
the storeroom in her lunch break.

1481
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:53,479
No-one was there.

1482
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:55,639
She'd have been searched,
wouldn't she?

1483
01:23:55,639 --> 01:23:58,639
She sewed a little pocket
in her dress. In the hem. Right.

1484
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,159
Nobody looked there. It was easy!
(WHIMPERS)

1485
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:02,799
Shut up!

1486
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:06,759
They will hang me, won't they?

1487
01:24:08,879 --> 01:24:11,279
Yeah, they will.

1488
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,679
This is faster.

1489
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,639
We all go together. And it's fun!

1490
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,519
I take a copper with me.

1491
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:22,599
There is something
I'd quite like to know.

1492
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:25,159
You'd like to know.
What would you like to know?

1493
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:28,239
How you killed her.
Gracie?

1494
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,999
Mm. You put something in
her medicine, didn't you?

1495
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,519
Strychnine, wasn't it?
Who told you that?

1496
01:24:33,519 --> 01:24:35,079
Well, you left it in the glass.

1497
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:37,199
Well, yeah.

1498
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,839
That's right, Mr Policeman.
But it was rat poison.

1499
01:24:39,839 --> 01:24:43,439
Right.
So you got her to steal this stuff?

1500
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:45,079
Yeah.

1501
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:46,959
And she got frightened?

1502
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,279
She got cold feet.

1503
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:51,359
"Don't do it, Harry.
You mustn't do it.

1504
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:53,159
We don't need the money."

1505
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:56,359
But I wanted to do it,
so I made her get me the stuff.

1506
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:57,839
I mean,

1507
01:24:57,839 --> 01:25:00,679
why do you think I was walking out
with her in the first place?

1508
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,359
Right. What, so she...she stole it

1509
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:05,919
and then had second thoughts?

1510
01:25:06,839 --> 01:25:09,879
Yeah, she asked me to give it back
or get rid of it.

1511
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:11,959
I knew she was going to tell
someone.

1512
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:14,479
I did it like you said.

1513
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:16,479
I poisoned her.

1514
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:20,439
I thought she'd have croaked it
before she even got to the factory,

1515
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:21,919
but...

1516
01:25:21,919 --> 01:25:24,119
that wasn't how it happened, was it?

1517
01:25:25,559 --> 01:25:28,319
You must admit
it's the perfect murder. (LAUGHS)

1518
01:25:29,519 --> 01:25:31,039
She blew herself up.

1519
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:34,679
I couldn't believe it when I heard.

1520
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:36,319
All the evidence gone.

1521
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:38,999
No dead body for you
to poke around with. Nothing.

1522
01:25:39,879 --> 01:25:42,239
But then that was Gracie for you.

1523
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:46,039
She was always very considerate.

1524
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:48,199
But she wrote the letter.

1525
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:50,079
You like it all neat, don't you?

1526
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:52,319
Dot the I-s and cross the T-s.

1527
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:54,639
How long have you been a copper?

1528
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,839
Yeah.

1529
01:25:56,839 --> 01:25:59,079
Some old friend of hers.
I didn't know that

1530
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:01,599
until that interfering bitch
came to the garage.

1531
01:26:01,599 --> 01:26:03,679
She had a letter
and she knew all about me.

1532
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,399
And then suddenly Grace is dead,

1533
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:08,999
and she thinks I've got something
to do with it. She threatened me.

1534
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:11,279
You know what?

1535
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:14,519
I followed her into town
and then I hit her with a brick.

1536
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,679
I killed her.

1537
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,719
I took the letter
and that was that, you know.

1538
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:36,599
Grace shouldn't have written to her,
you know?

1539
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:38,839
It was stupid of her.

1540
01:26:38,839 --> 01:26:40,879
If it hadn't been for Grace,

1541
01:26:40,879 --> 01:26:42,919
then I wouldn't have had
to touch her.

1542
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:48,399
Is there...er...
anything else you want to know?

1543
01:26:50,759 --> 01:26:52,759
No. I think that about covers it.

1544
01:26:52,759 --> 01:26:54,839
Yeah. I think you're right.

1545
01:26:55,999 --> 01:26:57,359
You know, it's funny, really.

1546
01:26:59,879 --> 01:27:02,479
When your friends come in,
they're not going to know

1547
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:05,559
which is you and which is me
and which is her.

1548
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:09,159
There's just going to be pieces,
and in the end,

1549
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:11,119
they'll have to bury us together.

1550
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:16,679
For ever

1551
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:18,199
and ever.

1552
01:27:24,559 --> 01:27:26,759
Grace.

1553
01:27:26,759 --> 01:27:28,719
Oh, Grace.

1554
01:27:29,759 --> 01:27:31,719
You lying bitch.

1555
01:27:32,519 --> 01:27:34,479
Nice sense of humour, though.

1556
01:27:38,599 --> 01:27:41,199
Thank you. Thank you.

1557
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,479
So it was just glycerine.

1558
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,959
It was, coloured.
Nothing nitro about it.

1559
01:27:57,959 --> 01:27:59,999
Did you know that?

1560
01:27:59,999 --> 01:28:02,959
Well, she couldn't have got
the real stuff out of the factory.

1561
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:04,639
A) The searches were too rigorous

1562
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,159
and B) if she had,
she'd have blown herself up.

1563
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:10,279
But she had to give him something
to keep him sweet.

1564
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:12,479
As soon as she did
she knew she was in trouble,

1565
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:14,799
and that's perhaps when
she wrote to your wife.

1566
01:28:14,799 --> 01:28:16,239
And he killed her.

1567
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,759
I'm sorry.

1568
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:21,479
This whole thing - trying to rob
a bank, all the killing.

1569
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:25,239
He was completely off his rocker.
It seems so. Anyway, thank you.

1570
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:26,719
For what?

1571
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,439
For finding him.

1572
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:30,759
Well, it was just an accident.

1573
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:33,119
Well, your accidents
are very helpful.

1574
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:36,119
Are they, sir? I'll have to arrange
some more, then.

1575
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:39,679
And you also helped confirm
that Grace's mother was dead.

1576
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,639
Did I?

1577
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:44,359
Well, all I knew was
that she wasn't at the funeral.

1578
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:47,399
Surviving mothers tend to turn up
to their daughters' funerals,

1579
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:49,119
don't they?

1580
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:50,839
Yes,

1581
01:28:50,839 --> 01:28:53,039
of course they do.

1582
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:03,479
Is it true?

1583
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:05,479
Is it over?

1584
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:07,439
Thank God.

1585
01:29:08,759 --> 01:29:11,879
You know I would have stood by you.
Whatever.

1586
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:17,959
I know.

1587
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:43,359
Brookie!

1588
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:47,759
The turkey!
I know, Miss Stewart.

1589
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:50,519
What happened to it?
I wish I could tell you.

1590
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:53,399
But Mr Foyle's gone up the wall,
and he was asking for YOU.

1591
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:55,079
He doesn't think I took it, does he?

1592
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:56,719
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

1593
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,319
But I can tell you, he had steam
coming out of his ears.

1594
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:00,879
And he's looking for me?

1595
01:30:00,879 --> 01:30:03,199
He said you were to see him
the moment you came in.

1596
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:15,039
Sir.
Yeah.

1597
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:17,559
I want you to know that
I had nothing whatsoever to do

1598
01:30:17,559 --> 01:30:19,439
with the disappearance
of the turkey.

1599
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:21,359
I know.
I don't know who took it.

1600
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:23,599
And I've no idea
why they left a photograph.

1601
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:26,599
You know?

1602
01:30:26,599 --> 01:30:28,559
The photograph is the evidence.

1603
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:31,079
I don't understand, sir.

1604
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:34,719
In the circumstances I thought, much
as you did, what a waste of a turkey.

1605
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,799
So I rang the local magistrate.

1606
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:39,039
And he said we could eat it?

1607
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:40,439
No, he didn't say that.

1608
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:42,959
He did say he'd give us
special dispensation

1609
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:45,519
to use the photograph as evidence.

1610
01:30:45,519 --> 01:30:48,719
So who is going to eat it?

1611
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:52,799
Well, I thought we'd offer it to
the children, the local evacuees.

1612
01:30:52,799 --> 01:30:54,799
That's a terribly good idea, sir.

1613
01:30:54,799 --> 01:30:57,359
Well, I'm glad you think so.
The magistrate seemed to.

1614
01:30:57,359 --> 01:30:59,759
Would you mind driving it round?
Not at all.

1615
01:30:59,759 --> 01:31:02,239
KNOCK AT DOOR
Yup.

1616
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:03,879
You manage that?

1617
01:31:03,879 --> 01:31:05,759
Absolutely.

1618
01:31:05,759 --> 01:31:08,799
Here we are, sir.
All plucked and ready for the oven.

1619
01:31:08,799 --> 01:31:10,319
My mum's old recipe.
Right.

1620
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:12,639
It was a bit tricky
stuffing it without any onions.

1621
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,679
They...erm...

1622
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,079
also hoped
you'd be able to join them.

1623
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:18,439
When?

1624
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,479
Tomorrow, lunch?

1625
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:22,519
Well, that would be wonderful, sir.

1626
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:27,599
The evacuees.
I had them in mind, really.

1627
01:31:27,599 --> 01:31:29,079
All the time.

1628
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:43,959
CHURCH BELL CHIMES
You hear that?

1629
01:31:43,959 --> 01:31:46,119
They're ringing the bells again.

1630
01:31:47,319 --> 01:31:49,559
It's all over for Hitler.
He's finished!

1631
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,079
Happy Christmas!
And you.

1632
01:32:08,959 --> 01:32:11,999
From now on, you work for me.

1633
01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:13,359
Sabotage?

1634
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:15,319
That's right.

1635
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:19,439
What happened?

1636
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:22,559
You've made a mistake.
It's you who's made a mistake.

1637
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:26,039
We'll make this the last one.

1638
01:32:54,999 --> 01:32:57,039
