00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,500
Colonel, look, I never
practiced civilian law.

150
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,508
Military law either, to any extent.

151
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,010
You have your ribbons. There's a war on.

152
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,343
Willisten, Goode and Honeysett
don't amount to a row of beans.

153
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,349
<i>A Purple Heart and a Silver
Star do. That's impressive.</i>

154
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,284
<i>I tell you, I could have
used you as the trial officer.</i>

155
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,845
Well, it's my understanding that it makes no
difference who's prosecuting and defending.

156
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,017
In terms of a conviction, you're right.

157

<i>There's too much talk that Winston will
hang because our British cousins want it.</i>

158
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,330
<i>Sure, they want it. They've got every right.</i>

159
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,495
Sure, it's important. The unity
of the theater is important.

160
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,370
But more important is the fact
that this man is a murderer...

161
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,375
and he will die because
murder cannot be tolerated.

162
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,879
<i>- Right?
- Well, I am the defense counsel.</i>

163
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,881
Indeed you are, sir.

164
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,441
And I'm looking to you to acquire
a thorough knowledge of the case.

165
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,454
Your client is waiting
for you. Go and see him.

Remember that I am always at your disposal.

Feel free to use the department in any
way that you wish. We're here to serve.

168

Remember, Barney, we have
been with this for weeks.

169
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,699
Now, there's nothing we want more than to
finish with it and wipe the slate clean...

170
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,705
so that the whole world can
look at this case and say...

171
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,207
"There, by God, is due process of the law. "

172

Do you play golf? The British
have a very good club here.

173
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,371
My name is Adams.

174
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,930
I've been appointed your defense counsel.

175
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,535
On your feet, Winston.

176

[Clicks Tongue] Big deal.

181
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,735
You won't get any medals
for defending me, Colonel.

182
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,971
Medals or not, you've agreed
to me as your defense counsel.

183
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,569
I would have agreed to a gorilla
being my defense counsel, Colonel.

184
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,742
Look, Winston, I've got four days
in which to prepare your case.

185
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,253
I've got a lot of people to
see and a lot of papers to read.

186
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,619
So when I walk in here,
you cut out the wisecracks.

187
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,885
When I ask a question, you answer it. Right?

188
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,825
- Do you really want to help me, Colonel?
- That's what I'm here for.

189
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,272
Every morning, when they
bring in my breakfast...

190
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,274
I ask for rye bread.

191
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,277
Every morning they bring in whole wheat.

192
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,746
Could you do something about that, Colonel?

193
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,481
You're a great comedian, Winston.
Unfortunately, I have no sense of humor.

getting through to him.

297
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:39,262
Our job was simply to establish that
he could distinguish right from wrong.

298
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,764
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, anything you remember, Colonel.

299
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:44,266
After all, you did head
the lunacy commission.

300
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:47,463
Oh, he was uncouth. He was
un-officer-like. Uncooperative.

301
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:50,473
You must realize, Colonel,
that lunacy boards are-

302
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,975
Well, perhaps "normal" is the wrong word.

303
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,978
But let me say that they are
not unusual in this theater.

304
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:58,981
We have men cracking up every
day, one way and another.

305
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,983
You asked for an impression.

306
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:04,487
My only impression is that there was no
reason to send Winston to this hospital.

307
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,489
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir!

308
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,390
I suppose somebody was just playing it safe.

309
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,425
I don't want to waste your time.

310
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,933
Can you remember who recommended
Lt. Winston to the lunacy board?

311
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,935
Well, again, it's difficult.

312
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,437
My psychiatrists are shipping
people over to me every day.

313
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:24,963
I'm afraid they're trying to make a
schizophrenic out of every case of battle fatigue.

314
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,943
- Yes, Nurse?
- From Dr. Kaufman.

315
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,037
Hello.

316
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:36,251
Thank you, Nurse.

317
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,255
I could check through my records, I suppose.

318
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,757
That probably won't be necessary, Colonel.

319
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:45,090
I'm going to see Winston again today.
We'll just see how it turns out.

320
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:48,097
I don't envy you your job defending that man.

321
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:51,362
- It's an assignment, sir.
- I apologize for being so busy.

322
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:54,370
- Is there anything else I can tell you?
- I shouldn't think so.

323
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:57,373
- Sorry to have intruded.
- I'm afraid I haven't been much help.

324
00:22:57,441 --> 00:23:00,933
If there's anything further I can do, please
call me. We can find some time together.

325
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,740
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

326
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:14,787
Colonel Adams.

327
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:16,917
I know your name too. Kate Davray.

328
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:19,519
They didn't tell me you were a
nurse, or I'd have reported sick.

329
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,588
- You are defending Winston?
- Yeah.

330
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:24,600
Colonel Burton knows very
well who examined Winston.

331
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:28,160
It was Dr. Kaufman, the head of
psychiatry. I was there. I work for him.

332
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:31,036
Then, getting down to cases, will
he let you have the evening off?

333
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:33,042
Major Kaufman found Winston insane.

334
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,101
Don't take any notice of Colonel Burton.

335
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,114
<i>He hasn't got anything like
Dr. Kaufman's qualifications.</i>

336
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:40,309
He's the commanding officer.
That gives him qualifications.

337
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:43,319
I don't like it when men like
Leo Kaufman get shoved around.

338
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:47,517
What you're telling me is, a major had a
run-in with a colonel, and the colonel won.

339
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:50,116
Colonels usually do, you
know. Now, how about dinner?

340
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:53,319
No, thank you. I'm busy.

341
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:03,298
Take it easy, soldier. The
first 10 miles are the roughest.

342
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:17,846
We're right outside, Colonel.

343
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,912
Thank you, Sergeant.

344
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,955
<i>Oh. Come in. Uh, Colonel Adams?</i>

345
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,020
Please sit down.

346
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:31,894
I'm, uh, sorry I blew my stack yesterday.

347
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:35,097
Uh, a place like this makes you like that.

348
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,106
Forget it.

349
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:41,235
- Like I said, I'm just here to help you.
- You can't help me, Colonel.

350
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:44,872
I can defend you in court. No matter what
you did, you're entitled to a fair trial.

351
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:48,247
I killed a man, Colonel. They
say there's no defense for that.

352
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:50,445
Why did you do it?

353
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:53,456
You wouldn't believe me.

354
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,287
<i>Try me.</i>

355
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,463
Colonel, do you know what
this war is all about?

356
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,531
I've got a couple of theories, yeah.

357
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:13,542
They'd be wrong, believe me.

358
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,478
<i>The war is nothing. It's what's
going to happen after that counts.</i>

359
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:19,948
It's going to start right here in Asia.

360
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:23,316
East against West, black against white.

361
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,750
Suppose we put the political discussions
aside for the moment and get down to cases.

362
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,763
All right then.

363
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,765
Sergeant Quinn was not on our side.

364
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,768
He was on the other. He was a bad influence.

365
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:42,237
He was spreading sedition.
He was altogether an evil man.

366
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:45,673
He'd sit and spout democracy.

367
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,677
Then he'd go out.

368
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:49,508
Where'd he go?

369
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,515
Up into the hills. One
of those native villages.

370
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,881
He had women up there.

371
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:57,887
Black women. I saw him!

372
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:01,322
And then he'd come back and tell
us about this brave new world...

373
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:04,827
that he and his black brothers were
going to make after the war was over.

374
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:08,456
Well, I mean, Colonel, I could
just take so much of that.

375
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,934
Winston, it's my experience...

376
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,436
that a man rarely kills for an ideal.

377
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:17,702
Didn't you have some personal
reason for killing Quinn?

378
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:23,169
You haven't listened to one
word I've said, have you?

379
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:26,182
I'm just trying to understand you.

380
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,684
You know, men like you make me sick.

381
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:32,688
You're so busy at acting the
hero and winning your war...

382
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:37,352
and scrambling up your lattice for promotion,
you can't see further than the next rung!

383
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:40,555
You make me wanna throw up!

384
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,830
Is there anything else you'd
like to tell me, Lieutenant?

385
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,571
Winston!

386
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,446
Sergeant!

387
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,891
You can send for me anytime you need me.

388
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:25,097
<i>[Keys Jingling In Lock]</i>

389
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:29,101
## [Whistling]

390
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,690
- Take me to the hospital.
- Again?

391
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:43,919
Yes, again.

392
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:54,270
<i>[Woman On P.A.] Dr. Frank.</i>

393
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:58,708
Nurse, can you tell me where I can
find Dr. Kaufman's office, please?

394
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:01,710
- Uh, last hut on the left, Colonel.
- Thank you.

395
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:06,715
<i>[Woman On P.A.] Calling Dr. Frank.</i>

396
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:10,310
<i>Please go to Colonel
Hale's office immediately.</i>

397
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:14,123
<i>- Major Kaufman?
- Colonel.</i>

398
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,455
My name's Barney Adams.

399
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:18,960
<i>Mind if I ask you a few questions?</i>

400
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,398
Let me say at once that Nurse Davray had
no authority to introduce my name to you.

401
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,935
No authority whatever.

402
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:28,494
I don't need any authorities,
Major. I have my own.

403
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:36,405
Very well then. In what way can I help you?

404
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,414
You examined Winston, right?

405
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:41,007
<i>- Mm-hmm. - Why was he brought
here in the first place?</i>

406
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,018
It was a formality.

407
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,953
He killed a man in cold blood
and, apparently, without reason.

408
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:49,117
<i>- Obviously, he had to be examined.
- What were your conclusions?</i>

409
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:51,990
That is confidential.

410
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:54,496
Major...

411
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:57,499
I am the defense counsel on a murder trial.

412
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,001
Admittedly, you don't have to talk now.

413
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,733
But I can order you to appear before me
and tell me everything I want to know.

414
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:07,607
- So why don't we discuss this like sensible people?
- There's nothing to discuss.

415
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:12,012
I wrote a report on Winston's condition
which my C.O. found unacceptable.

416
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:15,813
<i>I know you wrote a report. I want
to know what was in that report.</i>

417
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,455
Colonel, for a senior officer...

418
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:22,617
you seem to know very
little about army protocol.

419
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,958
I wrote a report on
Winston which was rejected.

420
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:30,557
<i>I was ordered to discharge him
from the hospital, and I refused.</i>

421
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:33,569
From that point on, he was
no longer my responsibility.

422
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,571
He is not my responsibility now.

423
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,630
Colonel, you must see my commanding officer.

424
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,699
I'll see your commanding officer in due time.

425
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:41,710
Right now, I want that report.

426
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:43,746
I am unable to give it to you.

427
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:46,146
Oh, Major, have I got news for you.

428
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:49,151
You're able to give me anything I want.

429
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:57,917
<i>Very well then. I've been
ordered not to give it to you.</i>

430
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,096
Are you telling me that Colonel Burton...

431
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:03,257
has forbidden you to give me that report?

432
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:07,666
Let's say he advised me not to.

433
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:12,107
Let's say I'm demanding it! There is no
document in this theater which I cannot obtain!

434
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:15,576
Why? What good would it do? You
can't save Winston. I can't save him.

435
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:18,842
You know he's got to hang. So why don't
you just leave me alone and go away?

436
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:22,248
Major, I'm ordering you
to give me that report.

437
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,253
Colonel Adams.

438
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,653
Would you excuse us, Nurse?

439
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:36,389
Colonel Adams, if you wish to
interview members of my staff...

440
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:39,401
I'd take it as a courtesy
if you'd see me first.

441
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,528
This happens to be my office, Colonel.

442
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:43,869
It happens to be my hospital, Major.

443
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,775
If you wish to interview Major Kaufman,
I'll ask you to do it on his own time.

444
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:51,279
Colonel Burton, I am the defending officer...

445
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:54,044
in the trial for a man's life.

446
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:57,052
I don't know what your

00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:29,821
Doesn't surprise me a bit.
How about wine? You like wine?

595
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,968
Here is a copy of it.

596
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:36,971
I took it from the confidential file.

597
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,973
Well, then you're an idiot.

598
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,442
Are you some kind of kleptomaniac? You
take that right back where you found it.

599
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,138
Aren't you going to read it?

600
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:48,349
It's a carbon copy.

601
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:51,352
It's unsigned, it's
unauthorized and it's stolen.

602
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,787
I'd look pretty funny bringing
that up in court, wouldn't I?

603
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:56,950
Why? Would it harm your career?

604
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:59,960
Oh, come on, honey. I've
got my own conscience.

605
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:01,962
I don't need yours too.

bad army dragon, that's okay by me.

607
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,669
But just let me do my job my way. Huh?

608
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:10,671
Now, it's been a long, hard day.

Oh, there you are, sir.

615
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:46,140
We got a message from Captain Gunther.

616
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,644
He forgot to tell you there's a press
conference on Sunday at 12:00 noon.

617
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:52,646
Incidentally, Colonel, how'd
you make out with Kaufman?

618
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,648
Lieutenant...

619

an annex to the officers' mess.

you will go out and get it at the proper time.

621
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:04,683
- Yes, sir.
- How do you get to Bachree?

622
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,423
- Bachree, sir?
- You heard me the first time.

You're in charge of arrangements, Lieutenant.

626
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,930
Why are we going?

627
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,576
How many witnesses do we have in Bachree?

628
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:25,579
Eleven, sir. But they're all prosecution
witnesses. They all saw the murder.

629
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:28,275
Frankly, I think we'd be wasting our time.

630
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,341
I'm not telling you to think, Lieutenant.

631
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,353
Eleven witnesses. That's
11 different stories.

632
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:35,356
I want every statement checked
against every other statement.

633
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:37,358
I want every discrepancy examined.

<i>And that is the day's work.</i>

If you say so, Colonel. We'll
just be going through the motions.

636
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,793
All right, so we'll go through the motions!

Gentlemen, back to work. It's not the king's
birthday or the Fourth ofJuly, you know.

643
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:17,056
- Which hand did he have the gun
in? - His right hand- No, left-

644
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:20,397
You saw him fire the gun, yet you
can't remember what hand he held it in.

645
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:23,404
Well, I don't see it makes much
difference. He still shot him.

646
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:25,406
He's got a point there.

647

Now, according to the diagram here...

What the hell are you talking about?

658
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,009
Are you responsible for all
this kerfuffling about out here?

00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:15,523
- That I am, Major.
- Well, you might have given us a bit of warning.

00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,526
I've got three hellholes like
this division before nightfall...

damn-all between every one of them.

- Sorry, sir.
- Ah, well, we'll scrub round it.

Now you're here, you'd better
have a quick one. This way.

Don't be alarmed. It's gin.

667
00:43:41,516 --> 00:43:45,953
I have to go to great lengths to
outwit these thieving nits up here.

00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:48,615
Sorry if I was a bit sharpish over there.

I don't mind you wasting your own time...

670

amiss when people waste mine.

- Water?
- No. I'll take it neat.

672
00:43:56,698 --> 00:44:00,464
What makes you think I'm wasting my time?

673
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:03,003
Well, it's a bit of a farce, isn't it?

674
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:06,470
You been out here long?

675
00:44:09,578 --> 00:44:11,603
Do you know Winston well?

676
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,911
As well as I know anyone here.

677
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,917
I'm up at supply headquarters.

678
00:44:16,985 --> 00:44:20,421
This is only one of half a
dozen stations on my parish.

679
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:22,582
But I spoke to him occasionally.

680
00:44:22,658 --> 00:44:25,593
To tell you the truth, I
had developed the habit...

681
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:28,789
of nipping very smartly round the
side of the huts when I saw him coming.

682
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:32,197
- Completely off his chump, you know.
- What do you mean?

683
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,235
Why, he's crackers.

684
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:37,237
<i>You know that.</i>

685
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:39,739
I've never heard of a murderer yet...

686
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:42,072
but someone didn't say he was crazy.

687
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:44,078
<i>Look, Major, I'm not a doctor.</i>

688
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:47,240
<i>I'm not even a lawyer. I'm just a soldier.</i>

689
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:50,773
The only thing I do know is that
Winston is a confessed murderer.

690
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:54,413
Well, you're defending him, ducky.

691
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:58,425
Why not? You've got to go
through the motions, haven't you?

692
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,927
- Now, wait a minute-
- Oh, come off it.

693
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,861
I know the score.

694
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:05,866
You can plead anything for
Winston except insanity...

695
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:09,370
because if he's insane,
he's not guilty, right?

696
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:12,566
But he's got to be found
guilty, because he's got to hang.

697
00:45:12,641 --> 00:45:14,632
And he's got to hang...

698
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:20,073
if only to save the American command
from a good deal of embarrassment.

699
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:23,083
He's got to hang because he's a murderer.

700
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,119
He's mad, all the same.

701
00:45:25,187 --> 00:45:28,588
The man's a paranoiac. He's
an incurable psychopath.

702
00:45:29,825 --> 00:45:32,259
What are your qualifications for saying that?

703
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:34,454
I'm a psychiatrist.

704
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:37,089
Then what are you doing in a dump like this?

705
00:45:37,165 --> 00:45:39,599
You may well ask.

706
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:42,603
I happened to take the view
that a certain liaison officer...

707
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:45,606
was too sick to resume his duties.

708
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:48,609
They happened to need a
liaison officer at that time...

709
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:50,611
more than they needed a psychiatrist.

710
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:53,273
So here I am, inspecting nether portions.

711
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:56,840
At the suggestion, I may
say, of the American command.

712
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:59,682
I take it you don't like Americans.

713
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:02,053
Oh, I can take 'em or leave 'em.

714
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:05,059
<i>You seem to have all the
clever answers, Major.</i>

715
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:09,393
If you're so sure that Winston is insane,
why haven't you come forward and said so?

716
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:11,728
Well, why the hell should I?

717
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,295
I was told pointedly enough it was none of my
business when I sent him down to the hospital.

718
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:22,071
I have been specially ordered to keep
my nose out of it all, and that I'll do.

719
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:26,080
If you want to prove him insane, there's someone
down there that can do it in five minutes.

720
00:46:26,148 --> 00:46:28,139
Kaufman. Go and see Kaufman.

721
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:32,916
When did you last see Winston?

722
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:36,253
The night of the murder, as they say.

723
00:46:36,324 --> 00:46:40,260
I was called over to see if I could
do anything for poor old Quinn.

724
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:43,263
Winston had rather sensibly
retired to his hut...

725
00:46:43,331 --> 00:46:45,663
and there were about four bods guarding him.

726
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:47,929
Did you talk to him?

727
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:51,166
Yes, I did, and a ruddy
difficult job it was too.

728
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:54,174
He simply sat there staring in front of him.

729
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:57,871
<i>However, eventually he began to talk.</i>

730
00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:00,437
<i>- What about?
- Oh, the usual junk.</i>

731
00:47:00,515 --> 00:47:03,973
All about the teeming millions
plotting to overthrow the world.

732
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:06,043
Surely he's mentioned it.

733
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,383
- He talk about Quinn?
- No, he seemed to have forgotten all about Quinn.

734
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:17,064
I can tell you why he killed him,
if that's what's worrying you.

735
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:19,336
<i>- Major Kensington.
- Yes, Corporal?</i>

736
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,734
- Reporting sick, sir.
- Go inside, would you?

737
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,770
You see, there's no British
officer here in Bachree.

738
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:30,904
As senior British N.C.O., Quinn had
roughly the same responsibilities...

739
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,380
as Winston had as an American officer.

740
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,441
This always nettled Winston.

741
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:38,749
He held that there was some
mysterious plot afoot...

742
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,814
to keep him from a more responsible job.

743
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,916
Perfectly true, of course.

744
00:47:43,993 --> 00:47:45,984

I'm your counsel, Winston.
You said you trusted me.

to Kaufman, weren't you?

- He does it.

- Nah. Poor fellow's crazy.

I suppose you think it's a
little late for that, huh?

<i>[Man] Hey, keep it down, huh?</i>

I'm not asking, Major. I'm ordering you.

You can order me to appear...

01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,833
but you can't order me to
give the testimony you want.

Look, buster, unless you can pull rank
on me-  and I'm a lieutenant colonel-

978
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:51,614
you just stick a pillow over your head.

Are you prepared to see him hang?

980
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:56,553
Look, I've done all that I could do.

981
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,617
When Burton asked me to
declare Winston sane, I refused.

982
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,629
I didn't have to refuse.

983
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:04,165
I just couldn't sign that paper.

984
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:07,133
And what happened? I'm a senior psychiatrist.

pills in the middle of the jungle.

Now you want me to go even
further. You tell me why.

987
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:18,807
Because you're a doctor. Because
you're the only man who can save him.

01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,212
[Scoffs, Sighs]

01:05:21,283 --> 01:05:23,683
Look.

990
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:27,586
The other day, Winston asked me if
I knew what this war was all about.

991
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:30,352
I'm sure he's asked you the same question.

992
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:34,418
Well, right now...

993
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:38,091
this war is all about a man named Winston.

994
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,828
It's, uh
- It's easy to fight for the innocent.

995
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:44,235
But when you fight for the sick,
for the warped, for the lost...

996
01:05:44,306 --> 01:05:46,365
then you've had justice.

[Sighs]

998
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,708
It's a big word, I know. It is, you know.

999
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,771
Bigger than my career.

1000
01:05:55,283 --> 01:05:57,410
Bigger than yours.

1001
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:04,952
- What time do you want me there?
- 11:00 a. m.

1002
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:10,562
I've got my round to do at 7:00.

1003
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:12,623
You'll make it, Major.

1004
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:18,803
Yes, all right. I'll be there.

1005
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,775
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

1006
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:26,142
<i>Now, according to the diagram-
that's Exhibit "B,"sir-</i>

1007
01:06:26,214 --> 01:06:30,583
your bed, Corporal Zimmerman, was opposite and
to the left of Staff Sergeant Quinn's cubicle.

1008
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:33,951
- Yes, sir.
- And if Quinn had made any move to defend himself...

1009
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:35,956
you would have seen.

1010
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:38,117
- Yes, sir.
- And did he try and defend himself?

1011
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:40,184
No, sir. He didn't have a chance.

1012
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:42,492
<i>- Did he reach out for his own gun?
- No, he couldn't.</i>

1013
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:45,397
- And you were an eyewitness to this
cold- blooded killing. - Yes, sir.

1014
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,458
<i>No further questions.</i>

1015
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:53,564
You may cross-examine, Colonel Adams.

1016
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,167
I have no questions, sir.

1017
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:03,607
Colonel Adams...

1018
01:07:03,685 --> 01:07:06,483
as you have elected not to
make an opening statement...

1019
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,820
it would be improper for me to
press you on your line of defense.

1020
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:13,657
However, the court has noted that so far,
four witnesses have taken the stand...

1021
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:16,390
<i>without any cross-examination
by defense counsel.</i>

1022
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,628
If it will help the court, sir, the
defense is prepared to concede...

1023
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:22,534
that Lieutenant Winston did
shoot Staff Sergeant Quinn...

1024
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:24,731
<i>in the manner described.</i>

1025
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:28,173
As far as I'm concerned, there's no
need for any further eyewitnesses.

1026
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:30,677
<i>That is for the court
to decide, Colonel Adams!</i>

1027
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:32,838
What I require is that you satisfy me...

1028
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,940
that Lieutenant Winston will be provided
with an active and alert defense.

1029
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:39,680
With respect to the court, sir, I
claim the right to present my defense...

1030
01:07:39,754 --> 01:07:42,052
in the way that would
most benefit the accused.

1031
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,922
<i>At this moment, all I intend to say...</i>

1032
01:07:44,993 --> 01:07:46,984
is that at the time of the murder...

1033
01:07:47,062 --> 01:07:50,691
Lieutenant Winston could not
distinguish right from wrong.

1034
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,804
Corporal Zimmerman...

1035
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:00,035
you have testified that you knew
Lieutenant Winston for four months.

1036
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:02,042
Yes, sir. Yes.

1037
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:07,309
In that time, did you notice any peculiarities
or eccentricities of any kind in his behavior?

1038
01:08:07,382 --> 01:08:09,316
No, sir.

1039
01:08:09,384 --> 01:08:13,377
Nothing at all that would have led
you to suspect, even for a moment...

1040
01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:17,050
that Lieutenant Winston was not a
perfectly normal, rational officer?

1041
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,461
No, sir.

1042
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:24,659
<i>Are you sure you have no questions before
I release this witness, Colonel Adams?</i>

1043
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:32,496
Corporal Zimmerman...

1044
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:35,168
what did you do in civilian life?

1045
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:38,076
I moved around. You know,
there was this bowling alley-

1046
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:41,172
At no time in your career were
you a practicing psychiatrist?

1047
01:08:41,249 --> 01:08:43,274
<i>- [Spectators Chuckling]
- [Gavel Rapping]</i>

1048
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:47,583
- No. No, sir.
- Thank you. That's all.

1049
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:51,615
Now, sir, I'd like to draw your attention to
Paragraph 3 here under Amphibious Vehicles.

1050
01:08:51,693 --> 01:08:53,718
- Your call, sir.
- Just a minute.

1051
01:08:53,795 --> 01:08:55,786
Yes? Yes, Johnny.

1052
01:08:55,864 --> 01:08:57,923
<i>- [Man Shouting] Hut! Hut!
- [Marching]</i>

1053
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:01,992
No questions at all? Where the hell is
that defense he's supposed to put up?

1054
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:07,137
How many more prosecution witnesses?

1055
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,939
Huh. Call me again.

1056
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:16,112
- All right. Sorry, Major. Go
right ahead. - Yes, well, I suggest-

1057
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:19,847
You've told the court, Burton, that when you'd
heard from headquarters about the murder...

1058
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:23,516
you telephoned Major Kaufman and asked
him why he had admitted Lt. Winston.

1059
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,822
Yes, I did. He said he was sick...

1060
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:30,126
that he was in a profound
confusional and depressed state.

1061
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:33,656
<i>- Then you examined Lt. Winston yourself?
- Yes, I did.</i>

1062
01:09:33,735 --> 01:09:36,067
What were the results of your examination?

1063
01:09:36,137 --> 01:09:38,628
He was suffering from general fatigue.

1064
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,733
He also suffers from a nervous
stomach and athlete's foot.

1065
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,677
<i>Apart from that, I'd say
his health was normal.</i>

1066
01:09:44,746 --> 01:09:47,943
But did you find any indication at
all that Lt. Winston was mentally sick?

1067
01:09:48,016 --> 01:09:49,950
I did not.

1068
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:52,851
Having found that Winston was sound
of body and mind, what did you do?

1069
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,412
<i>Having been advised by
theater headquarters...</i>

1070
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:58,653
<i>- that this man should stand trial
as soon as possible- - Kaufman.</i>

1071
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:02,823
<i>I suggested to Major Kaufman that he be
immediately discharged from hospital...</i>

1072
01:10:02,897 --> 01:10:04,831
and transferred to the stockade.

1073
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:07,060
- And was he so discharged, Colonel Burton?
-  He was not.

1074
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:09,729
Major Kaufman refused to
sign his discharge papers.

1075
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:13,103
- What did you do then?
- I reported this to headquarters.

1076
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:17,873
<i>General Kempton instructed me to convene
a lunacy commission and to examine Winston.</i>

1077
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:20,608
And what were the findings
of that commission?

1078
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:26,052
The commission found Lt. Winston to be
sane, fit and responsible to stand trial.

1079
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:30,284
<i>If the court pleases...</i>

1080
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:33,885
the United States Army is prepared to
rest on the evidence that has been taken.

1081
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:37,363
<i>I feel it has been proven that the
murder of Staff Sergeant Quinn...</i>

1082
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:39,423
<i>of the Royal Army Service Corps...</i>

1083
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:43,130
<i>on the night of August 16 at the United
States Army Corps depot in Bachree...</i>

1084
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:45,195
<i>was willfully and with forethought...</i>

1085
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:47,901
<i>committed by the defendant,
Lt. Charles Winston...</i>

1086
01:10:47,976 --> 01:10:50,604
<i>while he was of sound mind and in
full possession of all his faculties.</i>

1087
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:56,447
<i>[Thompson] You may present
your witnesses, Colonel Adams.</i>

1088
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,452
<i>Colonel Adams!</i>

1089
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,889
- [Chattering]
- [Gavel Rapping]

1090
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:15,729
The court is, indeed, distressed to
hear of the death of Major Kaufman.

1091
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:20,172
However, our first and only
task is to dispense justice...

1092
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:22,402
in the trial now before us.

1093
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:24,741
The court will recess for one-half hour.

1094
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:37,151
If only we'd subpoenaed Kaufman three days
ago, he wouldn't have been transferred.

1095
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:40,353
What's the use in saying, "If
only"? We didn't, and he was.

1096
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:44,091
- If only we cross-examined.
- Morse, Bender, shut up.

1097
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,599
Gentlemen, the only court-martial
case I ever defended...

1098
01:11:49,671 --> 01:11:53,334
was 16 years ago when I got a not-guilty
verdict for a master sergeant...

1099
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:57,367
accused of stealing by
"finding" a 10-ton truck.

1100
01:11:57,445 --> 01:12:00,005
So I can honestly say I
have never lost a case yet.

1101
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:03,414
<i>- [Bell Ringing]
- We're going to fight this thing through.</i>

1102
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,285
- The hell with Thompson and the rest of them out there.
- Yes, sir.

1103
01:12:07,355 --> 01:12:10,586
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

1104
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:15,862
Lieutenant.

1105
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,631
- I want to open up by putting you on the witness stand.
- Why?

1106
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:25,139
I want you to tell the court, exactly
as you told me, why you killed Quinn.

1107
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:27,902
I've already confessed to the
murder. I have nothing else to say.

1108
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,910
I want you on that stand.

1109
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,242
Court will rise.

1110
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:36,006
I'm not getting on that stand.

1111
01:12:36,084 --> 01:12:38,848
I don't have to, and you can't make me.

1112
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,979
Well, I know my rights, Colonel.

1113
01:12:41,055 --> 01:12:45,048
<i>- What do you think I am, some kind of a nut?
- The court will come to order.</i>

1114
01:12:46,561 --> 01:12:48,529
That's a joke, Colonel.

1115
01:12:48,596 --> 01:12:52,862
<i>All parties to the trial who were present
when the court recessed are present in court.</i>

1116
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:55,300
Colonel Adams?

1117
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,930
Try the report.

1118
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,940
<i>[Man Coughs]</i>

1119

1120

Major Kaufman's evidence is
no longer available to us.

1121
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,276
This is a report written by him
in respect to Lieutenant Winston.

1122
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,913
<i>With your permission, I would
like it read into the record.</i>

1123
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:16,980
May I see that, please?

1124
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:28,063
This is a carbon copy, Colonel
Adams. Have you the original?

1125
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:30,764
The original has been destroyed.

1126
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,172
Well, this is neither signed
nor certified a true copy.

1127
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:37,234
As law officer, I must rule that
this document cannot be admitted...

1128
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:39,803
as an authentic copy of
Major Kaufman's report...

1129
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:42,145
without proof he was the author of it.

1130
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,947
<i>- Do you intend to produce that proof?
- I intend to try, sir.</i>

1131
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:49,285
Call Colonel Burton.

1132
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:52,190
Even if they won't accept
the report as evidence...

1133
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,252
you can put it on the record
for the information of the court.

1134
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,493
I could put a comic book on
the record, if I wanted to.

1135
01:13:58,566 --> 01:14:02,798
I want that report admitted as the
evidence of a qualified psychiatrist.

1136
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,840
<i>[Chattering]</i>

<i>[Man] Colonel Burton.</i>

1138
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:20,044
Colonel Burton, I will remind
you that you are still under oath.

1139
01:14:20,121 --> 01:14:24,182
Colonel Adams, you may
cross-examine the witness.

1140
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,193
Thank you, sir.

1141

<i>[Man Coughing]</i>

1142
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,267
Colonel Burton, this lunacy commission
- who were the members?

1143
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:45,835
Colonel Hale, Major Frank and myself.

1144
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:48,906
- Colonel Hale is some kind of a surgeon, is he not?
- He is a surgeon.

1145
01:14:48,983 --> 01:14:51,120
- And Major Frank is a dentist.
- Yes.

1146
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,312
<i>And you, sir...</i>

1147
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:56,551
before you were commissioned, you
were the resident company physician...

1148
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,025
of the Hamilton Truck Works in Detroit.

1149
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,585
- Yes.
- Are you a psychiatrist, sir?

1150
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,325
- Not in a formal sense.
- Well, in an informal sense.

1151
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,562
- I've read books on the subject.
- Oh? Which books?

1152
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,768
I repeat, sir, what books?

1153
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,832
I don't recollect the titles.

1154
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,502
<i>[Adams] Uh-huh.</i>

1155
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:19,570
And in this general hospital of yours...

1156
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,980
do you have a department of psychiatry?

1157
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,041
We have a neuropsychopathic ward.

1158
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:26,587
<i>In other words, you do have
a psychiatric department.</i>

1159
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,646
- I suppose so.
- You suppose so.

1160
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:34,020
<i>And, uh, how many psychiatrists
are on the staff of that department?</i>

1161
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,758
<i>- Three, I believe.
- Three, you believe?</i>

1162
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,734
You are telling the court that none of them
was competent to sit on a lunacy commission?

1163
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,736
That is so.

1164
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,795
And yet, when one of them, Major Kaufman...

1165
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:49,537
submitted the report to you on Lt. Winston's
condition, you rejected that report?

1166
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:54,605
Yes. As I said, the report was
neither competent nor scientific.

1167
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,049
- You read it carefully?
- Yes, I did.

1168
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,953
And this, uh, surgeon and this
dentist, they also read the report?

1169
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:04,015
- I don't know.
- Well, I submit that you do know, sir.

1170
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,890
Was the report given to them?

1171
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,294
Possibly not, as I rejected it.

1172
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:14,131
<i>And so you, Col. Burton, are the only
man who has read Major Kaufman's report.</i>

1173
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,269
- I believe so.
- Thank you, sir.

1174
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:25,644
If the court pleases, I
would like this to be stamped-

1175
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:29,411
Colonel Adams, the law officer has already
ruled this document cannot be admitted.

1176
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:33,750
I believe that what Col. Adams wishes to do
is to have Burton authenticate the report.

1177
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,382
- Is that so, Colonel?
- With the court's permission.

1178
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,824
Major Smith, do you wish to examine this?

1179
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:42,193
- Not at present.
- Very well.

1180
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,722
I rule that this document be admitted
into evidence as an anonymous report...

1181
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,735
of unspecified origin.

1182
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:51,136
It's up to the defense to authenticate
it as the work of any particular person.

1183
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,003
Thank you.

1184
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:59,704
Colonel Burton, would you read this, please?

1185
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,622
<i>[Man Coughs]</i>

1186

1187
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,600
In, uh, 45 seconds.

1188
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:31,304
Is that the time you usually
allow for reports submitted to you?

1189
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,216
Now, Colonel, would you
tell the court, please...

1190
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:40,881
is this a copy of the report
submitted to you by Major Leon Kaufman?

1191
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,926
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1192
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,521
You have sworn to the court that you
read Major Kaufman's report carefully...

1193
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,532
and you rejected it.

1194
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,898
Must I remind you that you are under oath?

1195
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:57,405
May it please the court,
Col. Burton is not on trial.

1196
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,463
I object to this whole line of questioning.

1197
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,408
Col. Adams will confine his
questions to the examination.

1198
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:09,817
I ask you again, is this
a copy of the report...

1199
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,012
submitted to you by Major Kaufman?

1200
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:18,021
- No.
- Do you recognize any part as the work of Major Kaufman?

1201
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,857
That's impossible to say.

1202
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:24,888
<i>He was in the habit of making
several drafts ofhis reports.</i>

1203
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,093
<i>It might be an earlier draft.</i>

1204
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:29,831
Getting back to your days with
the Hamilton Truck Company.

1205
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:32,100
Did you resign, or were you discharged?

1206
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,040
I resigned.

1207
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:39,740
Were you not discharged because you
diagnosed a heart attack as acute indigestion?

1208
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:41,908
<i>- [Smith] Objection!
- Certainly not.</i>

1209
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:47,319
All right. We'll, uh, put your civilian
career to one side for the moment.

1210
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,324
I'm going to ask you once
more about this report...

1211
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,883
and I again remind you
that you are under oath!

1212
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,895
<i>[Smith] I object!</i>

1213
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:59,127
Your constant reminders to Col. Burton
that he is still under oath are offensive.

1214
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:02,295
<i>You are not examining a criminal,
but an officer and a gentleman...</i>

1215
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,135
who accepts the role of
a cooperative witness.

1216
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:10,569
- Do you have any more questions for this witness?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1217
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:13,375
In that case, we will recess for lunch.

1218
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:17,145
<i>And the court is recessed
till 2: 15 this afternoon...</i>

1219
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,154
<i>at which time those persons having business
in the court will appear here again.</i>

1220
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:27,722
Boy, was he ever saved by the bell.

1221
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,131
Got a minute, sir?

1222
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,142
Sure.

1223
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,320
Come in, Barney. Smoke?

1224
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:57,155
Thank you.

1225
01:19:57,225 --> 01:20:01,457
What a luxury to be in a
room without a telephone.

1226
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,092
Well, Barney, I made a mistake, didn't I?

1227
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:12,163
We all make mistakes, General.

1228
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,334
What are you doing to Burton? Are
you trying to destroy that man?

1229
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,379
- Yes, I am.
- Why? For God's sakes, why?

1230
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:21,041
Because he's a liar, a cheat and a coward.

1231
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:24,017
Because he's covered himself with
dirt, and it rubs off everywhere.

1232
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,417
He does his job.

1233
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,718
He's required to contribute
to the war effort...

1234
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,384
by running a base hospital
smoothly and efficiently.

1235
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,952
He does that. Anyway, Burton
can take care of himself.

1236
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,294
It's you I'm thinking about, Barney.

1237
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,357
- Are you trying to throw your career out the window?
- No, sir.

1238
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:43,996
Well, what are you trying to
do? What are you trying to prove?

1239
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,632
I'm trying to prove that
the system works, General.

1240
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,268
You asked me to put on a
demonstration. I'm doing that.

1241
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:52,711
No man is above the law. We know
that. But no man is below it either.

1242
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,772
And that's what I'm proving.

1243
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:59,920
Well, Barney, you better
go ahead and prove it.

1244
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,479
For myself, I don't deal in individuals.

1245
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:05,219
That's a luxury I can't
afford. I'm here to fight a war.

1246
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,922
I still say you don't buy
victory by rigging a murder trial.

1247
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:13,058
I don't know whether you do or
not, but that's your pigeon now.

1248
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,898
I'm already on the next crisis.

1249
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,599
You know, Barney?

1250
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:22,404
I was hoping to tell you soon
that you'd been made full colonel.

1251
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,170
Does that sound like bribery?

1252
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,007
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

1253
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,747
Give my regards to your old
man when you write to him.

1254
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,755
I'll do that.

1255
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:43,891
If you will bowl googlies and
long hops, inevitable, I suppose.

1256
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,126
207 for-

1257
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,135
Oh, never mind.

1258
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:50,194
Good morning.

1259
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,730
Have you just got up, or did
you manage to stagger into court?

1260
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:57,642
- We got there.
- Beer, I think. Two beers, please.

1261
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:01,307
Well, have you rung down the curtain
on the high drama of the courtroom?

1262
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:04,409
- We've recessed.
- And what's the brilliant defense?

1263
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:08,320
Self-preservation, provocation, or
didn't he know the gun was loaded?

1264
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:11,450
If you must know, the
brilliant defense is insanity.

1265
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,494
Now, if you'll excuse us.

1266
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:17,020
Why do English officers always
use our bar? We never use theirs.

1267
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,726
I tried, ducky. The beer's too warm.

1268
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:23,862
Tell me, are you putting Kaufman in the box?

1269
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:28,171
Kaufman's dead. Cracked up
his car racing to get here.

1270
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:33,142
Good God. I am sorry.

1271
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:36,206
So you'll appreciate we're
having a difficult time enough...

1272
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,447
<i>without a running commentary from you, sir.</i>

1273
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,624
Brilliant doctor.

1274
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,225
Well, I hear you're making
complete nonsense of it.

1275
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,127
I'd like a large, cold glass of water.

1276
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,139
<i>[Bartender] Yes, sir.</i>

1277
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:56,286
The court will rise.

1278
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,996
The court will come to order.

1279
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:07,940
All parties who were present when the
court recessed are again present in court.

1280
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:11,172
I would remind the witness
that he's still under oath.

1281
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,180
Colonel Adams.

1282
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:25,017
I have no more questions
for this witness, sir.

1283
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:27,755
<i>[Spectators Murmuring, Whispering]</i>

<i>- Major Smith?
- No questions, sir.</i>

1285
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:39,297
Now the witness may stand down.

1286
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,746
<i>If the defense rests, has
the prosecution any further-</i>

1287
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,044
The defense does not rest, sir.

1288
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,419
I have one more witness to call.

1289
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,279
Very well.

1290
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:12,100
Do you swear that the evidence you
shall give in the case now in hearing...

1291
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:15,665
shall be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

1292
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,736
<i>- I do.

1297

I'm a doctor of medicine, London University.

1298
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,832
I have a diploma in psychological medicine.

1299

I'm a fellow of the Royal

<i>[Adams] Thank you, sir.</i>

1305
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:12,764
This is a report written
by a medical practitioner...

1306
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,234
after an examination of Lieutenant Winston.

1307
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,294
<i>- Would you read this, please?
- I object!</i>

1308
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:20,000
The defense has introduced an
unsigned, uncertified document.

1309
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:23,066
There's no proof at all that this is
a report on Lt. Winston's condition.

1310
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:26,477
The report is typed on hospital stationery.

1311
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:30,006
It is headed "Lieutenant Charles
Winston. " It bears his serial number.

1312
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:32,177
It is titled "History and Prognosis. "

1313
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,744
Now, what more does the
trial judge advocate want?

1314
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:39,920
The law officer has already ruled that this
is an anonymous and unspecified document.

1315
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:44,021
<i>I suggest that defense counsel is pursuing
an unorthodox course, to say the least.</i>

1316
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:48,262
<i>If it will help the court, I will concede
that this is an anonymous report...</i>

1317
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,429
written about an anonymous patient-

1318
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:54,407
even, if the court so
wishes, a nonexistent patient.

1319
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,513
That is in order. The objection is overruled.

1320
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,276
Thank you, sir.

1321
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:10,187
<i>Major Kensington, you've read the report?</i>

1322
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:12,192
Yes.

1323
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,252
Is there anything in this report,
Major, that is not consistent...

1324
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:18,163
with your diagnosis of Lieutenant Winston?

1325
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,326
It is almost,
word-for-word...

1326
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,632
what I would have written myself.

1327
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:31,006
Lieutenant Winston was the only
commissioned officer at Bachree.

1328
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,309
He had the power and the authority.

1329
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,077
But Sergeant Quinn broke down this authority.

1330
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,311
He undermined Lieutenant Winston.

1331
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:41,150
He laughed at him and mocked him...

1332
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:44,589
<i>and the process of disintegration began.</i>

1333
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:47,457
He had an unhappy, lonely childhood.

1334
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,520
<i>He married a woman who terrified him.</i>

1335
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,897
<i>His three sons, apparently, treat
him with contempt and pity...</i>

1336
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:58,530
and the only reason he joined the army
was in a pathetic attempt to impress them.

1337
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:03,100
After Pearl Harbor, he began to create a
fantasy of winning the war single-handed.

1338
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,168
That was when he began to degenerate...

1339
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:08,238
from a mere neurotic into a paranoiac.

The murder of Sergeant Quinn...

1342
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:17,847
was the last, desperate
effort of Lieutenant Winston...

to defend himself with the exercise of power.
