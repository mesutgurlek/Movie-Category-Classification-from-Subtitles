1
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
 Next round!

2
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 Now that we've moved to paradise, there's nothing to eat.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 [This is a play on words, a phrase used in mahjong] 

4
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
 Speaking of moving, I forgot to congratulate you

5
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,100
 on Mr. Liang's promotion.

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 Can you even call that a promotion? He only supervises the rations.

7
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,400
 You can't even get rice from India now.

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,700
 Those in charge of rice are more powerful than those who guard the treasury.

9
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,600
 Mrs. Yee is right.

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,100
 Me? I'm not a living Buddha.

11
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,300
 But you should listen to me.

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,900
 If he takes a consignment, he won't be home for 3 days.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,400
 You'll be free then.

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,800
 I don't have the time.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,100
 His relatives are always coming around.

16
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,300
 They pack the place, even the corridors.

17
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,400
 I'll take that. [mahjong terminology]

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 I still have to settle their meals.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,100
 It's not even as though I'm getting paid for this.

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,600
 Yeah.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
 Don't mislead Mrs. Mak

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,900
 into thinking government officials 

23
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,700
 are the tiles we're playing with now.

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,200
 Isn't that so?

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
 The Japanese would never have thought that,

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 even the emperor gets henpecked.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,100
 Eat while it's hot.

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,600
 I can't eat any more, I'm getting fat...

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,300
 Everyone hoards up stuff now.

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,100
 Since we can't do anything else, just hoard up fat then.

31
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
 What else is good to stock up on, Mrs. Yee?

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,500
 You know my husband is in the import business.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
 I'll take that! [mahjong terminology]

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,700
 Even though Hong Kong has fallen,

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,300
 the ships still need to call.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,400
 I'll eat that. [mahjong terminology]

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
 Western medicine.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
 The last shipment sold out very quickly.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 He should get more of them.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,700
 I heard you went to Shu Yu yesterday?

41
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,800
 Yes, with some others. Mrs. Mak hasn't been there before.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,500
 It's embarrassing that I haven't.

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 There're two new branches in Hong Kong.

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,100
 The Sichuan and Hong Kong chefs couldn't get along,

45
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,500
 and besides Hong Kongers can't take spicy food.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 Isn't it spicy?

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
 Yes, it really was.

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 9 Wan [mahjong terminology]

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,700
 2 Wan.

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,700
 I'll take that.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,100
 Mrs. Mak didn't go yesterday?

52
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,900
 She hasn't come for a few days.

53
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
 I had things to take care at home.

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
 Since you had enough players, I decided to take a break.

55
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,200
 An excuse to hide eh?

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,300
 Who was it who said she wasn't free a few days ago over the phone?

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 That day doesn't count, I went to fetch Mrs. Mak.

58
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,500
 You can ask her if you don't believe me.

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 I specially chose to treat you to a meal that day, Mrs. Mak.

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,600
 She did it deliberately.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 I'll take that tile.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,900
 Do you still have more of those stockings?

63
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,700
 Yes, but I gave them all away.

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
 If you want I can bring more the next time.

65
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
 Ok.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
 Goods are running scarce in Shanghai.

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
 There's even a black market for soap and toothpaste.

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,900
 You should come more often.

69
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
 There's a place for you to stay.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
 I think he's had enough.

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,400
 The Kempeitai (Japanese Military Police) will demand for him.

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
 They didn't specify whether he should be dead or alive.

73
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,900
 Just give it to him.

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
 How will you account to Miura?

75
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,600
 They're investigating the arms the Americans supplied to Chongqing.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
 I'll meet him tonight.

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,200
 His secretary called to say today's dinner was cancelled.

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 He wants you to report directly to headquarters tomorrow.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,500
 You're not returning to the office today?

80
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 I still have an appointment.

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,900
 My relatives asked someone to get some from the Russians.

82
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,300
 Rings, jewels from the aristocracy.

83
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,700
 They're begging for cigarette butts on the streets. 

84
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,200
 Afraid of getting fakes.

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 You women started early today.

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
 That's a good hand you have.

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 Mr. Yee is here to show his support.

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,200
 Sorry...my turn? 

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
 That's a good one you have.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,300
 How many carats is yours, three carats?

91
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,800
 What do you think of this? I tire of it.

92
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,200
 It's no longer fashionable, I was thinking of getting it changed.

93
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,500
 Pin Fen has new stock.

94
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
 There's a new five carat one.

95
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
 It's large, but not as bright as yours.

96
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,400
 Why didn't you call me then?

97
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,900
 I only took a brief glance.

98
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,500
 Pin Fen has some stuff that can't be gotten outside.

99
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 They wouldn't sell that fire gem to me. [Shanghainese term for a high-grade jewel]

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
 How much is it worth now?

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,300
 That fire gem of yours is ten carats.

102
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's not as though it's a pigeon's egg.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
 Gems are just stones.

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 If you wear such large jewellery, you can't even play mahjong.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,900
 Nagging at me even though you wouldn't buy it for me.

106
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,100
 Ah, I won!

107
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,000
 Combo win. [Mahjong terminology]

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,700
 I was about to win myself. It's all Mr. Yee's fault,

109
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,400
 for saying you can't play mahjong if you wear jewellery.

110
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,300
 He did it on purpose.

111
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 Thank you Mr. Yee.

112
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,200
 Mr. Yee should treat us to a meal.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,800
 Sure, where do you want to go?

114
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
 Shu Yu. Western medicine?

115
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 Not Shu Yu, let's choose somewhere more expensive.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
 Oh dear, I forget.

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900
 I have an appointment at three.

118
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,600
 And I forgot all about it.

119
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
 That won't do, who'll play then?

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,000
 You should have said so earlier!

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
 I need to discuss something with someone.

122
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,300
 And I forgot all about it...

123
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,500
 Why don't you sit in for me, Mr. Yee?

124
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,900
 I'll be right back.

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,100
 And my luck had just turned for the better.

126
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,500
 Not today, I have something on.

127
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
 I'll play overnight with you ladies some other day.

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,600
 Mrs. Mak is too inconsiderate.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
 My husband has some money owed to him, it's been a few years already,

130
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
 the debtor finally agreed to to pay up a portion.

131
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
 Let's ask Mrs. Liao then.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,100
 Shen-ma, could you call Mrs. Liao over?

133
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 You owe us a treat.

134
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,800
 Mrs. Mak, Mrs.Yee says you can use the car.

135
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
 The car is waiting for you.

136
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,000
 I really couldn't.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,700
 Isn't't Mrs. Mak going...?

138
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
 Ok, thank you.

139
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,700
 I'll be right down.

140
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,900
 There are less cars in Shanghai than in Hong Kong.

141
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
 Gas is expensive. Even those who have cars don't drive any more.

142
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 Mrs. Mak, your Shanghainese is very good.

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,400
 My Mum is from Shanghai.

144
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
 When I was young some relatives of mine

145
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,500
 moved over to Hong Kong when the war started.

146
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 Really?

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,900
 These foreigners, they can only redeem this much a day.

148
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,900
 They can only get hard bread to eat.

149
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,500
 Do you need me to fetch you later?

150
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 No, I can call a cab.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
 Coffee, please.

152
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
 Sure.

153
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,700
 May I use your phone?

154
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,700
 Of course.

155
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 Strange, did I call the wrong number?

156
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
 Hello.

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,400
 Second brother, it's me.

158
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 Yes?

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
 I'm at the Keseling cafe now.

160
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,600
 Is everything alright at home?

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 Yes.

162
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,000
 I'm good, just too busy recently

163
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 to call back home.

164
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,800
 I'm going to go shopping today.

165
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
 I have a date, I'm going now.

166
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,400
 Ok.

167
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,100
 Well, then, there's nothing else.

168
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,700
 I know, it'll be ok.

169
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
 I'm going, goodbye.

170
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 We're moving out now.

171
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,900
 If you guys win we'll marry you!

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,400
 I didn't say I'd be the one marrying them.

173
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,500
 The men have all gone to war.

174
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 Who's going to marry this truckload of girls?

175
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
 I'm not going to, you marry him then!

176
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,700
 I heard from teacher that Guangzhou has been lost.

177
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,600
 Will it be safe in Hong Kong?

178
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,300
 I never thought that we'd have to rely on the Brits to protect us.

179
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,400
 Isn't your Dad in Britain?

180
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 Why didn't he bring you with him?

181
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,500
 He took my younger brother.

182
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,700
 When my Mum died he said he'd take me.

183
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,600
 But two years later, war broke out.

184
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
 I'm not going back again.

185
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,800
 War gave me the chance to go to Hong Kong.

186
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 I want to go overseas and see the world outside.

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,300
 See you by the pond after class tonight.

188
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,400
 Let's go back to our apartment together.

189
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
 Ok.

190
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,900
 Hey, Lai Shu Jin!

191
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,800
 I was just looking for you.

192
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
 Kuang Yumin, you still remember me?

193
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,200
 Yes, I saw you acting.

194
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,400
 Lingnan University's Women's Drama Society.

195
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
 We've set up a new drama society.

196
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,100
 We're auditioning for members today.

197
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,400
 But the women's drama society has never

198
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
 collaborated with males.

199
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,600
 Since we're borrowing Hong Kong University's premises for classes

200
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 and we have a lack of manpower, we should work together. 

201
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
 We can do Ibsen's "A Doll House"!

202
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 I know Nora's lines at the back of my hand.

203
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,700
 At this kind of time who has the mood

204
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,300
 to see this kind of bourgeoise show?

205
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,800
 We're intending to stage a patriotic play

206
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
 to raise funds for the war.

207
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 You should come for the audition tomorrow too.

208
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,400
 But I'm only a freshman, I've never acted before.

209
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
 It doesn't matter.

210
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
 Everyone should play their part for the resistance movement.

211
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,600
 While the soldiers are fighting on the frontlines,

212
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,300
 the Hong Kongers are relaxing.

213
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,300
 We need to awaken them from their complacency.

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,600
 What a typical director, he doesn't listen to anyone.

215
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
 But since it's the resistance, 

216
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,000
 we girls can't lose out to the guys.

217
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,400
 I just can't stand the thought of following his beck and call.

218
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,100
 He's quite passionate isn't he?

219
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,800
 Not long after his brother graduated from the military academy,

220
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,300
 he got killed in the war.

221
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
 So his family wouldn't let him join the army.

222
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 So that's why he's so agitated.

223
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
 I don't want him to get drafted either.

224
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
 I return myself to the land which nurtured me.

225
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,300
 And my soul...

226
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
 More to the left, more.

227
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,200
 Ok, that's fine.

228
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 Let's try it out.

229
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
 What's up?

230
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
 My Dad got married.

231
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 I'm writing a letter to congratulate him.

232
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 The pre-stage jitters will disappear once the curtains open.

233
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 Auntie Zhao!

234
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,000
 They found this officer behind the hills.

235
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Xiao Hong, has your brother come home?

236
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
 Shh! Come in quickly. 

237
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
 My son! Quickly, go boil some water.

238
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,500
 What happened to you?

239
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 He's an army officer, not your son.

240
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,700
 My son is coming home tonight.

241
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,900
 Coming home to eat dinner.

242
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,500
 I should slaughter a chicken for him.

243
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
 My son is coming back!

244
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,500
 He's coming back today!

245
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 My son is coming back.

246
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,100
 My son is coming back.

247
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,000
 Ever since she knew my brother died on the warfront,

248
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,700
 my Mum took ill.

249
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
 I made this for my brother.

250
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,700
 I just finished knitting it, but he'll never get to wear it.

251
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,700
 Please have it!

252
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,000
 I can't, you saved my life.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
 I don't have anything to repay you with.

254
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
 Saving our country is payment enough!

255
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,700
 Killing the enemy is taking revenge for my brother!

256
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
 I hate myself for being a woman,

257
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 and I promised my brother

258
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,100
 to take care of Mum.

259
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,500
 I want to set his mind at rest...

260
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 Your brother...

261
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 He was the same age as you. Ever since my Dad died,

262
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,100
 he'd been taking care of the family.

263
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,300
 He'd work faster than everyone else.

264
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
 Every year during the harvest,

265
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 he'd help others after harvesting our own crops.

266
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 He was also as rugged as you.

267
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 I'd always follow him wherever he went.

268
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,900
 He'd always say Heaven would bless the honest and kind.

269
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
 Our family had our hopes pinned on him.

270
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,200
 I'll kowtow to you!

271
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,100
 For this country, for my dead brother,

272
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,700
 for the generations of people,

273
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,900
 China cannot fall!!

274
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,900
 China cannot fall!

275
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
 China cannot fall!

276
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 China cannot fall!

277
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
 China cannot fall!

278
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
 Cheers!

279
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 This calls for a celebration!

280
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,200
 That was really great, everyone was shouting out:

281
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 "China cannot fall!"

282
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,000
 China cannot fall!

283
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,700
 600! 600 people seated in the audience.

284
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,800
 And those standing in the aisle too!

285
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
 Don't underestimate these Hong Kongers eh?

286
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 When we performed at Lingnan,

287
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,800
 we never had such an enthusiastic response.

288
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,000
 What we staged is the reality.

289
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
 The audience can emphasise, so naturally they're touched.

290
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
 During the fund-raising I saw many people tearing.

291
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,300
 Cheers to everyone, for raising this sum of money,

292
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,300
 and doing our bit for the war.

293
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,100
 We must drink to our heart's content tonight.

294
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,700
 Let's worry about the nation tomorrow.

295
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
 Cheers, bro!

296
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,900
 I have an idea, listen to me.

297
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,300
 We should sell tickets.

298
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,600
 And write on the door: "While stocks last!"

299
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,300
 If it's you, it's more like:

300
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,900
 "It's hard to sell even one ticket" 

301
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
 Here, give me the drinks.

302
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,200
 Careful!

303
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,500
 Cheers to our leading man and lady!

304
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
 Our ticket sales depend on her!

305
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 To our leading man and lady!

306
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
 I'm not, I'm not.

307
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
 We're the peach blossoms [students] of today,

308
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,500
 The pillars of society tomorrow,

309
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 We're singing together today,

310
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 Saving the people tomorrow on a giant wave,

311
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 A giant wave, continuously expanding,

312
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,200
 Classmates, my dear students,

313
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 let your strength prop up the rise and fall of this world,

314
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 A giant wave, a giant wave,

315
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,500
 Hurry!

316
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 To the top!

317
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 Have you lighted it?

318
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,700
 It won't do if peformers don't smoke.

319
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,700
 Try it, it'll come in useful during acting.

320
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,600
 Wong Chia Chi took a blow, who wants...

321
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 Gimme!

322
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,100
 Let me take a drag!

323
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,100
 Thank you.

324
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,100
 Why?

325
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,800
 Wong Chia Chi.

326
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 Come up!

327
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,300
 I met a fellow villager from my hometown

328
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 called Tsao De Xi.

329
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,800
 He went to the same school as my brother, so we're familiar with each other.

330
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,100
 I heard he's an Assistant Officer, working for the guy 

331
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
 in charge of the "Peace Exercise".

332
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,600
 His name is Yee.

333
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
 He's Wang Jingwei's aide, in charge of espionage and spying.

334
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,800
 He's now in Hong Kong.

335
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,900
 Wang Jingwei's runs the "Peaceful Exercise", but

336
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,800
 he's just a lackey of the Japanese.

337
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
 He's a traitor who betrayed our country.

338
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,100
 Wang is now accumulating troops.

339
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,900
 Hong Kong is under Yee's purview.

340
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
 This Tsao guy I met...

341
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,800
 This is a chance.

342
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,500
 What chance?

343
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,300
 This isn't theatre.

344
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 No matter how much we trade on our audience's tears and shout our voices hoarse,

345
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,100
 it's incomparable to killing a real traitor.

346
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,200
 We can do it this holidays so the school won't find out.

347
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,300
 We need to disguise ourselves

348
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,400
 and think of a way to infiltrate the Yee household.

349
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
 I'll get a favour from Old Tsao

350
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,400
 and get him to introduce us.

351
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,100
 And then we'll get guns,

352
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,400
 But which of us knows how to kill a person?

353
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
 We've only killed people on stage.

354
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 When you see a traitor in front of your eyes,

355
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,100
 you'll know that killing isn't difficult at all.

356
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,800
 It's only a matter of how many, how fast.

357
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,400
 This is a matter of life and death, I want everyone to consider it carefully.

358
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,700
 If you're in, then let's make this a big one.

359
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,400
 Knives together, let's not waste our youth,

360
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,600
 and slay one of Wang Jingwei's lackeys!

361
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,100
 I'm in!

362
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,100
 Count me in.

363
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 Then we'll too...

364
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I don't want to force anyone.

365
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
 I'm in too.

366
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 'lil un, I didn't expect you'd come find me.

367
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,700
 We haven't met since we left our hometown. 

368
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,400
 Less talk. Cheers!

369
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,400
 Drink up.

370
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,300
 I should also thank Brother Tsao.

371
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,500
 From now on you must take care of us.

372
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 Sure, sure sure.

373
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,600
 Here's one to you!

374
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 Brother, can you see if you can help us?

375
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,700
 Can you help us find work?

376
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,700
 It's tough, but let me think of something.

377
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,400
 Where's Liang Junsheng? He's still up there.

378
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
 What's he doing?

379
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,900
 We only have enough for Tsao.

380
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,100
 Maybe he can get more information.

381
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,100
 Just on those few glasses of cat's piss?

382
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,300
 The caucasians have all gone on holiday.

383
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,300
 We can use the second floor for two months.

384
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,300
 Where'd you get the money from?

385
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
 My Dad left me some money in Hong Kong

386
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
 in case of emergencies.

387
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,900
 I didn't ask you to get something so luxurious.

388
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
 If you want Auyang to be Mr. Mak, a businessman 

389
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,600
 and Wong Chia Chi to be Mrs. Mak, a rich housewife,

390
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,700
 this is the kind of place they should live in!

391
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,200
 Let's decorate this place and get some furniture.

392
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,900
 And get a maid.

393
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,900
 Does Mr. Mak need a moustache?

394
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,700
 Hold on.

395
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,400
 Don't use my best tie to wipe your mouth with!

396
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,400
 This isn't a rehearsal, there won't be a second chance.

397
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,200
 Remember your own roles.

398
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
 Don't say what you're not supposed to say. 

399
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,900
 You too...

400
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,100
 They're here!

401
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 Mr. Mak, Mrs. Mak.

402
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,800
 This is Mr. Mak's cousin, a friend from my hometown, Kuang Yumin.

403
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 This is Mr. Yee, and Mrs. Yee.

404
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
 You accompany them, I'll take my leave first.

405
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,800
 Sorry about making you drive all the way here to get me.

406
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,600
 Old Tsao said you were familiar with Hong Kong.

407
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
 If not we'd have used my husband's car.

408
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,300
 It's no problem, it's along the way.

409
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,100
 Mrs. Yee, do you want to visit Chung Wan?

410
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,400
 Though we've been in Hong Kong for a few months already,

411
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
 the only places we know are Chung Wan and Repulse Bay.

412
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
 How about Tsim Sha Tsui then?

413
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,700
 We can take a stroll there too.

414
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,000
 Sure.

415
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 To Tsim Sha Tsui, Queen's Harbour.

416
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,800
 Can you drop us off before you return to the office?

417
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,400
 It won't matter if we make a slight detour right?

418
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
 I wouldn't want to inconvenience Mr. Mak's official business.

419
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,200
 It's a family business, it's all right.

420
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,200
 What line are you in, Mr. Mak?

421
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,300
 Export trading.

422
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,000
 We also do importing.

423
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,900
 Mrs. Yee, where you live is pretty good.

424
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,000
 When we were looking for a house, did we look here?

425
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,300
 It's just a rental. Once war broke out on the mainland,

426
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,300
 we moved here hastily.

427
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,100
 Mrs. Mak, were you born here?

428
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
 I married here, my Mum's hometown is in Guangzhou.

429
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,300
 My Mum is from Shanghai.

430
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,000
 Then your Shanghainese must be good.

431
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,100
 I can speak, but not well.

432
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,900
 I've forgotten it all.

433
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,400
 [They are speaking in Shanghainese]

434
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,600
 My hometown is Anhui.

435
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 My Shanghainese isn't too good either.

436
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,800
 Thanks, sorry for bothering you,

437
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,700
 and helping me carry my stuff.

438
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
 No, I should.

439
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,000
 You're welcome, since he's my husband's cousin.

440
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,500
 He also just arrived in Hong Kong.

441
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 We brought him along to see the sights.

442
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
 What do you do in Guangzhou?

443
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,100
 I teach, in an elementary school in the village.

444
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,000
 As expected, you have a scholarly air.

445
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,800
 Either a college student or a teacher.

446
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
 Mrs. Yee, you have a good eye.

447
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,500
 Didn't you see those plainclothes bodyguards?

448
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,800
 There's no way we can make a move on him at his own place.

449
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
 Whenever he goes out there're at least a few bodyguards by his side in addition to the chaffeur.

450
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,800
 Even if we get him out there're at least three people we'll have to deal with.

451
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,700
 We need at least two guns.

452
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
 But it's still better than attacking him at home.

453
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,900
 Be more patient, we're already on track.

454
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,500
 Mrs. Yee has a good impression of Wong Chia Chi.

455
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,100
 She's already arranged a second meeting.

456
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,100
 Sorry, I'm tired.

457
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,500
 Can I come in?

458
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,500
 Come in.

459
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,200
 I pressed the tailor to hurry.

460
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
 Thank you.

461
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 What does Yee look like?

462
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,100
 I only got a glimpse, he wasn't what I expected.

463
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,500
 Our cook, he just left like that.

464
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 He didn't take anything, but the man just disappeared.

465
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,700
 So we moved to the Ban Dao hotel.

466
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,900
 It's already five days, and we don't dare to go back...

467
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,900
 My husband says it isn't safe, so we need to find somewhere else to stay.

468
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,700
 You can't trust the people here.

469
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,800
 These Cantonese, I can't catch a word of what they're saying.

470
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,200
 Exactly, I'm quite irritated.

471
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 Where can I find a cook,

472
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
 who can whip up some decent Shanghainese dishes now?

473
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
 I know there's a place in Hong Kong,

474
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
 which serves decent Shanghainese food.

475
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,700
 They have good fried shallot carp and drunken chicken.

476
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,900
 Then bring us there!

477
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,800
 Hey, Old Yee, Mrs. Mak just said

478
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
 there's a good Shanghainese restaurant in Hong Kong.

479
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,100
 Old Yee is a fussy eater.

480
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,200
 He compalains no matter how good the resturant is.

481
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,800
 Really? Which one?

482
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,500
 It's the Zhu's, at Kowloon.

483
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,800
 It's the main branch of the Shanghai Restaurant in Hong Kong.

484
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,200
 I think I've heard of it.

485
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,300
 I'll be back late tonight.

486
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,700
 Don't remember we have guests tomorrow.

487
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,700
 Good night.

488
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,100
 We're not invited tomorrow?

489
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,600
 He didn't tell me who the guest is.

490
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,200
 It must be Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun.

491
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,100
 They're forming a new government.

492
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,700
 They sent for Old Hsiao already.

493
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,700
 That means Mr. Yee is going to be promoted isn't he?

494
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
 As she said... [the tile reads "hit (on the mark)"]

495
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
 Why're you so late?

496
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
 Was playing mahjong.

497
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
 Sorry, I lost again.

498
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,200
 What about Mr. Yee?

499
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
 Barely saw him for a minute.

500
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,400
 He left and didn't come back.

501
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
 Hey, move aside, I'm bushed.

502
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,600
 Hey, I killed a beer bottle.

503
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,300
 It's already been a month.

504
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
 What's so great about shooting one or two beer bottles?

505
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,600
 You might as well shoot me!

506
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,000
 To spare my Dad from doing the job.

507
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
 The house, car, losing at mahjong.

508
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000
 Shopping for expensive stuff, buying a whore for you,

509
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Are we here on holiday or to kill a traitor?

510
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,200
 How many Dads do you think I have?

511
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,000
 Wong Chia Chi needs expensive jewellery,

512
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 and you want to be a Resistance hero,

513
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,100
 What about me? I'm a chauffeur in the day and a sentry at night.

514
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
 My Dad has been asking around.

515
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,100
 He thinks I've been fooling around in Hongkong.

516
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,000
 He wants to break off all ties with me.

517
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Why don't you guys think about that!

518
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
 We have guns.

519
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
 Why don't we kill some easy ones first?

520
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,100
 If not school will be starting soon.

521
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,800
 Everyone's here voluntarily.

522
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,300
 We can't blame it all on Kuang Yumin.

523
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,600
 I know we're in financial difficulties.

524
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,500
 I should have planned for this.

525
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,100
 I admit we don't have any experience.

526
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,600
 But we committed ourselves to this.

527
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,400
 We finally inflitrated the Yee household after so much effort.

528
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,800
 We can't just give up now.

529
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
 The guards are now familiar with me.

530
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
 I'll find a chance to do it myself.

531
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,700
 Don't worry, I'll take care of the consequences.

532
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
 Don't be dumb, you think you can do it alone?

533
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,700
 That's my problem.

534
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,300
 My documents are in the study.

535
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
 Mr. Yee.

536
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,700
 Mrs. Mak.

537
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,700
 The car broke down halfway. And it started raining.

538
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
 Send Mrs. Mak in.

539
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,400
 Hongkong's so humid. You can wring out water even in a handshake.

540
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,700
 Yeah, even Shanghai isn't that bad.

541
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,400
 I'm still not used to it even now.

542
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,900
 Mrs. Hsiao.

543
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,900
 I thought you wouldn't be coming because of the weather.

544
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,800
 Why are you back?

545
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,700
 Rain's too heavy, I changed my plans.

546
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
 Mrs. Mak, Mrs. Zhu, you're here?

547
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,100
 We're waiting for Mrs. Hsiao.

548
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,300
 Just nice, we need one more player.

549
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,800
 I still have something to do.

550
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
 Why don't you just play for a while?

551
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
 You haven't played for ages.

552
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,600
 Mr. Yee, Mrs. Yee's getting angry.

553
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,100
 Ok.

554
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
 Mr. Yee liked the material we chose that day.

555
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
 He didn't like the last one.

556
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,600
 Is there any tailor you're familiar with?

557
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,400
 Yes, I know of one, he's quite good.

558
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
 We make our suits and dresses there.

559
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,300
 Want to try making one there?

560
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,300
 I'll leave it to you.

561
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,200
 But it's the peak season now.

562
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,900
 They're busy with tourists' requests.

563
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
 Will it take a few months?

564
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,600
 No, not that long. We're old customers anyway.

565
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,600
 I can hurry him.

566
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,400
 When Mr. Yee is free,

567
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Mrs. Yee can give me a call.

568
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Mrs. Mak, I have your phone number.

569
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,900
 We can probably get a discount

570
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,900
 if we make one or two more.

571
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,500
 Mr. Yee prefers UK imports

572
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,700
 they don't give discounts for those.

573
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,700
 Really?

574
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 I've won!

575
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,000
 Your luck today is pretty good.

576
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 I didn't even realise I'd won.

577
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 The God of Fortune must have come.

578
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,100
 Ah, Mr. Yee.

579
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,100
 I recognised your voice.

580
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,000
 It'll complement your face more if the collar is narrower.

581
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Yes, a smaller collar looks better.

582
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,300
 Shorten the sleeves a little more.

583
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,800
 I said, you should shorten the sleeves.

584
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,100
 It'll make you look more sprightly.

585
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
 I'll leave it to you.

586
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,400
 This is a more modern design.

587
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 The collar looks good.

588
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,500
 Your dress is ready.

589
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,500
 I'll try it on.

590
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,800
 Go and eat first, don't wait for me.

591
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
 Does Mrs. Mak often make her clothes here?

592
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,900
 Yes.

593
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,900
 She's a frequent customer of ours.

594
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
 It's too fitting, I can't breathe properly.

595
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,200
 Mrs. Yee originally chose this one.

596
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,200
 But she didn't want it so I took it.

597
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,800
 I'll leave it as it is then. I'll take it off.

598
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,800
 Wear it.

599
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,200
 Alright.

600
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,300
 Is Mrs. Yee ok?

601
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,300
 Old Cao will bring her to the doctor.

602
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,300
 She said she had a headache when we were about to leave. Must be the mahjong.

603
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,700
 My husband doesn't like me to play mahjong too.

604
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,500
 I said, men have many ways to entertain themselves outside.

605
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,400
 But for women, we can only shop and play mahjong.

606
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,400
 Mahjong isn't that bad, at least we stay at home.

607
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,900
 When I called today

608
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
 did I disturb you?

609
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,500
 My husband isn't home, he went to Singapore.

610
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,800
 So his friends came over to accompany me

611
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,400
 in case I was bored.  

612
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,000
 But in fact he's getting them to keep watch on me.

613
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 I had an excuse to escape because you called.

614
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
 Really?

615
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,700
 I don't mind going out alone when I'm free.

616
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,900
 My husband isn't interested in the things I like.

617
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,800
 What do you like?

618
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
 Watching movies. He doesn't want to go so I go alone.

619
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,300
 He's always talking business with those friends of his.

620
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,000
 They're not interested in the movies at all.

621
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,100
 I don't watch movies too.

622
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,100
 Mr. Yee is a busy man. Only frivolous people watch movies.

623
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,100
 No, that's not it. I'm afraid of the dark.

624
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,600
 Will you drink some?

625
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,600
 I'll drink a little with you.

626
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,600
 We don't know many people in Hongkong, so we're always troubling you.

627
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,500
 It's trivial stuff, you don't have to stand on airs.

628
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,500
 If you're observant, nothing is trivial.

629
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,900
 There don't seem to be many customers here.

630
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,900
 It's because their food sucks.

631
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,400
 Sorry. But it's convenient to talk here.

632
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
 No one will disturb you.

633
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,400
 Is Mr. Mak busy with his work?

634
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,400
 I don't even know what he's busy about.

635
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,000
 He went to Singapore in the past two days.

636
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 But as long as the men don't come home, everything else's fine.

637
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,400
 Isn't it?

638
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,200
 What kind of business does Mr. Mak do?

639
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,000
 Import and export.

640
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,100
 If you're so interested in Mr. Mak,

641
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,000
 I'll bring him along the next time.

642
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,600
 At least men have more conversation topics among themselves.

643
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,600
 With women they can only talk about trivial matters.

644
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,100
 To me, a chance to talk relaxedly like this 

645
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,100
 is hard to come by.

646
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,400
 The people I associate with are those with high reputations.

647
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,300
 They talk all the time about politics.

648
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,500
 The fate of generations hang by their mouths.

649
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,200
 It doesn't matter what their views are.

650
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,200
 In all of their eyes I see the same thing:

651
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,500
 What?

652
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,800
 Fear.

653
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,800
 What about you? You're different from the rest.

654
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 You're not afraid, are you?

655
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,100
 What about you?

656
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,500
 You're smart, but you're not very good at mahjong.

657
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,100
 Yeah, I always lose.

658
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,200
 I've only won you before.

659
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
 Your suit is ready, do you want me to collect it for you? 

660
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,300
 I'll call you.

661
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,500
 I have an appointment later.

662
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
 I still have some time, so I'll send you home first.

663
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 Is it convenient?

664
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 Yes.

665
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,800
 They're here!

666
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
 Turn off the lights, guard the outside.

667
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,100
 Thanks. I'll send you to the door.

668
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,500
 You don't have to.

669
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,500
 Wait for me.

670
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,500
 They're coming!

671
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,500
 Turn off the lights!

672
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 They're about to come in.

673
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,700
 Don't blame me if you miss your appointment.

674
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
 Too bad you have an appointment...or, you can send the car away.

675
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
 Come up for some tea.

676
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,400
 Give me a stiff drink.

677
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,200
 He's very careful, when we were at the tailor's

678
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,700
 he sent away Old Hsiao and the bodyguard.

679
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,600
 That means even Old Hsiao isn't someone he trusts.

680
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,200
 No worries, just do the same thing the next time

681
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,600
 and get him into the house, we'll get him with one bullet.

682
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,000
 He's wary of "Mr. Mak", so he won't come in.

683
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,600
 He meets at very obscure places.

684
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,600
 Possibly Old Hsiao might not even know of them.

685
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Is he interested...

686
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 Mr. Mak isn't pleased.

687
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,700
 Not yet. But I know his intentions.

688
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,700
 Otherwise he wouldn't have sent me to the door.

689
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,200
 It's just that he's too afraid to come in.

690
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,200
 He was dallying by the entrance.

691
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,100
 He said he wanted to see me again.

692
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,600
 I originally thought of meeting at the cinema.

693
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,000
 Since it'll be easier to make an escape there.

694
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,500
 But he's a really careful man.

695
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,500
 He said he wouldn't go to dark places.

696
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,400
 If he calls again it'll be serious.

697
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,400
 I'll have to agree to be his mistress.

698
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,200
 And then?

699
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
 Have you guys thought, what next?

700
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,000
 Do you know how to do it?

701
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 Between a man and a woman...?

702
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,200
 You've all discussed this before already?

703
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,300
 Who?

704
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 Only Liang Junsheng has experience.

705
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,100
 With a whore?

706
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,500
 Do you want to drink?

707
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,500
 No need.

708
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,300
 The lights.

709
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,300
 You seem to be more responsive today.

710
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,300
 I don't want to discuss this with you.

711
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
 We cooked some porridge.

712
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,800
 Hello? Mrs. Mak, how are you?

713
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,600
 I called you two days ago.

714
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,800
 But you weren't in.

715
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,800
 I wanted to ask if you've tailored the clothes?

716
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,800
 You're not having it done any more? Why?

717
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,900
 Going back to Shanghai?

718
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,400
 Well, congratulations then.

719
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,500
 I'll go over right now.

720
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,300
 You haven't called for the past few days.

721
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,300
 So I thought I'd drop by.

722
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,500
 I'll go to the airport tomorrow then.

723
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,000
 I should really...

724
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,700
 I should really see you off, right?

725
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,700
 You're leaving just like that?

726
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,100
 I see.

727
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,400
 Give Mr. Yee my regards.

728
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,600
 Bon voyage.

729
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,600
 Goodbye.

730
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,900
 Moving house? Hope I'm not disturbing.

731
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,900
 Huang, you're no longer driving? A mover now are you?

732
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,900
 What are you doing here, Cao?

733
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,900
 To pay Mr. and Mrs. Mak a visit.

734
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,900
 And their cute friends.

735
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,300
 What do you want?

736
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,000
 Right from the start I knew something was wrong.

737
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,200
 I kept quiet about it

738
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,000
 so I could see what you were up to.

739
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,900
 So Mr. Mak is from Lingnan University.

740
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,900
 Cao, don't do anything reckless.

741
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,400
 Mr. Yee didn't take me to Shanghai.

742
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,600
 Why don't I repent my ways?

743
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,100
 I know a lot more than you guys.

744
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,200
 Your superiors must know

745
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,200
 that I'm more valuable than you guys.

746
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,500
 How much money do you want?

747
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,400
 I'd say at least 10 gold taels.

748
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,400
 And that doesn't include Mrs. Mak's price.

749
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 I'm thinking Mr. Yee would pay even more for her.

750
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,000
 You're asking for it!

751
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,200
 You really have it going, bro.

752
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,300
 I didn't know you were a spy.

753
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,200
 You should be the one helping me out.

754
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,400
 Instead why are you making use of me?

755
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,400
 Even though we're fellow villagers.

756
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,700
 You helped a traitor!

757
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,700
 You should have known what was coming for you!

758
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,700
 He's not dead yet.

759
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,600
 You're back?

760
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,600
 Morning.

761
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
 You're back.

762
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,800
 Morning.

763
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,400
 Aunt, I'm back.

764
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,300
 Has your father written?

765
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,300
 I'll check the mail later.

766
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,800
 Aunt, I'm going to school.

767
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,700
 You're still letting her study?

768
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,400
 I sold off the house her father left for her.

769
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,100
 In return I agreed to let her finish her studies.

770
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,100
 I'm a person who keeps her word.

771
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,600
 It is the time for victory!

772
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,200
 In the past 500 years,

773
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,000
 having endured the tyranny of Imperialism

774
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,500
 the whole of Asia has now

775
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,900
 broken free and achieved freedom.

776
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,900
 Asia is now returning to Asians' hands!

777
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,000
 For every day it is not,

778
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 we will fight unceasingly for freedom!

779
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,900
 You'd never have expected

780
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,000
 that our actions in Hongkong

781
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
 were being observed secretly.

782
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,100
 After you left that night,

783
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,500
 they appeared and cleaned up the mess.

784
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,000
 They smuggled us out of Hongkong.

785
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
 Who's "they"?

786
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 They're from Chongqing, they're the ones 

787
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
 who assassinated the Shanghai mayor.

788
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,100
 Now you know how childish we were.

789
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,700
 It was really ridiculous.

790
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,400
 Yes, especially me.

791
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,400
 I was just dumb.

792
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,600
 It was my fault.

793
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,600
 We all paid a price.

794
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,500
 How's everyone?

795
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,100
 They're all still around.

796
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,100
 Where?

797
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:43,300
 A few places. It's not convenient to say.

798
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,300
 I've been looking for you.

799
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,800
 I didn't go back to school.

800
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,800
 I later taught language lessons at a community centre.
