1
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,760
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

2
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

3
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,081
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

4
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,480
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,528
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

6
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,681
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

7
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,058
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

8
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,119
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.

9
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,618
To an American reporter...

10
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,623
there is something very special
about the people of this city...

11
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,122
this island, this nation.

12
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,125
Never in the long and stormy
history of Great Britain...

13
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,628
have her fortunes been
as low as they are...

14
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,094
in this spring of 1941.

15
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:25,689
Britain is fighting alone
for her very existence...

16
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,199
fighting desperately.

17
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,705
Yet her people remain
steadfast and unflinching.

18
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,705
Britain's allies have been
defeated one by one...

19
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,207
as the dark stain of Nazi conquest...

20
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,208
spreads across the map of Europe.

21
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:42,737
In Africa, Rommel is giving
the Eighth Army a very bad time.

22
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,212
Greece has fallen.

23
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,182
And the <i>Luftwaffe</i> continues
to smash English cities.

24
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:51,084
The worst news of all
comes from the North Atlantic...

25
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:54,588
where last month, German U-boats
and surface raiders...

26
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,682
sank 600,000 tons of shipping.

27
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,554
In this battle,
Britain's lifeblood is at stake.

28
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:02,255
This is the battle on which depends...

29
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,298
the future course of the war...

30
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:06,126
the future course of British history.

31
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:13,694
The battle of the North Atlantic
is fought at sea...

32
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:17,434
but it is directed from
the admiralty, here in London.

33
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:25,716
Very deep in the ancient
Admiralty Building...

34
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,216
200 feet underground, is the war room.

35
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,708
Here is the guiding brain
and central nervous system...

36
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,186
of the British navy...

37
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,687
The Operations Division.

38
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:37,850
Robert.

39
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,015
Sir?

40
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,525
Take Captain Shepard's things...

41
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,356
and put them in the office.

42
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,361
Aye, sir.

43
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,692
Thank you.

44
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,732
This, of course, is the message center...

45
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,200
for incoming and outgoing signals.

46
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,238
These tubes lead to
the wireless room down the hall.

47
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:59,242
Oh, Shepard...
Anything wrong?

48
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:00,707
That man's uniform.

49
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:03,143
Oh. We're quite informal here
about some things.

50
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,679
You'll find it's much different...

51
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,181
from the bridge of a ship at sea.

52
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,680
It has to be that way.

53
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,185
Shepard, this is Commander Richards...

54
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,686
the duty plot officer.

55
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:16,187
Captain Shepard is
the new director of operations.

56
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,689
[Mouth Full Of Food] How do you do?

57
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,692
Don't let me interrupt your meal.

58
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,693
Captain Shepard,
Second Officer Anne Davis.

59
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,695
Captain Shepard's taking over for me.

60
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,196
How do you do, sir?

61
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,697
How do you do?

62
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,197
Be nice to her, Shepard.

63
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,699
If she got angry and walked out,
we'd lose the war.

64
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,861
Really?

65
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:35,405
Seriously, you can depend on
this young lady.

66
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,405
I've done it many times.

67
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,202
Anne, be a darling, will you...

68
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:41,276
and get your plot report in
as soon as possible.

69
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,775
We mustn't be late...

70
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,277
forJimmy's party tonight.

71
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,710
Right-oh.

72
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,214
I suppose I should shed a few tears...

73
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,713
at leaving this place...

74
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,216
but quite honestly, I've hated the job.

75
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,946
Too much responsibility,
strain.

76
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,716
I'm getting a command at sea.

77
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,220
That's what I've always wanted.

78
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,220
Congratulations.

79
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,223
I hope you find one...

80
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,657
that doesn't involve too much strain.

81
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:04,660
It's a different kind of strain.

82
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:07,663
If a man's going to serve in the navy...

83
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,665
he ought to serve at sea...

84
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,631
unless, of course,
it's a man like yourself...

85
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,292
who's already seen action.

86
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,337
He should still serve at sea.

87
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,838
Yes. Well, I better get along.

88
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,338
I'll say good-bye now...

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,668
unless you have any questions.

90
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,675
I don't think so. Good luck.

91
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,733
Thank you.

92
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,229
We thought we might be of some
assistance, sir...

93
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:57,237
not knowing your way around yet.

94
00:06:57,305 --> 00:07:00,741
Is there anything I can do for you?

95
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:02,832
Yes, there is something.

96
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,174
I saw a rating enter the war room...

97
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,679
without his jumper.

98
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:10,704
From now on, everyone
will be properly dressed at all times.

99
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,718
I cannot have officers
eating sandwiches on duty...

100
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:15,217
Commander, under any circumstances.

101
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,219
I'm sorry, sir. Won't happen again.

102
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,688
Excuse me, sir.

103
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,020
I think you should know
that Commander Richards...

104
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,556
stood two watches without relief...

105
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,058
I'm sure Commander Richards...

106
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,153
doesn't need an interpreter,
Miss Davis.

107
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,220
I was also surprised
to hear a Wren officer...

108
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,630
addressed by her Christian name.

109
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,395
To me, this kind of informality...

110
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,993
is both irregular and inexcusable.

111
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,195
Come in!

112
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,241
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

113
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,706
Priority signal.

114
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,242
Thank you.

115
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,247
Huh. Excuse me.

116
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,281
Come in.

117
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,450
Oh, Shepard.

118
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,960
You know the assistant chief
of naval staff.

119
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,429
Yes, indeed, sir. Very well.

120
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,954
How are you,Jonathan?
I'm glad to see you again.

121
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,432
I have a signal here...

122
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,469
from our naval attache in Stockholm.

123
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,470
He reports two large German warships...

124
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:19,937
steaming through the Kattegat.

125
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,438
What ships are they?

126
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,940
He doesn't say.

127
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,975
Think it might be the <i>Bismarck?</i>

128
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,441
It's possible, sir.

129
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,502
She's just completed
three months' training...

130
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,945
in the Baltic.

131
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,515
Couldn't pick a better time
to break out...

132
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,516
with this Crete business
going on...

133
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,983
and our convoys scattered.

134
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,521
I have a nasty hunch
that's the idea, sir.

135
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:39,986
I hope you're wrong.

136
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,523
Can't afford to have that monster loose.

137
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,422
Look what <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and <i>Gneisenau</i> did to us.

138
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,992
22 ships sunk... 115,000 tons.

139
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,029
All in two months.

140
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:51,531
They don't have anything like
<i>Bismarck's</i> fire power.

141
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:55,021
She could stand off and sink
every ship in a convoy...

142
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,535
without ever coming under fire.

143
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,901
Shepard, get on to
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

144
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,438
Tell him we're not sure...

145
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,938
but we're very much concerned.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,439
We'll let him have...

147
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,804
every scrap of information.

148
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,068
Aye aye, sir.

149
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,337
Oh, and, Shepard.

150
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,436
I wish you'd prepare
your recommendations...

151
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:11,809
in case it is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

152
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,439
Very good, sir.

153
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,382
Pretty rough assignment...

154
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,214
for a new man on the job.

155
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,948
I'm not worried about Shepard.

156
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,954
He's one of the ablest men
in the service.

157
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:25,957
I'm told he's as cold
as a witch's heart.

158
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,959
That's a slight exaggeration, sir.

159
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,960
I want a man who's cold.

160
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,963
I'd like a man with no heart at all...

161
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:34,123
no soul...

162
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,631
just an enormous brain.

163
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,667
The battle of the North Atlantic...

164
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,135
is a grim business.

165
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,468
It won't be won
by charm and personality.

166
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,471
We've had too much of that.

167
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,972
I've known Shepard for years.

168
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,065
We've served together before.
He was different then.

169
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,972
Any particular reason for the change?

170
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,978
I suspect there are many reasons, sir...

171
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,980
reasons of a personal nature.

172
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,481
Oh. I see.

173
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:58,483
Well, how are we going to
get the information...

174
00:09:58,586 --> 00:09:59,985
on those two ships?

175
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,487
We have an agent in southern Norway...

176
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,987
Get in touch with him.

177
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,525
It's too dangerous to get in touch
with him directly.

178
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:10,527
There isn't time to go
through Zurich or Stockholm.

179
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,361
In this case,
you'll have to make direct contact.

180
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,128
Sir, this man is
in Nazi-occupied territory.

181
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,032
I realize that.

182
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:24,403
All the same, we must get
in touch with him immediately.

183
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,838
Aye aye, sir.

184
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,081
[Automatic Weapon Fire]

185
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:09,047
The enemy ships
were sighted coming out of the Baltic...

186
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,058
obviously heading out to sea...

187
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:13,560
obviously not in the service
of the king.

188
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:17,054
Now, what have we got over here
at Scapa Flow?

189
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,565
Battleships <i>King George V,
Prince of Wales...</i>

190
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,033
battle cruiser <i>Hood...</i>

191
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,534
a few cruisers and destroyers.

192
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,231
The rest of the fleet's
out on convoy escort.

193
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,272
It's from Admiral Cunningham, sir.

194
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,274
"Situation in Crete is deteriorating.

195
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:33,368
German airborne troops
have captured Maleme Airfield."

196
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:39,072
Why is it we never get
our bad medicine in small doses?

197
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,548
Perfect timing for an enemy breakout...

198
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,016
in the North Atlantic.

199
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:45,077
Cunningham and his fleet
busy down here in Crete.

200
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,553
Sommerville's got his hands full...

201
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,090
trying to reinforce Malta
with Force H.

202
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,592
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>
are up here at Brest.

203
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,593
We must keep them covered.

204
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:56,094
And 16 convoys to guard...

205
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,098
scattered all over the Atlantic.

206
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:01,497
If we had a hundred more ships...

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,999
we still wouldn't have enough.

208
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,162
Sir, we've just had a signal...

209
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,999
from our agent in Norway.

210
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:08,538
The message is incomplete.

211
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:12,508
"Sighted two enemy ships
of Kristiansand at 033 5

Cruiser <i>Prinz Eugen</i> and..."

213
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,011
The transmission stopped
abruptly at that point, sir.

214
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,514
Did you try to get him back?

215
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:23,015
Yes, sir. No further contact.

216
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,019
Where is Kristiansand?

217
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,519
Off here, sir.

218
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,020
Southern tip of Norway.

219
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,091
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?

220
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,557
I don't think this man...

221
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,559
would have transmitted
in the circumstances...

222
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,562
if it hadn't been something
really important.

223
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,065
Then we'll proceed on the assumption...

224
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:42,598
that it's <i>Bismarck.</i>

225
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,227
May I suggest we put
Coastal Command to work...

226
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,669
on air reconnaissance?

227
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,068
Yes. Everything from Bergen southwards.

228
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,571
Tell them to photograph
everything that looks suspicious.

229
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:53,575
I'll talk to Commander-in-Chief
at Scapa Flow.

230
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,075
Aye aye, sir.

231
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,279
[Ship Horn Sounding]

232
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,110
[Ship Horn Sounding]

233
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,614
Excuse me, sir.

234
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:03,515
First sea lord on the line, sir.

235
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,215
Commander-in-Chief, sir.

236
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,722
Hello,Jack. How are you?

237
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,019
I'm fine.

238
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:14,525
Those two German ships...

239
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,027
were sighted off southern Norway
at 033 5.

240
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,528
One is the <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

241
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:21,031
and we're not sure about the other.

242
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,532
Do you think it's...

243
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,534
I suggest you proceed
on the worst possible assumption...

244
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,037
that it's <i>Bismarck</i>
and she's breaking out.

245
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,699
I can't think of anything worse.

246
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:33,900
We can't let that ship
get loose in the Atlantic.

247
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,534
I'll come to immediate notice
for steam, sir.

248
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,238
All right. Good-bye.

249
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:42,548
We're directed to assume
that it's <i>Bismarck...</i>

250
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,049
accompanied by <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

251
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,549
and that they're attempting to...

252
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,552
break out into the convoy lanes.

253
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,055
Now, gentlemen, they'd have
four available passages...

254
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,487
wouldn't they?

255
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,046
Here's the Denmark Strait...

256
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,058
the passage south of Iceland...

257
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,559
the Faeroes-Shetland Passage...

258
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,563
and the Fair Island Channel...

259
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,029
between the Orkneys and the Shetlands.

260
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,894
Anyone care to place a bet?

261
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,991
What about the Iceland-Faeroes
Channel?

262
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,933
Not too near our bases,
room to maneuver.

263
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,505
Why wouldn't he take the nearest exit?

264
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:13,371
Fair Island Channel's
only a few hundred miles.

265
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:15,533
Too close to our air patrol.

266
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:20,069
All you're saying is
it could be any one of the four.

267
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:22,081
Actually, of course,
you're perfectly right.

268
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:23,548
I'm afraid somehow or other...

269
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,584
we've got to guard them all.

270
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,586
Have we any idea
where they are now, sir?

271
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,053
Nothing definite.

272
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,556
Jenkins, check with Coastal Command...

273
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,591
that they're carrying out a search.

274
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,058
Aye aye, sir.

275
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,326
Looks like two cruisers.

276
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,329
That's what the pilot said.

277
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,330
One's a cruiser, all right.

278
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,331
The other one's...

279
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,832
<i>Bismarck.</i>

280
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,459
<i>Bismarck's</i> been located in Norway.

281
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:29,763
Definitely identified.

282
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,326
<i>Bismarck's</i> in Grimstad Fjord.

283
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,838
They want us to send
everything we've got...

284
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:35,499
Bombers, torpedo planes, everything.

285
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:38,841
No luck. Nothing.

286
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,343
Visibility down to nil.

287
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,346
Cloud down to 200 feet, sir.

288
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,348
Can't get a bombing run
in weather like that.

289
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,349
200 feet along the fjord here.

290
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:47,751
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?

291
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,343
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?

292
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,852
O.G.62, sir.

293
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,512
Right.

294
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,892
Now, Miss Davis, take the <i>Arethusa...</i>

295
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,892
from O.G.62.

296
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,327
Put her with the Home Fleet.

297
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,330
Good.

298
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,332
Now take the <i>Victorious...</i>

299
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,336
from that convoy forming
up in the Clyde...W.S.8.B....

300
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,837
And put her with the Home Fleet.

301
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,839
Sir, Operations Home Fleet calling.

302
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,340
Director of operations.

303
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,842
No, I'm sorry.
We still have no information.

304
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:22,343
Well, the weather's closed in
over there.

305
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,940
The aircraft can't see a thing.

306
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:29,177
Yes, as soon... as soon as I hear, right.

307
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,185
Right. I will.

308
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,188
Now...

309
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,191
take the <i>Repulse</i> from W.S.8.B.

310
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,955
and put her with the Home Fleet.

311
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,696
Right.

312
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,699
Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it?

313
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,928
Yes, sir, but I wouldn't give much
for the convoy.

314
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,233
You do recall that's a troop convoy...

315
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,430
don't you, sir?

316
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:55,563
Yes, I do.

317
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,732
They've got a long way to go...

318
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,742
round the cape to the Middle East.

319
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,140
This leaves them unprotected.

320
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,677
I'm quite aware of the circumstances,
Miss Davis.

321
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,442
This is a risk we have to take.

322
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,541
<i>We</i> have to take, sir?

323
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,481
Well, Shepard...

324
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:12,985
what do you have in mind?

325
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:16,182
I think we must reinforce
the Home Fleet, sir.

326
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:18,690
They can't patrol everything
from here to Greenland...

327
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:20,692
with what they've got now.

328
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,193
Well, where do we get the ships?

329
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,696
We'd have to take ships from other duty.

330
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,698
It would involve some risk.

331
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,097
We could take <i>Victorious</i>
and <i>Repulse</i> off escort duty.

332
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:33,762
That would give the Commander-in-Chief
an aircraft carrier...

333
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,305
and another battle cruiser.

334
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:36,737
What convoy were they covering?

335
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,240
The W.8.S.B., sailing
from the Clyde tomorrow.

336
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,744
It's a large troop convoy, sir...
20,000 men.

337
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,906
We'd be exposing them to
a long and dangerous voyage...

338
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,504
without proper escort.

339
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,743
Is that what you're recommending?

340
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,250
Yes, sir.

341
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:55,378
You're willing to gamble
the lives of 20,000 men?

342
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,923
I think there's a difference...

343
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,957
between a gamble and a calculated risk.

344
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,726
Good for you, Shepard.

345
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,887
Of course, I realize it's...

346
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,897
It's not an easy decision to make.

347
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:11,696
The important ones never are.

348
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,200
All right, go ahead...

349
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,703
and detach those two ships
from the convoy.

350
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,206
Inform Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

351
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,705
Aye aye, sir.

352
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,173
[Ship Horn Sounds]

353
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:25,211
They're giving us <i>Victorious</i>
and <i>Repulse.</i>

354
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:28,213
Now we can send <i>Hood</i>
and <i>Prince of Wales</i> out...

355
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,715
to support the patrols
in the Greenland area.

356
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:33,719
I want them ready to sail
within an hour.

357
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,219
<i>Prince of Wales</i>
has civilian workers aboard.

358
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,722
They're making adjustments
to the gun turrets.

359
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,226
If they don't finish their work,
they'll sail with the ship.

360
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,725
Aye aye, sir.

361
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:46,228
As far as the rest of the fleet...

362
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:48,230
we'll wait for definite information.

363
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:51,232
I suppose my nerves
can stand it if yours can.

364
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,234
I've just talked to Captain Shepard.

365
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,735
The visibility over the coast of Norway...

366
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,237
is absolutely nil.

367
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,239
She may be there. She may not.

368
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,933
What's the latest forecast?

369
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,736
Pretty bad, I'm afraid, sir.

370
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,243
Looks like two days
of very thick weather.

371
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,318
The weather report is
very good, Admiral...

372
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,318
Two days of heavy overcast.

373
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,355
Good news, is it not so, Captain?

374
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,856
It is, sir.

375
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:22,289
Thank you, Bernhardt.

376
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,298
We have a most interesting
chess game here, Lindemann.

377
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:33,300
The important moves
this time are at the opening.

378
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:37,304
To break out into the Atlantic
will not be easy, sir.

379
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,805
Yes, but we have the advantage...

380
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,671
because they do not know
what we are going to do.

381
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,299
We can move out immediately...

382
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,810
or we can hide for a while...

383
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,312
under this beautiful overcast.

384
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,316
Also, we have a choice
of four different exits.

385
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,317
Group North has suggested
the Iceland-Faeroes Passage.

386
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,819
You're not forgetting that, sir?

387
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,320
We have to take orders from Group North.

388
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,256
We do not have to take suggestions.

389
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,758
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,759
Lindemann, we have
a great opportunity here.

391
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,160
I do not intend to let Group North...

392
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,392
or anyone else lose it for me.

393
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:13,762
There can be great glory in this voyage...

394
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,267
glory for the Third Reich...

395
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,304
glory for us!

396
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,203
For you, sir.
You are the fleet commander.

397
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,764
I will see that you are not forgotten.

398
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:26,776
I was forgotten after the last war.

399
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:28,777
Until the fuehrer came to power...

400
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,780
I got no recognition, no promotion.

401
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,280
I was ignored...

402
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:34,282
just as Germany was ignored.

403
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,784
The world only remembers the winners,
Lindemann.

404
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,786
We must make sure this time...

405
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,584
that it will remember us.

406
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,886
I am sure it will.

407
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,790
How soon can you get under way?

408
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,794
I can have steam in half an hour, sir.

409
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,558
I want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.

410
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,065
Signal <i>Prinz Eugen.</i>

411
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:54,530
Very well, sir.

412
00:21:58,904 --> 00:22:00,997
[Whistles]

413
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:03,666
[Yelling In German]

414
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:34,299
Sir, it's a signal from
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

415
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,800
An aircraft from Hatston's
got through to Grimstad.

416
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,300
There's nothing there now, sir.

417
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:39,802
Well, they've sailed.

418
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,805
At least we know that much.

419
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,806
Now we can get moving.

420
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,760
Position of all convoys, sir.

421
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:11,920
Thank you.

422
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:15,762
All we can do now is wait
and see what happens.

423
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,768
That's the worst part
of our job...the waiting.

424
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,272
You have a son
in the service, haven't you?

425
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,931
Yes, sir. He's at Gibraltar.

426
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,270
He's an air gunner in the <i>Ark Royal.</i>

427
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,775
I bet you're glad...

428
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:32,301
he won't be mixed up
in this <i>Bismarck</i> show.

429
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,778
Why should I be glad?

430
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,782
If you were, you wouldn't admit it,
would you?

431
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,284
He must take his chance
like everybody else.

432
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,476
I see.

433
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,816
There's an air vice marshal
coming in later...

434
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,322
to help out on reconnaissance.

435
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,323
Give him a briefing, will you?

436
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,489
You wanted to speak to the crew,
Captain?

437
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:54,996
They've been alerted.

438
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:56,555
<i>Achtung!</i>

439
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,332
Captain Lindemann...

440
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,834
with your permission...

441
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,268
I would like to address
the ship's company.

442
00:24:03,338 --> 00:24:04,771
As you wish, sir.

443
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,932
Thank you.

444
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:11,776
Officers and men of the <i>Bismarck...</i>

445
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:13,609
this is the fleet commander.

446
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,081
We are going out into the North Atlantic...

447
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:19,447
to attack the British convoy system.

448
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,452
We are going to sink their ships...

449
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,612
until they no longer dare
to let them sail.

450
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:27,419
It's true we are only two ships...

451
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:31,291
but the world has never seen such ships.

452
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,794
We are sailing in the largest...

453
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,457
the most powerful battleship afloat...

454
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,965
superior to anything
in the British navy.

455
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,729
We are faster...

456
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:44,703
we are unsinkable, and we are German!

457
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,205
You cadet officers...

458
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,298
you were selected by
the highest authority...

459
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,898
to make this voyage.

460
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,409
When you return to the fleet...

461
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:54,605
you will have many
inspiring stories to tell...

462
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,307
stories of German sea power...

463
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,283
stories of Nazi victory!

464
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,253
To all of you, I say this...

465
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:06,755
Never forget that you are Germans...

466
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,587
never forget that you are Nazis!

467
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:13,259
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

468
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,727
Heil Hitler!

469
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:22,795
In the center, the main plot.

470
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,801
What's that?

471
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,304
Another convoy, sir.

472
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:26,804
Fine. Carry on.

473
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,306
Now, sir...

474
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:31,810
over here, we have the <i>Hood</i>
and the <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

475
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:34,811
They left Scapa Flow 40 hours ago.

476
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,814
Here we have the <i>Repulse...</i>

477
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,315
the aircraft carrier <i>Victorious...</i>

478
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,316
and the <i>King George V.</i>

479
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:45,047
They've been steaming
for approximately 18 hours.

480
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:46,816
In this area...

481
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,050
the cruisers <i>Arethusa,
Manchester, Birmingham.</i>

482
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,819
In the Denmark Strait...

483
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,827
the cruisers <i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk.</i>

484
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,828
As you can see, sir...

485
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:59,196
our cruiser screen is
spread out much too thinly.

486
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,757
Now, if your people
would get into the air...

487
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,268
can't fly reconnaissance missions
in weather like this.

488
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,702
We realize that, of course, sir.

489
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:09,205
We must assume that the <i>Bismarck...</i>

490
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,708
in company with the <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

491
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,767
is going to attempt a breakthrough...

492
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:15,276
to the North Atlantic.

493
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,778
We don't know where...

494
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,781
and we don't know when.

495
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,783
If it's here...

496
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,282
or here...

497
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,784
then the <i>Repulse</i> and the <i>Victorious...</i>

498
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:28,289
and the <i>K.G. V</i> will have to do the job.

499
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,789
If it's here in the Denmark Strait...

500
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,292
then the <i>Hood</i> and the <i>Prince of Wales...</i>

501
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,657
will have to go after her.

502
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,787
I should think they'd handle it.

503
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:41,300
<i>Hood's</i> a great ship.
So is the <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

504
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,300
She's fresh from the builder's yard.

505
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,800
No training for her crew.

506
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,805
She put to sea with the contractor's
workmen onboard.

507
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,365
The <i>Bismarck's</i> a tough proposition
for any two ships.

508
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:52,943
Excuse me, gentlemen.

509
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:53,875
Excuse me, gentlemen.

510
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,310
The first sea lord can see you now.

511
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,312
Thank you very much, Shepard.

512
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,472
[Telephone Rings]

513
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:00,845
Yes, sir.

514
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,281
Right, sir.

515
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,284
Yes, I will.

516
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,285
Commander Richards, who's your relief?

517
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:07,786
Dexter, sir.

518
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,289
He's late, isn't he?

519
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,290
A little. I don't mind, sir.

520
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:14,793
I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.

521
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,309
<i>My dearest Tom...</i>

522
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,311
Come in.

523
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,316
Thought you might like some tea, sir...

524
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,045
since you won't take any rest.

525
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:48,349
What are you doing here?
You're off duty.

526
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,321
Third Officer Simpson's down with flu.

527
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,823
I'm just filling in.

528
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:55,827
Oh, thank you. Would you file that
for me, please?

529
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,328
There's an air raid going on up top.

530
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,829
Bad one?

531
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:01,831
No, not very.

532
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:04,766
Won't your family be worried about you?

533
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,267
I have no family here.

534
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,270
My father lives in Canada now.

535
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:12,774
I thought that surely you must
be married or something.

536
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,934
No, sir. Nothing at all.

537
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:16,442
Doesn't that seem odd...

538
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,569
if you don't mind my saying so?

539
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,581
I was going to be married last year...

540
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:23,206
but...it didn't work out.

541
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:24,648
His fault or yours?

542
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:26,150
He was at Dunkirk...

543
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:29,153
and he was listed as missing in action.

544
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,655
It was just a year ago...

545
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,020
a year ago next week.

546
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:37,793
He was a rather wonderful man...

547
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:41,319
not brilliant or dashing
or anything like that...

548
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,832
but just rather wonderful.

549
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:50,735
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,330
I think it helps to
talk about these things...

551
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:54,841
don't you, sir?

552
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:58,344
No, I don't.
I don't think it helps at all.

553
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,844
Getting emotional about things...

554
00:28:59,913 --> 00:29:01,346
is a peacetime luxury.

555
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:03,279
In wartime, it's much too painful.

556
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,282
You can't turn off your emotions...

557
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,284
just because there's a war on.

558
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,786
You can't do anything
about your feelings.

559
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,114
Yes, you can.

560
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:12,120
[Ring]

561
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,451
Director of operations.

562
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,287
Tell you why I called,Jonathan.

563
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:16,791
Dexter's here in my office...

564
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,849
and he has rather a special problem.

565
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:21,293
I understand you've given him
extra duty.

566
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:24,299
Correct. I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.

567
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:27,300
It seems that his girl is an army nurse.

568
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,495
She's got orders to sail tomorrow night.

569
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm very sorry that Dexter's young lady
is going overseas...

570
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,305
but that's beside the point.

571
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:35,807
Couldn't you make an exception?

572
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,309
I won't make an exception
for this officer...

573
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,809
or any other...

574
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:42,812
certainly not for reasons
of personal convenience.

575
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,576
Well, it's very simple, sir...

576
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,345
either you have discipline
or you haven't.

577
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,749
Well, I'm sorry, Dexter.

578
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,310
Thank you, sir.

579
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,321
By the way, Jonathan...

580
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,824
there's a fleet commander
aboard the <i>Bismarck.</i>

581
00:29:56,892 --> 00:30:00,182
Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens.

582
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:01,659
Lutjens.

583
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,163
You know this man?

584
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:04,664
Yes, sir, I do.

585
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:07,667
One of his cruisers sank my ship.

586
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:12,171
Oh. Then you'll have a special interest
in him.

587
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:23,202
Commander Richards,
have a bunk made up in my office.

588
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,373
Yes, sir.

589
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,712
I want the latest report
on all shipping...

590
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,217
in the North Atlantic...
enemy, friendly, neutral.

591
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,218
Any air reconnaissance over this area?

592
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,719
The weather's still too bad.

593
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,222
You show two cruisers
in the Denmark Strait.

594
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,722
Is <i>Suffolk</i> back on station?

595
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,726
We assume she is.
We don't know for certain.

596
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,226
She's quiet as a tomb.

597
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,739
Alter course to 1-9-0.

598
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,296
Starboard 15.

599
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,069
Starboard 15, sir.

600
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:02,010
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

601
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:03,841
Bloody fool!

602
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,183
This blasted fog.

603
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,686
It's like looking into a cake of ice.

604
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,188
I can't see a thing.

605
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:16,689
You see something out there...

606
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,690
it will have 15-inch guns.

607
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,693
The <i>Bismarck's</i>
got a solid foot of armor plate.

608
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,193
Who said so?

609
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,695
The gunnery officer, that's who.

610
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:28,199
He said we might as well
throw crumpets at her.

611
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,703
I wish someone would
throw a crumpet at me.

612
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:38,502
Ship bearing green 4-5!

613
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,737
Two ships bearing green 4-5!

614
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:46,077
Hard aport! Full ahead both!

615
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,115
Hard aport. Full ahead both, sir.

616
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,719
Shall we follow them, sir?

617
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,325
Steady on 1-3-0.

618
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,363
Steady on 1-3-0!

619
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,863
Yeoman, make to admiralty.

620
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:09,695
<i>Bismarck</i> and cruiser sighted.

621
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,701
Course...south.

622
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,202
My position...
Give latitude and longitude.

623
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,702
Get that off immediately...

624
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:17,706
in case we run into trouble.

625
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:19,035
Aye aye, sir.

626
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:20,040
Check radar.

627
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:22,201
Check your radar plot.

628
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,212
Enemy report from <i>Suffolk,</i> sir.

629
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,214
They've found her.

630
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,216
Picked her up in the Denmark Strait.

631
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,683
<i>Bismarck</i> and a heavy cruiser.

632
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,719
66-45 north...

633
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,720
26 west.

634
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,723
There, gentlemen.

635
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,224
Course southwest.

636
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,724
Now things are looking up.

637
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,227
Tell the first sea lord
immediately.

638
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:48,731
Good job we've got
some heavy stuff in the area.

639
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,232
Richards, let me have
an intercepting course...

640
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,234
for <i>Hood</i> and <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

641
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,235
Sir, this one's from the <i>Norfolk.</i>

642
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:56,735
<i>Norfolk's</i> there, too, sir.

643
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:58,238
She's with <i>Suffolk.</i>

644
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,740
They're shadowing
in thick fog, using radar.

645
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:02,673
I hope that radar
works better than usual.

646
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:05,302
She could blow them both
out of the water.

647
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,676
No. Lutjens is too clever for that.

648
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:10,181
He'd rather shake off a pair of cruisers...

649
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,682
than stop to sink them.

650
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,981
Course to intercept <i>Bismarck</i>
is 3-1-0.

651
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:17,486
That would bring <i>Hood</i> in contact...

652
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:19,853

I hope he's getting
all the help he needs.

You would be quite wrong
if you judged him too harshly.

He had his ship
blown from under him
last year in Norway.

This job here means promotion for him...

serving in the <i>Ark Royal.</i>

00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:53,145
Very good. Course 2-4-0.

817
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:56,889
Fire!

818
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:22,178
Give me a hand.

819
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:29,184
Hard aport. Steer 1-5-0.

820
00:43:30,753 --> 00:43:32,243
Make smoke.

821
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:43,195
She's badly damaged, sir.

822
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,856
She's turning away and making smoke.

823
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:51,962
Do you want to pursue?

824
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,005
No. We have more important work to do.

825
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:56,506
Hold your course.

826
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:58,007
Steady on present course.

827
00:43:58,075 --> 00:43:59,508
Very good, sir.

828
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:01,510
Captain, congratulations.

829
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:04,944
It's a great moment for the German navy.

830
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:06,447
Yes, Lindemann...

831
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,950
and for the two of us.

833
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,963
This morning, HMS <i>Hood...</i>

834
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:29,228
largest British warship,
was sunk by the...

[Speaking German]

838
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:48,482
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.

839
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,986
This island, which is
no stranger to bad tidings...

840
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:53,986
received news today that HMS <i>Hood...</i>

841
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:56,487
largest warship in the British fleet...

842
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:58,491
and pride of the British navy...

843
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:00,685
has been sunk by the German
battleship <i>Bismarck.</i>

844
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:03,922
From the <i>Hood's</i>
complement of 1,500 men...

845
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:05,428
there were three survivors.

846
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,929
In the same engagement...

847
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:09,933
the battleship <i>Prince of Wales</i>
was badly damaged.

848
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,436
Two British capital ships
have been put out of commission...

849
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,937
and the most powerful
battleship in the world...

850
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,438
is now loose on the high seas.

851
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,443
It remains to be seen
whether the British navy...

852
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,944
has the capability
at this crucial moment...

853
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:25,945
of concentrating enough sea power...

854
00:45:26,012 --> 00:45:27,946
to deal with the situation.

855
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,950
There is undoubtedly great
rejoicing in Berlin tonight...

856
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,645
and also on the <i>Bismarck.</i>

857
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:35,984
Here's to the ship, Lindemann...

858
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:37,988
and here's to us.

859
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:42,492
We have beaten the best they have.

860
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,993
Do you realize that?

861
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:44,993
Yes, sir.

862
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:47,496
They will never stop us, not now.

863
00:45:47,563 --> 00:45:49,497
You wanted the damage control report.

864
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:50,999
What is it?

865
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:54,002
We received one hit
forward on the port side...

866
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:55,502
over number two fuel tank.

867
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,003
We're losing a little oil.

868
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:58,163
Anything serious?

869
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,004
No, sir. I would say
the damage is very slight.

870
00:46:01,075 --> 00:46:03,600
However, I recommend we put about
and have it repaired.

871
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:07,875
Put about? You mean go home?

872
00:46:07,946 --> 00:46:11,143
Yes, sir. We could refuel
at the same time.

873
00:46:11,216 --> 00:46:12,945
Are you mad?

874
00:46:13,018 --> 00:46:16,476
We have fought our way out
into the Atlantic.

875
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:19,979
This is no time to turn
and run for home.

876
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,457
We wouldn't be running.

877
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:23,460
We've won a tremendous victory.

878
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,859
It's not the victory that was ordered.

879
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:28,954
You haven't been close
to the high command, Lindemann.

880
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:30,965
Do you know what will happen...

881
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,968
when Admiral Raeder
reports the sinking of the <i>Hood?</i>

882
00:46:34,035 --> 00:46:35,468
The fuehrer will smile...

883
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:37,471
and everyone else will smile...

884
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,472
and then, a few moments later...

885
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,974
he'll turn to Raeder with a scowl.

886
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,634
"What about the convoys, Raeder?

887
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,404
Have they sunk any convoys?"

888
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:47,969
There will still be
plenty of convoys, sir...

889
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:49,308
after we make repairs.

890
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:51,474
Is your ship unmaneuverable, Captain?

891
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,485
Are the guns damaged?
Anything out of action?

892
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:55,985
No, sir.

893
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:57,987
Then we will push forward...

894
00:46:58,054 --> 00:46:59,988
as instructed by the high command.

895
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:01,991
But surely the fuehrer must realize...

896
00:47:02,058 --> 00:47:05,926
Are you going to tell the fuehrer
what he must realize?

897
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:06,926
No, sir.

898
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:08,428
Then do not tell me.

899
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:09,929
For the time being...

900
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,431
we will hold our present
course and speed.

901
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,762
Yes, sir.

902
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,461
There will be no further
statement to the press...

903
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:17,969
not for the present.

904
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,472
Make a signal to admiral
commanding First Cruiser Squadron.

905
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,474
<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk</i>
must maintain contact...

906
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,974
with the <i>Bismarck...</i>

907
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:25,977
so that Home Fleet can intercept.

908
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,979
Continue shadowing as long
as you have fuel to do so.

909
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,479
Excuse me, sir.

910
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,981
This is <i>Bismarck's</i> latest
position, course, and speed.

911
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,985
Send it to the C-in-C,
Home Fleet right away.

912
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:37,485
Now, Shepard.

913
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,487
At its present speed, sir...

914
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:42,284
the Home Fleet cannot make
contact with <i>Bismarck...</i>

915
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,484
until tomorrow...

916
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:46,652
and then only if she maintains
her present course.

917
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:48,285
What if she doesn't?

918
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:51,490
That's it exactly, sir.
They won't make contact at all.

919
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:53,499
Prime minister for you, sir.

920
00:47:58,403 --> 00:47:59,995
First sea lord here.

921
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:01,505
Now, first sea lord...

922
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:04,439
I want to make it unmistakably clear...

923
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:06,942
that there is absolutely nothing
as vital...

924
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,445
to the nation at this moment...

925
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,242
as the destruction of the <i>Bismarck.</i>

926
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:14,442
You are authorized to employ...

927
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,144
any means at your disposal...

928
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,948
regardless of risk...

929
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,320
and regardless of the price
that must be paid.

930
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:27,452
This is a battle
we cannot afford to lose.

931
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:28,960
I understand, sir.

932
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:31,963
I don't care how you do it.

933
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,964
You must sink the <i>Bismarck.</i>

934
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:35,466
Good luck to you.

935
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:36,966
Thank you, sir.

936
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,974
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?

937
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,475
In my opinion, sir...

938
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,478
we cannot leave this entirely
to the Home Fleet.

939
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,979
We must reach out and pull in...

940
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:55,016
everything we can lay our hands on.

941
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,017
I've ordered <i>Rodney</i> to leave her convoy.

942
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,018
She was the last available ship.

943
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,020
I don't suggest this lightly, sir.

944
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:03,453
Down here at Gibraltar, we've Force H...

945
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,957
<i>Renown, Sheffield, Ark Royal.</i>

946
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,959
We can't strip the Western Mediterranean...

947
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,961
with this Crete business going on.

948
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:11,462
Perhaps if we left <i>Ark Royal</i> down there...

949
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:13,963
and sent the other two out.

950
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:15,557
No, sir.

951
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,466
We may need <i>Ark Royal's</i> aircraft.

952
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,969
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?

953
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:22,972
It's taking a serious risk.

954
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,473
I know Shepard has weighed
that very carefully.

955
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,634
In view of what the prime minister said...

956
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,769
we don't seem to have much choice.

957
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,473
Well, I may be able
to argue with you two...

958
00:49:33,547 --> 00:49:35,981
but I can't quarrel
with the prime minister.

959
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,483
Order Force H to sail.

960
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:38,984
Aye aye, sir.

961
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:47,152
Johnson.

962
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,317
Smith.

963
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:51,486
It's not for you, boy.

964
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:52,995
Stratton.

965
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:54,496
Singer.

966
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:55,997
Shepard.

967
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:57,500
Oh, thanks.

968
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:58,499
Thompson.

969
00:49:58,568 --> 00:50:00,001
Thompson, where are you?

970
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:01,502
<i>My dearest Tom...</i>

971
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,004
<i>I'm really much too tired to write...</i>

972
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:07,007
<i>but I think of you so very often...</i>

973
00:50:07,075 --> 00:50:08,508
<i>that I'm always afraid...</i>

974
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,511
<i>there may be things
I will forget to mention.</i>

975
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,011
Marvelous. No letter again.

976
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,514
Where are we off to this time?

977
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:17,015
Tom, is it true...

978
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:19,018
your father is director of operations?

979
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,518

since the battleship <i>Bismarck</i>
destroyed HMS <i>Hood.</i>

1092

pursuing her.

that the British navy
may have trouble finding her...

00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:14,285
Supposing <i>Bismarck</i> joins up with them...

1142
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:18,288
and all three of them
decide to come out together.

1143
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,947
What then?

1144
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,718
[Door Opens]

1145
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,226
What's the trouble?

1146
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,726
He just collapsed, sir.

1147
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,729
Take him in the office.

1148
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,789
Why is this man on duty if he's sick?

1149
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:32,298
I don't know, sir.
He didn't report sick.

1150
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,800
Get someone over here.

1151
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,963
Aye aye, sir. Simms, take over.

1152
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:40,239
All right. Leave him here.

1153
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:41,740
Aye aye, sir.

1154
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:42,798
Sorry, sir.

1155
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:45,710
Why the devil
didn't you report sick?

1156
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:47,245
I'm sorry, sir.

1157
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:50,714
I didn't want to miss anything.

1158
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:52,216
All right, Brown.

1159
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,219
We'll get you along to the sick bay.

1160
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:57,982
If anything happens, I'll let you know.

1161
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,521
Thank you, sir.

1162
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:02,024
What time is it, Miss Davis?

1163
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:03,526
About 6:30, sir.

1164
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,027
Morning or evening?

1165
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,028
It's a very fine morning.

1166
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,031
I think you should take a short walk.

1167
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,033
You haven't been outside
for five days.

1168
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,264
Take down this message
for Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet...

1169
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:19,271
Our interpretation
of best available information...

1170
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:22,273
indicates <i>Bismarck</i>
heading for the coast of France.

1171
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:24,003
Proceed accordingly.

1172
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:27,273
Sir, must you stick your neck out
quite so far?

1173
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:30,280
I'm afraid that goes with the job.

1174
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,281
To admiral commanding Force H...

1175
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:33,782
Proceed to intercept <i>Bismarck...</i>

1176
01:00:33,851 --> 01:00:36,285
on assumption she's headed for Brest.

1177
01:00:36,353 --> 01:00:39,254
Suggest search by aircraft
from <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1178
01:00:39,288 --> 01:00:42,791
Your son is in <i>Ark Royal</i>, isn't he, sir?

1179
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,281
Yes. Yes, he is.

1180
01:00:44,327 --> 01:00:46,795
Get that off immediately,
will you?

1181
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,260
Come in.

1182
01:01:28,328 --> 01:01:30,228
Come in, Miss Davis.

1183
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,229
Signal for you, sir.

1184
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,730
Thank you.

1185
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:42,170
This is a report on the
<i>Ark Royal's</i> air search.

1186
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,173
They haven't found a thing.

1187
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,673
Better tell Captain Shepard.

1188
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,971
Yes, sir.

1189
01:01:47,044 --> 01:01:49,171
Also, two of <i>Ark Royal's</i> aircraft...

1190
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:51,179
failed to return to the carrier.

1191
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:54,181
No need to tell him that,
I should think.

1192
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:57,707
By the way, how would you like
a trip to America?

1193
01:01:57,752 --> 01:01:59,117
America, sir?

1194
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:01,814
The admiralty's sending a mission over...

1195
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:04,413
Two regular officers and a Wren officer.

1196
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,685
The board picked you as first choice.

1197
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,250
It sounds very exciting.

1198
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:10,886
There will be no change, of course...

1199
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:13,397
until this <i>Bismarck</i> thing is settled.

1200
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,592
Aye aye, sir. Thank you very much.

1201
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:19,694
Yes, it would have to be
long-range aircraft...

1202
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,362
Catalinas, I should think.

1203
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,701
Yes, that's right. Call me back.

1204
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,899
Shepard.

1205
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,065
Sir?

1206
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,235
Seems our forces
are very heavily committed...

1207
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,245
to a single course of action.

1208
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:33,804
Is that based on the definite knowledge
that <i>Bismarck...</i>

1209
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:35,745
is headed for a French port?

1210
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:38,614
On definite knowledge?
No, sir.

1211
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:40,687
It's based on my summing up...

1212
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,345
of the general situation.

1213
01:02:42,422 --> 01:02:45,186
It was a decision that had to be made.

1214
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:47,225
I hope you're right, Shepard.

1215
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:49,523
I hope to God you're right.

1216
01:02:49,628 --> 01:02:51,687
A report from <i>Ark Royal,</i> sir.

1217
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:53,229
They haven't found anything.

1218
01:02:53,264 --> 01:02:54,731
All right.

1219
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:56,732
Are you off now, Miss Davis?

1220
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,235
Yes, sir. My watch ends at 7:00.

1221
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,238
I seem to have a lot of work
to do.

1222
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:04,239
Could you stay and help me out?

1223
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:06,241
Of course. I have a dinner date...

1224
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:08,242
but that's not until 9:00.

1225
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:10,244
Let me have the latest
information...

1226
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:12,246
on available aircraft
in Force H.

1227
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:13,746
Aye aye, sir.

1228
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,248
"Coastal command will activate
two crossover air patrols.

1229

"The northern-most will cover

1230
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:21,253
"from Brest to La Rochelle.

1231
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:24,745
The southern-most
will cover La Rochelle
to Cape Finisterre."

1232
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:27,758
If you'll coordinate that
with Coastal Command...

1233
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,761
I'll get on with the business
of Force H...

1234
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:33,262
and you can enjoy your dinner date.

1235
01:03:33,297 --> 01:03:36,266
At half-past one in the morning, sir?

1236
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:38,061
Oh, I'm sorry.

1237
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,499
I had no idea what time it was.

1238
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:42,434
By the way, Miss Davis...

1239
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:44,404
I'd like to make arrangements...

1240
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:46,599
for you to work with me full-time...

1241
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:48,505
if you can face it.

1242
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,510
What I had in mind...

1243
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,240
was to make you my assistant.

1244
01:03:54,314 --> 01:03:56,908
I appreciate you thinking of me, sir.

1245
01:03:56,981 --> 01:04:00,246
I need someone who's intelligent
and dependable...

1246
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,412
Quite honestly, someone like yourself.

1247
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:05,251
Well... what do you say?

1248
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:08,324
I don't know quite what to say, sir.

1249
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:11,326
I'd make an effort not to be so rude...

1250
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,124
as I have been in the past...

1251
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,130
if that's what's bothering you.

1252
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,131
It isn't anything like that.

1253
01:04:18,232 --> 01:04:20,462
If you want to say no,
please say so.

1254
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:21,369
Well, you see...

1255
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:22,131
Well, you see...

[Telephone Rings]

1257
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,299
Director of operations.

1258
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,366
One moment, please, sir.

1259
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:36,643
It's Captain Farnum... Casualty Section.

1260
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:03,768
Hello, Richard. Yes?

1261
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,929
What sort of bad news?

1262
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:15,278
Is there no other information?

1263
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,780
I see.

1264
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,284
Yes. I appreciate your telling me.

1265
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,944
Thank you, Richard.

1266
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:36,790
My son's missing.

1267
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:39,228
His plane ran out of fuel...

1268
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,926
and failed to return.

1269
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,229
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1270
01:05:43,302 --> 01:05:45,236
There's a good chance...

1271
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,237
he'll be picked up.

1272
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:49,033
<i>You</i> were picked up.

1273
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,768
When I got out of hospital...

1274
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:55,301
all I could think about
was getting back to London.

1275
01:05:55,345 --> 01:05:57,973
I wanted to see my wife.

1276
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:00,379
I took a taxi from Waterloo.

1277
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:03,782
As I drove into Welbeck Place...

1278
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:06,787
everything looked so familiar.

1279
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:11,315
Every house was just as I remembered it.

1280
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,953
Every house except mine.

1281
01:06:17,363 --> 01:06:20,821
There was a large
black hole in the ground...

1282
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,800
where my house had been...

1283
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:26,269
uh... where my wife had been.

1284
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:35,275
I didn't think it was possible
to feel such pain.

1285
01:06:36,879 --> 01:06:38,312
I know.

1286
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,474
I've been through it myself, and I know.

1287
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:44,745
I swore that night I'd never again...

1288
01:06:44,819 --> 01:06:47,788
get emotionally attached
to a human being...

1289
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:50,289
as long as I lived...

1290
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:53,292
but I made one mistake.

1291
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:55,293
I forgot about...

1292
01:06:55,327 --> 01:06:57,386
I forgot about my son.

1293
01:06:57,496 --> 01:07:00,260
You can't avoid pain
by fencing yourself off.

1294
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:03,094
Sometimes you need
the help of other people...

1295
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,758
more than anything else...

1296
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:08,202
but you have to let them get
close enough to help.

1297
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:10,272
I don't want any help.

1298
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:13,308
I found when I was deeply troubled...

1299
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:16,310
that I needed people very badly.

1300
01:07:16,344 --> 01:07:18,312
People want to be needed.

1301
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:19,938
I found that out, too.

1302
01:07:20,014 --> 01:07:21,538
We're in business again.

1303
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:24,777
<i>Bismarck's</i> been spotted
by a Catalina flying boat...

1304
01:07:24,852 --> 01:07:26,319
headed for Brest.

1305
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:28,343
Your hunch was right, sir.

1306
01:07:28,387 --> 01:07:29,854
Excuse me.

1307
01:07:29,888 --> 01:07:31,856
Sir, Captain Shepard has offered me...

1308
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,858
a new job to be his assistant.

1309
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:36,052
I'd like very much to take it.

1310
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,219
I hope you'll have no objection.

1311
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:40,924
Jonathan, what have you
done to that girl?

1312
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:43,761
She's just been offered
a marvelous opportunity...

1313
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:46,130
to go to America.
It means sure promotion.

1314
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:49,263
She's turning that down
to stay here with you.

1315
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,270
I don't understand it.

1316
01:07:51,372 --> 01:07:52,771
Here's the situation...

1317
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:55,775
The flying boat spotted
<i>Bismarck</i> at 1030

1318
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:57,777
and has been shadowing ever since...

1319
01:07:57,878 --> 01:07:59,140
using cloud cover.

1320
01:07:59,213 --> 01:08:00,771
Jonathan.

1321
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:02,781
I'm sorry, sir.

1322
01:08:02,882 --> 01:08:04,782
You were saying...

1323
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:07,283
the flying boat spotted
<i>Bismarck</i> at 1030

1324
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:09,286
and has been shadowing ever since...

1325
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:10,786
using cloud cover.

1326
01:08:10,888 --> 01:08:13,118
From time to time, <i>Bismarck</i> has put up...

1327
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,953
very heavy anti-aircraft fire.

1328
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,303
By now, the British know where we are.

1329
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:32,304
They'll send out everything they have.

1330
01:08:32,405 --> 01:08:34,805
We can sink anything they send out.

1331
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:36,808
What was your latest fuel report?

1332
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,741
We've lost about 200 tons...

1333
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,745
from the tanks that were damaged.

1334
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:42,246
We have 3 5% left.

1335
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:44,248
That is more than enough.

1336
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:46,249
I want to check the plot.

1337
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:48,750
Becker, keep me informed
about the fuel situation.

1338
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,176
I will, sir.

1339
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,586
I've requested air cover
from the <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

1340
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:55,624
How soon can we expect
them to be with us?

1341
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:57,626
Shore-based aircraft can operate...

1342
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,128
approximately that far
from the coast, sir.

1343
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:02,129
We will arrive at that point...

1344
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:03,596
about dawn tomorrow.

1345
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:05,633
What about <i>King George</i> and <i>Rodney?</i>

1346
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,634
What is their position now?

1347
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:09,669
Based on reports from Group West...

1348
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,136
I have them plotted...

1349
01:09:11,205 --> 01:09:13,673
200 miles to the north of us.

1350
01:09:13,705 --> 01:09:15,138
That is good.

1351
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:17,675
They cannot possibly overtake us now.

1352
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:20,679
A day or so in Brest to make repairs...

1353
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:23,976
and then we come out again
with our tanks full.

1354
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:28,644
Also, Lindemann... I have an idea.

1355
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:32,677
Suppose <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and <i>Gneisenau</i> came out with us.

1356
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:36,179
We would be the most powerful
fleet that ever sailed.

1357
01:09:36,224 --> 01:09:39,091
Nothing in the world could touch us.

1358
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:40,924
Excuse me, sir. Personal signal...

1359
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:42,587
for the fleet commander.

1360
01:09:42,663 --> 01:09:44,096
Thank you, Mueller.

1361
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,101
"Best wishes on your birthday."

1362
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,602
Look.

1363
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:54,764
Adolf Hitler.

1364
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:00,109
This is a great honor.

1365
01:10:00,178 --> 01:10:03,113
Yes, please. Right.

1366
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,113
Here are the fuel consumption reports...

1367
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:07,115
for <i>K.G. V</i> and <i>Rodney</i>, sir...

1368
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:09,617
as close as I can calculate them.

1369
01:10:09,686 --> 01:10:11,620
Don't look too good, do they?

1370
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:14,178
They're 140 miles astern of <i>Bismarck.</i>

1371
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:17,225
Can they steam at full speed
long enough to overtake her?

1372
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,226
They wouldn't have enough fuel
to get home.

1373
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:23,628
Sir.

1374
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,633
By daylight tomorrow, <i>Bismarck</i> will be...

1375
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:30,635
in range of German air cover.

1376
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,637
They'll send out the whole <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

1377
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:34,638
And a line of U-boats.

1378
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:37,140
We have to slow her down by tonight...

1379
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:39,072
so Home Fleet can overtake her...

1380
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:41,075
before she gets into friendly waters.

1381
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,578
<i>Renown</i> and <i>Sheffield</i> can't do it.

1382
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:45,580
That leaves <i>Ark Royal</i>.

1383
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:49,583
10 hours of daylight left.

1384
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:51,117
Call it 9 1/2.

1385
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:54,121
There's time to get off
one air strike anyway.

1386
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,622
With luck, they might get off two.

1387
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,123
Yes, sir.

1388
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:01,126
We'd better get in touch with <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1389
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:11,101
Your torpedoes have been fitted
with new magnetic exploders...

1390
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:13,104
so you should get good results.

1391
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:14,763
You have <i>Bismarck's</i> position...

1392
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:16,271
course, and speed.

1393
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:19,570
She's now 2 4 miles away,
bearing 183 degrees.

1394
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:22,610
She's all by herself,
so make your attack immediately.

1395
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,612
Oh, there's just one final word.

1396
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:26,614
The Home Fleet's 100 miles astern.

1397
01:11:26,647 --> 01:11:30,105
Unless you stop <i>Bismarck</i> today,
they'll never catch her.

1398
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:33,243
It's up to you, gentlemen. Good day.

1399
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:51,532
The <i>Sheffield's</i> been detached
from the flagship, sir.

1400
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:54,537
She was ordered to close
<i>Bismarck</i> and shadow her.

1401
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:56,037
How long ago?

1402
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,038
1 1/2 hours.

1403
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,539
1 1/2 hours?

1404
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,542
It wasn't decoded immediately, sir...

1405
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,543
because it wasn't addressed to us.

1406
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,545
We just happened to pick it up, sir.

1407
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,547
Our pilots have orders to attack...

1408
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,548
any ship alone in that area.

1409
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:12,049
Send a message to all aircraft...

1410
01:12:12,117 --> 01:12:13,709
"Look out for <i>Sheffield.</i>"

1411
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:16,051
Send it in plain language
immediately.

1412
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:17,554
Aye aye, sir.

1413
01:12:17,622 --> 01:12:19,988
Bit of a cockup somewhere.

1414
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:41,870
It's the <i>Bismarck</i>, all right!

1415
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,545
It's all right. They're ours...swordfish.

1416
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,051
Sounds as if they're going to fly
right over us, sir.

1417
01:12:53,117 --> 01:12:55,551
They're using our position
to get their bearings.

1418
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,054
I can see them now, sir. There they are.

1419
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:01,112
They're attacking us!

1420
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:06,260
Full ahead both! Hard aport!

1421
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:08,956
All guns, hold your fire!

1422
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:15,893
Torpedo exploded
as it hit the water, sir.

1423
01:13:17,472 --> 01:13:18,962
There's another one.

1424
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:26,443
They're exploding short.
What's the matter?

1425
01:13:26,512 --> 01:13:28,639
It's those damn magnetic exploders.

1426
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,274
Here comes one that didn't explode, sir.

1427
01:13:35,352 --> 01:13:36,683
Hard astarboard.

1428
01:13:36,753 --> 01:13:38,118
Hard astarboard.

1429
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:47,784
That was the <i>Sheffield</i>, sir...
just came from the carrier.

1430
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:49,796
Signal the other aircraft.

1431
01:13:49,864 --> 01:13:52,697
Tell them to break off the attack.

1432
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,290
Wheel amidships.

1433
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:55,800
Wheel amidships, sir.

1434
01:14:07,879 --> 01:14:10,313
We all feel the same
about what's happened...

1435
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,439
so there's no point in discussing it.

1436
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:15,349
Let's just say we've learned
a very important lesson...

1437
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,851
which may well prove
a blessing in disguise.

1438
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,514
All right, let's get on with the job.

1439
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,853
There's still enough light
for one more attack.

1440
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,687
Think you're up to it?

1441
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:26,726
Yes, but what about
those magnetic exploders?

1442
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:28,194
They're being changed.

1443
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,231
We'll go back to contact exploders.

1444
01:14:30,296 --> 01:14:32,856
Keep your seats, gentlemen.

1445
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:38,131
I have a message here
from the Commander-in-Chief.

1446
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:41,297
"Unless the enemy's speed
has been reduced by midnight...

1447
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:44,831
"<i>King George V</i> will
have to abandon the chase...

1448
01:14:44,874 --> 01:14:46,842
and turn back for refueling."

1449
01:14:46,877 --> 01:14:49,846
There's no need to tell you
what that means.

1450
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:52,040
This is our last chance, gentlemen.

1451
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:55,811
I suggest you go below
and get something to eat.

1452
01:14:55,884 --> 01:14:58,853
You'll be taking off at 1830.

1453
01:15:02,523 --> 01:15:04,320
[Bells Ringing]

1454
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:27,775
Skipper! Ship bearing green 4-5.

1455
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,380
This is it, boys! Come on, let's go!

1456
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:50,491
Hard astarboard!

1457
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:24,187
Where was that?

1458
01:16:24,256 --> 01:16:26,190
Amidships. No serious damage, sir.

1459
01:16:26,258 --> 01:16:27,691
Thank you, Mueller.

1460
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:29,886
Tell damage control to keep us informed.

1461
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:38,298
Hard astarboard!

1462
01:17:00,118 --> 01:17:01,915
Hard aport!

1463
01:17:09,893 --> 01:17:12,327
[Buzzer]

1464
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,828
Captain.

1465
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,160
Hit in the steering compartment, sir.

1466
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,200
Put your rudder amidships.

1467
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,495
Rudder amidships.

1468
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:29,170
The rudder won't move, sir.

1469
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,815
What ships are these?

1470
01:17:39,884 --> 01:17:41,317
The 4th Destroyer Flotilla, sir.

1471
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:42,818
They're getting close.

1472
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:46,345
We picked up two
very peculiar reports
from Coastal Command...

1473
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:47,822
following the attack by <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1474
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,858
The first one says,
"<i>Bismarck</i> circling."

1475
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:52,360
The second one reads,
"<i>Bismarck</i> heading nor-norwest."

1476
01:17:52,395 --> 01:17:55,262
Nor-norwest?
That's impossible, sir.

1477
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,766
She'd be headed straight
for <i>K.G. V</i> and <i>Rodney.</i>

1478
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,266
Sounds like faulty identification.

1479
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:01,767
Wrong ship, most likely.

1480
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,665
Sir? Signal from <i>Sheffield.</i>

1481
01:18:03,737 --> 01:18:05,329
They made contact with <i>Bismarck.</i>

1482
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:07,100
She's steering north at 10 knots.

1483
01:18:08,907 --> 01:18:10,340
That's incredible!

1484
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:11,841
It must be <i>Bismarck.</i>

1485
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:14,504
But what's she doing on that course...

1486
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:17,343
and at a speed of 10 knots?

1487
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:19,882
Hit by a torpedo, I'll bet...

1488
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:20,849
and damaged.

1489
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:22,350
Propellers?

1490
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:23,850
Could be, sir.

1491
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,353
Or rudder, can't maneuver.

1492
01:18:25,421 --> 01:18:27,889
We've got a chance now, sir.

1493
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:29,891
I think we've got a chance.

1494
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:43,495
Yes.

1495
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:45,298
It's the <i>Bismarck</i>, all right.

1496
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:46,804
Yeoman?

1497
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:48,305
Sir?

1498
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:51,309
Make to <i>Solent...</i>
intend to attack with torpedoes.

1499
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,808
Ships turning to port.

1500
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:54,309
Firing range 4,000 yards.

1501
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:55,744
Aye aye, sir.

1502
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:57,110
Bring on 30 knots.

1503
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,477
300 revolutions.

1504
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:01,812
[Yeoman] From Captain D, sir.

1505
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:03,818
Speed 30 knots.

1506
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:06,320
Turning to port to fire torpedoes.

1507
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:07,821
Firing range 4,000 yards.

1508
01:19:07,889 --> 01:19:10,449
Good! Then it is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1509
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:17,364
Damage control.

1510
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:18,364
Damage control.

1511
01:19:18,431 --> 01:19:20,797
Damage control, sir.

1512
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:22,356
Captain speaking.

1513
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:24,902
I want a report on that rudder.

1514
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,904
The divers are down now.

1515
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,599
They'll be up in a moment, sir.

1516
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:39,345
Range 6,000 yards, sir.

1517
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,310
Yes.

1518
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:45,818
I see.

1519
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:48,321
It's impossible
to free the rudder, sir.

1520
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:50,822
It was jammed too badly
by the explosion.

1521
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:52,324
How early in the morning...

1522
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:55,827
can you put a couple
of divers over the side?

1523
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:57,328
At first light, sir...

1524
01:19:57,396 --> 01:19:59,830
about 5:00 if the sea is not too rough.

1525
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:01,832
I do not care about the sea.

1526
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:04,333
I was thinking about the men, sir.

1527
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:05,834
Sir, from fleet commander.

1528
01:20:05,904 --> 01:20:07,337
Thank you.

1529
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,841
Ah.

1530
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:17,345
"Group West is sending out three
seagoing tugs.

1531
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,347
"All submarines
in the area have been ordered...

1532
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,349
to concentrate at this point."

1533
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:23,848
That is good.

1534
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:25,282
That is very good.

1535
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:29,881
Range 5,000.

1536
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,092
Attention all hands.

1537
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:36,854
Attention all hands.

1538
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:40,294
This is the fleet commander.

1539
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:41,797
We are having some difficulty...

1540
01:20:41,865 --> 01:20:44,459
repairing the damage
to our steering gear...

1541
01:20:44,533 --> 01:20:48,333
but I assure you
there is no cause for alarm.

1542
01:20:48,405 --> 01:20:50,100
4,500 yards, sir.

1543
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:52,139
Stand by the torpedo tubes.

1544
01:20:52,173 --> 01:20:53,936
Stand by the torpedo tubes.

1545
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,602
By morning, we will be in good hands.

1546
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,668
And if the British Home Fleet...

1547
01:20:58,712 --> 01:21:00,680
should be foolish enough to appear...

1548
01:21:00,714 --> 01:21:03,239
they will be torpedoed by U-boats.

1549
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:05,284
Meanwhile, let me remind you...

1550
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,376
that our guns have not been damaged.

1551
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:10,718
This is still the most
powerful ship afloat.

1552
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:15,224
I have in my hand a message...

1553
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:16,816
addressed to the entire crew.

1554
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:19,987
"All Germany is at your side.

1555
01:21:20,063 --> 01:21:24,227
"Your gallantry is
an inspiration to our people.

1556
01:21:24,299 --> 01:21:27,234
"You will forever occupy
a place of honor...

1557
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:32,261
in the history of the Third Reich."

1558
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,502
This message is signed by the fuehrer.

1559
01:21:35,575 --> 01:21:37,042
Range 4,000 yards, sir.

1560
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:40,204
Port 20, fire when the sights come on.

1561
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:47,183
Two enemy destroyers on port bow, sir.

1562
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,718
Alarm port.

1563
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:49,912
Alarm port, sir!

1564
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,081
[Alarm]

1565
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:00,361
Range 4,000, bearing 300 degrees.

1566
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:01,861
Guns ready port.

1567
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,363
Guns ready port, sir.

1568
01:22:03,431 --> 01:22:05,194
Illuminate with star shell.

1569
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:08,031
Illuminate with star shell.

1570
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,473
They've seen us!

1571
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,338
Now we're for it!

1572
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:19,707
20 degrees to go, sir.

1573
01:22:19,779 --> 01:22:21,076
Fire!

1574
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,712
All torpedoes gone, sir.

1575
01:22:27,784 --> 01:22:30,252
Let's get out of here. Hard aport.

1576
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:31,481
Open fire main armament.

1577
01:22:39,394 --> 01:22:40,827
Torpedo hit amidship, sir.

1578
01:22:40,896 --> 01:22:42,727
Good man!

1579
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:43,785
Fire!

1580
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:54,933
She's got the <i>Solent.</i>

1581
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:56,702
Good shooting, Lindemann.

1582
01:22:56,774 --> 01:22:58,207
Cease firing! Cease firing!

1583
01:22:58,275 --> 01:23:01,711
One hit on the armor
near the forward boiling room.

1584
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,213
The damage can be repaired...

1585
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,544
and it won't affect our speed, sir.

1586
01:23:05,615 --> 01:23:06,877
Thank you.

1587
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,144
That is good.

1588
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:13,220
Destroyers are still shadowing, sir.

1589
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,724
They have orders
to keep track of the <i>Bismarck...</i>

1590
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,224
until the Home Fleet closes.

1591
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:20,225
They claim three hits with torpedoes.

1592
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:22,227
It hasn't even slowed her down.

1593
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,730
What about the reports
of enemy submarines?

1594
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:26,230
A.C.N.S. says these have been confirmed.

1595
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,731
I've notified the Commander-in-Chief.

1596
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,098
What is C-in-C doing about it?

1597
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:31,636
He hasn't altered his plans.

1598
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,637
I'd like to send him a signal...

1599
01:23:33,705 --> 01:23:34,967
telling him to be careful...

1600
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:36,370
but I'm sure he'd resent it.

1601
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:39,998
Cigarette?

1602
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:41,406
Thank you, no, sir.

1603
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:43,503
I'll be here if you want me.

1604
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,309
Shepard?

1605
01:23:45,381 --> 01:23:47,815
Sorry about your son.

1606
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:51,745
Yes, sir.

1607
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,025
Captain Shepard, sir.

1608
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,525
Hmm?

1609
01:24:01,593 --> 01:24:03,026
Excuse me, sir.

1610
01:24:03,096 --> 01:24:04,529
I took in an operational signal...

1611
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:06,531
from one of the destroyers
shadowing the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1612
01:24:06,598 --> 01:24:09,567
They picked up three flyers
in a rubber boat.

1613
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,034
Must have been over an hour ago...

1614
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:14,037
so I couldn't get off in time.

1615
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:15,537
I heard about your son...

1616
01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:17,539
so I thought I'd tell you.

1617
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:20,041
It might not be him at all, sir...

1618
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,076
but you never know.

1619
01:24:22,143 --> 01:24:24,077
Thank you.

1620
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:26,080
Thank you very much.

1621
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,586
Oh, sir, A.C.N.S. has been calling you.

1622
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:36,088

Assistant chief of staff, please.

1624
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:01,041
Yes, sir.

Jonathan, I've got
the most marvelous news.

Your son is alive and well.

1628
01:25:09,482 --> 01:25:11,416
He's been picked up by a destroyer.

1629
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:15,052
This is absolutely official.

1630
01:25:15,121 --> 01:25:17,555
Farnum got the message half an hour ago.

1631
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:21,555
Jonathan?

1632
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:22,923

What did he say, sir?

1636
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:35,133
He didn't say anything.

1637
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,199
Well, will you excuse me, sir?

1638
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:12,566
Signal for Captain Shepard.

1639
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,067
I'll take it.

1640
01:26:14,134 --> 01:26:15,567
It's from <i>King George V.</i>

[Richards] What is it?

1642

They've sighted <i>Bismarck</i>, sir.

01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,073
Oh! Here comes the main event.

1644
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,574
Urgent signal for you, sir.

1645
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,241
Right gun load.

How much fuel have we got left?

1649
01:26:51,565 --> 01:26:55,023
We shall have to
break off action in two hours, sir.

1650
01:26:57,604 --> 01:26:59,037
Main armament ready.

1651

Enemy speed 10 knots.

Course 3-5-0, sir.

1653
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,214
They outnumber us 2 to 1...

1654
01:27:12,282 --> 01:27:15,217
and we can't do more than 10 knots.

1655
01:27:15,285 --> 01:27:17,219
What are you saying, Captain?

1656
01:27:17,285 --> 01:27:19,549
This is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1657
01:27:19,622 --> 01:27:22,056
We still have all our guns...

1658

All right.

I thought I'd be
cheering, sir, at this point...

They can't, sir.
They're trapped by the fire.

There's too much
