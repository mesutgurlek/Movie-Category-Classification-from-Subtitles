1
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,915
(Man) What... What do you want to know?

2
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,312
I live in a shit barracks,
constant threat,

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,792
I could get shot at any minute,
through any window.

4
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:46,272
I wake up every morning,
do the same patrols every day.

5
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,475
Basically,
the only thing I'm fighting for

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,631
that I know that I'm fighting for,

7
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,428
is to make it home each and every
day without getting killed.

8
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,715
Because I don't know why we're here.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,192
Well, I know why we're here,
but I don't know...

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,157
Yeah. I don't know why we're here.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,476
I mean, I've seen a, I'd say
about a 60-year-old woman

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,076
all dressed in black in a burka,
whatever they call them dresses,

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,232
pull out a AK from under her skirt
and start spraying.

14
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:18,752
Needless to say, she got...

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,629
I mean, she became a combatant,
and that's the truth, you know.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,951
Man, woman, child, if they pick up
a gun and start shooting at you,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,315
they're considered a combatant.
That's reality.

18
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:34,076
It's also just like hunting.

19
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,835
I've hunted deer
and coyotes and shit.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,436
It's like,
a person thinks the same...

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,275
tries to think like another
person would with a weapon.

22
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,593
So it's the ultimate style of
hunting, is war.

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,996
This is the Planet Earth, the body,
right?

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,752
The body's Planet Earth.

25
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:04,389
And Iraq is the corn hole.

26
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:08,268
The brown hole, the asshole,
whatever you wanna call it.

27
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,193
With a bunch of dingle berries,
insurgents...

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,079
A bunch of dingleberries
hanging around

29
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,709
just waiting for a shit storm.

30
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,828
And we just happen to be the fucking
turds going through the asshole,

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,073
and all the dingleberries are
surrounding us, trying to kill us.

32
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,878
That's what I think about Iraq.
It's a giant butthole.

- Oorah, Marines!
- Oorah, sir!

628
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,912
Hey, gather round. I'm gonna say
a prayer for PFC Cuthbert.

629
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,638
Bow your heads.

630
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,316
Lord, we lost
a great, young warrior today.

631
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,231
But the battle was won.

632
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,710
Please give his family the strength
to move on with their lives.

633
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,758
We know he's in a better place
with you, Lord.

634
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:38,196
Please give the United States
Marine Corps

635
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:40,793
the courage and ability

636
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,192
to destroy our enemy who hides
like cowards amongst civilians.

637
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,433
We thank you, Lord.

638
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:54,469
We have to make some difficult
decisions sometimes out here.

639

644
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,555
Yes, sir?

645
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,353
You handled yourself like
a true professional out there.

646
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:18,478
I'm gonna promote you to sergeant
and recommend you for the bronze star.

- Thank you, sir.
- You kept your head in the game...

648
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,276
...and kept your Marines alive.
Good to go?

649
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,557
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- All right, job well done, Marine.

No, man.

I keep seeing these fucking bodies, man.

660

fucking dead.

It's more like the women.

fucking mother laying next to them.

understands it either, man.
