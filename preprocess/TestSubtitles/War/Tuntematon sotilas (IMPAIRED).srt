You ever heard of a bear
killing three men?

143

Well, it's what Janzer claims.

it's a bear.

Jesus, man!

161
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,361
What's up?

162
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,597
That's a really nice bike
you got there.

163
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,037
My sister's got a tutu
that'll match that real good.

164
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,438
I hope it's pretty.

165
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,033
Look, I ain't going back here
next year. Got that?

166
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,669
You and I
don't like each other.

167
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,373
We don't have
to like each other.

168
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,279
We just have
to work together.

169
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,081
Unless you get an incomplete,
I suggest you be
at the town meeting tonight.

170
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,620
Why is that, Jay?

171
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,680
Because you said yourself
bears are an endangered
species.

172
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,521
It's grizzlies.

173
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,561
Okay, whatever,
dick Britannica.

174
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,061
Just be there, right?

175
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,896
[tires screech]

176
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,366
Oh, yeah.
By the way,

177
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,030
my cousin Jenny,
she likes you.

178
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,199
Don't ask me why.

179
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,174
She's gonna be there
tonight, too.

Jenny, Richard.
Richard, Jenny.

184
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,461
You're the one
that's coming with us
to the mountains this weekend.

185
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,364
What? No.

186
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,992
Jenny wants to come
along too,

187
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,469
but I told her I didn't think
that was a good idea.

188
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,766
That wouldn't be.

189
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,808
Why? I can handle it
myself, okay?

190
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,338
Can you hear me?

191
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,675
Good evening.

192
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,945
Uh...the Mayor
isn't here, yet.

193
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,543
So I think
I'll just get started.

194
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,755
I wanna thank all of you
for coming out tonight.

195
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:29,022
I know many of you are busy
getting ready
for the tourist season,

196
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,498
so... I'll just cut
to the chase.

197
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,501
Yesterday, as some of you
already know,

198
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,800
there was a bear attack
up on Echo Mountain.

199
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,397
Unfortunately,
three men were killed

200
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,705
and a fourth
was very, very lucky.

201
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,768
Taku He has returned.

202
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,679
Ed Janzer was found
by ranger Eagleheart

203
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,115
who happened to be
in the area of the attack.
[door closes]

204
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,653
Mr. Mayor.

205
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,315
And brought back
to town.

206
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,828
Ed was shaken up pretty badly,
but I'm happy to report
he's going to be alright.

207
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,730
I've contacted
the Federal Game Warden.

208
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,825
They have a couple
of Karelian bear dogs

209
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,234
who'll track the animal down
and kill it.

210
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,569
The problem is
they're over in Montana
right now

211
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,973
and won't be able
to get here for a few days.

212
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,034
I think you'll see
after looking it over

213
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,376
we really don't have much
to worry about.

214
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,542
Not much to worry about?
Sheriff, what about the tourists?

215
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:29,918
I'm sure the Mayor
will wanna comment on that but, uh,

216
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,981
my concern is for your safety
and the safety of our visitors.

217
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,822
What are we supposed to do
in the mean time, stay inside?

218
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,419
(Kassel)
No.

219
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,260
For what it's worth,
those men were up there illegally

220
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,664
and probably got between
the saw and her cubs.

221
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,828
If they go up there
and shoot that bear,

222
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,895
then the press
is gonna come up here.

223
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,204
We sure as hell don't need
any one dredging up ridiculous
monster stories again.

224
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,610
Exactly. That's why
there isn't going to be
any press coverage.

225
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,148
Our town needs
those tourism dollars.

226
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,515
How the bear's handled
is our business.
The important thing for us

227
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,146
is you just keep doing
what we've done for years.

228
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,090
We can't let
misguided reporters and crazy rumors

229
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,854
ruin our good town.

230
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,328
(Jenny )
Why do they have
to kill the bear?

231
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,060
When a bear kills a human,
they usually destroy it.

232
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,931
Would you kill it?

233
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,238
Me? No.

234
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,965
You gonna take
that shot or what?

235
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,270
Here's 20.
Says you gonna scratch again.

236
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,612
I can't believe you boys
are in here playing pool
and bullshitting

237
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,414
when your buddies
are rotting up on that mountain,

238
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,944
'cause of some pied-face
park ranger.

239
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:44,121
The way we hear
was that that Indian saved your heart.

240
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:48,223
Besides, Sheriff said
if anyone was caught up there,
we were gonna get arrested.

241
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,169
Ray, when in your life
have you ever paid attention to law?

242
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,697
That Indian's gonna have
his ass handed to him.

243
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,902
I bet you money on that.

244
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,212
They way
he took care of you?

245
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,613
Son of a bitch!

246
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,980
Come on!

247
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,451
( Ed)
What are you doing to me?
We're you there?

248
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,181
I had that bear
in my sights.

249
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,554
(Ed)
I came too, boys.

250
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,256
The boys
were ripped to pieces.

251
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,230
( Ed)
I've never seen
that much blood.

252
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,829
Who's with me?

253
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,201
This thing has got "A" written
all over it.

254
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,138
That's A for ass.

255
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,871
Alright, genius, wha--
what do you wanna do, huh?

256
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,744
You wanna go hit the library?
Stick your nose in a book?

257
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,181
Copy some pictures, huh?

258
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,583
That sounds
real exciting, dude!

259
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,021
You're pitiful, man.
No wonder you're still a virgin.

260
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,389
I just wanna have
a good time, alright?

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,556
Look, I'm gonna give you
an equation for you to learn.
This is very important.

262
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,500
Couple of girls
plus couple of beers equals fun!

263
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,867
And what about
graduating, huh?

264
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,607
Did you say
a couple of girls?

265
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,074
[laughs]

266
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,401
Evening, Trish.

267
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,275
Bye, Eddie.

268
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,920
[keys jingle]

269
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,825
How are you doing, Kassel?

270
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,323
Evening, Ed.

271
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,797
Look, I already told you
everything I know.

272
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,562
Right when I seen that bear
l got knocked out.

273
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,127
Would you like to check?

274
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,299
That's not what
I'm concerned about, Ed.

275
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,867
I'm concerned that
you might be planning
on doing something stupid.

276
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,505
Something
you might regret.

277
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,539
Wouldn't be
the first time.

278
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,711
It'll be the last
if you go near
Echo Mountain again.

279
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,884
Poaching is a crime, Ed.

280
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,687
The only reason you're not
behind bars tonight

281
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,388
is because
your buddies are dead.

282
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,729
So, if you're even thinking
about going back there, think again.

283
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,066
Thanks for this talk, Sheriff.

284
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,399
Go home, Ed.

285
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,916
(woman )
Who is going again?

286
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,579
Me, Jenny,
Rich, and Shea.

287
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,054
It's bad enough
I'm letting you take your cousin.

288
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,354
Momma, come on!
Shea is Richard's girlfriend, okay?

289
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,590
When we'll you be back?
And who's Rich?

290
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,929
Sunday or Monday.
Rich Winslow, Doris Winslow's son.

291
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,630
Oh, oh, Doris,
from the diner.
Nice lady.

292
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,734
Since when are you friends
with her son?

293
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,743
Oh, my God, mom!
I told you.

294
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,109
I just need his brains
so I can pass biology,

295
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,273
so I can graduate,
remember?

296
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,044
Well, I suppose.

297
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:31,454
Just stay away
from where the bear is.
And no drinking!

298
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,755
Don't worry, mom.
I'll be too busy working
on my six pack to drink.

299
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,455
[country music]

(Leo )
Woo!
Now we're huntin' boys!

301
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,495
Yeah. When you shut your mouth
and open your eyes,
then you'll be hunting.

302
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,902
Okay.
So, what's the plan?

303
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,635
We're gonna drive
over these two next ridges
as far as we can get

304
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,472
and we're gonna
set up camp.

305
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,845
A beer.

306
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,079
Hey, are you really
gonna kill Eagleheart
if we come across him?

307
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,923
I'm gonna make me
a bear claw necklace.

308
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,086
[all laugh]

309
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,757
Look, we've been over this.

310
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,598
All I'm asking
is for permission to go
in there with a few guys

311
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,864
before your men
with the dogs get here.

312
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,803
Before somebody else
gets killed!

313
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,774

<i>We need that in writing.</i>

314
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,605
You need it in writing?

315
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,168
Approved by a judge.
Great.

316
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,845

<i>We need it in writing.</i>
<i>It has to be legal.</i>

317
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,887
Okay, fine.
I'll play your little game.

318
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,583
But know this.
One more person
from this town gets killed,

319
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,422
and I'll shove
that court injunction
so far up your ass

320
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,224
your gums will bleed.

321
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,162
You too, Sir.
Have a nice day.

322
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,134
That better be the Game Warden
saying he's gonna be here
first thing in the morning.

323
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,192
You missed some.

324
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,262
Huh?

Tasty cream filling?

326
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,505
Look, so far I've managed
to keep this tale from growing legs

327
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,104
and turning it into another
Echo Mountain legend.

328
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,376
It was a massacre actually.

329
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,578
The point is
you need to hold up your end

330
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,485
and get this bear
taken care of.

331
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,218
I don't want it
transplant it, either. I want it dead.

332
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,351
We can't have the thing
coming back here.

333
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:19,488
I know, I know.
We can't have the tourists getting eaten alive.

334
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,557
Is that all you care about?
The tourists?

335
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,795
The tourists
pay my salary.

336
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,395
And they pay
your salary.

337
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:32,136
Do your job,
Sheriff Kassel, while you still have one.

338
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,904
Yes, Sir!

It's 12:15.

344
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,999
I told you bear bull
was going to fail out on us.

345
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,568
He'll be here.

346
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,840
He won't!

347
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,404
Trust me.

348
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,711
Just so you know,
the grizzly bear stands over nine feet tall

349
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,883
and weighs
over 1,500 pounds.

350
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,427

You stupid
son of a bitch!

So what we doin'?
Huntin' or campin'?

360
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,595
What are we gonna do
with my jeep?
Just leave it here?

361
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,504
You're the one
that ran out of gas.
What do you think?

362
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,564
Go and get elated.

out of here now? Walk?

Good camp spot

And I got dinner, too.

We got steaks tonight, Tom!

You're a hot nail.
C'mon!

You left a note.
You told me your parents said
it was gonna be okay.

377
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,785
Since when do you care
what my parents think
about you?

378

Looks like someone
couldn't wait.

384
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,390
(Jay )
You think we should go ahead
and drive through?

385
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,456
No, there's no reason to.
The trail starts right here.

386
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,560
Are we gonna like
close to where
the attacks were?

387
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,073
I don't know.
They didn't say last night.
They said up by the falls.

388
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,405
Are we gonna go
up there?

389
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,240
I don't see why not!

390
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:03,711
I suppose you brought the guns
seeing that you're dying to go
where the action is.

391
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,691
No. My old man locked up
the gun cabinet before he left.
He hid the key.

I brought bear repellent.

that are just tuning in right now.

This is the real deal
right here.
There's no fake stuff going on.

404
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,765
This is the tale of,
one, two, three, four horny kids

405
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,463
and their journey
up into the back country.

406

The journey
that will lead them face to face

with the killer
the grizzly bear.

408

could be their last.

Sure, why not?

Don't you get scared?

No. I don't feel it's
anymore scared of you
than you are of it.

So you think this bear
is scared of us?

it was a bear.

what I think killed those men?

What is it?

Nothing. I have the feeling
that something's watching me.

just set up the tents

and handsome.

it was the same bear that--

in killing anybody.

Jay, grow up.

467
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:41,814
What?

468
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,827
I'm gonna go change.

469
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,221
I would've run.

470
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,459
(Richard)
Oh, no.

471
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,058
You never outrun a bear.

472
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,604
It's the whole fight
or flight response.

473
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,640
If you flee, you're just--
you're like a rabbit
or a deer,

474
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:01,611
but if you stay
and if you hold your ground,
then you might have a chance.

475
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,546
Dude, you are so
full of crap.

476
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,413
I don't believe
a word of this.
Damn!

477
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,577
(Rich)
Really?
Okay.

478
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,644
What about
a thousand words?

479
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,330
(Jay shouting )
Deal!

480
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,390
Jay! Oh, my God,
you're such a pervert!
Get out of here.

481
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:27,268
I'm just recording
the scenery
for my project, baby.

482
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
[eagle screech]

483
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,681
[birds chirp]

484
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,042
[smells]

485
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,525
[loud cricket chirping]

486
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,133
You cook like you drive.

487
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,362
Yeah, you just
keep it up, Ed.

488
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,667
You'll be gettin' hit
on the head again

489
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,004
and this time
it won't be from no bear.

490
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,512
How many times I gotta tell you
it was no bear
hitting on my head.

491
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,069
It was cheap dumb ass!

492
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,012
[men voices]

493
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,345
You see that?

494
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,748
[men laughing]

495
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,582
Be quiet for a minute.

496
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,645
What?

497
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,191
I don't know.
I thought I saw something.

498
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,786
It's the woods.
Stuff moves. Now cook.

499
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,594
Leo, cook, damn it!

500
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,132
Mac cheese and ketchup.

501
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,573
It's a dinner
of champions, baby.
Yeah! What!

502
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,679
(Jay)
M mm, mmm.

503
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,573
Hey, want some?

504
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,810
No, thanks.

505
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,215
(Jay)
Tastes good.

506
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:25,086
I'm sure
after next year,
when we all broke college

507
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,750
we'll be sick and tired
of Mac and cheese.

508
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,487
Why don't you tell us
a story Rich?

509
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,256
Something scary.

510
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,299
We need to decide
who's sleeping
in which tent.

511
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,563
I mean, if you're gonna go
tell scary stories,

512
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,662
specially ones
having to do with bears,

513
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,368
(Shea)
I'm not gonna sleep alone.
Jay?

514
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,037
What?
I didn't say anything.

515
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,740
No, okay.
You can sleep by me,

516
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,410
but don't try
anything funny, okay?

517
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,386
C'mon, Shea,
there's nothing funny
about sex!

518
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:03,489
Okay. Now that we have that
dealt with, let's hear
your story.

519
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,426
Wait.
Before you start,

520
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,025
I gotta get this
on tape.

521
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,361
(Rich)
Everything?

522
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:13,962
Uh-huh. Otherwise,
well, if I don't,

523
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:18,134
how else am I gonna show
Vancamp that his golden boy
drinks beer?

524
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,234
[coughs]

525
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,769
(Jay )
Besides, it's all part
of the project, specially

526
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,816
if the bear gets us!

527
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,180
Stop!

528
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,048
(Jay laughing )
Sorry.

529
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,611
Smile.

530
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,054
Alright, go ahead.

531
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,855
Before Pine Creek
was settled,

532
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,091
and long before
Echo Mountain
was a preserve,

533
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,224
this whole area
was sacred land
to the Indians who lived here.

534
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,202
They didn't hunt,
fish, nothing.

535
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,434
And to the Indians,
Echo Mountain was
no man's land.

536
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,738
Why did they call it
Echo Mountain anyways?

537
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,974
(Rich)
The Indians claim that
if you called out at night,

538
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,039
something would answer you.

539
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,607
Something
or someone?

540
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:05,384
Hey, Jenny, for the love
of all that's holy,
please, shut up!

541
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,083
Sorry.

542
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:14,559
Now, the spring of 1891,
a few miners passing through
discovered gold here.

543
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:18,534
They didn't want
word to get out, so they built
a small clandestine settlement

544
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,128
and began mining.

545
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,036
<i>(Jay)</i>
<i>The natives didn't like it,</i>

546
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,940
<i>but they're the peaceful kind</i>
<i>that kept to themselves.</i>

547
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,706
<i>Everything was going</i>
<i>really well.</i>

548
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,509
<i>Until--</i>
<i>[bang]</i>

549
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,680
Until?

550
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,185
Until something happened.

551
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,281
By the time the miners
finally sent word back
to their relatives,

552
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,795
they described this place
as a mountain paradise
with them as riches.

553
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,229
Then instructed them all
to sell everything
and come immediately.

554
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,028
And so they did.

555
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,160
When they arrived,

556
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,261
they found all the miners

557
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:58,434
and their families... dead.

558
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,342
Women, children,

559
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,575
<i>everything, everyone</i>
<i>was slaughtered.</i>

560
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,174
Without a second thought,

561
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,310
the settlers took their guns,

562
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,754
went to the nearest tribe
and slaughtered everyone.

563
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,655
<i>That was a real massacre.</i>

564
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,491
<i>Not some phony stories</i>
<i>about Indians killing</i>
<i>white women and children.</i>

565
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,895
<i>(Jay)</i>
<i>Yeah, I remember</i>
<i>hearing about this.</i>

566
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
[bang]

567
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,164
<i>(Jenny)</i>
<i>If the Indians didn't do it,</i>

568
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,703
<i>what did happen</i>
<i>to the settlers?</i>

569
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,763
The natives blamed
the other creature
made this place home.

570
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,206
(Jay)
Wait, wait.

571
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,540
This is not
one of those stupid
Bigfoot stories, is it?

572
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,874
It's Taku He.

573
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,074
What the hell
did you just say?

574
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,118
The native peoples
all over the world
have different names

575
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:45,383
like Taku He, Sasquatch,
Yeti, Bigfoot,

576
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,687
usually translated
to mean large man.

577
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,489
Do they consider them
dangerous?

578
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,462
I would imagine
they're like

579
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,897
<i>any other creature</i>
<i>in the wild.</i>

580
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,097
<i>If they're put in a situation</i>
<i>of danger, they react</i>
<i>with the fly or fight response,</i>

581
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,163
<i>specially if you got</i>
<i>between mother and child.</i>

582
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,937
<i>(Jenny)</i>
<i>Do you think any of them</i>
<i>still live here?</i>

583
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,841
<i>(Rich )</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>

584
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,313
<i>but the records of them</i>
<i>dating back all the way</i>
<i>to the first explorers.</i>

585
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,748
<i>All the way</i>
<i>until a couple</i>
<i>of years ago.</i>

586
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,183
<i>Wild, screeching beasts</i>

587
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,244
who hunt for game
and fish.

588
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,881
You can throw rods
and things.

589
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,154
Okay, that's enough.
I do want to sleep tonight.

590
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,128
No, I've seen
all those campy
Bigfoot movies

591
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,530
and they aren't scary.

592
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,000
(Jay)
Okay.
Well, then you know

593
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,129
any woman
on her menstrual cycle
should stay out of the woods.

594
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,572
What?
Why?

595
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,542
C'mon!
Use your imagination.

596
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,374
Who wants a lady
on the rag with you
when you're camping?

597
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,676
(Shea)
Jay, shut up.

598
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,549
(Rich)
Actually, it's because animals
can smell blood from miles.

599
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,416
Okay, that's enough.

600
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,015
I agree.
Could we please talk
about something else?

601
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,922
Anything else?

602
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,802
Well, beer's kicking in.

603
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,566
Jesus!

604
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,103
So, do you think it's,
you know,

605
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,974
killed anyone recently?

606
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,105
(Shea)
Jenny, stop.

607
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,876
Has it?

608
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,547
Well, there are records
of a few animals mutilated
found hanging in trees.

609
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,385
Trees?

610
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,549
(Rich)
Trees.

611
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,320
Is that why
you didn't wanna come?

612
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,157
Okay, enough.
Do not answer that question.

613
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,789
[thumping]

614
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:40,769
(Jay)
Oh, my God.
You guys. I saw it!

615
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,001
I saw it over there,
in the night.

616
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,868
[burst out laughing]

617
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,944
[laughing]
You should've seen her!

618
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,489
That wasn't funny!

619
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,053
Jay?
You are such a jerk!

620

What kind of project
are you making, Jay?

794
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:01,499
Funny.
Somebody's gotta look
after my cousin.

795
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,369
Okay. Your cousin
can look after herself.

Right!

797

What do you
little horn balls say
if we go find that bear, huh?

00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,314
And you plan
would be, what?

799
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,182
Just go hike up the falls
where we heard
the gunshots last night.

800
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,785
Oh, yeah!
That's a good idea.

801
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,189
I mean, you know,
one in doubt always head
to a gun fire, right?

we have pictures
of the grizzly bear.

00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,292
So, how about
we just head back?

I need an A to graduate.

I got a bad feeling
our friend Ed Janzer

Hey, Rich,
I was wondering,

863
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:23,358
you know, last night,
were you telling the truth
about all that stuff?

Yeah.

865
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,800
Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

866
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:34,972
So, you're saying
that Bigfoot is real

867
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,605
and that that's
what killed those men?

You guys really
shouldn't be here.

(Jay)
Why not?

873
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,023
You all need
to leave here, now.

874
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,227
And we should listen
to you because--

875
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:04,399
Rich, can I talk with you
a moment in private?

876
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,409
What the hell's going on?

877
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,174
What's wrong?
Hey.

878
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,943
(Jenny)
Does anybody know
what they're talking about?

879
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,679
We'll never
gonna get out of here.

880
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,347
Oh, no, but look.
I think our boy scout

881

(Jay)
might be trying to get
his Indian badge.

882
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,319
He said we should get
the hell out of here.

883
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,863
Why?

884
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,126
Those gunshots
we heard last night.

885
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,601
There's a group of hunters
that are shooting
at everything.

886
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,932
They might come after us.

887
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,370
Come on!
Why would they do
something like that?

888
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,873
What else
did he say?

889
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,434
He said we should head
straight through the woods.

890
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,743
We gotta get the message
to the Sheriff, alright?
Come on!

891
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,777
Whoa!

892
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:50,149

I don't believe this.

The bastard
trashed the camp.

897
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,906
You and your boys
need to leave here now.

898
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,376
I will be leaving, alright?

899
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,504
But after I finish
killing you.

900
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,879
Ed says it's your fault
my cousin was killed.

901
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,390
I had nothing to do with that.

902
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,722
I don't think
Ed is telling you everything.

903
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,953
You don't know what
you're messing with here.

904
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,932
What do you think
did this to your camp?

905
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,402
What do you think
killed Leo and the others?

906
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:45,202
You should know enough
about bears to know
they always cover their kill.

907
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:50,368
He's right, Ed.
I was wondering about that
the whole time.

908
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:55,008
You have three seconds
to explain what the hell
you're talking about.

909
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,485
Or I'll put a bullet
in that blasted badge of yours.

910
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,120
There's a creature out here

911
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:05,388
and you managed
to piss it off pretty good.

912
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,157
A creature.

913
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:11,997
We may be dumb
by we ain't stupid, Chief.

914
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:17,335
For the lack
of better word, yes, a creature.

915
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:21,366
And whatever Ed
was doing up here two days ago,

916
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,435
disturbed it.

917
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,413
What did you do, Ed?

918
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,948
Shoot at it?

919
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,315
I should've shot you.

920
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,412
Think what you want.

921
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,424
But right now,
you need to leave here

922
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,289
or it's gonna kill you all.

923
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,387
Why won't this thing
kill you, huh?

924
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:46,060
It will.
That's why I'm leaving.

925
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:51,903
You crazy Indian.
You ain't going any place.
Tie him up.

926
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,135
[shouting]
Tie him up!

927
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,749
Can I see the map?

928
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,486
Do not tell me
we're lost.

929
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,359
Just making sure
we don't get lost.

930
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,194
I'm getting hungry.

931
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:19,167
Alright, dick,
where do we go now?

932
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,897
Uhm,
[clears throat]

933
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,371
I think we go
that way.

934
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,907
Hey, good.
Let's go.

935
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:30,571
I'm not staying
in this forest another night.

936
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,308
I'll get it.

937

There's gotta be
something wrong
with the TV, Mr. Vancamp.

1110
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,055
We've been watching
this tape all weekend.

1111
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:47,625
I had this incredible footage
of the grizzly bear.
He was like that.

1112
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,433
Except if you're standing up
and he'll roar!

1113
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,166
Roaring?

1114
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:54,266
(Jay)
I'm serious.

1115
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,243
(Vancamp)
I'm sure you did, Jay.

1116
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,541
Big surprise
for all of us, huh?

1117
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,139
Lucky for you
Richard got some nice photos.

1118
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:04,583
Actually, uhm,
Jay took these.

1119
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,553
(Vancamp)
Jay took these?

1120
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,180
(Rich)
Yeah.
I did the research

1121
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,555
in the library, mostly.

1122
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,150
(Vancamp)
Let's see.

1123
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,787
These are good!

1124
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,297
Looks like you got
precariously close there.

And this is
the killer bear, huh?

1127
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:27,838
(Vancamp )
I thought you understood
when I said in-depth.

1128
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:33,439
That I wanted something
a bit more... in-depth.

1129
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,040
What we have here
is a little thin,
don't you think?

1130
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:39,485
No, I don't think.
I don't understand why
every time I do a project,

1131
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:41,216
you gotta give me
so much sh--

1132
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:45,522
Excuse me, but I think
if you look at the research
that we actually did

1133
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:51,760
in it's entirety,
you'll see that we went
the extra mile, and that's him.

1134
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:58,262
Well, where might I find
this extravaganza.

1135
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:03,903
Well, it would be
extravagantly laid out
in your extravagant office.
