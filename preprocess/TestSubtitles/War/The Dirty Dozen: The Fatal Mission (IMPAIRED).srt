the chaplain's hours
are between 4 and 5.
Let's go.

318
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,039
Hit it!

319
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,244
Echevarria, you're a mystery to me.
I went through your files.

320
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:26,920
You've been through
some pretty heavy stuff.

321
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:31,080
Robbery, a gangland
kidnapping, assault
with a deadly weapon.

322
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,919
I had a very bad
childhood, sir.

323
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,566
Well, I figured
something like that.

324
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,116
But until you made
that night withdrawal
from the Bank of England

325
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:39,517
with a.45 and a
little dynamite...

326
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,076
you haven't done any
heavy time, have you?

327
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,760
I always express
sincere remorse, sir.

328
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:44,916
Sure you do.

329
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:48,636
I mean, parole officers, judges...

330
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,037
even cops wanted
to give you a break.

331
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,163
Well, man...
I mean, major.

332
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:56,080
I always figure, when you're
going for it, go all out.

When you're in the streets,
raise hell.

334
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,645
But when they get you,
they got you.

335
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,400
Be nice.

336
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,198
Will that be all, major?
That will be all.

337
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:08,761
We won't be here that long.

338
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,282
Well, glad to be
of service, sir.

This is the only film we have.

370
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:17,003
It was found next to
a dying newsreel cameraman.

371
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,443
The film was made during
an attack on the village
of Agrigento

372
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:25,158
in which the target is believed
to have been Benito Mussolini.

373
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:30,643
Our new contact says
that even now, this officer
is training another group

374
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,560
drawn from American
prisoners sentenced to death

375
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,445
or long terms of imprisonment.

376
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:41,799
The whole story seems
a little incredible, general.

377
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:45,084
Are you sure you're
not wasting money on
this, uh, this informant?

378
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,920
It is the opinion of our
senior agent in Ireland

379
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:49,998
that the story
is absolutely true.

380
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,237
Well, maybe you're right.

381
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:56,036
The whole country worships
outlaws and gangsters.

382
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,196
Now they've drafted them
into the Army, I suppose.

383
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:03,246
I've made arrangements to receive
further reports from this informant.

384
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,762
And we will supply all
necessary technical equipment

00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:08,406
My parents just travelled
around a lot.

00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,479
after Hoffman bounced

446
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,684
I had his body brought back here,
along with his parachute.

447
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:34,281
You think this was
more than a routine
training accident, major?

448
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:37,120
I know now, lieutenant,
that it was no accident.

449
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,517
The chute line on Hoffman's
parachute was cut.

450
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:43,123
He jumped out of that plane with
the jump ring in perfect position

451
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:44,800
and the chute still didn't open.

452
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,119
I thought the men
packed their own chutes.

453
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,596
No, you're talking
about paratroopers,
lieutenant.

454
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,485
My men are thieves and murderers.

455
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:54,764
These are prefolded and put on
an airplane by jump instructors.

456
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,077
Anybody could have got
to Hoffman's parachute,

457
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:58,885
even helped him on with it.

458
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,720
You said it yourself, major.
You've got thieves and murderers.

459
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,479
So one of them found
a reason to kill another.

460
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:06,036
Is that a reason for
getting me out here in
the middle of the night?

461
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,323
No. My reason is
Hoffman was one
of my men.

462
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:09,966
And he was very important.

463
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:11,355
He spoke German.

464
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:14,519
He travelled in Europe
for years and he was
familiar with Yugoslavia,

465
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,518
which would have been
a great help to me.

466
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,803
So you're saying you need
time to find a replacement?

467
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:22,039
There is no time, colonel.
The Nazis are gonna
move those people.

468
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:25,000
Major, you say that Hoffman
spent years in Europe,

469
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,283
picking up languages,
he knew the Balkans.

470
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:30,086
I grew up in Europe.
I speak many European
languages

471
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,761
and I spent six summers
in the Balkans and Yugoslavia.

472
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:35,646
Apparently, for whatever
reason, lieutenant,

You wanted to see me, major?
I've got a problem, sir.

640
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,642
We have several.
We have two reports.

641
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,286
One from inside Yugoslavia

642
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:32,519
indicating suddenly
increased security in
all the major cities.

643
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,406
Well, you picked
Yugoslavia because it's
on the main Orient Express route.

644
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,603
That's right.
And the partisans
are expecting you.

645
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,041
But the second report

646
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:43,086
is that the Nazis are
beginning to learn about you
personally and what you do.

647
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,965
Well, I'm not surprised.

648

What the hell
are you talking about?

649
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,997
General, I asked you here
because I believe there's
a traitor in our group.

650
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,123
Do you know who he is?
No, not yet.

651
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,164
But he got to Hoffman's parachute

652
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,602
and he would have been
invaluable to me in Yugoslavia.

653
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,961
I went through the folders.

654
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,516
And there's no way that Hoffman
could've met any of these men

655
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:01,279
before coming to
the military prison.

656
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:03,600
No, the Germans
ordered the killing.

657
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,759
But how could the Nazis possibly
have known who you were
going to pick for the mission?

658
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,680
They couldn't.
Obviously, our Mr. Somebody,

659
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,964
he got in touch with
the Germans after I assigned
him to the mission.

660
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:15,641
You know there was a blue film
smuggled into the camp?

661
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,525
And if you can
smuggle a blue film in...

662
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:20,236
you certainly can smuggle
a message out.

663
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:21,999
Then we have to
abort the mission.

Major Wright will attack the train

Forgive me, general.
But would it not be better
to hold up the train

supposed to give the führer?

YELENA:
Where do you want to hit that train?

803
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:30,559
WRIGHT: This is the plan
I briefed my men on:
We go through open country...

804
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:33,442
and we meet the train
here, near Nish.

805
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:36,724
There's an overpass
about 20 miles north
of the Bulgarian border,

806
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:38,081
near Pirot.

807
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:40,715
The train slows down there
because of a grade.

808
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:42,479
And I've trained my men

809
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,956
to jump on these moving cars
from the overpass

to take out these Nazi hotshots.

Then I'll explain it to my men.
If they have any problems,
I'll let you know.

WRIGHT:
Well, what can I do
for you, Stern?

Well, a lot of things

First, Hoffman jumps out
of that plane and bounces.

817
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:09,877
Hoffman was killed
in a training accident.

the chute and got him out of there.

No, the Yugoslavs
didn't slice Hoffman's chute line.
