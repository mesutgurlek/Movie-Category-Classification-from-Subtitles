 of setting up this base, in the
       heart of this town       

488
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:22,879

00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:31,221
Oh, yes. And it's running up to 
that compound there.            

491
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:34,191
      A patrol this morning     
         found an I.E.D.        

492
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:37,494
 We're walking towards it. They 
 cut the command wire,          

493
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,363
 which is a wire that runs to a 
 device that would trigger      

494
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:45,035
  the bomb. Hopefully, that is  
  the only command wire.

  come. The Taliban             

501
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:02,886
did not attack. But the
