1
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,120
His Excellency, the Reich Protector,
will arrive shortly.

2
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,880
What progress have you made,
General Votruba...

3
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,340
in your recruiting your Czech
anti-Soviet battalion?

4
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,680
- You know the Fuhrer counts on you.
- Yes, but it's extremely difficult...

5
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,760
our peasants and workers are,
unfortunately very sympathetic...

6
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,100
to the Russians.

7
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,150
Perhaps our production would increase
if our Skoda workers were allowed higher pay...

8
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,770
since our food allowance is very low...

9
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,480
frequently resulting in exhaustion.

10
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,780
Admittedly, your workers may be
under paid as workers...

11
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,780
but as an inferior race, as slaves,
they are highly over paid.

12
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,040
Give them higher wages, you say?

13
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,330
So they can print more of this underground propaganda?

14
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,800
They distribute this criminal material
everyday in the Skoda plant.

15
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,800
Every department is contaminated!

16
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,440
Herr Excellence, the Reich Protector!

17
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,500
[Speaking German]

18
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,840
His Excellency, the Reich Protector,
wishes to say...

19
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,470
that the reports from Skoda
are a putrid mess.

20
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,760
The stinking swine at Skoda
refuse to work.

21
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,140
[In German]
In Skoda, there are 37,000 workers there.

22
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,400
And the sabotage is out of control ...

23
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,730
yet only 50 were executed.

24
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,230
Why not 500?

25
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,900
What did he say?

26
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,780
He said "Shooting only 50 out of 37,000 is ridiculous"...

27
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,120
he demands at least 500 lives.
The restrictions mean nothing at all.

28
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,450
Silence!

29
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,710
The munitions factory in Czechoslovakia ...

30
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,130
will be put in the hands of the Gestapo.

31
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,090
I personally, will be responsible for Skoda.

32
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,510
If I may, your Excellence...

33
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,850
isn't there some better way,
something not so drastic...

34
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,640
Is this man crazy ...

35
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,270
talking to me in this language?

36
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,980
I insist that all Czech only speak
in German. You got that?

37
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,400
German! German! German! German!

38
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,780
I'll teach these sheep
at the Skoda factory to obey...

39
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,200
not to turn to listen to
or obey traitors ever again.

40
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,160
My car!

41
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,230
For those who failed to understand
his Excellence's last remarks...

42
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,270
the entire Czech armament production ...

43
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,190
is now transferred to my authority,
under the Gestapo.

44
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,570
The Reich Protector himself
will supervise personally...

45
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,870
<i>the necessary executions at the Skoda plant.</i>

46
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,120
To Skoda!

47
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Mrs. Dvorak!

48
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,400
- Good morning, Mrs. Novotny.
- Good morning.

49
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,730
I hope I can have 2 lbs. of potatoes.

50
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,030
I'm sorry, Mrs. Novotny,
perhaps tomorrow.

51
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,030
The turnips are nice.

52
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,450
Well, I guess it will have to be turnips
again, and a nice head of cabbage.

53
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,960
- Why is your motor running?
- Just waiting for my fare.

54
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,540
You know that gasoline is
ordered not to waste?

55
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,250
Yeah, but my battery is run down,
it won't start up again.

56
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,510
Stop the motor!
Stop the motor!

57
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,680
Now, start it up again.

58
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,470
[Car starts right up]

59
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,560
I... I guess it must have charged up.

60
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,690
So, you carry on this sabotage trick
to use up our fuel supply.

61
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,940
- Continue and do not stop.
- I do not know, don't understand it.

62
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,110
- I had to crank it up this morning.
- Drive to the police precinct.

63
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,200
- Yeah, but it never charged up...
- Forward! Forward!

64
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,250
Vanya was arrested.
Get going, quick.

65
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,760
Haya.

66
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,340
Pardon me Miss, but did you see
a taxi cab waiting?

67
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,050
Yes, a few minutes ago...

68
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,050
he seemed to had some trouble
with the Occupational Police.

69
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,680
They drove off with him.

70
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,340
Thank you.

Yes.

This way!

80
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,030
You better go home, now.

81
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,700

prettier. And it was yours.

- Cutting down?

- At noon on Kladno Avenue...

- You haven't seen anyone.

- I'm certain I have.
- You haven't seen anyone!

Father, you don't have any connection...

138
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,780
No, monkey, hardly. I've been politically
disconnected for over 15 years now.

139
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,950
It's best in such matters, one doesn't talk.

A entrust it to B,
B confines in C...

142

C reposes the secret to D and it's
not very far from E or F.

F reports it G

Yes, I understand. But to you father...

not even to your fiance, Jan.
No one is "no one"!

151

Look, I've had that old battery for 5 years.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

152
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,870
It's full of quarks!

153
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,580
There is some quarks to the tags, also.

154

According to the Gestapo, they belong to a car that was burned...

156
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,680
- Is that the late paper?
- Yep.

157
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,390
Can I look at it?

158
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,310
Yep.

159
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,990
Your cab was the getaway car!.

160
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,950
I don't know nothing about it.

There must be some other way than assassination.

What will be the result?
More terror, more bloodshed.

176

It will be like the student massacre
at the university

But Jan, those 120 boys gave their
lives to tell the world...

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,380
that we are still Czech.
That we will always be Czech.

to know it by heart.

know where to look it up.

You have to know it by heart,
future brother-in-law.

Jan, you have to hurry if you're
to be home before curfew.

Beda, go to the kitchen and tell Auntie
to wrap something up for Jan to eat.

With all the restaurants closed tonight,
you'll simply starve.

What beautiful roses!

Mascha, aren't you going
to introduce me?

Yes, of course. Mister...

- Karel Vanek.

Father, I want you to met a friend,
Mr. Vanek.

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,720
- Your daughter and I met...
- At the symphony.

221
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,640
My father, Professor Novotny.

222
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,100
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

223
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,850
I had the honor of being introduced
to your daughter at intermission.

224
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,900
I had the score of the symphony with me.

225
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,980
Oh, are you a musician, Mr. Vanek?

226
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,150
No, only a amateur.

227
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,490
I happen to be an architect.

228
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,410
I almost went along with
Mascha that evening...

229
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,660
only at the last minute,
I don't feel too well.

230
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,330
Oh, that's too bad,
but than again...

231
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,330
I wouldn't have had the pleasure of
escorting your daughter home.

232
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,880
Oh, then you live in this district,
Mr. Vanek?

233
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,340
No... no, I just happen to be
in the neighborhood.

234
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,110
Thought I would drop by
and pay my respects.

235
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,540
Young man, did you realize
it was already after 7 o'clock?

236
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,890
I have 6:30.

237
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,140
The correct time is 7:15. Your watch
must be slow, Mr. Vanek...

238
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,810
And tonight,
that might be dangerous.

239
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,980
Yes, I suppose I better run along.

240

If you're on the street after 7 o'clock,
they shoot you on sight.

Right, father...

Dinner is ready, lady.

243
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,040
You mustn't think of leaving.

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,540
- Millie, set another place, please.
- Yes.

245
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,870
Luckily Mr. Vanek, we prepared
for another guest this evening.

246
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,710
You will join us for dinner,
won't you?

247
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,630
I hardly know what to say...

248
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,890
Don't say anything, Mr. Vanek,
it's quite unnecessary.

249
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,430
Isn't it, Mascha?

250
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,230
Don't be deceived by this china,
Mr. Vanek.

251
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,990
- Turnips again.
- And cabbage.

252
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,160
My husband likes for me
to use this service...

253
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,740

of the good old days.

Let me correct you, Helene.

255
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,120
Not in memory of the good old days...

256
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,500
but of the bad new ones.

257

That is a meat platter.

258
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,460
It contains cabbage.
It should contain meat.

259
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,210
That's why I insist it should be
on the table before us.

260

I agree with you,
Professor Novotny.

261

What do you think of the shooting
of Heydrich, Mr. Vanek?

262
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,100
It was completely unexpected,
wasn't it?

263
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,270
It was rather inevitable,
don't you think, Mr. Vanek?

264
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,850
Yes.

265

of Czech boys over 11.

Alright. Let them think that.

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,650
I will tell you: "His beer is good."
Salute!

318
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
But he, himself, rather stinks.

319
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,580
[In German]: Right. I hope you're
at home this weekend.

320
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,380
- You're a smart ass.
- Don't talk German to me.

321
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,960
If I'm going to police your
fascinating people properly...

322
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,880
I have to learn your crazy
language to perfection.

323
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,630
Here is the first list, Herr Inspector.

324
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,320
Editor...

325
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,230
Railway worker...

326
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,940
Clergyman.

327
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,030
That's good.
Priest are always good.

328
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,740
They do more harm than anyone else...

329
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,950
offending in every sermon.

330
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,040
Listen, I have a good suggestion.

331
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,710
Nykvar, the poet.

332
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,420
Nykvar?

333
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,840
What for?
He is not political.

334
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,800
He only writes folklore,
children ballets, fables.

335
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,550
Herr Gruber, if it's your intention to
Germanize the protectorate...

336
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,350
that is exactly where you should begin,
with the children.

337
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,230
You're an extraordinary patriot, Czaka.

338
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,830
I'm sorry, professor...

339
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,290
do you think I might ask the janitoress if
there is an available room here...

340
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,710
in the house where I might stay over?

341
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,550
I happen to know there's nothing.

342
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,470
There is an available couch in my study...

343
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,800
That I can personally assure you
is not uncomfortable.

344
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,680
It has already been made up.
You're welcomed to it.

345
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,560
Very kind of you,
but...

346
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,230
There is hardly an alternative,
is there Mr. Vanek?

347
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,070
I hope those chimes
don't keep you awake.

348
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,950
Wenceslas hymn?

349
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,370
I should be use to it.
I hear it every morning.

350
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,580
What funny times. A man meets my
daughter at a symphony concert once ...

351
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,700
and the next week he moves in.

352
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,500
Do you think the neighbors might gossip?
What of Jan?

353
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,630
- I don't see why the neighbors should hear of it at all.
- Well, the janitoress knows.

354
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,340
She does?

355
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,630
Yes.

356
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,260
Who told her?

357
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,680
We have our breakfast quite early,
Mr. Vanek.

358
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,730
Since it's forbidden to lecture
at the university any longer...

359
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,520
some of my former students come here
to continue their studies.

360
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,690
-  Good night, monkey.
- Professor, I must speak with you.

361
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,570
You have to excuse me.

362
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,740
and a old fellow like me can't
keep up with you younger men.

363
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,330
Good night, Mr. Vanek,
I hope you rest well.

364
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,160
Good night, monkey.

365
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,960
Good night, father.

366
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,710
You don't need to tell him anything,
he knows.

367
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,880
You told him?

368
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,470
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't let me.

369
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,850
Father is an old revolutionary.

370
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,930
He was in exiled with the
founders of the Republic.

371
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,450
<i>British broadcasting...</i>

372
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,080
<i>The Czech government in exile here
informs that the daring execution...</i>

373
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,830
<i>of the hangman Heydrich is expected to
be followed by a nationwide bloodbath...</i>

374
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,800
<i>as savage as only the
Nazi barbarians can be.</i>

375
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,620
This woman who lead our men
the wrong way...

376
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,670
must have brought vegetables at
your place many times before.

377
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Maybe, but I don't know her name.

378
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,150
Pick it up, again.

379
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,750
There, put it back in place.

380
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,910
Good.

381
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,330
You say you never learned
where the girl lives?

382
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,090
- No.
- Here is the coffee, Herr Ritter.

383
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,260
[In German]
Thank you very much.

384
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,050
Real coffee.

385
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,600
Now, Mrs. Dvorak,
let's start from the beginning.

386
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,480
Now, don't be nervous, Mrs. Dvorak.

387
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,190
I am prepared to devote to you
all of tonight...

388
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,360
even longer, if necessary.

389
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,900
Well?

390
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,660
That's the girl.

391
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,340
I want you to listen to me very closely,
Mrs. Dvorak.

392
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,880
Do you realize where you are?

393
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,760
Yes.

394
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,180
And exactly,
where are you?

395
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,720
Gestapo.

396
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,020
And you actually believe you will walk
out of here without telling us the truth?

397
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,910
Now.

398
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,660
This girl...

399
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,250
who sent our men the wrong way...

400
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,380
she must have brought vegetables at
your place many times before.

401
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
<i>It is now 8 a.m.
Last night the Fuhrer's own physician...</i>

402
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,800

operation on the spinal cord...</i>

403
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,430
<i>on his excellency the Reich Protector...</i>

<i>removing 3 pistol bullets.</i>

405
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,940
- Anything?
- No. Nothing yet.

406
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,230
Here.

407
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,400
Several people have been arrested.

408
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,620
It is reliably reported that the
Gestapo have a definite clue...

409
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,620
- that will lead directly to the assassin.
- The taxi driver.

410
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,910
- No, no.
- But, who else?

411
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,210
I don't know.

412
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,460
I must leave at once.

413
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,630
<i>An important announcement from
the Occupational Authorities.</i>

414
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,130
<i>Taking personal charge...</i>

415
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,760
<i>the chief of the Gestapo from Prague...</i>

416
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,550
<i>Kurt Haas, has ordered instant retaliation...</i>

417
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,550
<i>for the insufficient cooperation of the civilian population.</i>

418
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,470
<i>Most severe methods are to be expected.</i>

419
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,730
They know nothing.

420
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,190
If they did, they would not threaten.

421
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,730
Miss Novotny.

422
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,570
Loud pounding on door]
Open up!

423
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,620
[In German]
Come with me. You, stay here.

424
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,210
Who are you?
What's your name?

425
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,130
- Karel Vanek.
- You live in this house?

426
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,670
Who are you?

427
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,010
I am Professor Novotny.
Whom are you looking for?

428
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,100
- For you?
- No!

429
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,020
Quiet, no interference!

430
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,600
On what grounds?

431
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,230
For the loathsome abominable
crime committed  against..

432
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,900
[German]the person of the
Reich Protector. And the refusal...

433
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,740
of Czechs who resist
to cooperate with us.

434
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,030
Who shall be held hostage until the killer...

435
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,120
is delivered to the authority.

436
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,000
And what if he is not surrendered?

437
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,040
This response is from the Occupation Authority.

438
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,760
If I understand you correctly, and for the
benefit of my family and students...

439
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,880
the loathsome abominable crime...

440
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,470
against his excellency,
the Reich Protector...

441
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,180
or more correctly, the unheard of...

442
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,850
traitorous behavior of my countrymen...

443
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,810
in failing wholeheartedly to fall in line with their "German" protectors...

444
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,070
compels you to hold me hostage...

445
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,070
together with others in whom, I presume,
until the assassin is surrendered..

446
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,950
our lives becoming forfeit for his?

447
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,740
- I believe that is correct?
- Correct

448
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,370
- Father, no. They can't...
- Oh yes, they can.

449
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,870
They can arrest me,
they can arrest a hundred more.

450
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,960
Indeed, they can arrest as many hundreds
as they have on their lists.

451
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,050
But I don't believe they will find
one single traitor among us.

452
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,300
- Or in all of the Czech nation.
- Who are you and all these others?

453
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,970
Some of my former students.
I give them private tutoring.

454
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Or is that forbidden too?

455
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,440
Keep your mouth shut, or you'll get some
real tutoring. Make yourself ready.

456
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,690
How can you take my husband for
something he knows nothing about?

457
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,610
No interruptions!

458
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,030
- Ludmilla.
- Yes?

459
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,320
Will you get some of my things ready?
Just a few for tonight.

460
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,570
Yes.

461
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,160
No razors are permitted.

462
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,450
I trust you will all continue
with your studies?

463
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,380
Don't let yourself be snowed
under at Valley Forge.

464
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,550
Father!

465
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,590
Good luck.

466
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,340
- Thank you.
- Now please go.

467
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,560
All of you.

468
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,310
- Stepan, I'm frighten.
- I know, I know

469
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,560
Monkey.

470
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,230
Thank you, sister.

471
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,070
Goodbye, son.

472
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,530
Remember all this, well.

473
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,660
I will.

474
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,420
I'm ready.

475
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,630
Vystyd, Priest

476
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Votruba, General.

477
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,770
Pravotka, Jew.

478
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,020
Necval, Writer.

479
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,150
Schyler, Clerk.

480
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,030
Matouseck, Worker.

481
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,290
Attention!

482
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,170
Who is the oldest?

483
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,460
All men over 50 raise your arms.

484
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,970
You, your name.

485
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,100
Professor Stepan Novotny.

486
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,720
Stand at attention when you address me!

487
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,560
Novotny, you're in charge
of this barracks.

488
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,440
Will be completely responsible for
compliance with camp regulations.

489
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,440
Base cleanliness must be maintained.

490
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,240
No spit or dirt on the floor.

491
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,490
All shoe laces, suspenders,
neck ties, and belts...

492
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,250
must be turned into to the
commandant's office within one hour.

493
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,790
Understood?

494
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,370
Don't shake your head, speak!

495
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,300
Father should have dressed more warmly.
Because it is damp and cold out there.

496
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,010
The assassin must give himself up,
or he's a monster.

497
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,930
If I knew who he was,
I'd go out and tell the police.

498
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,930
- Anyone in Prague should.
- Aunt Millie, it's not as simple as that.

499
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,230
- Why not?
- Whoever help him...

500
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,810
can't go to the Gestapo
after last nights broadcast

501
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,900
It would be like signing his own death
warrant. Him and his whole family.

502
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,860
Any one who knows...

503
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,650
and helps him,
is as guilty as the assassin.

504
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,820
Mascha!

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,540
Jan, look after Mascha.

506
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,200
Mascha, is there something I can do?

507
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,500
There is only one hope...

508
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,290
that he gives himself up.

509
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,750
Yes, I'm afraid so.

510
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,380
Oh darling, I'm sorry, but ...

511
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,430
I have to get back to the lab.

512
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,140
Yes.

513
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,260
Funny, when I left you last night...

514
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,850
I met a chap coming up the stairs
with some red roses.

515
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,110
Oh yes, the florist sent
them to my mother.

516
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,940
She is one of his old customers.

517
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,900
[Door bell buzzes]

518
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,910
I'll see who it is.

519
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,830
- Beda!
- They called off the school for the whole week.

520
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,500
They said on account of Heydrich...

521
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,170
But I heard they are using the rooms for
the wounded from Russian battles.

522
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,630
- How about father?
- Nothing yet.

523
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,510
Mascha, if you hear anything be sure
to let me know.

524
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,880
- I will, Jan, and goodbye darling.
- Good bye.

525
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,800
- Good bye, Jan.
- Good bye, Beda.

526
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,970
- Beda, your bandage is all filthy.
- It isn't filthy, it's just a little tangled.

527
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,350
- I'll fix it.
- No, I better do it. Come with me.

528
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,150
You ought to take lessons from Mr. Vanek.
He's an expert at bandaging.

529
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,900
You're next, Mr. Dedic.

530
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,740
Good afternoon, doctor.

531
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,910
Good afternoon.

532
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,210
His case history, doctor.

533
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,090
How's everything going?

534
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,090
Yesterday I was afraid of complications,
but today it's been pretty good.

535
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,810
- Here are the bandages, doctor.
- Thank you. That's all.

536
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,450
I took two sedatives.
Look at that

537
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,490
Naturally anyone who has been
through your last 24 hrs

538
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,120
Yesterday, when Vanya was arrested,
it looked pretty serious

539
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,670
So we had to leave you on your own.

540
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,130
- I understood.
- You did a great job, Svoboda.

541
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
Now they let lose their
horrible bloodbath.

542
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,800
Yes.

543
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,550
They've already sized over 400 hostages.

544
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,470
We anticipated hostages.

545
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,060
Yes.

546
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,440
Yes, we did,
didn't we?

547
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:29,030
I spent last night with the family
of Professor Novotny, the historian.

548
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,030
No...

549
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
No previous acquaintance.

550
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,280
His daughter helped me.

551
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,410
She directed the black shirts the wrong way.

552
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,160
This morning...

553
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,670
Dedic...

554
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,460
I've decided to give myself up.

555
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,170
- Svoboda!
- Oh, I'm not trying to make any noble gestures.

556
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,430
Or become a heroic martyr...

557
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,220
But 400 lives...

558
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,640
Four hundred?

559
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,060
Dedic, I'm only one, only one.

560
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,520
Have you thought about what must be
done to drive the Germans out?

561
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,270
You'll be needed, Svoboda.
You have no right to surrender.

562
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,940
Don't worry...

563
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,870
They won't torture any information
out of me.

564
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,160
All they'll get is my dead body...

565
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,080
a written confession and the evidence.

566
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,830
The bullets they remove from Heydrich
will give them that.

567
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,920
The gun will be absolute proof.

568
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,670
No...

569
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,260
the underground has nothing to fear.

570
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,880
But it has, Svoboda.

571
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,220
Listen, you're an physician.

572
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,550
If a man showing your symptoms
came into your clinic...

573
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,100
wouldn't you diagnose his case
as nerves shot to pieces...

574
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,730
hysteria cause by exhaustion?

575
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,350
Would you advise a patient in that state...

576
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,060
to make an irrevocable decision?
You would not!

577
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,240
Svoboda, you were chosen to act as
a representative of the Czech people.

578
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,490
The Czech people have executed "the Hangman".

579
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,290
400 lives! Yes, Svoboda,
What is 400 lives?

580
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,450
This is a war of millions...

581
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,000
and the execution of Heydrich is only one battle in that war.

582
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,960
But a most important one.

583
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,750
And if you surrender yourself,
alive or dead...

584
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,260
The Czech people will have lost that battle.

585
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,220
Every Czech person will say to themselves:
"We dare not resist!"

586
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:19,180
"The Nazi terrorist is too much for us!"

587
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,220
Svoboda...

588
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,020
three years ago we lost our army.

589
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,650
We stood on the streets crying like
children and watched it surrender.

590
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,610
So we built a new one...

591
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,860
A ghost army that will haunt them
until their blood runs cold!

592
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,910
Now, you would have this
army surrender too?

593
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,680
What about this Novotny family?
I take it you were sufficiently cautious?

594
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,600
They know nothing of me.

595
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,230
I used the name of Vanek,
told them I was an architect.

596
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,350
You're sure you didn't leave no clues
to your real identity...

597
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,690
- positive connecting link?
- None, I'm sure.

598
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,030
Dedic...

599
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,530
what about the taxi driver?

600
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,370
Jumped out of the window at the
Gestapo. They got nothing from him

601
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,670
I never met the man.

602
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,540
I wish I had.

603
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,920
You better let me have that gun.

604
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,260
You have a fool proof alibi...

605
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,140
but with that gun and those bullets there,
they would chew that apart.

606
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,200
One moment.

607
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,820
You forgot your prescription.

608
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,010
Miss Novotny.

609
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,640
Dr. Svoboda,
may I talk to you alone?

610
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,610
Nurse, please.

611
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,280
What are you going to do?

612
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,820
How did you happen to find me?

613
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
That's not important.

614
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:48,370
It was Beda, it was your bandage that gave me the idea you were a physician.

615
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,870
You said you hear the
Wenceslau hymn every morning.

616
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,040
So, when I noticed this hospital
across from the church...

617
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,760
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.

618
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,550
Nothing?

619
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,180
Last night you spoke differently...

620
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,050
when it was your life in danger.
Now you think you're safe.

621
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,220
So now it's nothing,
nothing to be done?

622
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,850
Dr. Svoboda, you're the only one
who can save my father.

623
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,770
What are you going to do?

624
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,230
I can not surrender to the Germans,
if that is what you mean.

625
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,190
But they will kill him for what you did!

626
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,570
- Let me explain.
- Alright, explain.

627
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,990
Explain why the man who helped you
was taken away to his death...

628
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
while you stood there silent.

629
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,540
But don't think I will be silent,
I tell you, I won't!

630
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,950
I won't let you kill my father,
because I won't!

631
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,000
Miss Novotny, consider what possible benefit...

632
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,250
it could do your father,
for whom I have the deepest admiration...

633
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,840
if you denounce me.

634
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,010
- You would involve your entire family.
- You were counting on that, weren't you?

635
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,390
You think you have control over me
because we helped you.

636
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,850
This is not a threat, but a simple fact.
One you must not forget.

637
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,850
You have it all nicely worked out.

638
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,020
If I tell them, then all my
family will be shot.

639
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,570
If I keep silent,
only my father will be shot.

640
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,570
In other words,
you simple statement of fact is...

641
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,030
we are lost in any case because we were
generous enough to save your life.

642
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,000
You're just a cold blooded coward.
You are no better than Heydrich, himself.

643
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,500
Even the Gestapo couldn't be as
inhuman as you are!

644
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,850
- Petschek Bank.
- Gestapo headquarters?

645
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,440
- Yes, quickly.
- Yes, ma'am.

646
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,650
Hurry, please.

Driver! Can't you hear me?

650
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,390
You're going the wrong way.
Stop!

651
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,400
- Who are you?
- Miss Novotny, you must be out of your mind.

652
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,150
- Do you know what you're doing at all?
- Stop, driver.

653
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,320
I have no time now to give you a
lecture on political principles.

654
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,990
Haven't you any idea what is
going on here?

655
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,660
- This is war, and you're in it.
- Who are you, and where are you taking me too?

656
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,490
Don't be frightened,
we aren't taking you anywhere.

657
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,740
We just want to explain to you...

<i>- Help, let me out please!
- What going on here?</i>

659
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,630
This driver took me the wrong way here, but I told him...

660
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,340
- Where do you want to go, Miss?
- To the Gestapo.

661
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,340
<i>Gestapo?</i>

662
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,390
But he drove the other way...

663
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,600
then this strange man...

664
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,220
<i>Strange man?</i>

665
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,560
- Where is he?
- I don't know what
she is talking about, so help me.

666
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,230
I didn't hear the little lady at all.
I'm hard of hearing...

getting pushed around by the tweezers.

668
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,780
Alright, you're blocking traffic,
you better keep moving.

669
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,330
Why did you want to go to the Gestapo?
Did they send for you?

670
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,000
- Com'on baby, tell us.
- Com'on, out with it.

671
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,920
No, No...

672
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,010
Well, if they didn't send for you, what
business have you got with those butchers?

673
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,720
What does a decent Czech girl want
with the Gestapo anyway?

674
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,600
Who are you squealing on you
little Judas? That poor driver?

675
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,890
What did he do to you, huh?

676
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,770
The Gestapo!

677
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,200
- No, don't let them.
- You needn't be afraid, Miss

678
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,200
- You wanted to be taken to the Gestapo?
- Yes.

679
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,620
Have you received a summons, or do
you wish to make a statement?

680
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,290
I haven't received any summons.

681
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,420
Alright miss, you will be taken to
the headquarters safely.

Here is your pass, Miss Novotny.
Heil, Hitler.

684
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,240
Miss Novotny,
it will be a few minutes.

685
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,740
Perhaps I might go to the washroom?

686
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,660
My cheek is bleeding again.

687
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,620
Right across the corridor,
first door to the left.

688

Your pass, miss??

689

Over there.

00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,110
Your pass?

691
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,360
You've been to Herr Ritter's office?

692
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,200
- Yes.
- And you have already made your statement?

693
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,070
Yes.

694
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,740
That's strange.

695
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,540
That pass should be
signed and stamped.

696
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,670
- There must have been should kind of mistake.
- We don't make mistakes here!

697
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,710
My father had nothing to do
with the shooting yesterday.

698
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,510
He was doing research at the library
all day.

699
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,470
You can easily get proof.

700
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,810
- And this is the statement you came to make?
- Yes.

701
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,560
But I understood only a few minutes ago...

702
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,900
you wanted to leave...

extremely valuable testimony.

First she tried to break out
without seeing me.

708
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,960
Now she would have us believe she came
only to have her father released.

709
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,920
- Bunk!
- What does she look like?

710
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,260
Young, quite attractive...

Yes!

I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long,

It's too bad for us,

I honestly hoped you came ...

718

Yes, I know her.

No.

- No, nothing political.

790
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,500
He came to see me.

791
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,550
You?

792
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,970
You see, we met at the
symphony last week...

793
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,010
yesterday he...

794
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,890
- dropped in quite unexpectedly.
- And stayed for the night.

795
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,850
It was curfew hour.
He had to stay over.

796
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,440
Charming coincidence.

797
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:34,570
He was the man who brought you
those roses, wasn't he?

798
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,780
Yes.

799
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,200
"The florist sent them to my mother".
That was a lie too.

800
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,370
Jan, You don't think I...

801
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,170
had anything to do with that man?

802
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,790
Mascha, I always thought that everything between us would be above board...

803
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,550
Open, clean.

804
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,010
Darling, you know I love you.

805
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,930
Please try to believe in me, Jan.

806
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,100
Mascha, why didn't you tell me?

807
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,560
Don't ask me why.

808
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,480
If you love me, Jan,
you must believe in me.

809
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,060
You're all I have to believe in.

810
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,610
You know that.
Don't let me down.

811
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,700
Jan, I'll never forget that
you believed in me.

812
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,500
Miss Novotny?

813
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,670
Gestapo. You're under arrest

814
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,510
We checked your story,
Miss Novotny...

815
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,600
In all of Prague,
no architect called Vanek exists

816
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,230
You're lying.

817
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,980
Where did you say you met him first?

818
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,690
At symphony hall.

819
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,400
You said you met him
during the intermission?

820
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,900
No, he had the seat next to mine.

821
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,700
And he told you his name was Vanek?

822
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,990
Yes, Karel Vanek.

823
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,330
- What's his real name?
- I don't know.

824
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,080
What illegal organizations does
your daughter belong too?

825
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,120
None at all. Mascha is a music student.

826
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,210
This Karel Vanek...

827
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,420
Isn't he one of your husbands former
colleagues from the university? A fellow teacher?

828
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,050
- Professor Novotny had never met him before.
- Where does this man live?

829
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,350
How shall I know?
He didn't tell me.

830
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,310
Is it usual for your niece to entertain
strange gentlemen at night?

831
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,350
No.

832
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,270
How many times did he sleep over
at your apartment?

833
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,440
Only that night.
And on the account of curfew.

834
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,320
Why did he come that particular night?

835
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,860
- I don't know.
- Answer properly!

836
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,030
You know we have means
to make you talk.

837
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,450
Maybe you have heard about
the rooms below.

838
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,160
What was his exact reason for coming?

839
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,210
A former call, to pay respects
to my daughter is all.

840
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,880
Why did you sister-in-law say it was your daughters fiance?

841
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,630
Because I was afraid the neighbors
would gossip about a stranger.

842
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,680
What was this "strangers" real name?

843
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,760
- Mr. Vanek.
- You're lying!

844
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,020
- I'm not lying.
- No?

845
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,770
We'll soon find out.

846
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,150
Do you know where your sister is
right at this moment?

847
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,820
She is where everybody ends up
who doesn't tell us the truth!

848
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,440
Mrs. Dvorak!

849
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,580
The whole family sticks to the same story...

850
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,750
But I don't believe this man,
Karel Vanek, exists

851
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,130
This letter arrived at the Novotny
apartment an hour ago...

852
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,930
by special messenger with a bouquet of roses...

853
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,140
from a  "Mr. Karel Vanek".

854
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,180
Vanek!

855
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:31,430
Interesting.

856
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,900
Why, this is ridicules!

857
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,440
You told me that this man doesn't exists

858
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,440
Curios.

859
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,450
Doesn't exist, yet here he is.

860
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,450
You're not going to tell me we went through
all this trouble for a silly love affair?

861
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,330
Looks that way.

862
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,330
What do you suggest, Gruber?

863
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,710
That we release the girl.

864
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,510
- What?
- What else can we do?

865
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,170
Are we suppose to interfere with lovers?

866
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,760
Or are we?

867
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:57,190
Miss Mascha, I had to come and offer
sympathy to you and your mother ...

868
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,230
for your fathers arrest

869
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,150
I have been unable to get that
tragic scene out of my mind.

870
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,870
ever since yesterday, I've been in the
depths of despair trying to quiet my conscience.

871
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,120
- I came to offer my help.
- Help!

872
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,830
You're talking of help!

873
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,120
The one responsible for all
we have been through!

874
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,670
<i>You spent the night with your conscience brother you?</i>

875
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,590
<i>We spent it with the Gestapo!</i>

876
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,050
<i>My whole family is still there.</i>

877
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,170
<i>You're the one the Gestapo wants!</i>

878
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,260
<i>You killed...</i>

879
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,810
<i>any feelings I...</i>

880
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,430
<i>ever had for you.</i>

881
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,520
<i>The things we've been through merrily
because you spent the night here...</i>

882
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,400
<i>- Mr. Vanek.
- Mascha...</i>

883
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,400
I can't tell you how sorry I am...

884
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,240
that my thoughtlessness has
brought to you.

885
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,450
Whatever you think of me,
I deserve and more.

886
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,210
Tell me the truth!

887
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,080
Alright, Mascha, I will.

888
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,920
<i>I gave you a false name.</i>

889
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,460
<i>My name is not Karel Vanek,
and I'm not an architect.</i>

890
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,630
<i>I am Dr. Franticek Svoboda...</i>

891
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,340
<i>resident surgeon
at St. Pancrazio hospital .</i>

892
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,930
<i>Why didn't you tell me that right away?</i>

893
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,350
<i>Maybe we ought to go into
the living room.</i>

894
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,690
<i>- Out here we might be overheard..</i>

895
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,320
<i>Mascha, I must make an confession.</i>

896
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,780
<i>I love you.</i>

897
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,740
I did take advantage of the curfew law
to stay over night...

898
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:36,120
But now it seems my silly little
escapade has boomeranged...

899
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,170
And I have fallen head over heels
with you Mascha.

900
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,960
And that is my only excuse for the
trouble I've made you.

901
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,010
I think I understand you much better now,
Dr. Svoboda.

902
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,600
And you do forgive me?

903
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,560
<i>I really ought to blame myself. After all...</i>

904
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,890
- Shut it down!
- Well...

905
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,560
This puts us back to where we started.

906
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,480
There is something fishy about all of this.

907
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,690
Why can't we admit when we are through?

908
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,360
You've have wasted all our time over
a cheap romance.

909
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,120
Release the family, start from scratch...

910
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,870
before Berlin comes down on our necks.

911
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,040
They're lovers.

912
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,210
I remember exactly, because it was the
same day his Excellency was shot.

913
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,670
- You're sure of the time?
- I have the operation reports right here.

914
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,260
Dr. Svoboda assisted me while I
performed the Cholecystectomy.

915
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,390
During the operation he was in charge
of the suction pump apparatus as usual.

916
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:34,010
Dr. Kesselbach, I understand you
also function as physician ...

917
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,770
for storm troop 34.

918
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,390
Yes, sir.

919
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,980
And Dr. Svoboda was there that day,
throughout the operation?

920
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,020
Yes, for 42 hours.

921
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,360
He stood only a few feet away from me.

922
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,400
You understand, Herr Inspector,
these intestinal operations...

923
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,860
-
require constant control...
- I understand, Dr. Kesselbach, Thank you.

924
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,200
That's all I wanted to know.
Thank you, professor.

925
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,500
Heil, Hitler!

926
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,040
Heil, Hitler!

927
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,760
Frankly, I dislike being beaten.

928
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,470
Even by our most distinguish poet.

929
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,510
You know, Mr. Necval, I always wanted
to met your personally...

930
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,720
- and now at last..
- I had always hoped to met you, Professor Novotny.

931
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,470
- and now at last..
- Excuse me, Mr. Necval...

932
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,600
- I wonder if I could bother you?
- Yes?

933
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,650
I happen to just scribble something
down today just to...

934
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,570
a few lines for a song maybe.

935
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,480
You being such a big writer,
I thought if you have the time...

936
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,650
please look it over. Fix it up a bit?

937
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,820
May friend, I have all the time
in the world here...

938
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,660
until these who'eses...

939
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,080
Well, this is a scribble.

940
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,080
Here, you better read it to me.

941
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,760
"Fellow patriots,
the time has come.

942
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,840
Fellow patriots,
there is work to be done.

943
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:57,470
Raise the invisible torch
and pass it along...

944
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,190
Keep it burning, keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.

945
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:04,650
Die if you must,
for a cause that's just..

946
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,610
but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.

947
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,650
Ever onward,
never returning...

948
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,780
the senseless butcher will be learning...

949
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,660
this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.

950
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,950
Carry on,
when we are gone.

951
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,540
No surrender!"

952
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,790
Of course you could made
that a lot better.

953
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,050
No, my friend...

954
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,010
let's have it just as it stands.

955
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,180
How does it go again?
"Fellow patriots..." Let me see that please?

956
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,930
"The time has come.

957
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,850
Fellow patriots,
there's work to be done.

958
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,190
Raise the invisible torch
and pass it along...

959
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,020
Keep it burning...

960
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,690
Keep it burning, keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.

961
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,660
Die if you must,
for a cause that's just..

962
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:58,120
but shout to the end:...

963
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,910
'No surrender!'."

964
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,580
<i>So their answer to terror...</i>

965
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,620
<i>is the murder of hostages...</i>

966
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,380
<i>Ours is the slowing down of
the German war machine.</i>

967
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,340
By the end of the week
all war production...

968
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,800
be lowered by a full 25%.

969
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,680
I work in the office of a
former hardware factory.

970
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,180
Now making parts for heavy tanks.

971
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,430
A few days ago, a telegram
came in from Berlin...

972
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,230
to stop immediately the manufacture
of 5 special tank parts.

973
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,020
Because of the new model tanks they have
started making for the Russian front.

974
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,150
Luckily, I saw the telegram
before anyone else saw it.

975
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,360
So I tore it up and threw it in the stove.

976
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,700
But what will happen?

977
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:39,320
They'll go on making the same 5 parts.

978
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,700
But when we send them to Germany...

979
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,290
they won't fit the new tanks.

980
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,670
Emil?

981
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,380
I think you all know sufficiently...

982
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,470
by my work with this group
from the past..

983
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,100
that no sacrifice has been
too great for me.

984
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,440
Yet I tremble before the bloodshed...

985
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,650
that threaten so many victims.

986
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,780
850 hostages have been arrested by now.

987
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:17,700
<i>More than 250 are already dead.</i>

988
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,950
<i>The very flower of our Czech nation...</i>

989
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,280
<i>faces systematic annihilation.</i>

990
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,410
Scientists, leaders of commerce, and industry, artists...

991
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,630
even priests of God!

992
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:32,420
So I ask, regardless of sentiment...

993
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:37,130
Can our nation afford the loss of
these outstanding citizens?

994
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,890
I say to myself, again, and again...

995
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,470
this man, whoever he is...

996
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,680
whoever executed "the Hangman",
is a great patriot...

997
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,480
a hero!

998
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,860
But still, I can't help myself...

999
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:56,440
I keep thinking: "If this man would
surrender himself...

1000
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:00,530
If he would say: 'Here I am, do with me
what you will, but spare the innocent'"...

1001
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,240
Wouldn't that be better for our beloved country?

1002
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,830
So I ask our group here,
if it should agree with me...

1003
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,800
to move to submit this proposal
to the Central Committee.

1004
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,410
Already people are saying...

1005
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:25,040
it is sheer lunacy to sacrifice
hundreds of lives for one.

1006
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,380
Emil, where did you hear such people
saying such things?

1007
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:29,960
All over Prague.

1008
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,170
I've even heard people blaming
the underground...

1009
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:34,760
for this new wave of German terror.

1010
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,050
Not where I work,
and I keep my ears open.

1011
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,510
- Right.
- I've listened to many women...

1012
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,020
some of them wives and
daughters of hostages.

1013
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:48,480
- Not one spoke a single word against it.
- I'm absolutely against the motion.

1014
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:52,480
I must ask to be excused on
voting on this matter.

1015
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,900
My brother was one of the hostages
executed this morning

1016
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,070
All those in favor,
raise their hands.

1017
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,000
Now the "nays"?

1018
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,000
I think the "nays" have it.

1019
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,670
We have to adjourn now,
it's getting near curfew.

1020
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,760
Leave one by one at irregular intervals.

1021
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,740
Dr. Pillar, is any one in your group...

1022
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,250
know anything about you
except your first name?

1023
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,830
Only the leader, Bartos.

1024
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,420
Anyway, you better not attend
any farther meetings.

1025
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:54,380
You're the only one in this group
involved in the Heydrich affair.

1026
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:58,420
Anyone who was involved should have
severed connection with this group.

1027
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:01,720
I understand.

1028
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,720
[Knocks on door]

1029
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,820
Bartos, I just told the doctor here
not to attend ...

1030
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,740
any meetings of your group
until farther notice.

1031
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:22,740
Dr. Pillar, use the stairs, please.

1032
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:33,210
I think this group will have to be
dissolved immediately.

1033
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:36,540
I know exactly what you're thinking.
That peculiar motion.

1034
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,760
- You know this man well?
- Certainly.

1035
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,340
He's been with us 2 years,
contribute a lot of money.

1036
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,430
How does he function in your group?

1037
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,010
He uses our beer wagons to
distribute our leaflets.

1038
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,770
He's the big brewer, Czaka, Emil Czaka.

1039
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:53,520
Remember 2 years ago when that group
in Pilsen, was betray to the Gestapo...

1040
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,860
- and 12 were executed?
- The Pilsen raid.

1041
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:59,530
Yes, I know.
Czaka was suspected...

1042
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:02,740
for a while. But it was determined that
the traitor spoke perfect German...

1043
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,070
and a very thorough investigation
proved Czaka...

1044
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,120
doesn't speak a bit of German.

1045
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:10,040
You think I put myself in danger?

1046
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,750
In all probability you talked yourself
into kingdom come.

1047
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,380
But you suggested it.

1048
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:19,460
I suggested you feel out the grounds,
test their morale.

1049
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,970
I didn't suggest you crawl out on a limb
and saw yourself off.

1050
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:29,390
- Take some cheese, it's good.
- No I have no more appetite.

1051
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,310
Maybe...

1052
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,350
maybe it would be safer if I left town?

1053
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,070
Sorry sir, once you work for the Gestapo...

1054
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,230
you work for the Gestapo.

1055
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,360
Then I insist you give me
a special body guard.

1056
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,410
I will not do anything without it.

1057
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:49,530
You'll do everything,
... and like it.

1058
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,250
Herr Gruber,
how can you treat me like this?

1059
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,910
I've done so much for you all these years,
and for Germany!

1060
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,830
And why did you do so much for us,
Czaka?

1061
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,960
Because as a real Czech patriot
I realize our entire future...

1062
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:05,090
depends on unconditional collaboration
with greater Germany.

1063
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,680
And I thought you did it
for business reasons.

1064
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,140
For certain favors...

1065
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,680
for certain valuable military contracts.

1066
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,560
May I?

1067
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:22,190
- Nice gold lighter.
- You like it?

1068
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,700
You wouldn't think of bribing me...

1069
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,200
with a gold lighter.

1070
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:31,330
Czaka, Czaka, Czaka...

1071
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,620
Suppose I pay you for police protection?

1072
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,920
Oh, just like life insurance?

1073
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:42,630
How much of a premium would you
be willing to pay?

1074
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,550
How much do you want?

1075
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,470
2,000 marks.

1076
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,340
2,000 marks per week?

1077
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,800
Per day.

1078
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,850
2,000 marks per day?

1079
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,930
Only a few days until we
round up your friends...

1080
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,440
then you just drop the insurance.

1081
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:02,570
Say 5 days,
10,000 marks.

1082
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,280
Suppose it lasts a month?

1083
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,070
So what? Another 50,000 marks.

1084
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:12,580
Why Czaka, you are a big beer magnet.

1085
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,620
Just another drop in the barrel.

1086
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:32,260
Make that check payable to the treasurer
of the Occupational Police Fund.

1087
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:42,270
That's it, Czaka.

1088
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,070
I am the treasurer.

1089
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,240
I know.

1090
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:58,240
[Telephone rings]

1091
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,520
- Yes?
- Your Father will be executed...

1092
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:09,860
at 6:00 this morning. You will be allowed
to see him before he is taken away.

1093
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:14,280
In a half an hour the police car will take
you to the camp. That's all.

1094
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,830
You have ten minutes,
no more.

1095
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,630
Monkey.

1096
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,890
Yesterday I was questioned about that
gentleman who visited us.

1097
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,020
Me too, but everything turned out all right.

1098
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:48,100
He came back to apologize...

1099
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,900
and offered me any help we might need.

1100
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:53,780
That's good.

1101
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,740
How is mother and Ludmilla?
and Beda, how is he?

1102
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,370
Mother tried to see you.

1103
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,040
I was permitted to write her a letter.

1104
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,960
I think the censor will let it through.

1105
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,830
It was only personal.

1106
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,550
I also started a letter to Beda...

1107
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,300
I was sure it would not pass.

1108
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,930
I'll tell it to you, Mascha,
and you repeat it to him.

1109
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:29,850
What I now want to say to you my son...

1110
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,610
is meant for you when you
are a grown man...

1111
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:36,820
the now mighty invaders...

1112
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:40,700
will now have been thrown off our land
for quite some time.

1113
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,780
"Quite some time."

1114
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,490
I hope you will be living in a free land...

1115
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:50,040
where the people are truly govern
by themselves and for themselves.

1116
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,500
Those will be great days to live.

1117
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,710
"Those will be great days to live."

1118
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,050
In a land where all the men, women, and
children will have enough food to eat.

1119
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,680
And time to read, and think...

1120
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:09,480
and to talk things over
for their own good.

1121
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:14,230
When such great days do come...

1122
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,950
don't forget that freedom is not
something one possesses...

1123
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:22,110
like a hat or piece of candy.

1124
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,330
The real thing is fighting for freedom.

1125
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,000
And you might remember me...

1126
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,670
not because I've been your Father...

1127
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:33,750
but because...

1128
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,920
I also died in this great fight.

1129
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:38,840
"Because I also died...

1130
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:42,050
in this great fight."

1131
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,050
[Truck approaching]

1132
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:05,050
[The sound of marching feet]

1133
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,410
Time is up, Novotny!

1134
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,970
<i>Attention.</i>

1135
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,970
[German]
<i>Let's go!</i>

1136
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,270
He still has his life in your hands.

1137
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,610
Who was the man you helped escape...

1138
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,950
when you sent our men the wrong way?

1139
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,570
I tell you I sat on that
investigating committee myself...

1140
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,860
and Czaka was entirely clear
of that raid in Pilsen.

1141
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,780
Because the traitor spoke German and Czaka doesn't...?

1142
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,990
Yes.

1143
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,580
Yet when he came to Prague and brought his brewery...

1144
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,210
he paid with a Deutsche check
from the Bank of Berlin...

1145
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:13,380
according to a little research of my own.

1146
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,000
Maybe Czaka does understand German.

1147
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,510
Listen, I've got an idea.

1148
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,840
It might work now after these 2 years.

1149
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,390
I don't know, but we can try.

1150
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,060
What?

1151
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:35,480
We can use Rudy
for this.

1152
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,070
Hello, Beda.

1153
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,610
Father was shot this morning.

1154
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,450
Shot?
But I...

1155
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,910
- Mascha!
- Jan, will you come with me please?

1156
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,540
I'm going to the camp to claim his body.

1157
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,290
But Mascha here is a list of all those
who were executed this morning.

1158
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,210
Your father's name is not among them.
See here, under the N's.

1159
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,680
Only 4, Navitol,
Napitol, Naavi and Nimocek.

1160
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,890
But I saw him on the truck this morning ...

1161
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,430
Yes, Miss Novotny?

1162
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:12,230
Oh, your Father.

1163
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,230
No, that list is correct.

1164
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,270
No. Just a little mistake.

1165
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,940
You were right, Jan.

1166
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,400
Mother! Mother!

1167
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:25,030
They play with human beings
like a cat with a mouse.

1168
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,830
I don't care.
I don't care!

1169
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,620
As long as he is alive.

1170
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,480
- Yes?
- Bartos just called me to met him for lunch.

1171
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,940
A sort of informal meeting.
What shall I do?

1172
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,950
Go!

1173
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,070
What?

1174
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,740
Listen, I'll arrest him when I see fit,
not before.

1175
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:13,500
What about these two that you still
only know by their first names?

1176
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,790
<i>But they will kill me!</i>

1177
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,630
Alright, you'll have your police guard.
Where do you want them, and when?

1178
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,920
Back room...

1179
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,010
Cafe Kramer.

1180
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,050
Mr. Emil.

1181
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,310
- Well, Emil.
- Emil!

1182
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:35,100
I want you to met my Uncle,
Mr. Dedic, just in from Kladno.

1183
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,770
- You're having lunch with us?
- Yes, I only have time for a quick bite...

1184
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,020
before I catch my train to Karlsbad.

1185
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,900
Passing through I thought I would
say hello to my nephew.

1186
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:46,400
Well, my pleasure, sir.

1187
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:48,700
Won't you be seated?

1188
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,620
Uncle.
Matushka.

1189
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,990
Emil.

1190
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
just between ourselves...

1191
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:06,510
I don't recommend the goulash,
but the paprica liver...

1192
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,930
simply prewar!

1193
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,350
And speaking of food,
or rather "No food"...

1194
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:17,140
I heard the most wonderful Hitler story
yesterday. You understand German?

1195
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

1196
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,730
You have to excuse me, I can only tell it in
German or I'll ruin the whole joke.

1197
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:26,240
Well, I know a little school book German.
That is if you want me to hear it!

1198
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,780
- Of course.
- Sure you'll translate for us, Matushka.

1199
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,540
Goebbels comes to Hitler...

1200
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:40,500
[German]
"Adolf, we have food for 5 years."

1201
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,790
"Five years? Really?" Said the Fuhrer.

1202
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,340
"Yes, five years," Goebbels said.
And the Fuhrer said...

1203
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:49,590
"I must tell Herman Goring"

1204
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,300
"No, by God,"
replies Goebbels.

1205
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:58,350
"Do not tell the Herman.
It's just the two of us, you and me."

1206
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,910
I happen to remember another Hitler joke.

1207
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,290
Hitler said to one of his elite guards...

1208
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,250
I forget how it goes.

1209
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,130
Yesterday you showed a very good memory...

1210
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,210
of the teachings of your Gestapo friends...

1211
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:31,650
when you tried to convince us to we turn
in the man who shot Heydrich.

1212
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,260
So, you don't understand German,
you slimy scum?

1213
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,760
No, I don't. I swear!

1214
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:49,780
Drag him back,
 keep him quiet.

1215
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,820
<i>Here, help me, police!</i>

1216
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,790
Get out! Through the window!

1217
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,210
Help, police!

1218
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:04,500
- Let's get out of the kitchen.
- Go ahead, we'll cover you!

1219
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,820
Halt! Put your hands up!

1220
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:39,870
Friends, I am Jan Pestuca,
editor of the "Prague Evening News"...

1221
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,750
<i>and I have been requested to
speak to each barracks.</i>

1222
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,330
<i>At 5 O'clock, we hostages...</i>

1223
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:50,380
<i>will be given the opportunity to
address all of Czechoslovakia...</i>

1224
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,510
<i>for a full hours broadcast</i>

1225
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,720
<i>Each barracks will be represented
by 2 or 3 volunteers...</i>

1226
01:25:56,930 --> 01:26:01,520
Will speak of the necessary of the
immediate surrender of the assassin.

1227
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,900
Volunteer speakers must be
ready at 4:30 sharp.

1228
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,900
Attention!

1229
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:20,660
It's clear as daylight...

1230
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:24,160
they're trying to use us as a cats paw
to get the assassin for them.

1231
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,540
I say, let the Czech people decide.

1232
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,130
Our lives,
or the assassins.

1233
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,760
I hope there will be no such
volunteering in here.

1234
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,590
What else is there to do?

1235
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,890
It's not only a question of saving
the 300 of us still alive.

1236
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:40,180
But after we're shot, what then?...

1237
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:42,600
there will be another 300, then 3,000.

1238
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,930
There will be no end until
they get the assassin.

1239
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,650
There will be no end anyway,
and they never needed a beginning.

1240
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:50,190
They slaughtered thousands
long before Heydrich.

1241
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,690
Just for breathing Czech air.

1242
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,570
Has it ever occurred to you professor
that the assassin is letting us pay for his act...

1243
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:00,700
While he goes scot free?
He, and his underground pals.

1244
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,900
I don't intent to wast my
time with you here.

1245
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:17,440
What we want is the identity
of this man, Dedic.

1246
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:20,650
Aldrich Krapke, the engineer?

1247
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,700
- Yes.
- As an educated man...

1248
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:28,870
you are intelligent enough to see the
unpleasant experiences ahead of you.

1249
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,870
You understand, Aldrich...

1250
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,960
when Herr Gruber
says "unpleasant"...

1251
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,790
he's merely being polite.

1252
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,800
What's he doing here?

1253
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,630
He belongs here, Gestapo informer.

1254
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,130
I don't get it.

1255
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,050
You'll get it soon enough...

1256
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,300
right through your head just
before we knock it off.

1257
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,020
Why, you stinking fat crawling scum, you!

1258
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:54,890
You shut your mouth you
filthy Bolshevik traitor!

1259
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,980
- Sabotador...
- Chega!

1260
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,900
You don't have to prove to us
you're not one of them.

1261
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:04,740
Katerina Honiga,
private secretary.

1262
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:08,240
You sabotaged your factory very cleverly.

1263
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,660
Perhaps you are...

1264
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,660
clever enough not to want to
visit our vault downstairs?

1265
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,420
Perhaps you prefer to talk to me...

1266
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,630
in private.

1267
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:21,340
No, I can tell you right here
what I think of you.

1268
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:24,010
- You pig.
Yes, you better not see her alone...

1269
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:27,800
you stool pigeon, or she'll scratch your
eyes out, you fascist blood hound.

1270
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:32,850
Big talk. Ten minutes below and
you'll beg them to kill you.

1271
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,650
Your mothers use to lay with rats!

1272
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,440
their milk was sewage.

1273
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,190
Take them to the vaults.
All of them!

1274
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,030
Tell them I want to know
about this Dedic.

1275
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,740
- Down there!
- Take them!

1276
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,750
Are these all the volunteer
speakers you have?

1277
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,790
Commandant, barracks 2 and 3 failed to
produce anyone who volunteered.

1278
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,630
Herr Commandant, in our barrack #5,
they also tired to prevent us...

1279
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,180
Quiet. Be ready to began your
speeches in 2 minutes

1280
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:10,260
Yes sir, I just have another idea
to jot down for my speech.

1281
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,350
That is not necessary.
Here are your speeches.

1282
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,270
<i>We must climb the path to loyal collaboration...</i>

1283
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,110
<i>and our very first step must be
to surrender the assassin.</i>

1284
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,110
Just plain common sense.

1285
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,240
I was always against using force.

1286
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:31,950
<i>Not one of us would fail to die
for the true welfare of our nation.</i>

1287
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:34,740
But people of Prague,
I ask you...

1288
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:38,920
shall we perish for the vicious act
of a murdering manic?

1289
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,960
Stop that immediately!

1290
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,630
It's easy for you to talk.
You're not gonna be shot!.

1291
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,340
- Everyone sit down!
- Be quiet!

1292
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,520
The Germans have succeeded, in part
shattering the unity of the city.

1293
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,190
Many people are now using
the word "assassin"...

1294
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,190
whereas before they only spoke
of him as the "executor".

1295
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:02,110
If I may suggest, perhaps you should all
know what Dedic wants you to do.

1296
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,160
He's at my apartment now.

1297
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:07,200
His condition is serious.
Shot through the lung

1298
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,700
But why did he go,
of all places, to you?

1299
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:13,580
- It was a terrible risk to expose you.
- He took every possible precaution.

1300
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:17,380
He changed taxi's a number of times.
Went through buildings and back yards...

1301
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:19,300
until he was dead certain no one had followed him.

1302
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,920
He could have come here just as well.

1303
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:24,010
And we would have called in another
doctor without involving you.

1304
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:27,050
He did not just come to me
just for me to treat his wound.

1305
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:30,270
- What else?
- To give me in detail my instructions.

1306
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,100
- Instructions?
- Where do you come into this?

1307
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:36,190
As Dedic sees it, we are faced
with two vital problems...

1308
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,360
each depended upon the other.

1309
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:41,940
If we could find a way of saving
the remaining hostages...

1310
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:43,990
or as many as possible...

1311
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,030
we would at the same time restore
the unity of the city.

1312
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,580
it would be a tremendous victory...

1313
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,170
But in the end, it's either the hostages
or you. We can't save both.

1314
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:59,880
I don't see any possible chance of us
getting these 2 birds with one stone.

1315
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:02,970
As Dedic sees it,
there is a chance.

1316
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,930
What about those bloodstains
in your cab?

1317
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,140
I never would have put 2 and 2 together...

1318
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:11,520
the car washer here calls me tonight...

1319
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,020
and tells me he found blood drops
on the backseat of my cab.

1320
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:17,940
- Just then I was home eating my soup...
- I'm not interested in your soup.

1321
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:21,070
What makes you think I'm
interested in a cab...

1322
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,650
where some passenger maybe
had a nose bleed?

1323
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:26,660
Herr Gruber, he recognized the description
of Dedic from tonight's newspapers...

1324
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,490
as one of his passengers.

1325
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:33,370
- Where did you drop this passenger?
- Well... that's the trouble...

1326
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,410
I don't remember.

1327
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:40,040
Maybe he was the one I took
to Czerny St, but, maybe not.

1328

[German]
This is crap!

1329
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:44,340
We have a list of his runs today.

1330
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,800
We could send someone to
everyone of these places.

1331
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:51,600
Listen, you tell me at 11:30 at night...

1332
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:55,310
that this man went to one of 15
different houses this afternoon...

1333
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,400
And you really think this Dedic, if it was he...

1334
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,310
will kindly wait for us...

1335
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,280
until we come to call on him
to pay our respects?

1336
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:07,320
Get them out of here!
Go home and finish your soup.

1337

Hey! 
Hey, you with the soup!

you dropped him at?

- Yes.

You didn't per chance receive a visit
from a man with a bullet wound?

No.

Of your marvelous quick success of Miss Novotny.

01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:43,160
Inspector,
why did you have me brought here?

1405
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:46,790
Horak, I thought we both had the
right to the whole truth.

1406
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,000
You ought to know what
your fiance is up too.

1407
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:55,710
Well, I guess this all becomes a
personal matter between you three.

1408
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,470
[German] Let's go.
I think I'll leave you alone.

1409
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,890
Good night.

1410
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,680
Jan, you mustn't...

1411
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:11,560
Well, what are you staring at?
You think you own me?

1412
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,400
You were lying to me all along.

1413
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,480
Yes I was. I just fell in love with him ...

1414
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:19,780
<i>That's all there was to it.
Can't you understand that?</i>

1415
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:21,610
<i>Yes.</i>

1416
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,370
<i>I'm sorry Franticek, for all that's happened...</i>

1417
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,530
Horak!

1418
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:33,000
It looks like both of us
had delusions tonight.

1419
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,510
- Find something, Mueller?
- Not at all, Herr Inspector.

1420
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,430
- Am I free to leave now?
- Not yet.

1421
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,800
What do you say to having a drink on me?
That is an order. Muller!

1422
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:48,850
I want you to watch this house, closely.

1423
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,020
If those two try to leave,
find out where they go.

1424
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:54,900
- As you order, Herr Inspector.
- Schirmer will re leave you in the morning.

1425
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,120
The small leather case on the desk.
The hypodermic.

1426
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,100
Come on sweetheart, get it off your chest.

1427
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:30,730
Take it from me. No woman
should be trusted to long.

1428
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,190
Ain't it the truth?

1429
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:37,860
Don't be a sucker, big boy.
There are more fish to come.

1430
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:42,490
Well, 6:00 already. What do you say
we go over to his place? .

1431
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,790
That is an order too.

1432
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,500
You shouldn't talk.
This wound is serious.

1433
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:50,420
I haven't much time.
I must finish telling you.

1434
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,170
Miss Novotny, all our thanks...

1435
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,510
you're a good fighter.

1436
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:03,310
Almost everything in this plan
depends on you.

1437
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,810
It will be very difficult...

1438
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:12,230
I believe the people of Prague...

1439
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,320
will come to help us.

1440
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,470
- Gruber come in yet?
- No.

1441
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:42,470
No, and his office can't seem to get in
touch with him. He was out all last night.

1442
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,360
That must be the little cutie who
let him down so hard.

1443
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,900
The German offered 20 marks if we could
get info about her cheating before.

1444
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,200
It was like pulling teeth.

1445
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,700
Couldn't even get him to talk about her.

1446
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,450
Why does this flatfoot have to know
so much about this dames life?

1447
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:11,540
All he told me was he caught
her cheating last night.

1448
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:15,380
Myself, I figured it must had something to do with...

1449
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,000
[German snores loudly]

1450
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:18,800
politics.

1451
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:22,680
Because Gruber says, how could a
nice girl like that run around like that...

1452
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:26,350
her father is one of the hostages
going to be killed any minute.

1453
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,350
Come on, fatty,
wake up.

1454
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,480
Let me sleep...

1455
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,690
you'll get your money tonight.

1456
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,020
I'll be waiting.

1457
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:43,700
So long, big boy.
Just pretend you never knew her.

1458
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,910
Too-da-lu!

1459
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:49,910
[Clock chimes begin ringing all over town]

1460
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,490
Is it possible now,
to tell his real name?

1461
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:54,120
No, but his name will not be forgotten.

1462
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:57,500
One day the school children will honor it.

1463
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:01,380
"In retaliation for the cowardly
murder of the Reich Protector...

it is ordered that commencing at 2:00 today...

1465
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:10,840
executions will be carried out
every 2 hrs instead of 24...

1466
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,510
unless the assassin is surrendered."

1467
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,060
Pardon me.

1468
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:25,360
Good morning, Mr. Czaka.

[Inaudible dialog]

1470
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,330
- This is absurd.
- But I tell you I'm sure.

1471
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:09,040
- You've mistaken me for somebody else.
- No, I'm sure of it.

1472
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:11,130
Miss please,
everyone is looking at us.

1473

- I tell you, you're absolutely wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1474

Please, miss, please.

1475
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,510
You must met me,
I have to talk to you alone.

1476
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,560
Miss, what do you want
with this gentleman?

1477
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,890
It is nothing,
absolutely nothing.

1478
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:26,600
What do you mean by that?
Such impertinence.

1479
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:29,820
Gestapo. Inspector Schirmer.

1480
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:33,190
Of course.
Naturally that's different then.

1481
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,530
I don't know this person.
I've never seen her before.

1482
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,120
Miss Novotny, we will clear up
this matter somewhere else.

1483
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:45,080
I think you better take this gentleman
along to headquarters.

1484
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:48,750
But this is absurd. I will report you
to the proper authorities

1485
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,840
Alright, alright.

1486
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,050
I will not go.

1487
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,590
Orders is orders.

1488
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:59,010
I will see that you are
properly cared for also.

1489
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:12,570
And where is this note she wrote?

1490
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:14,690
Here.

Well, what does it mean?

1494
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,710
Miss Novotny,
this time you're going to talk.

1495
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,170
You recognize Mr. Czaka as whom?

1496
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,380
What did you want to say to him
alone that was so important, huh?

1497
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:40,510
Let me tell you, Herr Ritter,
it's very simple.

1498
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,260
She says she recognizes me as someone she helped escaped...

1499
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:46,520
from Karls Ave. From the Black shirts

1500
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:52,690
The lady insists that I am the man
who shot Heydrich.

Me, of all people!

That is perfectly ridiculous
of course, Mr. Czaka...

Miss Novotny, perhaps you are afraid
because you lied to us before...

1519
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:19,620
But if you tell the truth now,
I promise to overlook that.

1520
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:24,840
Remember, we won't stop the executions
until we have the assassin.

In a few hours,
in any case by tomorrow...

This is your last chance,
Miss Novotny.

1526
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,160
I was on the Karls Ave.

1527
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,740
You saw the assassin run from the alley?

1528
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:57,200
Yes, it was the man I saw in the restaurant.

1529

- The brewer, Czaka?
- Yes.

1530
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:02,370
In what direction did he escape from?

1531
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:05,920
Just around the corner from Dresden St,
just where I told the officer.

1532
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:08,630
Did you see him running until
he was out of sight?

1533
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,970
No, there was a passing cab,
and it drove off with him.

1534
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:17,260
For your sake, Miss Novotny,
I'm glad you added that detail.

1535
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:22,640
It confirms with a voluntary statement
from the same cab driver.

1536
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:25,810
Ritter, bring in Czaka.

1537

01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:31,360
That's him, alright.

1539
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:36,580
I've never seen this man before.

1540
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:39,120
You picked him up on the corner of Karls Ave and Dresden?

1541
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:42,160
Yes, sir. And he said:
"Drive as fast as you can."

1542
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:44,880
Where did he ask to be taken?

1543
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,840
Some place with furnished rooms,
with no questions asked.

1544
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:50,380
Like I told you this morning.

1545

It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous!

at that very time, I was having
lunch at the Golden Quail...

1551

Where I always eat,
just like today.

1552
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,780
You can check it quite easily.

1553
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:18,910
Do you remember day when
the Reich Protector was shot?

1554
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,410
Naturally, what Czech doesn't?

1555
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:24,330
- It was last Wednesday at noon.
- Exactly.

1556
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:28,250
And on that day, at that time, did
Mr. Czaka have lunch at your restaurant?

1557
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,380
- Now you'll see...
- No, your excellency.

1558
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:32,510
No, Mr. Czaka didn't come in that day.

1559
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,720
I remember it like my own birthday.

1560
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:37,760
I held his usual table for him,
your excellency.

1561
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:42,390
I even said to Albert here,
maybe Mr. Czaka is sick or something.

1562
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:47,060
- But Novak, I was there.
- No, Mr. Czaka.

1563
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:50,320
No, Mr. Czaka, I remember because I put
on your table your favorite Rhine wine...

1564
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:53,440
the old Riesling. But I had to take it off
when you didn't show up.

1565
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:55,700
No.
You're all mixed up.

1566
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,990
You, how can you make such a mistake?

1567
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,870
Please try to remember.

1568
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,370
I was there.

1569
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:10,090
Freddy, you brought me
a pack of cigarettes.

1570
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:12,760
I dropped them on the floor,
remember?

1571
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,800
No, Mr. Czaka, that was the day
before the shooting.

1572
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:22,350
Pauline, didn't you check my hat that day,
as always?

1573
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,390
Didn't I even pinch your cheek,
and you said: "No, Mr. Czaka"?

1574
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,270
Didn't I tip you nicely,
as always?

1575
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,190
You always do, Mr. Czaka,
but not that day.

1576
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,360
- You didn't come that day.
- You're crazy!

1577
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:36,150
You, all of you, crazy!

1578
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,320
What's going on here anyway?

1579
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:43,200
What is the meaning of all of this?
I demand an explanation!

1580
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:46,000
Stop shouting at me,
Mr. Czaka.

1581
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:48,710
We demand an explanation.

1582
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:51,880
Where were you at the time
of the assassination?

1583
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,670
I told you.

1584
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:59,180
I told you, in the Golden Quail, eating.
And after lunch I had a business...

1585
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:01,260
conference with Mr. Tomas Pulta,
the bearing manufacturer.

1586
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:04,600
Yes, in his own apartment until 5:30.

1587
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:07,270
How do you remember that time so well?

1588
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,690
Because at 6:00 I had another appointment right here...

1589
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:12,980
in the Gestapo,
with Inspector Gruber.

1590
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:17,190
I was with him until way after midnight helping him prepare the list...

1591
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:21,740
[Whispers]
the list of the hostages.

1592
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:24,370
Brodavka.

1593
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:29,370
Vystyd.

1594
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,790
Pescacek.

1595
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,220
Walk out!

1596
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:41,510
- Good bye, Pescacek.
- Good bye.

1597
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:45,970
Come on, come on.

1598
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:48,680
Sing "The Invisible Torch"!

1599
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:52,730
<i>...and pass it along...</i>

1600
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:56,820
<i>Keep it burning,
Keep it burning,</i>

1601
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:01,240
<i>keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.</i>

1602
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:04,950
<i>Die if you must,
for a cause that is just...</i>

1603
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:08,950
<i>but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.</i>

1604
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,710
Stop the singing!

1605
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,040
<i>- Ever onward, never returning
- Silence!</i>

1606
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:16,840
- the filthy butcher will be learning.
-Stop the singing!

1607
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:20,760
<i>this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.</i>

1608
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:24,930
<i>Carry on,when we are gone.
No surrender!"</i>

1609
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,970
<i>No surrender!</i>

1610
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:31,890
I must regret to inform you,
the bearing manufacturer, Mr. Pulta...

1611
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:35,690
was one of the hostages executed
at 2:00 this afternoon.

1612
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:38,730
Pulta?
Shot?

1613
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:42,490
How does he get on the list?
I had business with him.

1614
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:43,700
I didn't suggest his name.

1615
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:47,620
I suppose I ought to apologize
for neglecting to notify you?

1616
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:52,210
In any case, his widow Mrs. Pulta,
testifies you never appeared that day.

1617
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,750
- What?
- But, here is another lady...

1618
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,550
- who can tell us the exact reason.
- I don't know this woman.

1619
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,010
Mrs. Nimitz, last night you testified that
on the day of the assassination...

1620
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:06,010
the cab brought a certain well dressed
man to your rooming house.

1621
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:07,720
Yes, this man here.

1622
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:11,890
Will you repeat your testimony please?
Just as you gave it last night?

1623
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:15,520
He came exactly at half pass twelve noon.

1624
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:17,820
I showed him a room for 3 marks.

1625
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:20,900
He told me he was expecting a
lady friend, if I wouldn't mind.

1626
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:24,030
I said: "Well, if you guarantee
she's decent, who cares".

1627
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:27,910
- So then, he gave me 5 marks.
- Lies! All lies!

1628
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,950
How can you listen to
these traitorous Czechs?

1629
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,660
How can you take their word
against mine! I protest!

1630
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:35,870
You know I'm loyal. For years I've kept
you informed of the underground.

1631
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,550
Only yesterday you got seven through
me! Seven! Only yesterday!

1632
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,800
How can you be so unfair?

1633
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:46,390
Will you kindly permit the
witness to continue?

1634
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:50,060
Uninterrupted.

1635
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,690
Will you go on, Mrs. Nimitz,
please.

1636
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,860
Well, no lady showed up
all afternoon long.

1637
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,780
Just heard him walking up
and down the room.

1638
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:07,530
And after a while he comes out and says
he wants to telephone somebody ...

1639
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:10,120
but I said: "I wouldn't even have a phone
if I could afford one ...

1640
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:12,580
because it is more trouble than it's worth."

1641
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:17,290
Then about half past five, he comes out
wants to see the afternoon papers...

1642
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,750
all about the shooting of the "Hangman"...

1643
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,090
Reich Protector Heydrich.

1644
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:25,510
Then he just put on his hat and went.

1645
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:28,510
But this morning, after I was
questioned and went home...

1646
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:32,810
I remember something I found
after this gentleman left his room.

1647
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:36,270
Here, I brought it with me,
even though it's real gold.

1648
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,940
E. C.

1649
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,530
It has your initials,
Mr. Czaka.

1650
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:52,660
I don't understand.

1651
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,700
I had it,
this morning.

1652
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:56,750
I'm sure.

1653
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,420
I must have left in the restaurant.

1654
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:03,170
This is a frame up.
A fantastic frame up!

1655
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:05,050
Don't be preposterous.

1656
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:07,970
Are you trying to say the whole city
of Prague is conspiring against you?

1657
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:11,510
None of these people
know each other at all.

1658
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:29,030
A minute ago, you said you had
no telephone at all. Didn't you?

1659
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,030
Yes.

1660
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,870
Alright!

1661
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:38,250
Now I'll prove that everything
you said was a filthy dirty lie...

1662
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:41,790
And this whole thing nothing
but a criminal conspiracy.

1663
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,550
She said I was in her rooming house
between 12:30 and 5:30.

1664
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,760
Very well.

1665
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,930
She also says
she hasn't got a telephone.

1666
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:55,260
Then how was it at 2:30 I was talking
to somebody on the telephone?

1667
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:58,350
And who was that somebody?

1668
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:04,230
Gestapo Inspector Gruber.

1669
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:08,030
I demand that Inspector Gruber be
brought in immediately to confirm this.

1670
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,320
I also demand the
arrest and investigation...

1671
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:14,160
everyone of these slimy perjurers.

1672
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:15,410
Call Inspector Gruber.

1673
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:18,000
We have been unable to contact
Inspector Gruber all day.

1674
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,460
His office is still trying to locate him.

1675
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:40,640
Just for a pick me up.

1676
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,410
No more beer around?

1677
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:02,710
No more beer.

1678
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:04,710
What's so funny all of a sudden?

1679
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:08,420
- I like that lipstick.
- What lipstick?

1680
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,720
All over your face.

1681
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:25,020
I see!

1682
01:58:25,310 --> 01:58:26,860
Yeah...

1683
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:30,280
that lipstick on the doctors face was perfect...

1684
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,360
not all smeared up.

1685
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:37,830
You're right, Jan, old boy,
you girl is still all yours.

1686
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:40,950
They staged it.
But a little to perfectly.

1687
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,410
Thanks for the assassin.

1688
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:45,620
What do you mean?

1689
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:51,000
If they staged that bedroom act, then the
uncle must have really been there...

1690
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:57,340
and your little girl put one over
on old man Gruber.

1691
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,050
And why?

1692
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:03,310
Because one or the other
must be the assassin...

1693
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:06,810
Dr. Svoboda or Uncle Dedic.

1694
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:12,360
And your sweetheart is an accomplice to the same assassins.

1695
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:16,240
But this time she is going to talk,
and talk fast.

1696
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:57,650
It's broken.

1697
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:01,080
Miss Novotny,
your assassin Mr. Czaka...

1698
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,160
seems to have a perfect alibi...

1699
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:05,160
No less than Gestapo Inspector Gruber.

1700
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:09,420
Yes, Miss Novotny,
Inspector Gruber.

1701
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:11,880
You just wait till he gets here.

1702
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:14,510
But what about all the hostages
in the meantime?

1703
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:19,470
The executions will cease the minute
the case is finished. Not before.

1704
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:23,390
But, if Gruber confirms Czaka's alibi...

1705
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,060
everyone of the witnesses today...

1706
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:29,980
with you first, will go to the

1707
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:37,530
Well, we will now go look into
this alibi of Dr. Svoboda.

1708
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:39,490
It's really worth looking into you know.

1709
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:42,700
Then we'll take care of you and
your faithful sweetie.

1710
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:46,250
Now if you will excuse me, Mr. Horak,
I will have to hurry.

1711
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:51,580
Just relax.

1712
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:01,470
Can you tell me where to find
Dr. Svoboda?

1713
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:03,760
He is in operating, assisting Professor Kubicek.

1714
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:05,560
Thanks.

1716
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:23,970
Close the door, Beda.

1717
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:28,510
Plenty lucky for you mother was
worried about Mascha...

1718

1723
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:47,530
Beda, go over there and wait.

1724
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:50,540
See if the Gestapo goes poking around.
If she shows up, stop her.

That's Dr. Svoboda.

1729
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:28,570
- Detective Gruber, you looking for me?
- Yes.

1730
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:30,950
Just a few questions, doctor.

1731
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,000
Where can we talk undisturbed?

1732
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,250
Here, in the locker room.

1733
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:43,010
Talk me doctor,
when you fellows operate...

1734
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:45,010
you always wear these masks?

1735
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:48,300
Naturally, against infection.

1736
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:56,600
I thought you said
we could talk here all alone?

1737
02:03:56,810 --> 02:04:00,560
It's all the same.
My colleague, Dr. Pillar.

1738
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,900
Inspector Alois Gruber,
Gestapo.

1739
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:14,750
You were the other one at the operation
the day he shot Heydrich.

1740
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:18,170
Exactly, Inspector, o
Dr. Pillar as you say...

1741
02:04:18,370 --> 02:04:22,170
did take my place that day,
with the mask.

1742
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:25,960
Very clever.

1743
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:31,180
- May I use your telephone, Dr. Svoboda?
- No.

1744
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:34,810
No, you better not use that phone.

1745
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:37,600
You better put that down, doctor.

1746
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,060
I'm gonna put it where it belongs.

1747
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:48,280
If you think you're gonna rush me from both sides...

1748
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:51,910
that I can only get to one of you in time...

1749
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:55,580
Then you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised.

1750
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:59,000
I can shoot this gun a lot quicker...

1751
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:01,790
then both of you can jump.

1752
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,060
Not bad, doctor.

1753
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:24,820
That was close.

1754
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:26,730
But stand right where you are...

1755
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:29,450
or you get a slug in the gut.

1756
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:11,630
I was at the doctor when I heard
the radio call for Inspector Gruber...

1757
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:13,250
of course I came immediately.

1758
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:15,710
You say you were with him
this morning, Mr. Horak?

1759
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:20,590
Yes, you see the Inspector and I...

1760
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,350
went to a cabaret last night.
Well, he stayed all night at my apartment

1761
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,140
When did he leave you?

1762
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:29,230
I should say about
10 o'clock this morning.

1763
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:32,690
- Did he happen to say where he was going?
- Yes, I believe he did.

1764
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:35,860
I think he mentioned he had an
appointment with a Mr. Czaka at his house.

1765
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:37,860
Where?

1766
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:40,150
Czaka's house.

1767
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,450
Ritter, bring Herr Czaka around.

1768
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:45,660
Thank you, Mr. Horak.

1769
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:48,700
I'm sorry, but I have to hold you
like the other witnesses...

1770
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:51,540
until all of this is settled.

1771
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:10,730
Go to Czaka's house and see if
Gruber was there this morning.

1772
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:24,870
Mr. Czaka, when did you
last see Inspector Gruber?

1773
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:29,250
Yesterday afternoon.
Here at the Gestapo.

1774
02:07:29,450 --> 02:07:32,710
And where were you this morning
from 10 o'clock on?

1775
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,790
At home, until noon.

1776
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,670
And then two of Gruber's men came
to escort me to the Golden Quail.

1777
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,720
Gruber wasn't with you before then?

1778
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:46,550
No, I told you I haven't seen him at all today.

1779
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:49,560
Excuse me.

1780
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:53,520
Yes?

1781
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,450
Czaka...

1782
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:06,530
between 10 and 12 this morning...

1783
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:09,120
Inspector Gruber
was with you...

1784
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:11,660
at your home.

1785
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:16,170
No, Herr Haas.

1786
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:19,800
- Who said that?
- Your butler.

1787
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:26,300
Why, Herr Haas,
that's impossible.

1788
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:27,970
The man can't be insane.

1789
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:32,180
I demand to see him.
Face to face!

1790
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:37,230
This morning, when Inspector Gruber
arrived, I showed him into the study...

1791
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,690
then Mr. Czaka sent me down to the
railway station for a timetable.

1792
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:43,900
Josef, where do you get these hallucinations,
haven't I always paid you well?

1793
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:47,620
- Why do you tell such lies?
- Will you kindly keep quiet Mr. Czaka?

1794
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:51,620
- Go on please.
- When I had returned, the Inspector had gone.

1795
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:55,710
- Where is the study?
- Right in there, but it's locked.

1796
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,500
After Mr. Czaka left, the maid wanted
to go in to clean...

1797
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:01,420
we couldn't find the key anywhere.

1798
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:03,760
Break the lock.

1799
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,470
Can't do that, it's an genuine antique.

1800
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,990
That's Gruber's calling card.

1801
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,490

1806
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:45,420
You said your housekeeper had
hallucinations, Mr. Czaka?

1811

Czaka, this check for 10,000 marks...

1812
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,060
Whom did you give it to?

1813
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:02,820
To the Occupational Police fund.

1814
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:07,990
I'm not interested for what purpose you
gave the money, but to whom you gave it.

1815
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,950
To Inspector Gruber.

Damned pig!

1817
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:21,290
Yours, Mr. Czaka?

1818
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,590
No,I never had a gun.

1819
02:10:23,790 --> 02:10:26,170
Herr Haas, this pistol was
made in England.

1820
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:29,550
The exact same caliber of the bullet
that killed the Reich Protector.

1821
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:31,760
Impossible, Herr Haas!

1822
02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:33,800
All of this is false,
completely false.

1823
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:36,720
If you only got Herr Gruber here, all
these accusations would be proven false.

1824
02:10:36,970 --> 02:10:38,180
The whole thing is a frame up,
an awful frame up!

there is a mimeograph in closet.

1826

I'm innocence. I swear I am!

1827
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:57,620
The underground planted all of this to
pin the assassination on me!

1828
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:59,500
Where is Haas?

1829
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:01,750

1830
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:10,050
Schirmer! downstairs!

1831
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:31,360
Miss Novotny,
you are free to go.

1832
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:33,320
Czaka was the assassin.

1833
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:36,580
We even found the gun in which
he shot Heydrich.

1834

The remaining hostages will be
released in the morning.

No.

1837
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:48,050
This scum must have been working
for both sides all this time.

1838
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,840
It looks like Gruber caught on to him
but couldn't be bribed.

1839
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:52,300
Not Gruber.

1840
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:55,010
So, Czaka had to get rid of him.

1841
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,020
Pull around the corner.

1842
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:11,940
Czaka, get out of here.

1843
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:22,830
You're free, Czaka.

1844
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:24,790

1845
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:28,040
- Free!
- Sure. Go on.

1846
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:30,750
Schirmer, I'll never forget you for this,
never forget you!

1847
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,220
