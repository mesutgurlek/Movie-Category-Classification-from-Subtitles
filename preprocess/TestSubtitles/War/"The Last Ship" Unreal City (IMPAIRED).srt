unborn child's stem cells

656
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,749
to re-create a vaccine.

657
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,650
You go on. Take the ladder from the roof.

658
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:08,552
I'll take care of her, find Alisha, too.

659
00:40:08,585 --> 00:40:10,870
No way ... I think I know
where they'll take her,

660
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:12,598
and I can show you.

661
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:14,920
Difficult woman.

662
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,778
Let's go. Come on.

663
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:18,503
Yes, Doctor.

664
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:21,487
Get her on the table.
Warm up the equipment.

665
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,587
No! No!!

666
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,401
Stop! No! Stop!

667
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:27,807
Hurry up! Quickly! Take her coveralls off!

668
00:40:27,832 --> 00:40:28,466
[Screaming]

669
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:29,549
I can't!

670
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:30,876
Just open it up!

671
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:31,643
Stop! Stop!

672
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:32,753
Come on! Quickly!

673
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,341
Help me!

674
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,173
The Avocet sub-basement's right above us.

675
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:39,401
She'll never hear us coming.

676
00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:40,993
We're gonna do this<i> your</i> way,

677
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:43,041
so let's hope your guy keeps
the lights out long enough.

678
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,500
Sundown is in five minutes.

679
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,561
We need to find our
people and secure the lab.

680
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:50,390
Do what you got to do.
I only want Granderson.

681
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:53,023
Calm down!

682
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:53,866
Lieutenant!

683
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:54,547
No!

684
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:55,489
Listen to me!

685
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:57,247
[Muffled screaming]

686
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,367
Do you want to save your baby? Huh?

687
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,695
Lieutenant, listen to me.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

688
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:03,950
Do you want to save your baby?

689
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:07,219
'Cause I haven't done
surgery since medical school.

690
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:09,847
So if you want at least
one of you to survive,

691
00:41:09,872 --> 00:41:12,524
I'm gonna need you to
calm down and sit still.

692
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,124
You understand?

693
