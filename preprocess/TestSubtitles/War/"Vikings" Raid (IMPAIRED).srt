My lord, for your wife Siggy,

7
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:10,615
would have you not done the same?

8
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:12,418
Ragnar Lothbrok can give you nothing,

9

<i>I on the other hand can
give you a great deal.</i>

10

<i>This is my daughter, Thyri.</i>

11
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,622
She's soon to get married,

12
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,523
and I must think very carefully

13
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,092
about her future husband.

14
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:24,195
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.

15
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:25,296
We have proof.

16
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:26,431

Am I still your slave?

Does it matter?

52
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:02,690
Athelstan: It matters because I
have noticed that in your world,

53

slaves are often treated worse than dogs.

Do I treat you like a dog?

Legally you could beat me to death,

and there would be no penalty.

58

70

they cut their heads off.

And when they laid them
in the ground, they...

It was Rollo who said that if you're alive,

you might be here.

370

His daughter is getting

00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:57,023
Odin chooses slain men to join him.

503
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:59,292
They arm themselves

504
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:03,029
and fight in the great courtyard.

505
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,897
They kill one another;

506
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:09,035
but every night they rise again

507
00:35:09,036 --> 00:35:12,937
<i>and ride back to the hall and feast.</i>

508
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:16,375
The roof is made out of shields.

509
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:19,044
The rafters are spears.

510
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:22,047
Coats of mail litter the benches.

511
00:35:22,048 --> 00:35:26,051
A wolf stands at the western door

512
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:28,519
and an eagle hovers above it.

513
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:32,890
<i>It has 540 doors,</i>

514
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:35,893
and when Ragnarok comes,

515
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:41,065
800 warriors will march out of each door,

516
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:42,800
shoulder to shoulder.

517
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:46,069
Athelstan: What is Ragnarok?

518
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,504
(Silence)

519
00:35:54,245 --> 00:36:00,015
Well then, how was the Earth created?

520
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:04,453
<i>Helga: The earth was
made from the Ymir's flesh</i>

521
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,021
and oceans from his blood,

522
00:36:06,022 --> 00:36:09,057
when the Titan was thawed from the ice.

523
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:13,362
The gods, they made hills out of his bones,

524
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:16,231
<i>and trees from his hairs,</i>

525
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:19,334
and the sky dome is his skull.

526
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:21,636
And out of his brain

527
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,772
they shaped the welling dark clouds.

528
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:35,482
Floki: So, how do you
think it was made, priest?

529
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:38,485
(Fire crackles)

530
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:42,122
(Sighs)

531
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:46,059
(Bird chirps)

532
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:48,728
(Chicken clucks)

533
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:10,515
(Weak laugh)

534
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:13,084
Rollo: Siggy.

535
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:19,957
(Passionate kissing and moaning)

536
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:22,359
Siggy: No. No.

537
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:25,729
Rollo: I was sure!

538
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:29,833
I've come to warn you:

539
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:32,635
you must leave at once, today.

540
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:35,839
My husband, he hates you.

541
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:39,642
He has shown me nothing but
respect since I came here.

542
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:43,078
Rollo, believe me.

543
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:47,817
Get away.

544
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,730
(Door creaks open and shut)

545
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:09,082
(Footsteps crunch in the snow)

546
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,662
Ungh!

547
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:23,096
Aghhh! Agh!

548
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,234
(Pig squeals)

549
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:30,736
Ungh!

550
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:32,305
(Hard blows) Ungh!

551
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:38,811
(Flames crackle)

552
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:05,869
(Approaching footsteps)

553
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:18,848
(Sighs)

554
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:25,020
(Water splashes, startled gasp)

555
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,026
(Breathing heavily)

556
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:35,029
Earl Haraldson: Where's Ragnar Lothbrok?

557
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,098
(Tugs on his chains)

558
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:42,103
Where is he?

559
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,039
He's dead.

560
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,108
Are you sure?

561
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:50,778
(Chuckles)

562
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,548
You said that you always tell the truth.

563
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:02,855
You seem to have a little
trouble opening your mouth.

564
00:40:07,762 --> 00:40:10,664
Perhaps I could make that
a little easier for you.

565
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,634
(Unsheathes dagger)

566
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:23,409
(Frightened gasps)

567
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,547
(Rollo gurgles as the
knife slices his flesh)

568
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,788
(Flames crackle)

569
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:42,827
Gyda: When will he be better?

570
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:45,563
Ragnar: It's taken too long already.

571
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:49,666
Lagertha: In a few weeks' time
your father's wounds will be healed

572
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,501
if he is careful.

573
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,939
Bjorn: You must have patience, Father.

574
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,273
(Mockingly) You must have patience, Father.

575
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,042
Shut-up.

576
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:03,380
(The door bursts open)

577
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,817
Bjorn: Torstein!

578
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,586
Floki: I found him
wandering around the marshes.

579
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:12,421
Torstein: I was lost.

580
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,060
I was visited in great secrecy

581
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,528
by Earl Haraldson's wife, Siggy.

582
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:28,503
She told me that her husband
had played a trick on Rollo...

583
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:31,473
and imprisoned him, trying
to find where you were.

584
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:36,477
Then he tortured him.

585
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,918
He tortured my brother?

586
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,787
Torstein: Yes.

587
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,325
<i>Siggy is sure</i>

588
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,794
<i>her husband means to kill him</i>

589
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,530
because Rollo will not,

590
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,799
in any way, admit to where you are.

591
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,668
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.

592
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,405
(Fire crackles)

593
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,785
(Grunts)

594
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,391
(Rain patters outside)

595
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,668
(Grunts)

596
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:46,676
Ragnar: Floki.

597
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:58,821
I have another favor to ask of you.

598
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:01,623
I want you to go into Kattegat.

599
00:43:01,624 --> 00:43:03,459
I want you to ask for
a meeting with the Earl.

600
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,960
And when you meet him,

601
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:07,763
challenge him to a personal combat

602
00:43:07,764 --> 00:43:09,498
with me.

603
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,368
Tell him, if he refuses

604
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,938
shame will stalk him
for the rest of his life,

605
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:20,841
and Odin will never
permit him into Valhalla.

606
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:22,676
♪

607
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,368
Next time on Vikings.

608
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,503
They came in three ships,

609
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:36,405
and those ships are
now sailing up the tide.

610
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,407
They have ships that can cross the oceans

611
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,742
but also sail up rivers.

612
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:42,610
I'm with child.

613
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:44,312
You have made me a happy man.

614
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:46,181
The combatants can choose

615
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:48,016
any weapon and shield they desire.

616
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:57,057
Would you not like to be
married to another one?

617
00:43:57,058 --> 00:43:58,025
Who?

618
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:58,859
Me.
