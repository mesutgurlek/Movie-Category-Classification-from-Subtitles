1
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,354
(man) It is men who endure toil and dare
dangers that achieve glorious deeds.

2
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,648
And it is a lovely thing
to live with courage,

3
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,881
and to die leaving behind
an everlasting renown.

4
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:13,428
War!
This is what Demosthenes calls for, war!

5
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,556
(crowd protests)

6
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:21,249
- Aeschenes puts words in my mouth.
- If you mean truth, I put it there.

7
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:24,690
I know of no other way
for it to come from your mouth!

8
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,671
(crowd laughs)

9
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:28,965
Your audience performs well today.

10
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,658
Philip's money is well spent. The words
I used were "arms" and "money".

11
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:36,786
I quarrel with the words you did not use:
"Men" and "blood".

12
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:40,540
If these words must be used...
yes, men and blood.

13
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,416
Athenian men and Athenian blood?

14
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,711
To save Athens,
whose blood should be shed?

15
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,717
- (man) To save Athens, not Olynthus!
- And if Olynthus falls to the barbarian,

16
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,324
what stands between
Athens and destruction?

17
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:56,599
- Peace!
- Move for peace and I'll support you.

18
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:00,249
Men of Athens,
are there still madmen among you...?

19
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:04,941
Who wish to live?
I'm mad. I'm stark, raving mad.

20
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,640
Are there sane men among you
who still think that we have the power

21
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,558
to debate the question of war or peace?

22
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,269
Who will fight? You or us?

23
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:24,649
Why do you speak thus? For love
of country or love of Philip's gold?

24
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:27,882
No! No! No!

25
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:33,096
Philip has been at war with us ever since
he razed the first Greek city to the ground.

26
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,415
And as each Greek city fell,
Philip, too, kept proclaiming peace.

27
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,499
And, to our eternal shame,

28
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:45,089
we stood by and never once
cried out against his barbaric acts.

29
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:51,867
Are you blind that you cannot see
that this is the plan for Philip's conquest -

30
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:56,663
to extend his rule
city by city, state by state,

31
00:03:56,766 --> 00:04:00,313
by bribery, treachery, force of arms?

32
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:15,745
- Yes?
- From Macedonia. Message for the king.

33
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,665
Philip.

34
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,984
Philip, wake up.
There's a messenger from Macedonia.

35
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,154
Ah, such dreams I had.

36
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:32,847
Such strange and troubled
drunken dreams.

37
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,036
A messenger...?

38
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:38,895
- What news do you bring? Good or bad?
- You have a son.

39
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:42,857
- A son?
- Born to the queen three weeks ago.

40
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,090
- I have a son.
- Alexander.

41
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:50,365
- That's the name the queen gave him.
- Alexander. And the queen?

42
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:53,076
- She sends you greetings.
- Greetings?

43
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:55,370
"To Philip. Hail and rejoice."

44
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:59,855
"On this day to Olympias,
your queen and wife, a god was born."

45
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,007
- A god?
- Those were the queen's words.

46
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,282
What mother in Greece has not dreamed
that her first-born was a god?

47
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:28,491
Hail, Philip, conqueror.

48
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,869
Hail, Egyptian.

49
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,354
I want to see my son.

50
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,966
(man #1) Looks like you -
the hair, the eyes.

51
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,469
(man #2) Even his beard!

52
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:50,388
You named him well: Alexander.

53
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,308
Alexander of Macedonia.

54
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,436
Alexander of Greece.

55
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,190
Little lion.

56
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:02,380
Little god.

57
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,907
I say, uh...

58
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,557
I've heard that legend.

59
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,163
There were signs
of greatness at his birth.

60
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:18,752
Quakes and storms shook the earth,
and in the skies a star fell.

61
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,298
And two eagles perched upon
the roof of the queen's chamber.

62
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:24,696
And in far off Asia,

63
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:29,180
the Temple of Ephesus was struck
by lightning and burnt to the ground.

64
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,682
How did you read these signs,
soothsayer?

65
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:36,584
The two eagles -
that he was born to rule two worlds.

66
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,460
The burning of the temple -

67
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:43,883
that a torch was kindled that day that
would one day consume all the world,

68
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,532
and this torch, your son.

69
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,206
And the falling of the star?

70
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:58,169
That a god was born to me... of a god.

71
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:01,610
(soothsayer) There were other signs
and portents of divinity.

72
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,529
Before his birth, the queen had a dream.

73
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,596
I had a dream, too, soothsayer.

74
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,142
One night on the battlefield
of Olynthus I had a dream.

75
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:14,644
I dreamed of death.

76
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,589
And when I awoke,
I didn't know whose death it was.

77
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:22,465
(crowd) We want Philip!

78
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:25,489
- Foretell it to me.
- Those shouts are for you.

79
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:29,869
The people have been waiting for hours
to see the king and his son.

80
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,674
- And if you kill him, what?
- Pleasure, bloody pleasure.

81
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:05,114
- And if you're wrong?
- An Egyptian soothsayer dies.

82
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:08,764
- And king Philip says to the world...?
- That he is also a man.

83
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:15,126
A madman! And if you are, play the role
and also kill her and the boy.

84
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,486
Kill her?

85
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,179
- And the boy?
- Why not?

86
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,724
Isn't it the ancient law
of the wild Macedonian chiefs?

87
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:32,539
You knew her when you married -
proud and jealous,

88
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:37,232
as wild as the mountains from which
she came and the gods she worshipped.

89
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:42,760
What she thinks I don't know, but this I do
know: She's a woman and she taunts you.

90
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,948
Taunts me?

91
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:48,702
Tears me.

92
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,456
And what do you believe, Parmenio?

93
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,167
Even the oracle at Delphi
proclaims his divinity.

94
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:58,922
- I've bought shrines and burned them.
- I accept the will of the gods.

95
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,424
And what do you believe?

96
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:05,179
I believe in the glory of Macedonia,
in the kingdom.

97
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:08,099
In the army,
forged with your will and your strength

98
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:12,896
and your belief that we were stronger and
more fit to rule than anyone in Greece,

99
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:15,397
even in Athens.

100
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,796
And you're right, Philip. We are.

101
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,863
We must proclaim to the world
that Macedonia will not fall apart,

102
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:26,035
that she will continue to rule
through you and through your son.

103
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,935
And then, Philip, we shall have truly lived.

104
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:32,707
Go to her.

105
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:36,774
You loved her once. At least
you can live in peace with her.

106
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:40,528
- Accept the boy. He's yours.
- (murmuring from crowd)

107
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:43,552
And give them what they want.

108
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,311
Alexander.

109
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,752
Alexander.

110
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,611
Achilles, too, was born of a god.

111
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:05,660
And at his birth it was foretold
that he would be greater than his father.

112
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,683
And he was.

113
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:13,688
And this destiny shall be yours,
too, Alexander.

114
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,608
Al...

115
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,349
They want to see the prince...

116
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,894
and the queen.

117
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:49,352
(crowd cheering)

118
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:47,122
- Greetings, Aristotle.
- Greetings, Alexander.

119
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,354
- Whose kill?
- His. Alone, on foot.

120
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:54,317
You should have seen it. It was like
a duel to decide which of them was king.

121
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:57,757
That duel need never have been fought.

122
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,947
Cleitus is back.

123
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:02,137
Cleitus?

124
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,289
Cleitus. Black Cleitus!

125
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,957
- King.
- Companion.

126
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,295
Lucky Cleitus, to be the only one
amongst us chosen to go to war.

127
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:16,423
- For war you need men.
- Three years doesn't make a man.

128
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,508
What does, Philotas?

129
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:20,906
The news, friend. The news. My father?

130
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,036
He's well. He sends you greetings.
As do all your fathers.

131
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,685
- Were there many victories?
- Does the sun rise every morning?

132
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,292
- We even raided Persian soil.
- Persia!

133
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:34,568
Across the Bosphorus one night -
a quick, short, sharp raid.

134
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:37,487
Before they knew it,
we'd sacked three towns.

135
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:40,407
A Greek army on Persian soil -

136
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:45,621
the dream of Greece for 200 years,
and to Philip goes the glory.

137
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,914
Hail, Philip.

138
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:50,000
Hail, Philip!

139
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:54,172
Cleitus, why did my father send you here?

140
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,466
To train new troops and bring them back.

141
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,864
- And us?
- To train you, too, as always.

142
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:03,557
- And bring us back, too?
- I have no orders concerning that.

143
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,998
- Hail, Philip!
- Your father means you well.

144
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:10,543
I mean him well, and love him.
But he hoards his glory like a miser,

145
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,524
while we sit at the feet of Aristotle

146
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:16,174
and learn of great wonders of science,
of mathematics and of logic.

147
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:21,493
And maybe one of us will write a book
and be known as the pupil of Aristotle!

148
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:39,636
Aristotle... forgive me.

149
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:42,347
For what? You spoke like a king.

150
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:45,684
I, like a teacher.

151
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:50,794
- Your blood ran quick, too?
- At Cleitus' tale of the Persian raid? Yes.

152
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,174
For in that act I saw something
that might unite our torn and bloody land,

153
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,572
and put an end to Greeks killing Greeks,

154
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,431
and send them marching
under Philip on their holy mission -

155
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,976
to conquer Persia and destroy it.

156
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,478
Will Greece follow my father?

157
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:11,754
I do not know. Neither does he. Men
do not easily forget years of slaughter

158
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:15,091
and burning and pillage,
and deep and bitter hatreds.

159
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,888
And the cry of "Philip the Barbarian"
still echoes through the land.

160
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,702
He may conquer, but he will not rule.

161
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:28,438
Do you know how vast
the Persian Empire is?

162
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:32,401
From the Nile to the Indus,
from Samarkand to Babylon.

163
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:35,947
And beyond. Do you know
how many different people live there?

164
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,370
By heart. Carians, Armenians,
Jews, Parthians, Egyptians.

165
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:43,975
- I know their customs and their gods.
- Yes.

166
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,564
For this is more than an empire,
this is Colossus.

167
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:52,944
To rule it would take a man
as great as you can be.

168
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:56,488
That is why I say patience.

169
00:15:57,426 --> 00:16:00,347
Patience? My time is short.

170
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,162
Short?

171
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:06,291
When the great god Zeus,
father of Achilles,

172
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:11,193
gave him his choice between a long life of
obscurity and a short one filled with glory,

173
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,903
he chose glory.

174
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,509
So did I.

175
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,700
Achilles died young.

176
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:31,630
Your friends are waiting for you
on the field. It's your turn to throw.

177
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,970
We Greeks are the chosen, the elect.

178
00:16:57,073 --> 00:17:00,828
Our culture is the best,
our civilisation the best, our men the best.

179
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:04,164
- Now watch.
- (Aristotle) All others are barbarians,

180
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:07,918
and it is our moral duty
to conquer them, enslave them,

181
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,525
and, if necessary, destroy them.

182
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,826
Wonders are many, but none
is more wonderful than man himself.

183
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:22,830
The Persian way of life has
the seed of death and fear in it,

184
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,167
the Greek, of life and courage.

185
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,756
The gods of the Greeks
are made in the image of man.

186
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:36,179
Not men with birds' heads
and bulls with lions' heads,

187
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:40,975
but men who can be understood and felt.

188
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:43,582
"Thus beneath great-hearted Achilles
his whole-hooved horses

189
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:45,667
trampled corpses and shields together,

190
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,169
and with blood
all the axle-tree below was sprinkled,

191
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:50,463
for blood drops from
the horses' hooves splashed them,

192
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,758
and blood drops from
the tyres of the wheels."

193
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,365
"But the son of Peleus
pressed on to win glory,

194
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:58,284
flecking with gore his irresistible hands."

195
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,061
To place such responsibility on his
shoulders, to thrust manhood on a boy!

196
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,544
- Aristotle, we waste words.
- You waste a great man. In another year...

197
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,507
Another year?! In a year
I once swept through half Greece.

198
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,426
In another year they may sweep me back.

199
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:37,285
- This time victory is not on my spears.
- You asked for my opinion.

200
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:39,161
- I treasure it.
- You won't take it.

201
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,559
- Tell him why.
- There are many whys.

202
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:45,732
- I know them all.
- I know one. The queen.

203
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,607
- I know that one.
- Listen to him.

204
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,423
Listen to what?
Does he say the boy's not loyal?

205
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,674
- To you?
- To me.

206
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:53,865
- He'd lay his life down...
- I for him.

207
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:58,557
But you are asking him to make a choice
between the mind and the heart.

208
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:02,103
He'd make the right one.
I hold him to be a man.

209
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:17,014
An Illyrian spear through the knee.

210
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:21,394
What's an arm or a leg or an eye
for the sake of glory?

211
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:25,670
You've grown.
A year ago, when I left you here...

212
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:28,693
- Almost two.
- So it is.

213
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,926
Tall and straight as a spear.

214
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,907
A Macedonian spear.

215
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:47,254
- Do you come from Pella?
- No.

216
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:50,591
- Straight from the battlefield, to see you.
- Me?

217
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,493
- How's your mother?
- When I last saw her, well.

218
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:58,099
- When was that?
- Several months ago. Why?

219
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:01,019
- Aristotle tells me you excel.
- Except in patience.

220
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:05,816
He's told me that, too.
And that you thirst for glory.

221
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,883
- When we hear news of your victories...
- Victories? There are none.

222
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:13,219
For the first time in 20 years,
Macedonians retreat.

223
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,930
- I've heard that, too.
- And what do you think?

224
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:19,164
That my father's name
is Philip of Macedonia.

225
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:23,334
Can you rule in Pella while I fight?

226
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:29,486
- Rule in Pella?
- There is a revolt there.

227
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,554
In my capital, in my palace!
That's why I'm back.

228
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,786
There must be loyalty
here to the House of Philip.

229
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:40,018
Can you rule? Aristotle stands opposed.

230
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,877
Who else?

231
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,858
Attalus.

232
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,238
And you?

233
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:52,740
I rode 200 leagues to Mieza.

234
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:55,451
I can rule.

235
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,372
- At all costs?
- I can rule.

236
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,880
Tomorrow morning, when the sun is high,

237
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:09,008
I want you and your companions
to ride into Pella.

238
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:12,658
And there, in full view
of the entire populace,

239
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:16,203
I'll proclaim you regent in Macedonia.

240
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:20,791
- I'll go and tell the others.
- Alexander.

241
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:36,016
There's work to do. Farewell, Aristotle.

242
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:40,396
Farewell. Take these words with you,
and use them for what they're worth.

243
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,089
Alexander is many things.
He's logic and he's dreams.

244
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:49,468
He's warrior and he's poet.
He's man and he's spirit.

245
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,596
He's your son, but he's also hers,

246
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:56,037
and he believes himself to be a god.

247
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:10,531
(dog barks)

248
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:59,959
(women's laughter and music)

249
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,608
Alexander!

250
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,116
The night was a thousand years.
When I heard last night that you...

251
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:53,349
You heard last night that I was coming?
From whom?

252
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:57,729
Oh, a man... a soldier... a messenger.
I don't remember.

253
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,857
I couldn't wait.
I wanted to come to you, to warn you.

254
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,985
- To what?
- No. No, not to warn you. To beg you.

255
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:07,218
- To warn me? To beg me?
- I vowed to the gods that...

256
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,929
Mother, say what you want to say.

257
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:13,057
He's gone mad.
No one was safe in Pella this night.

258
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:15,246
Philip has gone mad.

259
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,669
- Send them away.
- They're my friends, here for safety.

260
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:22,755
Send them away!

261
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,802
What's all this about my father?

262
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:34,018
To the sword, the cross, the rack,
men that have been his friends for years.

263
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:38,814
Now everyone is his enemy. He accuses
everyone of conspiring against him.

264
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:44,028
Even me. You'll hear that story,
Alexander. You'll hear it from him.

265
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:47,260
But you mustn't believe it.
You mustn't. You don't, do you?

266
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:49,867
Why should he accuse you?

267
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,707
He wants to get rid of me.
He's been wanting to for years.

268
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,731
He wants to marry again.

269
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:01,546
- Who?
- Attalus's niece.

270
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:05,196
You be careful of Attalus.
You be careful of all of them.

271
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:08,116
She's no fool.

272
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:12,704
She won't let him throw her away like
he's done with all the others. She's young.

273
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,685
Mother!

274
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:21,047
Whatever he asks of you, do.
Whatever he says, agree with.

275
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:23,653
For when you're regent...

276
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:28,554
When you're regent, then... we'll rule.

277
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:31,265
We?

278
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:35,228
Your father will see you now.

279
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:14,123
Have you seen your mother?

280
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,251
Yes.

281
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:23,509
An act of revolt
against the state is treason.

282
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:27,157
In giving you the regency,
I give you power.

283
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:31,017
Power is absolute -
if you don't use it, you lose it.

284
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,145
- My father always spoke bluntly.
- Did he?

285
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:39,358
That's not what people say.
They say "Philip, the cunning", "the fox".

286
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:41,652
- Speak bluntly now.
- I do not choose to.

287
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:46,449
- Then I do not choose to answer.
- Who says choice is yours? Alexander!

288
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:49,056
All I ask is truth.

289
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:53,853
- I've been at Mieza all this time.
- You saw her. Many times you saw her.

290
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,399
- Whenever I could.
- And never did you hear about this plot?

291
00:26:57,606 --> 00:27:00,631
It's your choice as king
to put me on the rack.

292
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:06,471
There's a man on the rack now,
a kinsman of your mother's,

293
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:09,286
who, before he died, screamed her name.

294
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:11,580
Torture makes men scream blasphemies.

295
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:14,916
- Is it blasphemy to speak her name?
- In foul lies, yes.

296
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:18,150
And if I brought you proof
that this revolt was brewed by her?

297
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:21,904
If I brought you proof, and you brought
me proof, and we swore to heaven?

298
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:24,823
Here we stand,
and you believe in me or you don't!

299
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,909
I want to.

300
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:30,350
- And I want you to.
- Then listen.

301
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:33,270
And listen carefully, boy. This woman...

302
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:35,876
- My mother.
...wants to rule.

303
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,839
She is the queen.

304
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:44,428
You asked for blunt words -
so she's called.

305
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,477
There is no love between us. She can
only rule through you. You are her power.

306
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:53,395
And her pawn.

307
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:56,106
- I'm no one's pawn.
- Are you sure?

308
00:27:57,461 --> 00:28:02,259
A rumour here in Pella -
the Macedonian army is defeated.

309
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:06,012
Philip is dying. Philip is dead.
Rumours, rumours.

310
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:09,245
- Spread by whom?
- By her. Here in Pella, chaos.

311
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:12,060
Who rules? She does.

312
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:16,128
Antipater, my regent, dare not oppose her,
for she claims she rules for you.

313
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:19,673
To back up that claim, she calls on
her brother, the king of Epirus.

314
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,592
For the first time
since I took power in Macedonia,

315
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:24,991
a foreign army stands on its borders.

316
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:29,476
Now she has the power she seeks, for
Antipater dare not use his troops in war.

317
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:35,106
So he gives in to her, for he knows that
I may need those troops. And I do!

318
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,130
Now there's no longer chaos in Pella,
there's murder.

319
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:40,216
Some of my best men died.

320
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:45,534
What does it matter that the Macedonian
Empire crumbles? She rules in Pella!

321
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,393
This is why Attalus
stood opposed last night at Mieza.

322
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:53,876
Is it?

323
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,900
And why Parmenio stood in silence.

324
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,820
They were afraid of her hold on you.

325
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:02,635
I am not.

326
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:08,893
Alexander, as your first act as regent,
send your mother away.

327
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:14,732
- Exile my mother?
- Back to her kinsmen in Epirus.

328
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,234
- She'll be happy.
- Is that the cost of my proof?

329
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:19,945
How do you think I came to power?
My brothers...

330
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:24,012
I know. You slew them.
Do you want me to do that, too?

331
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:25,784
Why didn't you ask me this
last night in Mieza?

332
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:32,042
And if I do this, then, Father,
I'll be your pawn, won't I?

333
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,630
Aristotle was right.
You're not ready to rule.

334
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:40,280
All you're fit for is to fight and die
like any Macedonian soldier.

335
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,450
Then at least live like one.
Get drunk. Choose a woman.

336
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:46,118
I do!

337
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,205
I choose her!

338
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,977
Young fool!

339
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,897
Fool! You fool!

340
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,485
By my right as king,

341
00:29:57,588 --> 00:30:00,926
I give you, Alexander of Macedonia,
the seal of regency.

342
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:06,036
With this seal, you rule in my absence
as though you were king.

343
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:12,502
You have the power to collect taxes, raise
troops, make war and hold royal court.

344
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:14,587
For as it is with the king,

345
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:18,549
according to ancient Macedonian law,
so it is with his regent.

346
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:22,303
He is, in his single person,
lord of all things,

347
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:26,996
both open and secret,
at once general and absolute.

348
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:48,581
I am leaving Antipater
here as your adviser.

349
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:54,317
Alexander, there's another
ancient law of kingship -

350
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:58,800
to trust no one,

351
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:03,806
and to learn how to be alone.

352
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,163
Are you asleep?

353
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:28,936
No.

354
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:33,421
You're regent now.

355
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,070
Not because he wanted it so,
but because he had no choice.

356
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:39,886
You're regent now.

357
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:42,075
Good night, Mother.

358
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:49,375
- Alexander, I swear to you...
- Do not swear, Mother.

359
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:54,068
Who else should
I have fought for except you?

360
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:57,716
What other love do I have?

361
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:03,035
There were rumours of his death.
He was being defeated.

362
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:05,746
There were others
who claimed the crown.

363
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,831
Why, Mother?

364
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,691
The crown is mine
by right of birth, isn't it?

365
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:16,695
You wanted to swear before.
Swear that!

366
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:21,284
By divine right.

367
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:30,043
Good night, Mother.

368
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,821
Good night, Alexander.

369
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:45,372
- There's peace in the hills.
- The tribes revolted against the king.

370
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:49,335
- Your father may need these troops.
- The regent is, in my father's words,

371
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:54,340
lord of all things, open and secret,
general and absolute.

372
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:30,732
You will rebuild your city here
and name it Alexandropolis.

373
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:35,946
No man's pawn.

374
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,136
(fanfare)

375
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:36,427
I return this seal of regency, as ordered.

376
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,432
The news is that
you move against Athens.

377
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,769
The news here is that
you move against hill tribesmen.

378
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:49,462
That you set men free whom I imprisoned.
That you set up statues to yourself.

379
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:52,799
That you name cities after yourself.
That you're all heroes.

380
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:55,197
- Mine were the orders, they obeyed.
- Yes.

381
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,055
You ruled well in Pella... for yourself.

382
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,478
How many Macedonian troops that I could
use have you lost on your road to glory?

383
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,066
This leg of mine!

384
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:14,385
How could you, sir, regret a wound that at
every step reminds us of your conquests?

385
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:22,622
Alexander, walk with me.

386
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,988
- You have my temper.
- I know.

387
00:35:34,196 --> 00:35:37,325
And my ambition. More, I think.

388
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,619
Alexandropolis!

389
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,809
At least wait until I die.

390
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:57,868
I've given you command
of the left wing of my cavalry.

391
00:35:57,971 --> 00:35:59,953
This time we'll crush them.

392
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,499
I'll ride into Athens.
And what'll they cry then?

393
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:07,983
"Philip the Barbarian" or
"Philip, captain general of all Greece"?

394
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:11,423
You will ride with me.

395
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:17,055
Alexander, this girl, Attalus' niece,

396
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:19,557
she means very much to me.

397
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,902
My name is Eurydice.

398
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,091
I know your name.

399
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:55,116
Are you afraid to speak to me?

400
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,889
Afraid?

401
00:36:56,992 --> 00:37:00,643
Forgive me for using
the word "afraid" to Alexander.

402
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,918
- Laughter sits well on your face.
- And on yours.

403
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,629
- Could there be a bond between us?
- A bond?

404
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:10,966
- I will not have you frown.
- Command comes easily to you.

405
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:15,450
It was not a command.
An entreaty, a wish.

406
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:25,669
You are very young.

407
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:28,381
Older than you by a year.

408
00:37:28,484 --> 00:37:30,153
And very beautiful.

409
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:38,496
You look at a woman
like your father does.

410
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:41,624
Perhaps I'm... jealous.

411
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:44,648
I am... of his love for you.

412
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:49,341
- Flattery comes easily to you, too.
- Does Alexander need flattery?

413
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,407
Truth.

414
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,596
Why did you come here?

415
00:37:57,577 --> 00:38:00,810
To find out if there
will be hate between us.

416
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:04,043
- Once, when I was much younger...
- Much?

417
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:05,815
Very much.

418
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,570
...my father took a new woman into
the house. I went to him and spoke out.

419
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:14,680
For my father has had many wives and
mistresses, and many children by them.

420
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,765
There will be hate between us.

421
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:20,519
As I said, I was young
and did not understand my father.

422
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:24,481
"Why" I asked "must there always
be new rivals for the throne?"

423
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:27,088
He threw back his head,
laughed, and he said

424
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:30,842
"My boy, if I surround you
with competitors

425
00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:34,283
you will have all the more reason
to surpass them in merit."

426
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:40,332
My father, as I said,
had many wives and mistresses.

427
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,926
- Tears spring easily to your eyes.
- I do not wear a mask as you do.

428
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:53,263
What I am is on my face,
and what I see is on my tongue.

429
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:56,078
And what do you see?

430
00:38:56,181 --> 00:39:02,335
A young girl, an old man
and an ambitious general called Attalus.

431
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:07,549
And love?
You do not see that at all, do you?

432
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:13,909
- This is not the way I wanted it.
- What do you want?

433
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:21,209
To be able to love Philip,
and to be loved in turn... in peace.

434
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:27,257
As his mistress, his wife or his queen?

435
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,342
As his queen.

436
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:33,095
So be it.

437
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:39,770
Alexander, I told you before,

438
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:42,794
this girl means very much to me.

439
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:49,468
The Thebans will not let us pass.
We fight tomorrow.

440
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:52,283
To fight means perhaps to die.

441
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:56,872
Again, please,
let there be no quarrel between us.

442
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,876
I said... so be it.

443
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:10,010
(Demosthenes) Again,
the Macedonian is on the march -

444
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:14,077
the wolf, Philip,
and his whelp, Alexander.

445
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:17,623
Again, all we hold sacred is in peril.

446
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:20,438
But here, at Chaeronea,

447
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:24,401
the fate of Greece
will once and for all be decided.

448
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:28,155
Shall it live under freedom? Or tyranny?

449
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:35,246
For this sacred struggle, even the graves
of our fathers will yield up their dead.

450
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:36,600
Athenians!

451
00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:41,606
Macedonians!

452
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,635
(Philip) Demosthenes declares openly

453
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:53,077
that the battle of Chaeronea
will decide once and for all

454
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,309
who is to be master in Greece.

455
00:40:56,412 --> 00:41:00,376
Macedonians, give him his answer!

456
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:23,654
Hail, Alexander, hero.
Hero of Chaeronea.

457
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:33,351
We Athenians would like
permission to bury our dead.

458
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:38,670
Let them lie and rot on the field of
Chaeronea till they stink to the heavens.

459
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:04,112
To the hero of Chaeronea!

460
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:06,511
(all) Alexander!

461
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,370
And now... to the victor.

462
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:13,393
- To me!
- To Philip!

463
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:15,270
- To Philip.
- (laughter)

464
00:44:15,374 --> 00:44:17,877
Fierce in battle, generous in victory.

465
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,238
You see, Memnon?

466
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:27,158
I defeat you and
I invite you to dine with me.

467
00:44:27,262 --> 00:44:30,600
Isn't that the way
an Athenian gentleman behaves?

468
00:44:30,703 --> 00:44:34,041
I could destroy Athens now, but I won't.

469
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:38,108
To destroy a centre of culture
would be the act of a barbarian.

470
00:44:38,314 --> 00:44:40,505
And that, Philip is not.

471
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:46,762
Is he, Memnon?

472
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,847
Is he, Athenians?

473
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:53,853
Is he, Demosthenes?

474
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:57,919
Is he, Demosthenes?

475
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,110
Is he?

476
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:02,299
Is he, Demosthenes?

477
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:06,471
Is he, Demosthenes?

478
00:45:07,513 --> 00:45:09,495
Philip the Barbarian.

479
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:11,997
# Philip the Barbarian

480
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:14,708
# Philip the Barbarian

481
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:21,071
Philip the Barbarian dances over
your dead bodies, you Athenians!

482
00:45:21,173 --> 00:45:27,014
Father, you're Philip of Macedonia,
now captain general of all Greece.

483
00:45:27,117 --> 00:45:32,541
You're right. My victory,
my kingdom, my Greece!

484
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:34,625
Not yours!

485
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,232
Philip the Barbarian!

486
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,213
Alexander.

487
00:45:44,948 --> 00:45:47,034
Too much to drink.

488
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:50,789
Much too much to drink.

489
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:06,013
Athenians...

490
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,932
Demosthenes...

491
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,232
Saved my life.

492
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:19,464
He could have been king. Saved my life.

493
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:23,636
Don't ever forget that.

494
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,015
# Philip the Barbarian

495
00:46:28,223 --> 00:46:29,996
# Philip the Barbarian

496
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,873
# Philip...

497
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:35,211
A young girl...

498
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:39,486
and a drunken, foolish old man.

499
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:16,088
In tribute to the heroic Athenian dead,

500
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:21,615
I send their ashes back to Athens
under the escort of my son Alexander.

501
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:24,012
And there, in Athens,

502
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:29,227
a treaty of peace will be drawn up
between us by my son Alexander.

503
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:37,673
To all those who died like men on
the bloody field of Chaeronea, all hail!

504
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,448
Alexander rides to Athens,

505
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:03,429
and I stay here.

506
00:48:03,637 --> 00:48:05,723
It was a wise decision.

507
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:08,956
To win the war and lose the peace is folly.

508
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:12,606
There'd be no cheers for you in Athens.

509
00:48:12,709 --> 00:48:17,716
Only hatred, and perhaps
an assassin's dagger at your throat.

510
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,285
When and where
will I meet that dagger, friend?

511
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:54,839
To my humble home, Alexander, and in
the name of Athens, I bid you welcome.

512
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:57,444
Oratory, Demosthenes,
is a noble profession,

513
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:01,929
and, I am told, a rewarding one.
How humble is your home, Aeschenes?

514
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:05,370
Almost Macedonian -
empty of all, save victories.

515
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:07,038
- Well said.
- Well rehearsed.

516
00:49:07,142 --> 00:49:08,707
And well acted.

517
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,504
I have heard that there are no two better
actors than Demosthenes and Aeschenes.

518
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:17,675
I should like to witness a performance.
And I should like to know,

519
00:49:17,883 --> 00:49:23,098
where were all these wonderful physiques
when we defeated you at Chaeronea?

520
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,869
Memnon.

521
00:49:24,974 --> 00:49:28,729
Had so great a victory been mine,
I would have said the same.

522
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,813
My wife, Barsine.

523
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:33,838
- Barsine.
- And this, Stratocles, Athenian senator.

524
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:38,113
Thocian, general. Charidemus,
commander of the Athenian fleet.

525
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:45,725
- Barsine is a Persian name.
- I am both Persian and Greek.

526
00:49:45,933 --> 00:49:49,688
Athens is now my home.
Both my husband and I love it very much.

527
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:54,798
My father once said "Athens is
neither a city nor a state. It's an idea."

528
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:57,509
I can understand that now that I'm here.

529
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:02,827
And Aristotle taught me that an idea
is greater than a man. An idea is divine.

530
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:06,163
Do you believe that?

531
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:26,080
We demand no ransom nor tribute.

532
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:30,043
All Athenian prisoners of war
shall go free.

533
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:32,545
We ask that all Greek
city states and nations

534
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:37,030
agree that no Greek in any part
of the world shall bear arms against us.

535
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:39,219
- And that is all?
- No.

536
00:50:40,365 --> 00:50:44,851
Each state here agrees to supply men,
arms and ships for the war against Persia.

537
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:49,126
Unlimited men?
Unlimited arms? Unlimited ships?

538
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,837
- Till victory be won.
- Whose victory?

539
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:53,610
These are the terms.

540
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:59,867
You see? We have lost the right to choose
for whom and for what we are to die.

541
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:01,743
What have you gained?

542
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:06,645
For the first time in history, Greece is able
to measure its strength with any empire.

543
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:11,963
A nation with a destiny, a divine mission
to bring Greek culture to all the world.

544
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:15,508
Or have your ideas
grown greater than your men?

545
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:18,845
Now you have that unity
and strength to fulfil that mission.

546
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:21,973
And this is what I have brought you.

547
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:30,941
Philip of Macedonia further decrees
that no Macedonian troops...

548
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:35,112
Philip of Macedon
used words to gain his ends.

549
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,823
This boy believes in what he says.

550
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:21,933
Mother, I have brought you
many tales from Athens,

551
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,165
and many gifts - gifts for a queen.

552
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:28,919
Bring them to her, not to me.
I am queen no longer.

553
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:40,599
- Queen no longer?
- Divorced by your father's royal decree.

554
00:52:40,806 --> 00:52:45,083
Philip has said to all Greece that his wife,
your mother, is unfaithful.

555
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:49,879
- I am leaving Pella.
- Also by royal decree?

556
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,112
Not by his words, by his deeds.

557
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:55,510
Here I am alone.

558
00:52:55,613 --> 00:52:58,430
Behind my back, laughter.

559
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:02,914
Olympias wants no one's pity.
I'll be treated like I once was or...

560
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:07,501
I did not think I had any tears left to shed.

561
00:53:08,439 --> 00:53:10,108
No!

562
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:12,611
No, Alexander.

563
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:16,470
Go to his wedding in peace.
Accept it as the will of the gods.

564
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:19,181
I have my destiny, you have yours.

565
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,269
Greetings, companion... my son.

566
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,568
Alexander.

567
00:53:56,198 --> 00:54:01,518
How do I tear down this wall that stands
between us? By breach? Assault? Storm?

568
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:04,333
- You built the wall.
- How? By marrying Eurydice?

569
00:54:04,437 --> 00:54:07,566
- You said "So be it."
- Were my words all you needed?

570
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:10,277
- No.
- Then why seek my approval now?

571
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:12,988
Because you're my son.

572
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:15,595
Your divorce stated
my mother was unfaithful.

573
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:19,244
Everyone worships the gods
in their own way. Your mother...

574
00:54:19,348 --> 00:54:21,642
- But it states...
- That was a mistake.

575
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:24,876
- A mistake that threw dirt on my name.
- I was angry, sick.

576
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:28,421
- I acted without thinking.
- Not you, Father.

577
00:54:28,525 --> 00:54:33,010
You've never done a thing without
weighing it on the scale of your ambition.

578
00:54:33,947 --> 00:54:38,223
You give, not because you want to.
You made me regent.

579
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:41,247
You gave me my command at Chaeronea,
sent me to Athens.

580
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:47,922
You, Alexander! You high-minded
philosopher, you god among men,

581
00:54:48,129 --> 00:54:52,301
why did you accept,
if not for love of the same things?

582
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:55,742
In heaven's name,
let's talk of things as they really are.

583
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,078
A Macedonian princess!

584
00:54:59,182 --> 00:55:03,772
Not from Epirus,
nor Athens, but Macedonia.

585
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:17,431
Is it in your mind
to cut me out of the succession?

586
00:55:18,995 --> 00:55:22,020
You play a dangerous game with me, boy.

587
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:24,314
And you with me.

588
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:28,068
If you think victory at Chaeronea
made you greater than you are,

589
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:31,822
- you'd better measure your shadow.
- I have measured it.

590
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:34,324
Why should that be in my mind?

591
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:38,183
Because you now see me as a rival,
not as a son.

592
00:55:40,475 --> 00:55:43,813
If I did, you wouldn't be alive.

593
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:49,235
Give me your hand.

594
00:55:49,444 --> 00:55:51,739
Give it to me!

595
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:54,867
To the new queen!

596
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:00,916
And may the gods at long last give to
Macedonia a legitimate heir to the throne.

597
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:06,025
You stupid, drunken fool!

598
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:09,465
You dare to call me a bastard?!

599
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,243
Alexander!

600
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:23,960
Look at him!

601
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:28,027
This is the man who is preparing
to pass from Europe into Asia,

602
00:56:28,235 --> 00:56:31,155
but cannot even pass
from one couch to another.

603
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:52,741
Mother, get dressed.
We leave Pella tonight.

604
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:57,537
(trumpet call)

605
00:57:00,144 --> 00:57:05,359
(herald) To all men in Greece,
hail and rejoice.

606
00:57:05,566 --> 00:57:10,886
On this day, to Philip of Macedonia
and his queen, Eurydice,

607
00:57:10,988 --> 00:57:14,013
a son has been born.

608
00:57:14,117 --> 00:57:16,829
These are Philip's words:

609
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,957
Let all strife cease.

610
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,981
Let all crimes be pardoned.

611
00:57:23,085 --> 00:57:26,527
Let all in exile return home.

612
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:08,967
Your father bids you welcome.

613
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:13,765
The city states have sent
their quota in men and arms.

614
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:17,727
We march on Persia before the month
is out. There will be three armies.

615
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:20,647
You will command
the one that marches east.

616
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:22,836
And Attalus?

617
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:27,008
He marches south with me. The
ceremonies that will be held at Pella...

618
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:30,762
- For the birth of his son?
- For many reasons.

619
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:32,325
...are very important.

620
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:36,601
All the ambassadors of Greece are here,
as an expression of their loyalty.

621
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:39,625
It's fitting that you appear
at your father's side.

622
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,483
- My mother is to be treated with honour?
- Agreed.

623
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:45,986
I want the king's word for that.

624
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:51,825
Agreed.

625
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:55,580
Within the week, four of your companions
are to be banished.

626
00:58:55,787 --> 00:59:01,106
Harpalus, Ptolemy,
my son Philotas, and Pausanias.

627
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:06,216
- Why?
- Because I think it best.

628
00:59:06,736 --> 00:59:10,178
- Is their loyalty to me treason?
- When it sets you against me.

629
00:59:10,282 --> 00:59:13,411
I believe this is what they have done
from Chaeronea onwards,

630
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:16,435
even during the months
that you were in exile.

631
00:59:16,538 --> 00:59:19,563
- I've heard reports.
- And I have, too.

632
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:23,004
I know the reason
that I'm back here in Pella.

633
00:59:23,212 --> 00:59:27,071
I saw it in the streets.
You need me here.

634
00:59:27,174 --> 00:59:30,825
- On this, I'm firm.
- And I am, too!

635
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:33,954
Let theirs be the choice.

636
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:36,352
Philotas?

637
00:59:37,185 --> 00:59:39,271
I accept.

638
00:59:45,006 --> 00:59:47,197
Then it's done.

639
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,742
Done.

640
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,520
Pausanias?

641
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:06,906
How will you be able to live
without your... god, Alexander?

642
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:08,573
(Philip chuckles)

643
01:00:08,677 --> 01:00:11,285
I accepted exile, not disgrace.

644
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:13,474
(laughter)

645
01:00:21,816 --> 01:00:24,424
And Philip laughed?

646
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:27,343
As though I were a stable boy.

647
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:31,097
Your quarrel's not with Attalus,
but with Philip.

648
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:35,164
For Philip could have done you justice,
but he laughed.

649
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:41,422
Come take the sword,
this wretched hand of mine.

650
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:44,966
One deed, one act of glory.

651
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:51,433
My father once asked what a man should
do to hand his name down to posterity.

652
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:56,855
He replied "kill the person who has
accomplished the greatest deeds,

653
01:00:57,062 --> 01:01:02,695
and then, whenever that person
is spoken of, he too will be remembered."

654
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:05,405
- Mother!
- Alexander!

655
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:10,515
Pausanias, friend,
you've had much to drink.

656
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:13,538
Go now and sleep. And tomorrow...

657
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:15,520
Tomorrow?

658
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:20,317
Tomorrow... king!

659
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:29,076
Mother... what thoughts
do you put in his head?

660
01:01:30,118 --> 01:01:33,560
- None that are not already there.
- And what's in yours?

661
01:01:33,663 --> 01:01:35,541
- A name.
- Whose?

662
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:37,000
A baby's, the king's new son.

663
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,693
Philip has named him karanos.

664
01:01:41,796 --> 01:01:43,883
A name, like any other.

665
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:48,472
The king who founded the Macedonian
royal family was named karanos.

666
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:53,373
What's in Philip's mind?

667
01:02:14,749 --> 01:02:19,025
(Olympias) What's in Philip's mind?
What's in Philip's mind?

668
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:26,949
What's in Philip's mind?

669
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:35,709
(crowd cheers)

670
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,096
Walk in front of me.

671
01:03:09,598 --> 01:03:11,580
I'll walk alone.

672
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:45,470
(crowd screams)

673
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,202
Leave him alone.

674
01:04:17,483 --> 01:04:18,839
Alexander!

675
01:04:51,373 --> 01:04:55,754
May the gods curse the killer
from now till evermore,

676
01:04:55,857 --> 01:04:58,256
whoever the killer may be.

677
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:07,849
Father,

678
01:05:11,602 --> 01:05:15,358
neither on my hands... nor in my heart.

679
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:19,007
I swear it.

680
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,953
(fanfare)

681
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:17,507
(Alexander) I hear you wait
to declare who is to be your king.

682
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:26,996
According to ancient privilege,
it is the right of the army,

683
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:32,106
both by law and force of arms,
to decide who shall be their king.

684
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:53,587
The hand that plunged the dagger into my
father's body was the hand of my friend.

685
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,672
And I slew my friend.

686
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:58,696
My father's murder was carefully planned.

687
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:03,389
My friend was a tool
used by others for larger ends,

688
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:06,309
by men whose purses
bulge with Persian gold,

689
01:07:06,412 --> 01:07:10,897
and who, for this gold, would betray
their country and their holy cause.

690
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,921
From Demosthenes,
the rabble-rouser in Athens,

691
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:16,736
to men here in Pella.

692
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:21,012
And there is not world enough
nor time enough

693
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,619
for these men to escape my vengeance.

694
01:07:24,765 --> 01:07:29,980
Soldiers, you were assembled
here on the plains of Axios

695
01:07:30,187 --> 01:07:36,341
by my father, Philip,
to be led to the greatest glory and riches

696
01:07:36,444 --> 01:07:41,868
that any army since the world began
has ever yet achieved -

697
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:47,186
the conquest and destruction
of the Persian Empire.

698
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:53,339
Nothing is changed
but the name of the king!

699
01:07:53,441 --> 01:07:58,135
(soldiers) Alexander!
Alexander! Alexander!

700
01:08:02,826 --> 01:08:04,807
(chanting continues)

701
01:08:35,674 --> 01:08:38,177
Delegates of the Greek states
here assembled,

702
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:42,453
at the Treaty of Corinth you elected
my father captain general of all Greece,

703
01:08:42,556 --> 01:08:44,642
and pledged him loyalty.

704
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:49,544
I claim that loyalty, and his titles, now.

705
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,984
Corinth?

706
01:08:55,591 --> 01:08:57,677
We pledge it.

707
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,658
Thebes?

708
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,142
Thessaly?

709
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,521
Argos?

710
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:14,674
Athens?

711
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:18,741
Do you place value on pledges
given at the point of spears?

712
01:09:18,844 --> 01:09:22,495
If broken, I'll not hesitate at
the gates of Athens, as my father did.

713
01:09:22,703 --> 01:09:26,249
I do not doubt that, Alexander.
And you do not have my oath.

714
01:09:26,352 --> 01:09:30,420
For it is sacred only when,
as a Greek, I have free choice.

715
01:09:31,774 --> 01:09:36,051
Memnon, to be exiled from Greece
for the rest of his life.

716
01:09:36,154 --> 01:09:39,388
With, of course, the approval of Athens.

717
01:09:40,846 --> 01:09:47,000
I also order the arrests of Aeropas
and Hermanes for high treason.

718
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:51,171
To be executed in accordance
with our ancient law.

719
01:10:15,154 --> 01:10:17,240
(Alexander) Eurydice.

720
01:10:18,908 --> 01:10:21,933
- She was very dear to me.
- She was as my child.

721
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:26,000
Then bury her like a queen,
not like a thief in the night.

722
01:10:26,103 --> 01:10:28,815
We Macedonians are a religious people.

723
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:32,882
- A suicide must be buried in the night.
- Suicide?

724
01:10:32,985 --> 01:10:35,697
So it will read.
She took her own life.

725
01:10:37,574 --> 01:10:39,139
- The babe?
- Plucked from her,

726
01:10:39,346 --> 01:10:42,162
and thrown into
the sacrificial flames in front of her.

727
01:10:42,266 --> 01:10:45,708
For your mother is a religious woman
and seeks to appease the gods.

728
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:48,106
Is the tale too horrible for your ears?

729
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:52,590
Shall I tell you, too, who placed the noose
around her pretty, white young neck?

730
01:10:52,694 --> 01:10:56,866
But I am a religious man,
and accept the will of the gods.

731
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:02,497
What's man's fate is man's fate,
both yours and mine.

732
01:11:43,581 --> 01:11:45,354
O Father...

733
01:11:46,605 --> 01:11:51,507
O Father Zeus,
I will lay victories upon your altar

734
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:56,200
the like of which
no man or god has ever seen.

735
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:58,036
You god, that gave him to me,

736
01:12:58,139 --> 01:13:03,355
and for whom I have kept him
all these years, do not break your vow.

737
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:08,255
If his life be short, as is the prophecy,

738
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:12,740
give him in that short span of life
that which is the prophecy also:

739
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:17,327
Eternal glory to the end of time.

740
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:04,982
I now claim the whole of Asia...
land won by the spear.

741
01:14:30,112 --> 01:14:34,180
(Memnon) I oppose meeting Alexander,
now in battle, at the River Granicus.

742
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:38,664
This is Asia, where space is as vast
as time, and both are on our side.

743
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:41,896
Here to the east -
mountains, desert, wasteland,

744
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:44,086
2,000 thirsty miles to Babylon.

745
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:48,153
Here, along the shores of Asia Minor -
rich cities, good harbours.

746
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,011
Here - Alexander, with neither
enough men, money or supplies

747
01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:57,017
to do anything now but live off the land.
He must move down the coast.

748
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,789
What do you propose?

749
01:14:58,892 --> 01:15:01,709
Retreat and destroy
everything before him.

750
01:15:01,812 --> 01:15:04,211
Let him conquer nothing
but burned-out land.

751
01:15:04,419 --> 01:15:09,217
And when his supplies are gone, his lines
cut... At a time and place of our choosing.

752
01:15:09,424 --> 01:15:12,345
Retreat before this boy,
this adventurer, this pirate?!

753
01:15:12,553 --> 01:15:16,516
This boy brought Greece to its knees
in 16 months. It took his father 20 years.

754
01:15:16,724 --> 01:15:20,792
This is the Persian Empire. If necessary,
we can put a million men against him.

755
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:25,485
But not at Granicus. There we stand equal
in numbers. I fight one battle at a time.

756
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,882
Then let us fight it
and have done with talk!

757
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:31,116
- Talk?! Then fight it by yourselves.
- Memnon!

758
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:38,831
Darius, Emperor,
you hired my skill in war.

759
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:43,107
- He also hired your courage.
- If I doubted either, he would not be here.

760
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,984
Speak, Memnon.

761
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:47,277
My lords of Persia, listen well.

762
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:49,885
Alexander is like a lion
on the scent of blood.

763
01:15:49,988 --> 01:15:53,013
He needs a fight, a kill,
and he needs it quickly.

764
01:15:53,117 --> 01:15:55,933
If you feed the growing legend
of his invincibility,

765
01:15:56,036 --> 01:15:59,478
if you give him victory in Persia,
if we are defeated at Granicus...

766
01:15:59,582 --> 01:16:01,355
You seem too sure of that, Greek.

767
01:16:01,459 --> 01:16:04,901
The cities along the shores
of Asia Minor will go over to him.

768
01:16:05,005 --> 01:16:09,490
- For they still consider themselves Greek.
- Persian for 200 years.

769
01:16:09,592 --> 01:16:12,513
Greek or Persian,
a man's roots are a man's roots.

770
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:15,537
Are they?

771
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,144
Is there also a doubt here of my loyalty?

772
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,671
My lords, let me speak bluntly.

773
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:27,425
I am a Greek, as you did call me,
taking arms against a Greek.

774
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:31,805
This is not a game for me or for my men.
We have to win, as do you.

775
01:16:31,908 --> 01:16:34,620
This is a professional army we face.

776
01:16:34,828 --> 01:16:37,644
You spoke bluntly, now I will.

777
01:16:37,747 --> 01:16:41,398
These lands you speak of burning
are ours. The crops are ours.

778
01:16:41,606 --> 01:16:43,901
Handed down to the nobles of Persia

779
01:16:44,108 --> 01:16:47,029
by the great kings of Persia
thousands of years ago -

780
01:16:47,132 --> 01:16:50,992
when men still lived like beasts
on those Greek islands of his.

781
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:55,267
Not a foot of land,
not a grain of wheat will be destroyed.

782
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:57,874
This is our decision, Darius, Emperor.

783
01:16:58,603 --> 01:17:02,567
We will meet Alexander at Granicus,
and we will destroy his army!

784
01:17:02,669 --> 01:17:05,277
And I will kill him.

785
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:08,510
- On your heads.
- On our heads.

786
01:17:08,614 --> 01:17:11,847
Do you have stomach for this fight,
Memnon?

787
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:48,344
Break of day?

788
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,742
Our women also wait.

789
01:17:57,415 --> 01:17:59,501
For time is a thief.

790
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:03,672
I am not sending you to Babylon.

791
01:18:03,776 --> 01:18:06,801
Who, then, will the king hold
as hostage for your loyalty?

792
01:18:06,904 --> 01:18:11,494
You'll go to Miletus with the rest of the
women and wait for news of Granicus.

793
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:17,228
- As you will.
- As I will.

794
01:18:19,105 --> 01:18:22,130
I will many things.

795
01:18:25,883 --> 01:18:29,221
I can't believe in what you're doing.
Nor do I think that you do.

796
01:18:29,429 --> 01:18:32,558
- You have eyes and cannot see.
- I see that I have no choice.

797
01:18:32,661 --> 01:18:37,042
- No choice but to lead Greeks to death?
- They're mercenaries. They fight for pay.

798
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:41,108
- And you?
- You ask me that now?

799
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:44,028
Shall I ask it of your body
when it's brought back?

800
01:18:44,235 --> 01:18:47,677
- Would you have me play the traitor?
- What would you betray?

801
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:53,101
Half the night I've sat and listened to
your talk of Babylon, the king, his nobles.

802
01:18:53,308 --> 01:18:57,689
Even in your troubled sleep, the words
you spoke drew a picture of twisted men

803
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,295
to whom wheat stands higher
than a man's life.

804
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:01,964
Who else opposes Alexander?

805
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:04,883
- Who else should?
- Every man who hates tyranny.

806
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:08,116
Which do you hate most,
tyranny or Alexander?

807
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:13,435
- Those words are strange.
- This empire for which you fight

808
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:16,563
is old and corrupt and begs destruction.

809
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:21,569
- The world we live in begs destruction.
- No. It needs a new force, a new idea.

810
01:19:21,671 --> 01:19:24,487
And that idea has come to Asia,
as it came to Greece.

811
01:19:24,695 --> 01:19:28,867
And like Greece, it's here.
You see it, but you don't understand it.

812
01:19:29,388 --> 01:19:30,327
Alexander.

813
01:19:30,535 --> 01:19:33,977
I am both Persian and Greek,
and I know both worlds.

814
01:19:34,081 --> 01:19:37,731
Perhaps the Athens in which
we believe is old and corrupt, too,

815
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:41,172
but its ideas and glories
are worth keeping alive.

816
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:44,404
Whose glories? Athens' or Alexander's?

817
01:19:44,508 --> 01:19:49,724
Both, if needs be. A Persian victory
will not do this. Alexander's will.

818
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:53,373
If you could not see it when he spoke
in Athens, you must see it now.

819
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,605
Did you, when you
went into exile with me?

820
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,525
- I wasn't sure.
- But you went.

821
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,862
- I am your wife.
- That's a word in your heart?

822
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:06,616
- You ask me that now?
- Yes, now.

823
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,787
For I believe he's never left
either your mind or your heart, has he?

824
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:18,294
- It's a bitter farewell.
- Memnon...

825
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:22,570
For you, Memnon, I plead for you.

826
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:22,426
At Troy, Achilles found
his Hector and killed him.

827
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,866
Who will be my Hector?

828
01:21:29,099 --> 01:21:31,498
To the god of battles!

829
01:21:53,186 --> 01:21:55,168
Charge!

830
01:23:31,937 --> 01:23:33,814
(Cleitus) Alexander! Duck!

831
01:24:14,794 --> 01:24:17,715
You treacherous,
murderous Persian dogs!

832
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:33,982
We ask for quarter.

833
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:39,092
Every Greek in the world was pledged by
sacred oath not to take arms against me.

834
01:24:39,195 --> 01:24:43,159
- I gave no such oath.
- But you were bound by it, like your men.

835
01:24:44,618 --> 01:24:49,208
We now stand on the field of battle -
you the victor, we the vanquished.

836
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:52,961
No. I as captain general of all Greece,

837
01:24:53,064 --> 01:24:55,881
and you as traitor to your people.

838
01:24:55,984 --> 01:24:59,009
Not for myself but for my men,
again I ask for quarter.

839
01:24:59,112 --> 01:25:02,450
Ask it of the Persians, who deserted you.

840
01:25:03,284 --> 01:25:05,370
How will you celebrate this victory?

841
01:25:05,577 --> 01:25:09,854
At Chaeronea your father danced over the
bodies of Greeks who fought for freedom.

842
01:25:09,957 --> 01:25:11,835
Freedom?

843
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:15,903
You fight for pay! Earn it!

844
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,969
Then let it be to the death.

845
01:25:53,754 --> 01:25:58,343
Of all the Greeks who fought at Granicus,
no one escaped alive.

846
01:26:13,358 --> 01:26:16,696
This, Alexander,
is the legend of the Gordian knot.

847
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,345
In many years past,
when we were sorely pressed,

848
01:26:20,553 --> 01:26:23,995
it was said that a king
would arrive in a village cart

849
01:26:24,099 --> 01:26:26,811
who would help us and become our ruler.

850
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:30,147
This came about.
And the king was Gordius,

851
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,589
who left his cart here, as it stands,
with this message:

852
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:38,490
That anyone who could unravel this knot
would become ruler of Asia.

853
01:26:39,532 --> 01:26:41,514
Many have tried.

854
01:26:41,617 --> 01:26:44,329
All have failed.

855
01:27:36,259 --> 01:27:38,345
(man) Ephesus, Sardis, Helicarnassus.

856
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:42,516
He is cutting off the Persian fleet from
every port along the coast of Asia Minor.

857
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:46,270
Alexander's turning
the Aegean Sea into a Greek lake!

858
01:28:55,822 --> 01:28:57,804
Alexander, your wound!

859
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:02,705
These Greeks to Macedonia,

860
01:29:02,809 --> 01:29:06,146
to till the soil and work in the mines
to the end of their days.

861
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:09,275
The entire population
to be sold into slavery.

862
01:29:09,378 --> 01:29:11,986
And you, Athenians,

863
01:29:12,089 --> 01:29:16,366
you citizens of the capital of the world,
you representatives of its culture,

864
01:29:16,573 --> 01:29:21,267
you dignitaries, emissaries, whom I find
in Persia still conspiring with Darius

865
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:23,665
as you did against my father,

866
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:27,941
you will be held with us
as hostages for Athens' fickle favours.

867
01:29:28,148 --> 01:29:33,260
Do you think to win her favour by what
you did at Miletus or Zeleia or Granicus?

868
01:29:33,466 --> 01:29:36,491
Do you think those at home
will ever forget such savagery?

869
01:29:36,699 --> 01:29:41,080
And for those of us who might have come
over to you, we have had our warning.

870
01:29:41,705 --> 01:29:44,729
Against you it must be to the death!

871
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:50,777
Yours the victory,

872
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:55,575
yours... the spoils.

873
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:27,900
You will be treated...
according to your rank.

874
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:37,493
- Barsine.
- Alexander, conqueror!

875
01:30:37,597 --> 01:30:39,161
- Is he?
- That's for you to say.

876
01:30:39,266 --> 01:30:40,830
- No, you.
- You sacked a city.

877
01:30:40,934 --> 01:30:42,081
- Look at me.
- Burned it.

878
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:45,419
- Look at me!
- Looted, pillaged, taken a woman.

879
01:30:45,522 --> 01:30:47,713
What do you expect to see?

880
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,945
- What I saw in your eyes when I awoke.
- Because you want it so?

881
01:30:51,153 --> 01:30:55,638
- What I saw in your eyes in Athens.
- There I betrayed Memnon with my soul.

882
01:30:55,741 --> 01:31:00,331
Here at Miletus, Alexander must be loved.

883
01:31:00,433 --> 01:31:04,918
And where is Alexander's love? "You will
be treated according to your rank"!

884
01:31:05,022 --> 01:31:08,047
- I did not mean...
- Those were your words!

885
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,053
My rank is hers.
I will share both her glory and her shame.

886
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,075
(whispers) Alexander!

887
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:18,995
What?

888
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:24,627
- I did not speak.
- Your lips formed words.

889
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:32,552
What do you now fear to say
that you did not fear to say last night?

890
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:37,766
What thoughts drive
through your storm-tossed brain?

891
01:31:37,973 --> 01:31:40,268
Thoughts?

892
01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:42,145
Storm-tossed?

893
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:45,482
You chose to go.

894
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:49,027
Go.

895
01:31:50,903 --> 01:31:53,511
My head turns.

896
01:31:53,615 --> 01:31:55,493
It swims.

897
01:31:55,701 --> 01:31:58,726
And why must you
always choose to be alone?

898
01:32:00,393 --> 01:32:04,774
Alexander... now look at me.

899
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:16,765
These were found on the battlefield.

900
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:24,690
From Demosthenes... to Darius.

901
01:32:24,794 --> 01:32:30,948
We need wait for the Athenian fleet no
longer. Let's face it here, now, in Miletus.

902
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:35,014
Athens is not with us, neither is Greece.
We have been betrayed!

903
01:32:35,221 --> 01:32:37,725
- Betrayed.
- It's over.

904
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:41,688
- Whose voice do you speak with?
- I speak for myself.

905
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:44,086
- The quarrel is not here.
- The issue is.

906
01:32:44,294 --> 01:32:46,589
It has not been stated.

907
01:32:46,692 --> 01:32:50,969
I see it in all your eyes...
and your thoughts:

908
01:32:51,906 --> 01:32:54,305
"Turn back. Turn back."

909
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:58,269
There is nothing in my eyes, nor in
my thoughts, that is not on my tongue.

910
01:32:58,371 --> 01:33:01,187
Nor ever will there be.
Command, and I'll follow.

911
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:06,610
That is not enough. You're Macedonians,
not Persian slaves. I want your hearts!

912
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:11,929
You propose to go on - without
the Athenian fleet, without support,

913
01:33:12,031 --> 01:33:16,516
with a lifeline that stretches back more
than a thousand leagues into Macedonia.

914
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:19,019
This is what your father would have done.

915
01:33:19,122 --> 01:33:21,208
He would have left a garrison here,

916
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:26,006
taken back the spoils to Macedonia
in what little fleet we have left,

917
01:33:26,109 --> 01:33:32,159
forced Athens into supporting us, then
invaded with an army five times as strong.

918
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:34,347
This your father would have done!

919
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:38,207
My father! My father! My father!

920
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,813
I am Alexander, not my father!

921
01:33:54,055 --> 01:33:59,062
The hand that plunged the dagger into my
father's body was the hand of my friend.

922
01:33:59,269 --> 01:34:01,459
And I slew my friend.

923
01:34:01,668 --> 01:34:03,128
Mine the sin, too.

924
01:34:03,232 --> 01:34:05,213
The crown is mine
by right of birth, isn't it?

925
01:34:05,318 --> 01:34:08,551
# Philip the Barbarian
Philip the Barbarian

926
01:34:08,655 --> 01:34:11,888
And nothing can stand in the way
of Alexander's destiny, can it?

927
01:34:11,991 --> 01:34:16,164
What's man's fate is man's fate,
both yours and mine.

928
01:34:34,515 --> 01:34:37,853
Macedonians, I am disbanding our fleet

929
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:41,398
and sending it back
to Macedonian shores.

930
01:34:41,606 --> 01:34:47,760
We came here to Asia to conquer,
to win... or to die.

931
01:34:49,739 --> 01:34:52,973
Do you need further words from me?

932
01:34:58,082 --> 01:35:02,358
You Greeks in chains,
who fought for Persian pay,

933
01:35:02,982 --> 01:35:07,467
are free to go back to your homes
or to serve under me as you choose.

934
01:35:07,571 --> 01:35:12,369
For it is your birthright as Greeks
to live under no tyranny,

935
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:15,706
but as free men with a free choice.

936
01:35:18,103 --> 01:35:22,067
You, too, are free
to go back to Athens, if you wish,

937
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:25,299
as I no longer need Athens.

938
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:31,035
For if she will not lead in this holy war,
then she must follow.

939
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:34,788
For I will embrace in my cause any man -

940
01:35:34,891 --> 01:35:40,211
Greek, Carian, Lydian, lonian -
who believes in it.

941
01:36:16,603 --> 01:36:19,419
Greece is where you are.

942
01:36:19,522 --> 01:36:21,504
Where you walk.

943
01:36:21,608 --> 01:36:26,093
Where you talk, breathe, live.

944
01:36:35,685 --> 01:36:38,397
To Alexander, write:

945
01:36:39,856 --> 01:36:41,734
Every nation of Asia have I,

946
01:36:41,837 --> 01:36:45,488
Darius the Persian, king of kings,
king of lands of every tongue,

947
01:36:45,696 --> 01:36:48,512
ordered to be assembled
on the plains of Babylon.

948
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:53,831
Such an army as the world has never
seen before stands against you.

949
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,167
Therefore, we command you,
withdraw and return.

950
01:36:57,375 --> 01:37:00,713
Go back to the bosom
of your mother Olympias.

951
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,049
For you are still an impudent
and shameless boy,

952
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:06,865
who in your madness
and ignorance have come to Asia

953
01:37:06,969 --> 01:37:10,619
with your band of robbers to do mischief.

954
01:37:10,723 --> 01:37:16,564
I send you a whip, a ball and
a bag of gold. The whip to train you.

955
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:19,587
The ball so that you may play
with boys of your own age

956
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:23,758
and not meddle in the affairs of men.
And the gold for expenses.

957
01:37:23,862 --> 01:37:26,156
For I have heard that you are poor,

958
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:29,493
and since I have gold
as abundant as the sunlight,

959
01:37:29,596 --> 01:37:33,143
you need not come to Asia
as a thief to steal it.

960
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:43,050
You should not have informed us
of your vast amounts of gold and silver,

961
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:47,533
because now we will fight harder
until all your possessions are ours.

962
01:37:48,157 --> 01:37:51,912
Nor have called me "thief" and "boy",

963
01:37:52,016 --> 01:37:55,667
for if you slay me,
it will not be accounted a great triumph,

964
01:37:55,874 --> 01:37:59,421
because you will have slain
merely a robber chief.

965
01:38:00,671 --> 01:38:04,426
But if I slay you, which I intend to do,

966
01:38:04,634 --> 01:38:08,389
it will be said that
this great king and warrior

967
01:38:08,491 --> 01:38:14,228
died by the hand of a little Greek boy.

968
01:38:15,791 --> 01:38:18,607
For I am coming against you,

969
01:38:18,711 --> 01:38:22,883
and, having entrusted myself
to the immortal gods,

970
01:38:23,091 --> 01:38:25,072
I shall be victorious over you.

971
01:39:25,032 --> 01:39:26,805
Does he make camp?

972
01:39:26,908 --> 01:39:32,332
Half a league from here they stand at
arms, no baggage train, no tents pitched.

973
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:35,356
He will attack soon, within this night.

974
01:39:35,564 --> 01:39:37,128
And we?

975
01:39:37,232 --> 01:39:40,152
We will wait.

976
01:39:40,256 --> 01:39:42,968
Order each man to stand at arms
all through the night

977
01:39:43,175 --> 01:39:45,679
and to raise his voice in loud battle cries.

978
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:59,130
(soldiers shouting)

979
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:19,360
(shouting continues)

980
01:40:35,314 --> 01:40:38,026
(distant shouting)

981
01:40:55,544 --> 01:40:58,152
40,000 horse. Nearly a million infantry.

982
01:40:58,255 --> 01:41:00,759
200 chariots, with scythes
to cut horses' hooves.

983
01:41:00,966 --> 01:41:02,844
Pits dug as traps for our cavalry.

984
01:41:02,948 --> 01:41:05,034
- 1500 bowmen.
- Will the Persian move?

985
01:41:05,138 --> 01:41:07,954
- He hugs the earth like a child its mother.
- Make camp.

986
01:41:08,057 --> 01:41:13,064
Make camp? Attack now, under cover
of night. In the dark there is confusion.

987
01:41:13,272 --> 01:41:15,775
On both sides, Parmenio.

988
01:41:15,878 --> 01:41:20,364
I will not steal a victory. If I am to be
destroyed, let it be by the light of day.

989
01:41:20,571 --> 01:41:22,553
Tell the men to rest.

990
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:25,786
(soldiers cheering)

991
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,168
(cheering subsides)

992
01:41:52,271 --> 01:41:54,253
(silence)

993
01:42:10,311 --> 01:42:13,753
Oh! An evil omen! An evil omen!

994
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:19,072
Macedonians -
disaster, destruction, death!

995
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:25,119
It is an omen of good fortune.

996
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:30,333
The Persian moon will be eclipsed by the
Macedonian sun. Is it not so, Aristander?

997
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:37,320
Tell the men not to have fear.

998
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,969
The heavens are on our side.

999
01:42:49,102 --> 01:42:51,605
O God of Fear,

1000
01:42:51,814 --> 01:42:57,029
to you and against failure...
I make sacrifice.

1001
01:43:02,033 --> 01:43:07,040
I now call upon all the gods
to prove to me and to all men

1002
01:43:07,246 --> 01:43:10,167
that I am truly the son of heaven,

1003
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:14,651
by giving me this day... victory.

1004
01:43:16,318 --> 01:43:22,264
This aid I beg in prayer
with outstretched arms, Ahura Mazda.

1005
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:25,495
Grant me through righteousness
the increase of my kingdom,

1006
01:43:25,704 --> 01:43:27,894
never to be destroyed.

1007
01:43:27,998 --> 01:43:31,231
Come to my support at my call.

1008
01:43:35,297 --> 01:43:38,948
You generals, companions, officers...

1009
01:43:39,885 --> 01:43:44,057
this message you will bring
to the troops under your command:

1010
01:43:45,725 --> 01:43:48,020
This is the final battle.

1011
01:43:49,062 --> 01:43:51,461
This day, Greece will be revenged,

1012
01:43:51,564 --> 01:43:54,902
all Asia will be ours,
its riches in our hands,

1013
01:43:55,006 --> 01:43:58,135
and all our labours ended.

1014
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:01,159
This, then, is the plan of battle.

1015
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:06,895
We are outnumbered in everything
save courage and discipline.

1016
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:12,630
But the Macedonian army is such that
even if I, Alexander, were to fall in battle,

1017
01:44:12,837 --> 01:44:15,236
only one man would be lost.

1018
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:20,764
The Persian such that if the head
is cut off the rest of the body dies with it.

1019
01:44:22,118 --> 01:44:25,977
Therefore, Macedonians,
hold and wait.

1020
01:44:26,914 --> 01:44:29,209
Hold and wait.

1021
01:44:30,877 --> 01:44:34,840
Then, when we charge,
have but one thought:

1022
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:39,220
Kill Darius! Kill Darius!

1023
01:44:39,324 --> 01:44:41,410
Kill Darius!

1024
01:44:45,789 --> 01:44:47,666
Charge!

1025
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,342
(man shouts)

1026
01:48:25,397 --> 01:48:27,692
Darius's bow, his shield, his chariot.

1027
01:48:27,795 --> 01:48:31,237
The great king has fled! He has run away!

1028
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:34,678
The great king has run away!

1029
01:48:34,886 --> 01:48:37,285
(laughter and shouting)

1030
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:18,788
So this, it seems, is royalty.

1031
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:52,573
(weeps)

1032
01:49:53,511 --> 01:49:55,597
My mother weeps for my father.

1033
01:49:55,701 --> 01:50:00,186
Grant us this, Alexander - that we may
bury him before you put us to death.

1034
01:50:00,914 --> 01:50:03,626
Your father is alive.

1035
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:08,633
I bear no hatred toward you
or your family, Queen.

1036
01:50:19,893 --> 01:50:23,127
He's braver than his father.
What's your name?

1037
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:25,212
- Ochus.
- And yours?

1038
01:50:25,315 --> 01:50:27,401
Amytis.

1039
01:50:31,363 --> 01:50:32,823
Roxane.

1040
01:50:33,449 --> 01:50:35,014
Roxane.

1041
01:50:52,323 --> 01:50:56,913
We will go to the north, to the
Caspian Gate, to raise another army.

1042
01:51:01,916 --> 01:51:04,941
My wife and family, how are they?

1043
01:51:21,417 --> 01:51:24,129
Ha! Go on. Go on. Ha!

1044
01:51:45,088 --> 01:51:49,678
Alexander rides towards us.
He is no more than ten leagues away.

1045
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:51,553
Abdicate.

1046
01:52:53,806 --> 01:52:55,892
Get away.

1047
01:53:14,557 --> 01:53:16,644
Get on!

1048
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:32,494
Then die, Darius, Emperor.

1049
01:53:35,413 --> 01:53:37,395
Get away, quickly!

1050
01:54:35,268 --> 01:54:38,397
- (soldier) This is how I found him.
- Did he speak?

1051
01:54:38,501 --> 01:54:42,360
- He asked for water. I gave him some.
- Did he speak?

1052
01:54:42,463 --> 01:54:47,470
Some words I did not understand well,
about destiny and fate.

1053
01:54:47,573 --> 01:54:50,285
He gave me this to give to you.

1054
01:54:50,493 --> 01:54:53,309
Then he prayed. Then he died.

1055
01:54:55,915 --> 01:55:01,548
(Alexander) "My son, Alexander,
look now what I was and what I am,

1056
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:04,988
with no one near me
to even close my eyes."

1057
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:09,994
"Let the Macedonians and Persians
sit in mourning for me."

1058
01:55:10,201 --> 01:55:12,809
"Take my daughter, Roxane,
for your wife,

1059
01:55:12,912 --> 01:55:16,667
so that the seed of Darius
and of Philip may be mingled in her,

1060
01:55:16,771 --> 01:55:20,213
and that our worlds may become as one."

1061
01:55:21,671 --> 01:55:25,739
"Into your hands... I commend my spirit."

1062
01:55:43,987 --> 01:55:47,012
(Alexander) "That our worlds
may become as one."

1063
01:55:47,845 --> 01:55:51,601
"Into your hands I commend my spirit."

1064
01:56:12,767 --> 01:56:17,774
Let the man who slew my enemy
come forward, for I seek to honour him.

1065
01:56:20,067 --> 01:56:26,117
Let him fear not, for I swear by the gods
and by the life of my mother Olympias

1066
01:56:26,219 --> 01:56:29,974
that I will make him renowned
and exalted over my troops.

1067
01:56:37,273 --> 01:56:40,819
Why did you betray, make prisoner
and finally murder Darius?

1068
01:56:40,922 --> 01:56:45,825
I did not act alone. We agreed that such
an act would win favour in your eyes.

1069
01:56:45,927 --> 01:56:49,682
And the crown of Persia which you had
the arrogance to place upon your head?

1070
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:52,602
- You won hatred and death.
- You swore falsely!

1071
01:56:52,809 --> 01:56:55,209
No. You.

1072
01:56:56,251 --> 01:57:00,945
For he was both your lord and your
kinsman, and you swore loyalty to him.

1073
01:57:01,152 --> 01:57:05,950
I will keep my oath.
You will be exalted above my troops.

1074
01:57:06,157 --> 01:57:11,059
Impaled upon a stake, and there be left
for all men to see and remember...

1075
01:57:11,893 --> 01:57:16,587
that only a king... may slay a king.

1076
01:57:35,042 --> 01:57:37,441
I weep, friends.

1077
01:57:37,545 --> 01:57:42,343
I weep for all those Greeks
who did not live long enough

1078
01:57:42,446 --> 01:57:46,827
to see such a sight
as Alexander on the throne of Darius.

1079
01:57:46,929 --> 01:57:49,746
For Ptolemy, a throne, too.

1080
01:57:49,953 --> 01:57:54,647
Thrones for all of you,
for all of you shall be kings.

1081
01:57:54,751 --> 01:57:58,819
Hephaestion, Nearchus, Harpalus,

1082
01:57:58,922 --> 01:58:04,763
all my companions,
generals, soldiers - kings, all of you.

1083
01:58:05,596 --> 01:58:07,577
Ask and it's yours.

1084
01:58:07,785 --> 01:58:13,313
Gold, silver, spices,
jewels, slaves, women - yours.

1085
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:16,649
Cleitus! Where's Cleitus?

1086
01:58:16,858 --> 01:58:20,717
- Cleitus is drunk.
- And has what he needs.

1087
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:22,906
(laughter)

1088
01:58:24,156 --> 01:58:28,537
I, too, like Alexander,
give to you everything I've gained.

1089
01:58:28,745 --> 01:58:31,561
For I, too, like Alexander,
am rich enough in glory.

1090
01:58:31,665 --> 01:58:35,524
My son, to make yourself
less great would be far better.

1091
01:58:35,627 --> 01:58:40,947
To my king,
Alexander of Macedonia, son of Philip,

1092
01:58:41,049 --> 01:58:46,473
who led us here and will lead us safely
home again victorious conquerors.

1093
01:58:55,023 --> 01:58:57,943
(man) The war is over! Darius is dead!

1094
01:59:05,659 --> 01:59:10,353
The city burns!
Our soldiers have set fire to the city.

1095
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:12,855
Look, it's burning. Look!

1096
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:16,401
Look, it's on fire! It burns.

1097
01:59:16,504 --> 01:59:21,407
As should this palace, a symbol to
all the world that the holy war is ended,

1098
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:26,724
that the Persian Empire is no more,
that Alexander has revenged Greece.

1099
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:31,729
Women, who followed the camp
of Alexander all over Asia

1100
01:59:31,937 --> 01:59:34,753
and dreamed of this day
when we should return to Greece,

1101
01:59:34,856 --> 01:59:38,299
shall I, Barsine,
throw the first torch for you?

1102
01:59:38,402 --> 01:59:41,427
Or will you, Alexander, throw it for us?

1103
02:00:03,742 --> 02:00:05,724
No.

1104
02:00:05,931 --> 02:00:07,705
No. Put them out.

1105
02:00:07,913 --> 02:00:10,625
Put the flames out! It's my palace!

1106
02:00:10,728 --> 02:00:13,232
My palace! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1107
02:00:16,776 --> 02:00:18,967
It must not be said of Alexander

1108
02:00:19,174 --> 02:00:22,825
that wherever he passed only charred
ruins remain as his monument.

1109
02:00:23,241 --> 02:00:26,788
It will be said of Alexander
what he has always wanted said.

1110
02:00:26,996 --> 02:00:30,646
You think me too drunk not to know
that you, too, seek to betray me?

1111
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:34,087
- Betray?
- Either that, or you cannot understand.

1112
02:00:34,191 --> 02:00:37,946
- I understand too well.
- What?

1113
02:00:38,049 --> 02:00:40,761
The fire that burns inside you,
put that out, too.

1114
02:00:40,865 --> 02:00:44,202
- That's heaven's fire.
- Alexander, let there be an end.

1115
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:47,748
- Why? So that you can hold me chained?
- Yes.

1116
02:00:47,851 --> 02:00:51,398
- Is this the degree of your love?
- My love has no degree.

1117
02:00:51,501 --> 02:00:53,587
You fear I'll leave you for another woman.

1118
02:00:53,690 --> 02:00:56,507
No other woman is my rival
except your mother,

1119
02:00:56,714 --> 02:00:59,739
and your frenzied desire
to outdo your father!

1120
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:05,267
I am not Philip's son.
I am the son of God.

1121
02:01:07,872 --> 02:01:10,271
The world is my domain,

1122
02:01:10,375 --> 02:01:13,504
and my mission is to rule it and rebuild it.

1123
02:01:14,963 --> 02:01:18,718
We will march to the end of the world.

1124
02:01:18,926 --> 02:01:21,534
It's men who must follow you, not gods.

1125
02:01:21,637 --> 02:01:25,392
Men will. All men will!

1126
02:01:34,254 --> 02:01:36,028
Athenians!

1127
02:01:36,131 --> 02:01:40,720
Alexander asks that we now
formally proclaim him a god,

1128
02:01:40,824 --> 02:01:43,014
son of Zeus Ammon.

1129
02:01:43,535 --> 02:01:46,977
"O Athenians, when will you see
your days of glory again?"

1130
02:01:47,185 --> 02:01:49,897
Demosthenes once asked.

1131
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:54,068
Well, now you have your answer - never!

1132
02:01:54,171 --> 02:01:56,988
Alexander, who could
have conquered for us,

1133
02:01:57,091 --> 02:02:01,785
but now conquers for himself
and stands master of two worlds -

1134
02:02:01,992 --> 02:02:03,974
Europe and Asia!

1135
02:02:05,746 --> 02:02:09,084
In ten short years
he has conquered the world.

1136
02:02:10,021 --> 02:02:13,776
He has fought his way
2,000 miles to Babylon.

1137
02:02:13,879 --> 02:02:17,217
Miletus, Sidon, Tyre...

1138
02:02:18,155 --> 02:02:21,493
all these great cities
have fallen before him.

1139
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:24,308
He has entered Egypt.
He has crossed the Euphrates.

1140
02:02:24,412 --> 02:02:30,149
Babylon, Persepolis, Susa -
all are his treasure houses.

1141
02:02:30,355 --> 02:02:35,466
He has done away with Darius, and made
himself king of kings over all his domain.

1142
02:02:36,508 --> 02:02:41,619
Master of two worlds, he has achieved
what no man has achieved in history.

1143
02:02:43,078 --> 02:02:46,103
And now he has crossed
into the lands of India.

1144
02:02:46,206 --> 02:02:49,961
He has gone further than
any man or god before him.

1145
02:02:50,064 --> 02:02:52,568
He has conquered man.

1146
02:02:52,775 --> 02:02:55,905
He has outdone the gods!

1147
02:02:56,008 --> 02:02:59,972
Make the resolution, Demosthenes.
Proclaim him a god.

1148
02:03:04,663 --> 02:03:07,583
Proclaim Alexander a god!

1149
02:03:10,294 --> 02:03:14,988
Why should the blood of thousands be
shed to gratify the ambition of one man,

1150
02:03:15,090 --> 02:03:19,680
who has disowned his father and
insanely affects kinship with the gods?

1151
02:03:28,646 --> 02:03:31,254
This I've heard the soldiers say.

1152
02:03:31,357 --> 02:03:33,861
You will proceed to Ecbatana.

1153
02:03:33,965 --> 02:03:38,972
You will take command, to ensure our
lines of communication against attack.

1154
02:03:39,074 --> 02:03:41,160
Farewell, Parmenio.

1155
02:03:52,839 --> 02:03:58,159
Philotas, you are under arrest...
for high treason.

1156
02:03:58,261 --> 02:04:01,286
No more. No more.

1157
02:04:01,494 --> 02:04:03,997
Whatever you want me to say, I'll say.

1158
02:04:05,352 --> 02:04:08,377
It's true, I plotted against you.

1159
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:14,007
(groans)

1160
02:04:14,112 --> 02:04:17,032
I and my father Parmenio!

1161
02:05:15,218 --> 02:05:18,243
For your pleasure, great king,

1162
02:05:18,451 --> 02:05:22,936
a contest of skill between
a Macedonian and a Persian.

1163
02:05:25,438 --> 02:05:28,880
20 gold talents, the province of Bactria -

1164
02:05:29,086 --> 02:05:31,694
my king has been very generous to me...

1165
02:05:31,798 --> 02:05:36,179
I'll wager it all against
one of your Persian robes,

1166
02:05:36,282 --> 02:05:38,368
which I, too, must now learn to wear,

1167
02:05:38,576 --> 02:05:43,270
that my Macedonian there can beat
any Persian that you bring against him.

1168
02:05:43,373 --> 02:05:46,189
Come, Persians, will you wager?
Will you fight?

1169
02:05:46,397 --> 02:05:49,109
- Will you hold your tongue?
- No.

1170
02:05:49,316 --> 02:05:52,550
That's for slaves to do, not free men.

1171
02:05:52,757 --> 02:05:55,156
Either I am that,
or do not invite me to dine.

1172
02:05:55,261 --> 02:05:58,286
Or drink, for the wine
has gone to your head.

1173
02:05:58,389 --> 02:06:03,604
Your father, Philip,
won many battles as drunk as Dionysus.

1174
02:06:07,461 --> 02:06:09,547
Send in your man.

1175
02:06:39,162 --> 02:06:42,186
- Let him live.
- No. Let him die,

1176
02:06:42,290 --> 02:06:45,210
as have so many Macedonians, by order!

1177
02:06:45,418 --> 02:06:49,486
- Cleitus, brother.
- Can I be a brother to a god?

1178
02:06:49,694 --> 02:06:53,344
It is by the blood of Macedonians
that you have grown so great.

1179
02:06:53,447 --> 02:06:58,036
- We were the victors, not the Persians.
- There are no victors nor vanquished.

1180
02:06:58,244 --> 02:07:01,582
There are vanquished. All those
who came with you are vanquished.

1181
02:07:01,685 --> 02:07:04,501
If you cannot hold your tongue, go!

1182
02:07:04,709 --> 02:07:09,194
Your tongue is thick with wine, too.
Is that seemly for the king of kings?

1183
02:07:09,611 --> 02:07:12,531
Cleitus is dismissed by Alexander!

1184
02:07:12,634 --> 02:07:15,868
- In heaven's name, go!
- No, till I've had my say.

1185
02:07:15,971 --> 02:07:19,622
Then stand on your drunken feet,
if you can, and say it!

1186
02:07:19,725 --> 02:07:24,002
You cast aside every man
who's helped you, even your father.

1187
02:07:25,982 --> 02:07:28,277
I?

1188
02:07:28,484 --> 02:07:32,239
- I saved his life at Chaeronea.
- I saved yours at Granicus.

1189
02:07:32,447 --> 02:07:35,055
- He bore me a grudge for this.
- As you bear me one.

1190
02:07:35,262 --> 02:07:38,079
As you do to any man who
might throw a shadow on your glory.

1191
02:07:38,286 --> 02:07:41,103
There is no man alive
who can throw a shadow on my glory.

1192
02:07:41,206 --> 02:07:45,274
There are dead men who can, and do!
Philip, Attalus, Parmenio.

1193
02:07:45,482 --> 02:07:49,132
- These words are little short of treason!
- They are not short of truth.

1194
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:52,782
Let those who will bow before
your Persian robes and throne,

1195
02:07:52,885 --> 02:07:55,597
and accept that you have
disclaimed your father

1196
02:07:55,805 --> 02:07:58,308
and pass yourself off as the son of God!

1197
02:08:04,251 --> 02:08:09,258
Let go of me! Am I Darius,
to be held prisoner by my friends?

1198
02:08:09,465 --> 02:08:11,239
Let go!

1199
02:08:15,618 --> 02:08:19,581
"Are these your customs? Is it thus
that Greece rewards her heroes?"

1200
02:08:19,685 --> 02:08:22,188
"Shall one man claim
the trophies won by thousands?"

1201
02:08:22,396 --> 02:08:25,108
I quote from Euripides,
your favourite poet,

1202
02:08:25,211 --> 02:08:29,070
as did Pausanias and your mother,
before Philip's murder!

1203
02:08:30,008 --> 02:08:32,303
Go now!

1204
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:34,492
To Philip,

1205
02:08:37,412 --> 02:08:39,185
Attalus...

1206
02:08:41,062 --> 02:08:43,461
and Parmenio.

1207
02:09:27,152 --> 02:09:29,760
Cleitus, brother!

1208
02:09:30,489 --> 02:09:32,784
Cleitus, brother!

1209
02:09:32,887 --> 02:09:37,164
Is this Alexander,
who cries because he has killed a man?

1210
02:09:37,371 --> 02:09:42,065
Can this be he, who lies there, crying in
fear of the law and of the tongues of men,

1211
02:09:42,167 --> 02:09:46,861
when he himself is the law
and the measure of right and wrong?

1212
02:09:46,965 --> 02:09:50,198
Whatever is done
by supreme power is right.

1213
02:09:51,449 --> 02:09:53,326
These are words.

1214
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:57,080
And Cleitus is dead, and I killed him.

1215
02:10:13,034 --> 02:10:16,684
We will go back, Macedonians.

1216
02:10:19,916 --> 02:10:22,106
And I, Ptolemy,

1217
02:10:22,524 --> 02:10:25,966
companion of Alexander,
later Pharaoh of Egypt,

1218
02:10:27,007 --> 02:10:30,240
bear witness to the terrible return
from India to Babylon.

1219
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:43,797
For the first time in the ten years
since he left Macedonia,

1220
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:47,238
Alexander, sick and weary, retreated.

1221
02:10:48,488 --> 02:10:51,722
But he turned even
this retreat into victory.

1222
02:10:51,930 --> 02:10:55,267
For within him, out of the death of Cleitus,

1223
02:10:55,475 --> 02:11:00,065
a new idea was born, a new
understanding, a new driving force -

1224
02:11:01,001 --> 02:11:05,695
that it was not lands that must be
conquered, but the hearts of men.

1225
02:11:06,736 --> 02:11:10,387
And at the end of the thirsty road,
at Susa,

1226
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:14,454
Alexander pledged himself
and us to this new idea.

1227
02:11:15,288 --> 02:11:18,521
(priest) Make this union fruitful
as the seeds of the earth,

1228
02:11:18,729 --> 02:11:22,380
and let the children of Alexander, a Greek,
and Roxane, a Persian,

1229
02:11:22,587 --> 02:11:25,404
be of both worlds and live in one.

1230
02:11:36,352 --> 02:11:39,690
(priests) And let this be true
of all you Greeks and Persians

1231
02:11:39,793 --> 02:11:43,027
who are married here this day at Susa.

1232
02:11:43,963 --> 02:11:47,823
And let this be true
of all you Greeks and Persians

1233
02:11:47,926 --> 02:11:51,890
who are married here this day at Susa.

1234
02:11:52,097 --> 02:11:55,957
And let this be true
of all you Greeks and Persians

1235
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:58,251
who are married here this day...

1236
02:11:58,354 --> 02:12:00,440
(fanfare)

1237
02:12:19,314 --> 02:12:25,259
To you, you men and women with whom
I have lived and with whom I have died -

1238
02:12:25,466 --> 02:12:28,700
Philip, Eurydice,
Parmenio, Philotas, Darius...

1239
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:33,497
and Cleitus... my brother -

1240
02:12:35,477 --> 02:12:37,459
I offer this prayer.

1241
02:12:49,763 --> 02:12:53,414
And to you for peace I pray,

1242
02:12:53,517 --> 02:12:55,812
that Macedonians and Persians

1243
02:12:55,915 --> 02:12:58,836
and all the people of my empire
will always be alike.

1244
02:12:59,043 --> 02:13:02,590
Not merely subjects, but people
who will live and build together

1245
02:13:02,797 --> 02:13:06,031
in harmony and unity
of heart and of mind.

1246
02:13:06,134 --> 02:13:09,159
For we are all alike under God.

1247
02:13:09,263 --> 02:13:14,478
And if God is the father,
then he is the father of all.

1248
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:22,298
No.

1249
02:13:23,236 --> 02:13:24,800
Oh, no.

1250
02:13:25,634 --> 02:13:28,555
No, no. Not yet.

1251
02:13:30,327 --> 02:13:32,726
There is still so much to do.

1252
02:13:53,476 --> 02:13:55,249
Barsine.

1253
02:14:02,235 --> 02:14:04,321
Man's fate.

1254
02:14:05,572 --> 02:14:08,180
You gods,

1255
02:14:08,284 --> 02:14:13,499
have I not done enough
in this short span of life to sit among you?

1256
02:14:14,749 --> 02:14:17,461
Must I be cursed with man's fate?

1257
02:14:19,962 --> 02:14:22,987
Barsine, after I am dead,

1258
02:14:23,091 --> 02:14:28,202
see to it that my body is carried out
and cast into the River Euphrates,

1259
02:14:28,305 --> 02:14:31,330
so that it may disappear,

1260
02:14:31,433 --> 02:14:36,962
that men will forever believe
that from the gods I came...

1261
02:14:38,837 --> 02:14:43,218
and to the gods... I returned.

1262
02:14:51,767 --> 02:14:54,897
To whom do you leave your empire?

1263
02:15:04,906 --> 02:15:09,809
To... the strongest.

1264
02:15:21,382 --> 02:15:26,806
(Aristotle) Wonders are many, but none
is more wonderful than man himself.
