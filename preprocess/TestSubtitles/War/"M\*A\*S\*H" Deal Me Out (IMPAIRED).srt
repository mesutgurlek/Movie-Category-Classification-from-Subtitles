1
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:16,031
Welcome to the 4077 th,
Major Freedman.

2
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:19,435
The conference will start
at 1800 hours, sharp.

3
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:22,804
I'll be there.

4
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,242
Oh, sir, if you'd like a drink,
compliments of Colonel Blake.

5
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:28,507
Scotch, gin, vodka.

6
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:32,244
And for your convenience,
all in the same bottle.

7
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:34,912
- Thank you, Corporal.
- Oh, you're welcome, sir.

8
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:44,922
The conference starts
at 1800 hours, sir.

9
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,659
Good. I can get in
a little sack time.

10
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,667
Oh, yes, sir.

11
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,669
- Corporal.
- Sir?

12
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,537
Have a nurse wake me...
a little at a time.

13
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,542
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,212
<i>[Mclntyre]</i>
<i>How'd you get out of it?</i>

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,943
I just sat her down and I said,
"Honey, it'll never work.
You're too good for me."

16
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:08,714
- Was she?
- No, as a matter of fact,
she wasn't very good at all.

17
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,815
- You have a lot of trouble
with women, don't you?
- Every chance I can.

18
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:15,019
- Sponge.
- Sponge.

19
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,358
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Yeah?

20
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,594
I just wanted to remind you, sirs, that
the conference is set for 1800 hours.

21
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:25,535
- How much is that in people time?
- 6:00.

22
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:28,665
Wow!

23
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:32,802
Hey, Radar, without your glasses
you could almost pass for offensive.

24
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,075
<i>Hey, why don't you</i>
<i>leave the little fellow alone?</i>

25
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,639
It's okay.
I can take a joke.

26
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,785
- <i>[Mclntyre] Hey!</i>
- <i>Wait a minute!</i>

27
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,789
Where you going?
I was kidding!

28
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:47,917
- He's kidding!
- You're beautiful!

29
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:49,928
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Yo.

30
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:55,059
Sir, Major Freedman and Captain Pak have
arrived and will be ready at 1800 hours.

31
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,898
Oh, that's terrific, Radar.

32
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,370
Cut yourself shaving, sir?

33
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,499
No, Radar. I thought I'd wear
three pieces of toilet paper tonight.

34
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:06,340
Maybe start a new trend.

35
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:10,075
- I don't think it'll catch on.
- That'll be all, Radar.

36
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,414
- Sir, could I ask a favor?
- Ask away.

37
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:16,421
- Can I use the jeep tonight?
- Oh?

38
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,049
Got a little action
lined up tonight, Radar?

39
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,891
Well, me and a couple of guys
are going down to the Purple Dragon.

40
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:24,896
It's supposed to be
real nifty.

41
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:29,833
Oh, Radar,
the Purple Dragon is a Lockheed bomber
packing crate they emptied...

42
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:34,066
and stuck in a jukebox
and a bunch of B-girls on roller skates.

43
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,869
Yeah.

44
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,904
I wouldn't touch one of those girls
if I was a ten-foot pole.

45
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:47,044
- Uh, but, sir...
- Do you remember the training
film you saw yesterday?

46
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:50,816
- Oh, don't worry about me, sir.
I know what to do.
- Uh-huh.

47
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,791
I'm not gonna get trench foot.

48
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,453
- Have a good time.
- Thank you, sir.

49
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:02,295
Gentlemen, I make it
1800 hours.

50
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,700
We're all assembled.
Let's begin.

51
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,035
Okay.
First ace deals.

52
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:11,440
Here we go. Oops.

53
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,206
- Nice dealing, Henry.
- That's embarrassing.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,216
- Did you cut those cards, Henry?
- Somebody ought to cut Henry.

55
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,045
Okeydoke, ante up.

56
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,783
How 'bout a little five-card stud?

57
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,493
Jake.
Three of clubs.

58
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,529
Deuce. Lady.

59
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:34,032
Ooh. And a big ace for the dealer.
Sorry about that.

60
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,466
- Bet a buck blind.
- Okay.

61
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,503
- Call.
- Call.

62
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,233
The winning hand is folding.

63
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,332
- The pot is ripe.
- Hi, sirs.

64
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,468
Sandwiches from the mess tent.

65
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:48,012
I hope everybody
likes carrier pigeon.

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,641
There's ham, chicken and something
brown that just lays there.

67
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:54,117
Here we go.
Jack, four.

68
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:57,519
Pair of threes.
Queen. Ace, four.

69
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,219
Everybody know Klinger?
This is Captain Pak, Major Freedman.

70
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,420
Ah, the psychiatrist.

71
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:06,158
Still trying to get out
wearing dresses, Klinger.

72
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:08,928
Earrings with a sweater?

73
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,936
<i>Klinger, be creative.</i>

74
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,438
I remember a guy, insisted
he was a cockroach...

75
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,998
who would only crawl
along the woodwork.

76
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,135
That was Private Kafka, I believe.

77
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,238
<i>Then I had a young man</i>
<i>who claimed to be reincarnated.</i>

78
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,340
Said he was with Washington
at Valley Forge,

79
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,352
and therefore he'd already
done his military service.

80
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:38,423
Just a moment, Nurse.
Hold it, people.

81
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,431
Lieutenant Rogers?

82
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,626
Yes, sir?

83
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:48,070
This man can't be put under.
He's army counterintelligence.

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,803
Can't be anesthetized unless
there's another C.I.D. Man present.

85
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:56,211
In case he tells anything
under sedation. Regulations.

86
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:59,877
I've notified your H.Q.
There will be someone here in a hour.

87
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:04,719
And I guarantee you you're
absolutely in no danger, I think.

88
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:08,560
Thanks, Doc.

89
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:11,118
Five clams.

90
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,132
- I'm out.
- I'm in.

91
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,102
I wonder what the chances are
of my getting the fifth jack?

92
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,162
Oh, well, not to worry.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,572
Your five and up five.

94
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,769
That's mean.

95
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,007
I'm gonna beat the pants
off you, lady.

96
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:33,883
- Hey, where'd we get the kosher salami?
- I brought it.

97
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:37,980
Little girl I knew at Berkeley
sent it. She's a yenta now.

98
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,992
Okay, okay, here we go.
Down and dirty.

99
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,790
- [Groans]
- What's your problem, poker face?

100
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,958
I'm committing suicide.

101
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,400
Go out in turn, Sidney.

102
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,997
Oops, just found something,
but I'll check.

103
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:58,202
Hey, I bought the fifth jack.
I'm out.

104
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:01,440
Dealer bets ten bucks.

105
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,016
<i>Colonel?</i>

106
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,917
- Uh, Colonel?
- Let's see here.

107
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:12,116
Fondling your chips
is very infantile.

108
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,352
- Not now, Sidney.
- Colonel?

109
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,519
- Not now, Radar.
- But, sir...

110
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:21,532
Radar, whatever it is, sign it,
cancel it or order five more.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,592
All right, Klinger,
I'll see your bet.

112
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,003
- <i>What do you got?</i>
- Full house.

113
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,303
Aces full of tens.

114
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:34,210
Oh, rats!
Just missed.

115
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,078
- A pair of deuces?
- I don't have to show.

116
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,515
Sir, it's important.

117
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,519
And private.

118
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:46,484
Okay, deal me out.

119
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:50,318
- What do you wanna play next, Sam?
- Five-card stud.

120
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,443
High-low.
You can buy one at the end...

121
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,011
and low hole card wild.

122
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:01,286
Now, that's inscrutable.

123
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:03,887
Wait a minute!
Almost killed who?

124
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:06,729
I don't know what his name is, sir.
You know how dark it is.

125
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,497
I was driving along, and then all
of a sudden I felt this thump.

126
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:13,098
- I think it was a thump.
- Was it a thud or a thump?

127
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:16,473
No, it was more like a thump.
It was real sharp-like.

128
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:19,377
Yes, it was definitely
a thump, sir... a Korean thump.

129
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,711
Why a Korean thump?

130
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:24,343
'Cause I ran over a Korean.

131
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,048
Holy mackerel, Radar!
Hitting a Korean national!

132
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:31,786
- They'll put in the cooler till
you're a little old corporal.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,124
Just take it easy, son.
Where is he?

134
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,561
- He's in the hospital.
- Let's go.

135
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:39,794
Yes, sir. I'm really sorry
to take you away from your card game.

136
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:44,237
Ah, Radar, don't you think you mean
more to me than a pair of deuces?

137
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:48,071
Thank you, one and all.
A popular win.

138
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:51,738
Well, I think it's about time
we separate the men from the boys
around here.

139
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:54,748
- You the new sheriff?
- That's right, sonny.

140
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:57,307
And this here's
the new schoolmarm.

141
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,751
Deal, Tex,

142
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,755
already.

143
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:05,554
No contusions,
no abrasions, no bleeding.

144
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:09,859
- That's good, isn't it, sir?
- No bleeding is best, Radar.

145
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,865
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,868
- How you feel, old timer?
- [Moaning]

147
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,497
Okay, Nurse, let's get some X rays,
find out if anything's broken.

148
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:23,237
- Yes, sir.
- His old bones snap like kindling.

149
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,711
Uh, gee, I sure am sorry, mister.

150
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,715
[Speaking Korean]

151
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,256
I think he understands.

152
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:39,850
Radar, let me know.
I'll be at the game.

153
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,304
- Whose deal is it?
- I dealt last.

154
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,033
Oh, okay, it's me.
Cut.

155
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:56,838
Five-card draw, dollar and two,
jacks or better, progressive.

156
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:05,347
Oh, I see the "conference"
is in full swing.

157
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,980
Hi, Frank.
What's new up on the mount?

158
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,984
Read any good
commandments lately?

159
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,995
It's against regulations
to gamble with an enlisted man.

160
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,224
You never enlisted,
did you, Klinger?

161
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:22,827
When they came for me, I ran like a
thief right into Grand Central Station.

162
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,236
They trapped me in a pay toilet.

163
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:30,107
- <i>[Mclntyre] Beautiful.</i>
- Cost 'em four dollars
in nickels to get me out.

164
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,170
I love a volunteer.

165
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:38,117
You know, during the physical,
they jabbed me with a coat hanger
to get me to cough.

166
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:44,490
Boy, if this doesn't
take the cake.

167
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,586
Officers laughing
at a draft-dodger while
a real soldier lies bleeding in O.R.

168
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:52,429
- What do you mean, bleeding?
- Who's bleeding in O.R.?

169
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,561
A C.I.D. Man. His chopper crashed.
Looks like multiple internal injuries.

170
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:59,630
- So why aren't you operating on him?
- You can't anesthetize...

171
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:02,642
a C.I.D. Man unless
there's another one present.

172
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:09,643
- That's crazy.
- There's an officer on his way
from H.Q. Be here anytime.

173
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:13,949
Anytime, Frank? How many minutes
are there in an anytime, Frank?

174
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:18,721
I gave him two units. I assure you
his condition is stable now.

175
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:22,695
- Being a horse doctor you'd know that.
- I lost a kid that way once.

176
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,597
- Come on, Trap.
- Now, be advised.

177
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:29,797
If you so much as touch that patient,
you're violating army regulations.

178
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:33,671
Frank, we promise to keep saluting
all during the operation.

179
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:35,834
Deal us out.

180
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,806
Okay, deal me in.

181
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,817
- Lap sponge.
- <i>[Nurse] Lap sponge.</i>

182
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:47,286
Keep that suction going.
This guy's drowning in himself.

183
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:50,415
- He could have easily cashed in.
- Is that Frank a pip?

184
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,324
My vote is we put him
in front of a 21 -gun salute.

185
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:57,194
I'll tell you this. Frank has
definitely put me off reenlisting.

186
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,495
Give me another clamp.
Come on. Quick.

187
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,468
Hope this guy doesn't mind
ignoring orders by living.

188
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:06,507
- Clamp.
- Sponge.

189
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:09,509
- Okay, that's enough.
- No, it's not.

190
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,841
Nothing broken here, Radar.
Everything's right where it ought to be.

191
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:21,685
- Are you sure, sir?
- Radar, I don't know
all the medicine in the world,

192
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:25,487
but I can read an X ray with
one eye tied behind my back.

193
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,020
Even the hairline. A little loss
of calcium, but that's understandable.

194
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,293
He was born two years
before Moses.

195
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,835
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,234
But look it.
He's all stiff.

197
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:39,967
It looks like he's paralyzed.

198
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,375
There's your syndrome...
trauma-induced hysterical paralysis.

199
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:48,313
- Wow. That can't be good.
- It's classic, Radar.

200
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:52,114
His mind's raising hell with his body
for getting him in an accident.

201
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,827
It just says, "You just lay there
for a while and be rigid,

202
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:01,828
and that'll teach you."

203
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,023
See?

204
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:06,498
It's all said in Korean, of course.

205
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,695
Well, let's throw the old blanket back
and see what I can find.

206
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,874
No, thank you.

207
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,578
What's wrong, Frank?

208
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:22,673
- I can handle this, Colonel.
- Well, handle it quietly, will you?

209
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,913
I got an old geezer here
stiff as an ironing board.

210
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:32,115
That's the last tray you're going
to upset, soldier. There's a war on!

211
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:34,684
And we've no time for violence.

212
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,253
I don't wanna go back up there.

213
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,265
I don't wanna go.

214
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,528
Nobody wants to go, fella.

215
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:44,935
We all know it's brutal at the front,
especially those of us at the rear.

216
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,668
There's nothing wrong with you, see?

217
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:51,678
It's all in your head.

218
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:55,409
But don't get the idea
it's psychological.

219
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:57,951
I'm not buying that old
combat fatigue dodge.

220
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,544
You're going back
into the front line, soldier.

221
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,877
<i>The army doesn't care</i>
<i>about your head.</i>

222
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,343
Just get the enemy in the crosshairs
and blast away.

223
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,677
What's up, Frank?
Fort Sumter been fired upon?

224
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,910
Did you get to the
"whites of their eyes" part?

225
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:14,250
You did it, didn't you?
Operated on the C.I.D. Man.

226
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:16,813
Yeah, we thought we'd
save his life for kicks.

227
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,088
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
when this thing hits the fan.

228
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:24,097
Oh, you're a big fan hitter,
aren't you, Frank?

229
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,692
I don't wanna go back.
I don't wanna go back!

230
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,829
Shut up or I'll have you
shipped out tonight.

231
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,335
- Hey, Frank.
- Hmm?

232
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,106
Doctors, medicine,
compassion... remember?

233
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:41,876
- We're here to serve.
- Ours is a dedicated, humane profession.

234
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:45,885
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Will Doctors Pierce and Mclntyre</i>
<i>kindly return to the conference.</i>

235
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,921
<i>They need your money.</i>

236
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,651
- Dr. Mclntyre.
- After you, Dr. Pierce.

237
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,464
There's a possible straight.
A pair of threes.

238
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,902
Another queen.
I don't know.

239
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:07,338
And garbage for the dealer.
Pair of queens bets.

240
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,070
- <i>Trapper?</i>
- Wait a minute. What's everybody got?

241
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:15,309
- You like to look
at my hole card, gringo?
- Very funny. Don't rush me.

242
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:18,318
Would you like to make a bet
before the war goes into overtime?

243
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:21,446
- Okay. I'll check
to the possible straight.
- Check along.

244
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,683
- I'm out.
- I'm light five.

245
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,556
- "El foldo."
- All right, I'll see you.

246
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,289
- Over and out.
- Sam, did you get the straight?

247
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:34,824
Did I hit the straight?
Two, three, four, five, nine.

248
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:37,336
My queens held up.

249
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:39,930
Sell me another stack, Shirley.

250
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,408
- Hold it. Everybody freeze.
- What's the matter?

251
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:45,912
One of the sandwiches just moved.

252
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:51,014
I can tell you this much, Major. This
is definitely a court-martial offense.

253
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:53,986
- I warned them. I warned them.
- Why didn't you order them?

254
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:59,118
A warning is like an order. If you warn
hard enough, that's sort of"orderish."

255
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,821
- Were you in the operating room
with them?
- No.

256
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,194
I don't like to be around
when rules are broken.

257
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:08,668
A rough situation, Major. This man's
head's full of intelligence.

258
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:13,571
That's not my department, sir.
Intelligence is something
I try to avoid.

259
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,337
I can see that, yes.

260
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,344
How long will he be out?

261
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,279
Oh, he'll be a little groggy
for three, maybe four hours.

262
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:25,979
I want a reliable M.P.
Sitting right there with a pad
and a pencil all the time.

263
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,648
- Just in case.
- Okay.

264
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:33,751
You people really know
a lot of secrets, don't you?

265
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:36,922
Yes, we do, but you didn't
hear that from me.

266
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:41,162
Stuff about the war and the Commies and
what they do to women that won't talk?

267
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,998
Yep.

268
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,133
- Now, where are these surgeons?
- Right this way, sir.

269
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,844
Lights out, soldier!

270
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,251
Stuff it, Major!

271
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,920
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, he's pretending to be violent.

272
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,726
Great imitation.

273
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,598
I'll settle your hash
later, mister!

274
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,264
Okay, moving right along now.
Dealer's choice.

275
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,637
Five-card stud.

276
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,336
Sidney, what's the psychiatric
basis for gambling?

277
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:25,345
- Sex.
- Why?

278
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,643
I don't know.
They tell me to say it.

279
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:31,708
Sex is why we gamble. Sex is why
we drink. Sex is why we give birth.

280
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:36,280
- Thank you, Doctor.
- I'm taking a five-dollar chip.
That was a house call.

281
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:39,485
Are you guys gonna play cards
or chew the fat?

282
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,586
If I wanna chew the fat,
I'll eat a sandwich.

283
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:46,429
- Henry, bet the bullet.
- Okay, I'll bet a buck.

284
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,266
- Here they are.
- Pierce. Mclntyre.

285
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,636
- Where?
- You two are under arrest.

286
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:54,641
Whoa.
Hold the phone.

287
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,372
I'm Colonel Blake here. Nobody arrests
them without telling me the whys...

288
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,880
and wherefores
or the reason thereofs.

289
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:05,612
They operated on a C.I.D. Man
without another C.I.D. Man standing by.

290
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,678
[C.I.D. Man]
Captain Halloran.

291
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:12,157
Okay. Did you guys
really do that?

292
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:15,525
- Henry, the guy could have died.
- <i>[Pierce] He was bleeding, Henry.</i>

293
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:19,555
And Frank here who studied
medicine under General Rommel
was too chicken to operate.

294
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:24,003
He was afraid under anesthesia
the lieutenant might give away
Harry Truman's hat size.

295
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:28,474
- Were you present when Lt. Rogers
was given anesthesia?
- Of course.

296
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,272
Just a minute.
Colonel.

297
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:34,178
- <i>Can these men be trusted?</i>
- Well, certainly.

298
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:36,614
What about her?

299
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:42,247
She's my wife.

300
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:46,623
- That's a very interesting joke, Sam.
- Thanks for seeing me, Sidney.

301
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,989
Look, Captain. The lieutenant
went under like a doll.

302
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:53,863
The only thing he said under anesthesia
was, "Honey, you're the greatest."

303
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:58,235
<i>It was a textbook operation.</i>
<i>No complications.</i>
<i>He'll be up and snooping in a week.</i>

304
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,798
- Is that the full poop?
- And nothing but the poop.

305
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:05,872
I split a gut
getting down here.

306
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,972
<i>Look, if it'll make</i>
<i>you feel any better,</i>

307

a dollar and the whites are 50 cents.

308
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,053
Deal me in.

309
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,518
It's amazing!

310
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,355
Anyone who comes in here
is instantly corrupted!

311
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:23,591
Hurry up, Frank.
The good ship <i>Lollipop</i> is leaving.

312
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,093
Hey, up close you're a guy.

313
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:32,833
Far away too.

314
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,877
- Uh, sir?
- [All] Yes?

315
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:41,642
- Colonel, sir?
- Radar, I'm trying to lose some money.

316
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:44,446
Sir, this is about
the man that I, uh...

317
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,952
Radar had a jeep accident.
He hit a local.

318
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:50,855
- What happened, kid?
- The guy's all right. He's sitting up.

319
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:56,192
- I told you, Radar.
- Says if I give him 50 bucks,
he won't report me to the M.P.s.

320
00:19:56,263 --> 00:20:00,029
<i>Hey, Corporal, is this</i>
<i>a little guy about five-foot nothing,</i>

321
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:02,797
anywhere between 50
and 200 years old?

322
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,431
- Yes, sir.
- He looks like he fell off
a charm bracelet?

323
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:09,374
- Yes, sir.
- His name is Hwang?

324
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:14,881
- Yes, that's what he said, sir.
- You know who you got here...
the famous Whiplash Hwang.

325
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:18,783
- What?
- He's the fall-down king of Korea.

326
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,913
Professional accident victim.
He pretends to let a jeep bang into him.

327
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,890
- Then he gets whatever he can for it.
- That's pathetic.

328
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,893
Yeah, it is in a way.

329
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,761
He was a farmer before the war, and then
he had to hit the road, literally.

330
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:34,528
All right, come on.
Ten bucks a man ought to do it.

331
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:38,971
Hey, this is blackmail.
Maybe I ought to run him in.

332
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,237
Maybe you will
on the way home.

333
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,709
Okay, the pot's right.

334
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,875
- Here you go, Radar.
- Thank you, sir. All you sirs.

335
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:52,908
- Come on, Hawk. Deal.
- These sandwiches for anybody?

336
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,955
Anybody with a death wish.

337
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,284
Where were we?

338
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,723
- Whose bet is it?
- Ace, four bets.

339
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:03,786
- Okay, one buck.
- It's 2:30. Should we set a time limit?

340
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:07,356
Okay, one week from today,
we deal once around to me.

<i>[Gunshots]</i>

- That's gunfire.
- It's 2:30 in the morning.

343
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:16,442
- Maybe there's
an after-hours war around here.
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>

- It's a patient, sir. He blew his cork.

345
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,414
- Sidney, front and center.
- I'm not going out there

<i>[Gunshots]</i>

I think I'm doing it
in the right order.

349

Let me go out there.
One shot and I'll stop him.

350
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:51,067
Hold it. Anything you put
in him, we have to take out.

351
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,272
One bullet.
That's all.

352
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,475
Okay, one bullet.
Just don't use the gun.

Sidney. Come on.

356
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:16,970
I'm not going back up to the line.
The noise is terrible.

357
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:19,665
Yes, I understand.
The noise can be very loud.

358
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,903
- Shells have a tendency to explode.
- You've been there. You know.

359
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,274
Actually, no one's ever asked me.

360
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:29,714
But I see almost every war picture
that comes out. I feel it's my duty.

361
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,445
You got no clothes on.

362
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,285
Well, I like to take them
off when I have a shower.

363
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,291
- Put that gun down.
- Why do you wanna send me back?

364
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,557
Yo? Frank?
You alone in there?

365
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,621
Well, not exactly.

366
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:49,658
Uh, Private Carter's
in here with me.

367
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:53,672
I'm fully naked.
He has a gun.

- Sure. Fine. Well, you know.

- Yes, I am.

This one keeps saying
he wants me to go back to the front!

374

He's a good man, one of the best
in the profession,

375
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,691
a terrific doctor
and a great human being.

376

Maybe we should call

He keeps waving the flag
in my face!

Ten thousand doctors and
