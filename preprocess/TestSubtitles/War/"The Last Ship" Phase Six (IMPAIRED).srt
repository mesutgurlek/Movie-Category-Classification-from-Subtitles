It was transmitted
at the same time as POTUS'.

a much bigger file.

If you had to, could you do it
here on the ship?

688
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:08,575
The lab wasn't built for that.

689
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:10,577
It's for collecting data.

690

But if you had to, could you?

691
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:18,785
The expeditionary team
will forward deploy

for the next group.

Hopefully we'll find support.

and nothing from Mayport
or the lab.

We can't even get
an FM radio signal.

702

If the power grid's down,
that means everything's down.

703

We'll know more when
we get boots on the ground.

Mike, we're not going home.

00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:06,133
The lab's 200 miles inland.

You saw the news footage.

708
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,670
We'll fight our way in there
if we have to.

And then what?

710
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,140
Generators run out
in a couple weeks,

maybe the civilian population
tries to overrun it.

712
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,044
There's too many variables.

713
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:18,679
So, what do we do?
We stay on the ship?

- Dr. Scott says she has
what she needs right here. - Dr. Scott.

In the absence
of a command structure,

I decide what's in the best
interest of our mission.

720
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,060
And we have enough food here
to last us what, a week?

721
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:34,161
How much fuel?

722
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:35,395
We'll find what we need.

- No. We will not.

Tom, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

725
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,135
But it's not gonna work.
People want to get home.

726
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:44,571
And who exactly gets to go home

727
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:49,676
when we have 80 biohazard suits
for 216 people?

728
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,780
We draw lots.

729
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:56,650
I can't think like that, Mike.

730
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:58,285
It'll at least
give people a chance

731
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,187
to get back to their families,
to say goodbye.
