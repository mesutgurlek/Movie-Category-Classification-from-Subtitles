Let's just keep it quiet, ma'am.

00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,220
You speak English?

5
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,264
Yes.

6
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,259
Are there any Japs around?

7
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,521
You're...

8
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,898
You're an American.

9
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,441
Have the Americans...

10
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,609
No, no, no.

11
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,279
No, just me.

12
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,614
Just me, you understand?

13
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,658
Are there any Japs on the island?

14
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,951
No.

15
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,619
You're sure?

16
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,572
Yes, I'm sure.

17
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,084
All right, where are
the rest of you?

18
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,044
The rest?

19
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,964
Isn't there anybody
else on this island?

20
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,091
There is no one else here.

21
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,301
What, ma'am?

22
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,471
There is no one on
the island but me.

23
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,140
You're, uh...

24
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,351
You're alone here?

25
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,646
God has been with me.

26
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,482
You're, uh...

27
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,193
You're a nun, ain't you, ma'am?

28
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,987
Yes, I'm...

29
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,613
I'm sister Angela.

In here okay?

34
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,876
Yes.

35
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,132
Everything's pitching like I'm...

36
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,085
still on the raft.

37
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,423
I'd better lie down
before I fall down.

I'm real beat.

You, ma'am. You...

42
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,617
You okay?

43
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,951
Yes. Yes.

44
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,835
I'm in no danger of any kind.

45
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,789

- Right.

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,531
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

49
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,617
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

50
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,320
Amen.

51
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,290
What gives, ma'am? We're
supposed to have a blackout.

52
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,875
If there were Japanese out there,

53
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,420
they could see those lights
15, 20 miles offshore.

54
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,881
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yes, I'm sorry, Mr....

00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,060
This, uh...

58
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,062
This island got a name?

59
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,565
- Yes, uh, Tuasiva.
- An atoll, huh?

60
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,858
Yes.

61
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,069
Listen, did I hear right?

62
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,904
You're, uh...

63
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,240
You're all alone on this island?

64
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,693
Yes.

65
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,119
Since when?

66
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,498
Mr. Allison, you
must be very hungry.

67
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll tell you what happened
after you've eaten.

68
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,921
There's some dried fruit and some
biscuits over in the bungalow.

69
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,624
I'll go for that.

70

(WAVES BREAKING)

71
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,137
How about seconds, ma'am?

72
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,469
There isn't anymore.

73
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,855
Why didn't you say so?

74
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,523
Fine guy that makes me,

75
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,942
taking food out of a woman's mouth,

76
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,527
especially a nun's.

77
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,651
You were starved, Mr. Allison.

78
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,035
I don't suppose there'd be
any cigarettes around, huh?

79
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,536
No.

80
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,489
No cigarettes.

81
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,834
What I wouldn't do for a smoke.

82
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,673
Who belongs to this?

83
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,968
It was Father Phillips' pipe.

84
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,680
He's buried down there.

85
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,983
How'd he die, ma'am?

86
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,154
The last few days were
too much for him.

87
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,491
I was at the mission at Wanitok.

88
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,493
That's in the Tua group.

89
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,995
The Japanese were raiding
islands all around us...

90
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,997
and conscripting the natives...

91
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,500
and making prisoners
of the Europeans.

92
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,669
A ship came for us.

93
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,006
Our instructions were to close
the mission and go to Fiji,

94
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,009
but Father Phillips wouldn't
leave without Father John Ryan,

95
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,008
who was alone here at Tuasiva.

96
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,598
It was against the ship's
orders to come for us,

97
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,518
so Father Phillips prevailed
upon some natives...

98
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,521
to bring us in a sailing craft.

99
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,357
It required all his
eloquence and money.

100
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,026
The crew was in terror
of the Japanese.

101
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,445
But why'd you come here, ma'am?

102
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,990
I mean, why didn't you go
to Fiji with the others?

103
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,992
Father Phillips was over 70...

104
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,616
Too old to make the voyage alone.

105
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,998
We landed here four days ago.

106
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,167
Father Ryan wasn't here.

107
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,794
No one was here.

108
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,123
The Japanese had come before us.

109
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,969
Go on, ma'am.

110
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,015
Father Phillips went all about
the island calling Father Ryan.

111
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,139
"John! John!"

112
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,020
We climbed up the hill,

113
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,524
and when we got to the top,
we saw our boat sailing off.

114
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,028
Poor souls. They had
simply lost courage.

115
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,530
Father Phillips said,
"God forgive them."

116
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,032
Nothing more.

117
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,034
Then we...

118
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,036
came back down the hill...

119
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,079
and sat here on the verandah.

120
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,328
He smoked his pipe...

121
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,626
and it grew dark.

122
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,205
I went inside and slept.

123
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,966
Next morning I found
him on the beach.

124
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,968
He had fallen.

125
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,796
He couldn't talk.

126
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,973
I gave him his crucifix.

127
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,975
He kissed it,

128
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,678
and he died.

129
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
That's tough, ma'am.

130
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,107
On you, I mean.

131
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,984
Why, I'm sure it's nothing...

132
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,654
to what you have been
through, Mr. Allison.

133
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,990
We was on a sub,

134
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,993
lying off some island
with a code name.

135
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,497
My party was supposed to
go ashore and do a recon.

136
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,166
We had the rafts over the side already.
We was just getting in them...

137
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,585
What I mean, we was
half on, half off.

138
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,295
Suddenly a light hits us.

139
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,006
Twenty-millimeter stuff
started pouring in.

140
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,008
So the skipper takes the sub down,

141
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,010
which is according to his book,

142
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,388
but a little tough on us gyrenes.

143
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,139
We're crawling around
there in the water,

144
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,975
and suddenly the Jap boat
starts dropping depth charges.

145
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,478
It's like the whole
ocean is exploding.

146
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,021
Something bumps into me.

147
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,023
A raft, empty.

148
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,984
So, I pull myself onto
it, heave my guts up...

149
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,858
Begging your pardon, ma'am.

150
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,989
Next thing I know, it's daylight.

151
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,991
There's no land in sight.

152
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,615
Guess that's about
it, till I hit here.

153
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,824
Thank God you were
spared, Mr. Allison.

154
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,379
Same goes for you, ma'am.

155
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,174
Well, I...

156
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,176
think I'll get a little rest now.

157
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,512
You'll be all right
here on the verandah?

158
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,432
- Oh, sure. Sure, ma'am.
- Good night, Mr. Allison.

159
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,135
Good night, ma'am.

160
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,158
That should do us, Mr. Allison.

161
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,968
I seen some bamboo over there.

162
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,970
I'm gonna go cut me a spear...

163
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,673
and spear some fish.

164

00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,755
Why, it sure is, ma'am.

168
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,640
Come on, ma'am!

169
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,475
Hubba-hubba!

170
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,144
Come on!

171
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,749
Ah!

172
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,927
I seen a length of rope over
there by that shed. Go get it.

173
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,646
- We're gonna catch that turtle, ma'am.
- Are we, Mr. Allison?

174
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,270
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
your help. Come on.

175
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,102
All right, now, ma'am, together.

176
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,564
One. Two.

177
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,566
Three. Four.

178
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,943
One. Two.

179
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,945
Three. Four.

180
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,739
Hup. Ho.

181
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,532
Three. Four.

182
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,910
One. Two. Three.

183
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,745
- Four.
- That's the stuff. One.

184
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,247
(TOGETHER) Two. Three. Four.

185
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,875
Oh! One. Two.

186
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,418
Three. Four.

187
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,463
There he is, ma'am. Dead ahead.

188
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,964
Easy now.

189
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,293
Just let her drift.

190
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,601
(ALLISON) Got him.

191
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,148
Just like taking candy from a baby.

192
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,492
Oh!

193
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,320
Oh, Mr. Allison!

194
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,164
Oh!

195
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,164
Ooh, my. Oh.

196
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,694
Oh!

197
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,037
Oh!

198
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,339
Ma'am!

199
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,923
Turtle meat's kind of sticky, huh?

200
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,051
- But it's good.
- Mmm! It's delicious.

201
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,053
What is turtle anyway?

202
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,721
It ain't a fish.

203
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,807
It's, uh, it's a reptile.

204
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,060
- You mean like snake?
- Well, of the same family.

205
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,895
It's considered a great delicacy.

206
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,438
It's a gourmet's dish.

207
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,315
No kidding.

208
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,566
Whose dish?

209
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,236
A person who knows fine food.

210
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,529
Oh.

211
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,326
You know, with all the things there
are to eat on this island...

212
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,829
There's breadfruit,
mangoes, papaya,

213
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,165
not to mention the
fish in the sea...

214
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,000
There's no question
about us surviving.

215
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,961
We could go on here for years,

216
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,789
and I mean years.

217
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,678
You think it might come
to that, Mr. Allison?

218
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,473
Well, the way this war is going.

219
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,769
Well, isn't there any chance of
our own forces landing here?

220
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,023
Well, the brass planned to
bypass a lot of these islands...

221
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,942
on their way to Tokyo.

222
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,485
At least, that's the scuttlebutt.

223
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,821
Scuttle what?

224
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,241
Scuttlebutt. You know, the poop.

225
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,868
Poop.

226
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,828
Like, um, guys beating their gums,

227
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,872
you know, giving out
with the rumors.

228
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,542
Oh, yes, of course, rumors.

229
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,462
Well, they don't seem to beat
their gums on very hopeful poop,

230
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,381
do they, Mr. Allison?

231
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,335
No, ma'am, they don't.

232
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,974
How far do you figure
it is to Fiji, ma'am?

233
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,477
About 300 miles,
Father Phillips said.

234
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,980
Lots of water.

235
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,648
Due south, ain't they?

236
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,476
I believe so.

237
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,942
That's the way the wind's blowing.

238
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,195
Why, Mr. Allison?

239
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,950
Why, Mr. Allison?

240
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:44,505
Well, I was thinking...

241
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,925
but, no, ma'am, that would
be just plain crazy.

242
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,549
What would?

243
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,514
Trying to sail down
there in a raft.

244
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,850
Everything would be against
our making it, everything,

245
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,852
even if there weren't
Japs all around...

246
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,520
and we could sneak through them.

247
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,481
What I mean is that nobody
in their right minds...

248
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,483
would want to leave this place...

249
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,485
where's there's plenty
to eat and good water...

250
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,445
and go sailing off
to hell and gone...

251
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,030
begging your pardon, ma'am...

252
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,492
in a two-by-four rubber raft, and maybe
starve to death or die of thirst,

253
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,195
even if they didn't get drowned.

254
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,199
But you'd like to try.
Is that it, Mr. Allison?

255
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,042
Well, ma'am...

256
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,211
Of course you would.

257
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,506
No, if it was just me, okay,

258
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,841
but, uh, I couldn't ask you to go,

259
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,548
and I wouldn't leave you here,
so, uh, let's forget all about it.

260
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,094
What if I myself would
like to try, Mr. Allison?

261
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,894
I'd say you was crazy too, ma'am.

262
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,602
Thank you, Mr. Allison.

263
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,530
The raft would have
to have a rudder.

264
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,407
I'll figure out some way to fix it.

265
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,034
Could the sail be of palm?
I know how to thatch.

266
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,487
Good.

267
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,460
I sure hope you like fish, ma'am.

268
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,629
Because after about a week
when the fruit runs out,

269
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,589
there's going to be
nothing else but,

270
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,133
raw fish, at that.

271
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,969
And I'm sure I'll get used to it.

272
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,971
Oh, sure.

273
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,807
Now, that was a dope question.

274
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,143
It's a cinch you'd like fish,

275
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,267
with your religion and all.

276
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,441
You know, the guys in the corps,

277
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,901
the ones who go to see the chaplain
the night before an attack,

278
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,903
have to eat fish on Friday,

279
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,947
we call them mackerel snap...

280
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,122
What is it you call
them, Mr. Allison?

281
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,499
Huh? Who?

282
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,169
The ones who have to
eat fish on Fridays.

283
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,671
Oh, we call them, uh...

284
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,295
- Um...
- Is it mackerel snappers?

285
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:57,555
Yeah. Yeah, that's what
some of the guys call them.

286
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,308
But they're good marines,
ma'am, the best.

287
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,557
I'm glad to hear that.

288
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,689
Of what faith are you, Mr. Allison?

289
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,982
Huh?

290
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,318
What church did your
parents raise you in?

291
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,695
Oh, I didn't have no parents.
I was an orphanage kid.

292
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,157
You mean you never
knew your parents?

293
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,659
They died when you were little?

294
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,329
I mean there I was at the Allison
Street entrance one morning...

295
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,331
in an empty egg crate.

296
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,583
Allison Street, Milwaukee.

297
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,331
I figure I'm a...

298
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,331
I figure I'm illegitimate.

299
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,512
Well, what's the difference,
I say. I got born, didn't I?

300
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,848
Didn't they give you any religious
teaching in the orphanage?

301
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,350
Oh, sure.

302
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,353
Every Sunday, some skinny old
crack used to come around...

303
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,524
and go on about what cigarettes
will do to your insides and...

304
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,526
things.

305
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,445
But I broke out of
there when I was 14.

306
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,030
The next few years,

307
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,032
I seen the insides of more halls
of correction and jails...

308
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,034
than I did churches.

309
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,237
Then I joined the marines.

310
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,915
Now, you look at me, ma'am.

311
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,877
What do you see besides
a big, dumb guy?

312
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,587
I'll tell ya.

313
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,090
A marine, that's what I am.

314
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,467
All through me, a marine,

315
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,052
like you're a nun.

316
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,056
You got your cross. I got
my globe and anchor.

317
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,475
(LAUGHS)

318
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,477
It took a lot of working over,

319
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,396
but they're the ones could do it.

320
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,981
My first D.I....

321
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,483
That's, uh, drill
instructor, ma'am.

322
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,610
When I was a recruit, he
looks me up and down,

323
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,613
and he says, "Lad, I'm gonna
make you hate my guts.”

324
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,240
The old peep sight.

325
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,284
He sure kept his promise.

326
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,786
There were times I
wanted to commit murder.

327
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,997
Then I seen the light,

328
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,749
and I started being a marine.

329
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,210
Other guys, you know, most of them,

330
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,004
they got homes, families.

331
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:57,381
Me, I got the corps,
like you got the church.

332
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,511
Yes, I'm...

333
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,639
I'm sure they have
many things in common.

334
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,600
Yeah.

335
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,144
Yeah!

336
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,273
You should have known my D.I.

337
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,941
Your D.I., ma'am?

338
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,361
Yes. Sister Brigida, the
mistress of novices.

339
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,280
We had a name for her too.

340
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,983
Yeah, what was that?

341
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,118
We called her the...

342
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,321
The Holy Terror.

343
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,627
Um, not getting personal or
anything, ma'am, but, uh,

344
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,630
are you different from other nuns?

345
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,633
I-I don't think so.

346
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:43,721
Well, uh, I never thought nuns
made with the jokes, you know.

347
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,306
No offense, ma'am.

348
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,976
Of course not.

349
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,312
I never thought there were
any pretty nuns either.

350
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,981
Ooh, you should've seen
Sister Mary Fidelis.

351
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,150
We took our novitiate together.

352
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,486
She was a model before she
joined the community.

353
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,030
Her face was in all the
fashion magazines.

354
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,323
Yeah?

355
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:06,452
Sister Mary Fidelis was the
loveliest girl I ever saw.

356
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,829
Well, what did she
want to be a nun for?

357
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,541
Because it gave her greater
happiness than anything else.

358
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,253
I don't get it.

359
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,463
Well, maybe there are some...

360
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,383
as wouldn't understand a man
wanting to be a marine.

364
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,710
Oh, do you think they saw me?

365
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,336
Can't tell. Maybe.

366
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,505
Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Allison.

367
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,507
Did I hurt you, ma'am, when I
pushed you down like that?

368
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,135
- Oh, no, no, no.
- He's coming back.

369
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,972
He's doing a recon job, like
giving this place the once-over.

370
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,433
For what reason, do you think?

371
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,019
I don't know. Nothing good.

372
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,023
You know, the other day when we
was up there, I spotted a cave.

373
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:21,110
Might not be a bad idea for us to spend
the next few nights in that cave,

374
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,939
till we get that raft
finished and shove off.

375
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,541
There you are, ma'am, water.

376
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,543
Oh, splendid.

377
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,668
Your bed is made, Mr. Allison.

378
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,542
Oh, thanks, ma'am.

379
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,300
Well, this isn't too bad, is it?

380
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,015
It's a very pleasant cave, indeed.

381
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,935
Land crabs and all?

382
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,857
(ANGELA)
Ah, they're quite harmless.

383
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,026
Well,

384
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,778
guess I'll climb into the rack.

385
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,613
Climb?

386
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,573
Where?

387
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,158
Bed down.

388

- You know, go to sleep.
- Oh.

00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,498
Oh, ma'am,

if you hear me rustling
around early in the morning,

391
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,168
don't let it bother you.

392
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,004
I'm used to cussing
the music at 5:30.

393
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,007
No, it won't. We're
always up at 5:00.

394
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,468
Sounds like you're in a
pretty tough outfit, ma'am.

395
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,428
It is, Mr. Allison.

396
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,222
It is.

I am about to take...

What, ma'am?

401
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,329
Holy Virgin, Mother of God,
and after him my only hope,

402

my good angel, my holy patrons,

403
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,750
intercede for me and protect
me during this night,

all my life long and particularly
at the hour of my death.

Amen.

I was saying my prayers.

407
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,558
Oh.

408
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,559
Do you never say
yours, Mr. Allison?

409
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,028
No, ma'am.

410
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,698
Well, did you never pray?

411

No, ma'am.

412
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,874
Well, sure... You do
believe in God the Father?

413
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,170
Oh, sure, ma'am. Anybody with
any sense believes in God.

I'm all right, truly.

Noise can't hurt us, ma'am.

I'm trembling this way.

to Christ, our Lord.

747

engaged or something?

751
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,793

no right to speak.

770

he asks himself which is better...

771
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,005

772

wine made from rice?

792
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:48,580
Well, it's kind of like wine,

Huh?

823
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:22,734
Mr. Allison, I-I think
I've mastered this...

824
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,445
This Japanese game.

825
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,905
It's a little like draughts.

826
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,908
Why do you have to
have big blue eyes...

827
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,737
and a beautiful smile?

828
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,575
And freckles.

829
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,630
Did you ever play draughts?

830
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,841
No, ma'am. Only craps.

831
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,260
Craps. Acey-deucey.

832
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,180
Well, then I'll teach you.
It's quite simple.

833
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:55,433
Now, then, you're
white, and I'm black.

834
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,770
The object of the game is
to take each other's men.

835
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,190
That's all old Allison needs,

836
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,275
a game of draughts.

837
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,277
That'll fix everything up.

You don't want to play?

No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am.

840
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,285
I mean...

841
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:18,832
I don't want to play
no game of draughts.

842
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,461
Yes. Well, then in that case,

843
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,505
I think I'll say good night.

Have we, Mr. Allison?

It's just you and me, see?

a nun if we're all alone?

You can't, can you?
'Cause there ain't no point.
