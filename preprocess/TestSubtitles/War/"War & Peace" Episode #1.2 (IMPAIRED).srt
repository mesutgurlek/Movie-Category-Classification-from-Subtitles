I just wanted to come
and see Natasha on her name day.

8

let him marry me.

And he does love you, I know it.

Russia hasn't lost
a war in 100 years.

12
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:36,700
This monster, Bonaparte,
he's crossed into Austria now

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,713
and who's to say
that Russia won't be next?

14
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:41,836
- Don't put yourself in any danger!
- Mamma, please don't fuss. I am a man now.

15
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:44,393
I request permission to join
Prince Bagration in this action.

If one quarter of them
come back tomorrow, I'll thank God.

What about?

19
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,305
He wants to marry us both off.

20

[PRIEST READS WEDDING VOWS IN RUSSIAN]

23
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,404
I have to tell you that
the Minister of War is very busy

24
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:48,353
and may not be able to see
you this evening.

25
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:49,936
It's imperative that he does.

26
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,461
I've come directly
from the battlefield.

27
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,924
My orders were to report
to the Austrian Emperor himself.

28
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,819
No, no, this is not how we
do things here, your Excellency.

29
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:59,043
I'll have to have a word
with the Minister.

30
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,362
He's asked to see the Emperor.

He will see you now. Please, come in.

00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:30,732
So? You are from General Kutuzov?
And the reason for your visit?

34
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:33,681
To report the success
of the action at Schongrabern.

35
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,163
Here is the dispatch.

36
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,845
You call it a success, do you?

37
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:43,481
It seems of little consequence,
now the French have taken Vienna.

38
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:47,398
Coming after the defeat
of the Austrian army at Ulm, yes,

39
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:49,301
it was a success.

40
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,896
The French advance was stopped long
enough to allow our armies to regroup.

41
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:57,479
But there were terrible
casualties on our side, too.

42
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,643
We await Napoleon's next move.

43
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:04,973
Well, this is a war, you know.
One must expect some bloodshed.

44
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:08,691
General Kutuzov thought that

45
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,541
you'd like to hear
some good news, for a change.

46
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:15,902
Thank you.
His Majesty will be informed.

47
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:18,972
And now, if you would excuse me,
I have work to do.

48
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,571
Or was there something else?

49
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,561
What are you looking at?

50
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:06,751
My lovely wife! I was just thinking
what a treasure I have.

51
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:08,530
Am I a treasure, then?

52
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,108
Oh, Lord, you are.
You are an inexhaustible treasure.

53
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:17,679
Full of wonderful,
wonderful secrets and delights.

54
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,829
The more I discover, the more
it seems is left to be discovered.

55
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,271
More secrets, more delights -
does that make sense?

56
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,848
Mmm.

57
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:31,773
Actually,
I don't think I am inexhaustible.

58
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:34,302
One can get a bit tired
of having one's secrets and delights

59
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,631
discovered all the time,
over and over.

60

My love, forgive me.
What an inconsiderate brute I am.

61
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:42,371
You're not so bad.

62
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:46,703
But there are more things
to life, aren't there?

63
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,993
You are Count Bezukhov, after all.

64
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:51,988
Yes, I have been
thinking about that.

65
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:54,205
And taking advice and so on.

66
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:58,553
I think one of the first things
we should do is make a tour

67
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,803

68

Well...

The thing is...

70
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:09,373
I'm not really awfully good
at coping with peasants and farms

71
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:12,190
and all that country life,
sort of thing.

72
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,100
And I have rather a lot
of engagements in the city.

73
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:19,032
I think it would be better
if you went on your own.

74
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:20,844
I'd only be a distraction, anyway.

75
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,484
Yes, but a wonderful,
wonderful distraction...

76
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:26,387
No, I think you should start
as you mean to go on.

77
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:27,837
Duty before pleasure.

78
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:33,814
Don't you think it'll do us good
to spend a little time apart?

79
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:37,849
If you say so.

80
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:40,513
Don't they say that absence
sharpens the appetite?

Mine doesn't really need
any sharpening, Helene.
