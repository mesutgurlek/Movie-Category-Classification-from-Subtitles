[Hawkeye] All right, just to
make it interesting, anybody can
open with a pair of 10s...

2
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,480
but only if you're wearing
civilian boxer shorts.

3
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:20,790
[Margaret] Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You can't set a rule like that.

4
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:24,764
- No, it's dealer's choice, Major.
- Will you accept
a civilian panty girdle?

5
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,667
- Tens and boxer shorts.
- That is the most absurd rule
I've ever heard.

6
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:31,570
- Can anybody open?
- I'll open for 25 cents.

7

I'm out. I blew everything last night
on Radar's cockroach races.

10

He had the winner,
but it come in riderless.

- Riderless?
- The fly fell off.

- I'm in.

- Huh?

14
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:56,754
Oh, yes. Oh, I had the most
extraordinary dream.

15
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:00,767
I was a cardinal in Rome,
and the pope had a bad cold.

16
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:04,271
What do you suppose that means,
Sidney? You're the skull jockey.

17

Well, Freud said
every dream is a wish.

18
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,943
One time my uncle dreamt
he was dancing with a whale.

19
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,445
When he woke up,
our cow had eaten his pants.

20
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:15,677
Do you wanna bet, or do you want Sidney
to tell you what that means?

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,617
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.
I didn't know it meant anything.

22
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,746
- [Hawkeye] You want a loan, Sidney?
- No, I think I'll write a letter.

23

- Two.

- Here they are.

[Thinking] Dear Sigmund,
I've been feeling somewhat
frustrated lately...

29
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:40,600
and so I came to
a kind of spa.

30

The waters are
pretty good here.

31
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:46,138
And the inmates have an interesting

- Who deals?
- <i>[Sidney Thinking] One of them is</i>

- What am I holding the cards for?
- <i>Name of Hawkeye.</i>

- Why should I call <i>you</i> "Doctor"?

These earrings go for 7.50 at the Tokyo P.X.

00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,846
Don't you think hoops
are a little trashy before breakfast?

54
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:04,983
If I thought it'd get me out,
I'd wear hula hoops in my ears. 2.50?

00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:08,153
- I'll take 'em for 2.50.
- Sold.

You give life here. I'm running
a little low on that right now.

- Well...

145

winter's the busy season
for shrinks here.

146

The days get shorter.
The nights get colder.

147
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:10,001
I was getting 15 cases a week of total
crack-ups. Can I have some of that?

148
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,003
Business was too good.
I was losing people.

149
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,411
Sidney, we all lose patients.

150
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,676
Actually, the straw that broke my back
was this one kid who heard voices...

151
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:25,381
telling him to kill himself.

152
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,481
I spent a lot of time with him.

153
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:32,027
One day he was
very calm, relaxed.

154
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:35,896
Sometimes that's a signal
they've made a decision.

155
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:39,902
Only somehow...
I missed it.

156
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:45,573
And that night,
after I went to sleep...

157
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,472
that sweet, innocent,
troubled kid...

158
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,007
listened to the voices.

159
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:03,422
After that, I started sleeping late.
I wasn't doing my work.

Well, well, well. So the doctor
can't cure himself, huh?

I'd heard it all.

286
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,091
She got together with
some of her lady friends...

287
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,755
and they went on a trip
to Indianapolis... for no reason.

288
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,663
- For no reason?
- Just to look around.

289
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:12,033
It cost $55. And she's
getting mixed up in politics...

290
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,334
stuffing envelopes
for the Republican Club...

291
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:16,340
and maybe even, uh...

292
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,277
ringing doorbells.

293
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:22,075
It sounds as though
she's stepping out on her own a little.

294
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:25,139
- That's what I think.
- People grow, Frank.

295
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:28,050
- When I go home, I want
the same girl I married.
- Right.

296
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,054
Well, she's changing.

297
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:32,113
She's becoming...

298
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,683
sexy and...
provocative and...

299
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,697
I got a letter today with a picture
of her in slacks...

300
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:44,736
walking away
from the camera.

301
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:47,533
Frank, maybe she's just trying
to find out who she is.

302
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,540
That doesn't mean
she's leaving you.

303
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:53,339
You bet she isn't, bub. I happen to
believe in the sanctity of marriage...

304
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,471
no matter how ugly
or disgusting it gets.

305
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,481
I'll kill her
before I divorce her.

306
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,779
I'm not suggesting either.

307
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,911
Oh, no...

308
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:04,182
of course you're not.
[Chuckles]

309
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:09,091
I should have known better than to tell
something personal to a psychiatrist.

310
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,925
[Thinking] Actually, Sigmund,
it's a wonder more people here...

311
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:14,133
don't take a vacation
from reality.

312
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:14,656
Don't take a vacation
from reality.

313
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,894
Some people even manage to grow.

314
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,233
- <i>Radar, for instance.</i>
- Come on! Come on!

315
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:23,297
<i>In many ways,</i>
<i>he's still as innocent and naive</i>
<i>as the local orphans he plays with.</i>

316
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,935
<i>And yet this boy</i>
<i>keeps this unit</i>...

317
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:29,276
<i>this state of chaos</i>...
<i>running smoothly.</i>

318
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:33,079
Uh, sir, I have some papers
for you to sign before you go to bed.

319
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:36,417
Just in time, Radar. I was just saying
good night to Mrs. Potter.

320
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,422
Say good night
for me too, sir.

321
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,015
- Unless she's in
her nightgown or something.
- [Chuckles]

322
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,493
I'll ignore that.

323
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,621
Uh, sir, here's
the mess requisition.

324
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:48,495
- I ordered 500 hams.
- Isn't that kind of a lot?

325
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:53,129
Well, Sergeant Skinowsky from
over the 309th says he'll trade
me ice cream and fruit for ham.

326
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:56,072
I figured it might be a good
idea to order a few extra.

327
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,109
Good boy, Radar.

328
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:01,840
I haven't had fruit for so long,
my colon will think it's a stickup.

329
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:04,508
That's a good one, sir.

330
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,314
- This is the updated patients list.
- Right.

331
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:13,791
- What's in the box?
- Um, it's the ambulance driver's
personal effects, sir.

332
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,727
It's going out
to Graves Registration.

333
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,562
- Did you write a little note
for me to his folks?
- Yes, sir. It's right here.

334
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:25,660
I never know what to say.
Of all the lousy duties I've
had to perform in this service...

335
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:27,898
that's always
been the lousiest.

336
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,907
You can change it
if you want, sir.

337
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,967
I'm not sure all the words
are exactly right or anything.

338
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,104

- Thank you, sir.

I can't figure out, even with
all you've taught me, Sigmund...
