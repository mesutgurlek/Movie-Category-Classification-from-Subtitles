1
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:59,647
<i>[Man On P.A.] Attention all personnel.</i>
<i>You're not gonna believe this...</i>

2
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:02,050
<i>but there's a new shipment</i>
<i>of wounded in the compound.</i>

3
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,054
<i>Please report for triage.</i>

4
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:06,181
<i>I told you</i>
<i>you wouldn't believe it.</i>

5
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,799
I've got multiple compound fractures
and severe abdominal trauma.

6
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:18,200
- This guy better go first.
- I got a sucking chest in the balcony, Doctor.

7
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:22,070
This guy better go before first.
Whole blood and prep him, stat.

8
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:24,074
- Get that down tight, will ya?
- <i>Yes.</i>

9
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,502
Sidney, what are you
doing here?

10
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:30,411
I don't know. I thought I was
getting on the crosstown bus.

11
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,609
Do you give transfers here?

12
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,879
How did you get this red stuff
all over your head?

13
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:38,445
Well, you might find it hard to believe,
but I was doing therapy in a foxhole...

14
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,457
with that boy.

15
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,256
- We started to get overrun
by some of those Chinese fellows.
- Oh, group therapy.

16
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,959
Then to discourage the Chinese, our artillery
started lobbing shells into the area.

17
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,968
That discouraged all of us.

18
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,504
- How's my tuchus?
- Fine. Just a little diaper rash.

19
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,506
Get the clothes off these
Chinese patients...

20
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:58,873
add 'em to the Chinese uniforms
we got from our last session and burn 'em.

21
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:01,378
- They're infested.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,108
Sidney, what happened?

23
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:06,150
Well, it's a long story...

24
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,447
but it's the last house call
I'll ever make.

25
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,182
When I first saw this boy,
he had to be carried into my office.

26
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,284
He wasn't wounded. He'd seen
three of his buddies killed in 24 hours.

27
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:19,956
[Hawkeye] Hysterical paralysis.
How'd you get him back to the front?

28
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,966
We used to send
these cases home.

29
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,866
- The problems just stuck with them all their lives.
- Hmm.

30
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:26,871
But if the trauma
is recent enough...

31
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:30,033
and the defenses haven't built up to
the point where they'll resist treatment...

32
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:32,042
- it'll yield to talking.
- Hmm.

33
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:34,044
But you gotta get them
right back to their unit.

34
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:36,478
So how come you wound up
in the foxhole?

35
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:39,312
Doing a follow-up. You can't just
send them out and forget 'em.

36
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,318
Major Winchester,
I'm terribly sorry.

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,718
Would you mind stepping outside
and scrubbing up?

38
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,121
[Chuckling]
I kind of doubt that'll be necessary, Major.

39
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,386
I just spent seven and a half
minutes scrubbing.

40
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:51,861
- Yes, but that was before you touched your nose.
- I beg your pardon.

41
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,489
<i>Your nose. You touched your nose.</i>
<i>You're no longer sterile.</i>

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,830
If you operate now,
you'll contaminate the field.

43
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,530
Of course. That is precisely
what I would do, if in fact...

44
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,697
I had touched my nose,
which I didn't.

45
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,798
Major, I saw you
touch your nose!

46
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,900
Major, do you think
my face is insensate?

47
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:08,537
Don't you think if I had touched my nose,
I would have felt it?

48
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,979
I just felt something over my lip.
Maybe you touched my nose.

49
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,983
You touch his nose,
you'll have to marry him.

50
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:17,385
Colonel Potter, I clearly saw
Major Winchester touch his nose.

51
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,082
You naughty boy.

52
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,024
Colonel, I refuse to spend another
seven and a half minutes scrubbing up...

53
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,028
because of this woman's
paranoid hallucinations!

54
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,064
She's a pretty good observer,
Winchester.

55
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,895
I did not touch my no...
I did not touch my nose.

56
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,266
You did touch your nose!
I saw you touch your nose!

57
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:35,306
It's the battle of the noses, ladies and gentlemen.
Who do you think is ahead?

58
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,502
- Well, Winchester was ahead for a while,
but he blew it.
- Say, that's disgusting.

59
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,806
How am I expected
to operate in here...

60
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,381
if I must continually leave
to wash my hands?

61
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:47,350
- [All] Don't touch your nose!
- [Charles] Idiots.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,886
Careful you don't scald yourself
with that coffee, Major.

63
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,014
You have definite problems
with depth perception.

64
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:55,218
Oh, I know what I saw, Major.
A nose is a nose is a nose.

65
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,660
Where are you two kids gonna be eating?
I'd like to sit on the other side of Korea.

66
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,164
- Why don't you stuff it?
- What are you getting mad at me for?

67
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,292
- I didn't touch my nose.
- But <i>you</i> did.

68
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:05,302
- No, I did not.
- You did.

69
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:07,497
- You most certainly did!
- I did not touch my nose!

70
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:11,042
Excuse me, sir. Mommy's got dinner ready,
but I can't find my daddy.

71
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,008
He's this big hairy man
in an undershirt.

72
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:15,273
Fascinating case, eh, Sidney?
What do you make of it?

73
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,849
Well, it's either a serious
regression to childhood...

74
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,418
or possibly some kind
of borderline schizophrenia.

75
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,046
Regression. That one. All of a sudden
I feel real small, you know?

76
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:26,056
Maybe I should sit down
and tell you about it.

77
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:30,822
- I'm so glad we're not late for the dinner show.
- Toast of Broadway strikes again.

78
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,125
- I got it. Smell this.
- Oh, come on. Don't start with me.

79
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,894
- I know what it smells like.
- I mean it. I can't eat if you do that.

80
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:39,027
Just take a sniff.

81
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,436
If you took a raw egg
and buried it in a shoe...

82
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,941
- under a chicken coop...
- I told you not to do that!
How am I gonna eat this stuff?

83
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:48,104
- Am I right? But a brown egg. A brown egg, right?
- Will you shut up?

84
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,645
Who gave you permission to steal
my personal private property?

85
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,515
I'll tell my daddy you did that.
He's got big long hairy arms.

86
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,317
- So's your old man.
- Radar, I need it. It proves I'm crazy.

87
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:02,622
- Major Freedman said so.
- <i>It proves you're cra</i>z<i>y 'cause</i>
<i>you carry a teddy bear, huh?</i>

88
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:05,697
- Will you stop? I'm halfway home.
- How'd you like to get knocked all the way home?

89
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:10,235
- Smell this.
- Will you, for crying out loud,
stop making me smell your food?

90
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:13,533
- I can't eat as it is!
- You know, you're completely
deficient in imagination.

91
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,437
- You're completely deficient.
- Let's have it quiet in here.

92
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,874
- Look what you're doin'! You're hurting him!
- I haven't done a thing!

93
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:20,468
Let's calm down.

94
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,911
- Just give it a little try. Come on.
- No!

95
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:25,074
- If anyone touched my nose, you did!
- Huh!

96
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:27,812
I wouldn't touch your nose
with a ten-foot pole!

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,013
- Hello. Testing.
- <i>[Loud Chattering]</i>

98
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,215
One, two, three.

99
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:36,192
[Chattering Continues]

100
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,065
Sidney, wait up.

101
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,692
I'm kind of glad you're here.
These people are fallin' apart.

102
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,895
- How long they been acting like that?
- Couple of weeks.

103
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,905
No rest.
Nothin' but work.

104
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:51,101
This unit is running
as smoothly as a pig on stilts.

105
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,508
It was a little quieter
in that foxhole this morning.

106
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,910
Sidney, what would you say
to seeing a few of the folk...

107
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:59,178
- on an informal basis while you're here?
- Sure. Why not?

108
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:03,688
Use the V.I.P. Tent. I'll discreetly direct
a few of the loonier ones your way.

109
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,257
Just make sure they come in
one at a time.

110
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,827
Listen, I'm no head doctor,
but I think they need a little diversion.

111
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,830
You know, something to break
the routine.

112
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,366
Some square dancing or some...

113
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,402
Sure! Square dancing.
That's the ticket!

114
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,234
- They're kind of exhausted...
- Look, I'm their commanding officer.

115
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,104
If I say dance, they hoof.

116
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:30,013
Did you hear what I said?

117
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:32,709
Maybe you better
save an hour for me.

118
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,618
Watch out, Major. We're gonna
light a fire here. So stand back.

119
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:39,987
Will you hold on?
I got another load to put on there.

120
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,583
So put it on. What do I care?
I wanna go to dinner.

121
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,959
- I haven't eaten since reveille.
- What's the fire for?

122
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:47,396
We're burning the Chinese uniforms.
They're infested.

123
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:50,400
If we had to burn every louse in this camp,
we'd have to burn this camp.

124
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,402
Look, I just wanna
do my job and go and eat.

125
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:54,699
- Am I stoppin' you?
- You keep passin' remarks back and forth.

126
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,707
Trouble with you is
you're too sensitive!

127
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,105
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- <i>[Sidney] Come in.</i>

128
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,313
I hope I'm not
disturbing you, Major.

129
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:06,373
Not at all.
Nice to see you, Major.

130
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,943
Well, I'm here primarily
as a favor to Colonel Potter.

131
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,955
<i>Sure. What's up?</i>

132
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:16,494
I have a problem... by the name
of Charles Emerson Winchester.

133
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:18,222
Winchester is your problem?

134
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,730
- He's insane.
- Really?

135
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,461
He has no grasp of reality.

136
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,469
[Chuckling]

137
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,769
For instance, uh,
just to give you an example...

138
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,139
It's insignificant really.

139
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,543
He touched his nose in surgery
and won't admit it!

140
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:38,310
Is that crazy,
or is that crazy?

141
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,511
Classic. How often
does he go for his nose?

142
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,679
The point is he denies it!

143
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,984
He's completely irrational!

144
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,082
How do I know what
he'll try to touch next?

145
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:49,854
Ah-hah.

146
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:52,658
What's that supposed to mean?

147
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,495
"Ah-hah." I know an "Ah-hah"
when I hear one.

148
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,002
- You think I'm infatuated with him, don't you?
- Is that what I think?

149
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,698
Well, let me set your mind at ease, Major.

150
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,901
The only reason he goes for his nose is
because it's the only living thing around here...

151
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,944
that would have him!

152
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,946
I don't know.
He seems like a decent person.

153
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,948
Intelligent, a certain
amount of wit.

154
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,314
And money. Let's not
forget his money...

155
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,512
which he's constantly
flaunting in front of us...

156
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,990
with his laundered hankies
and his monogrammed caviar.

157
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:23,653
- I suppose you think I find money attractive.
- I have no idea.

158
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:26,697
Money is far down
on my list, Major.

159
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,563
Money comes second,
maybe even third.

160
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:34,706
Second.

161
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:38,709
Anyway, the man is
totally self-absorbed!

162
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,711
What do you think of him?

163
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,373
Well, he seems
basically normal.

164
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:48,181
- Uh-huh. In other words
you think he's crazy about me.
- I do?

165
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:51,882
Well, I just wouldn't be too sure
about that if I were you.

166
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,890
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

167
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,928
Uh, if you have any more pain,
Major, just take some aspirin.

168
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,998
Oh, thank you, Margaret.

169
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:03,466
I'll go now. I'm sure
you have some sort of...

170
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,231
mental problem to discuss.

171
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:13,541
Now I ask you.
Did I say anything to provoke that?

172
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:19,876
I tell you, Major, that woman
is verging on a very serious breakdown.

173
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,783
If I had any confidence at all
in psychiatry...

174
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:26,085
[Chuckles]
I would recommend, uh, treatment.

175
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,091
Thank you.

176
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,525
Was there anything else
you wanted to talk about?

177
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,688
Hardly.

178
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:37,030
I do not intend to be part of
Colonel Potter's psychiatric cattle drive.

179
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:41,197
I just dropped by to say
that I won't be dropping by.

180
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,570
Would dropping by
make you uncomfortable?

181
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:49,272
No. Don't waste your clinical come-on
with me, Doctor.

182
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,043
I had my fill of psychiatrists
at the age of nine.

183
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,252
And no, I don't
care to talk about it.

184
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,743
And no, I don't
care to talk about it.

185
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,822
Look, the point is...

186
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:01,120
she is the one
who is obsessed.

187
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,320
She watches my every movement.

188
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,163
My body seems to be
of intense interest to her.

189
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:13,469
Which I suppose you find,
uh, very revealing, right?

190
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:18,600
Hmm. In other words,
the woman's crazy about me. Huh?

191
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,912
Please, don't make me laugh.

192
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:25,074
I don't know whatever
got into me.

193
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,019
Okay, let's light it.

194
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,112
Come on. Come on.
What are you waitin' for?

195
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,248
You know, if we toss
this crate on over there...

196
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:35,622
it could really
be a nice little fire.

197
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,127
Yeah. Right. Nice.

198
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,217
Tom, you're gonna be fine.

199
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:04,085
You'll need a little more surgery down in Seoul,
and some therapy, but you're gonna walk.

200
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:06,248
Well, I don't know if you guys
take tips...

201
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:09,088
but my dad is the king
of the hardware business in Cleveland.

202
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:11,355
You need a sink or anything,
I can get you a dozen.

203
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,921
- King of the hardware business.
Maybe he can get us a throne.
- You name it.

204
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,228
- Why don't you get a little rest?
- We'll check you later.

205
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,100
Okay. If I'm not here,
I've just gone dancing.

206
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,107
- Sidney.
- How's the kid?

207
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,111
- Oh, you gotta see him.
- He's doing great.

208
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:30,113
I can't believe he was
a basket case a week ago.

209
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:32,149
He's cheerful. He's joking.
I don't know how you did it.

210
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:36,710
The big thing is getting them back
to the front as fast as possible. It really works.

211
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,722
Come on in.
You're in for a real treat.

212
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,328
How ya feelin', Tom?

213
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,500
How am I feelin'?

214
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:53,730
You crud! I'll tell you
how I'm feelin'.

215
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,898
I feel like I had
my damn legs blown off!

216
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,636
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>I'm feelin'?</i>

217
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:02,510
I'd be back home walkin' around on two good
legs if you hadn't sent me back to that ridge.

218
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:07,074
Tom, you were able to walk back to the ridge
because of the work we did together.

219
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,085
Why don't we talk about it
for a few minutes?

220
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,883
Don't come near me, you butcher!
Now, I'm telling you.

221
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,584
<i>You get him outta here,</i>
<i>or I am gonna wreck this place.</i>

222
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,322
If you change your mind,
I'll be in my tent.

223
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,130
Well, you seem to be
getting your strength back.

224
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:25,999
Anything we can get you...
A baseball bat? A crowbar?

225
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:29,198
Sorry I raised my voice
back there, Doc.

226
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:32,835
I want you guys to know that I'm grateful
for what you did for me.

227
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,175
Good night.

228
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:50,080
Klinger.

229
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:54,855
My, how you've grown. Seems like just this
morning you were a little girl in Mary Janes.

230
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:59,824
Can I talk to you, Major.
I hear you got your shingle out.

231
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,425
I realize I've only told you about
a hundred and twelve times...

232
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:05,131
but I can't help you
with the Section Eight routine.

233
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,708
Oh, I don't wanna talk
about getting out.

234
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,902
I wanna talk about
being crazy.

235
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:13,174
Well, this is a novel approach.
Go on.

236
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:17,012
No, I mean it.
I'm afraid I'm going crazy.

237
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,881
- You want me to lie down?
- What's the problem?

238
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,860
Well, I look at myself in the mirror lately,
and I see this guy...

239
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:33,264
in earrings, pillbox hat, veil...
maybe a little choker of pearls.

240
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:35,836
And I ask myself...

241
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:39,270
"Would a sane man dress like this?"

242
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:42,002
I'm tryin' to convince them,
and I'm convincing myself.

243
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,070
- You're actually worried?
- Major, I think I'm really goin' nuts.

244
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,707
Gina Lollobrigida used to
make me drool...

245
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:53,254
and last week I looked at a picture
of this beautiful, voluptuous woman...

246
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,481
and all I could think of was...

247
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,491
"How could she wear a peasant blouse
with a tweed skirt?"

248
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,493
Now is that "el flippo" or what?

249
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:02,688
Look, you're in the crazy business.

250
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,664
Fashion consciousness is just
a tool of the trade.

251
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:10,431
Doc, I go to sleep wondering if my pleats
will hold out for another day.

252
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:14,030
My palms got sweaty last week
when I read that cocktail-length hems...

253
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:17,407
are going longer in the back,
and I just don't have the material.

254
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,412
Now that's sane, right?

255
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:22,711
Klinger, let me ask you something.
Why do you want to get out of here?

256
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:26,514
Why? Well, there's,
there's lots of reasons.

257
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:32,516
I guess death tops the list.
I don't want to die.

258
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,289
And I don't want to look at other people
while they do it.

259
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,695
And I don't want to be told where to stand
while it happens to me.

260
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,166
And I don't want to be told
how to do it to somebody else.

261
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,533
And I ain't gonna. Period.
That's it. I'm gettin' out.

262
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:45,765
You don't like death.

263
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:49,970
Overall, I'd rather lay in a hammock
with a couple of girls than be dead. Yes.

264
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,206
Listen, Klinger.
You're not crazy.

265
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,544
I'm not? Really?

266
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,813
You're a tribute
to man's endurance.

267
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,583
A monument to hope
in size 12 pumps.

268
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,920
I hope you do
get out someday.

269
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,927
There would be a battalion of men
in hoopskirts right behind you.

270
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:12,327
- Thank you, Doc.
- Anytime.

271
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:15,266
- Anything else I can help with?
- No, I gotta get goin'.

272
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,998
I got some nylons soaking.

273
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:23,438
[Chattering]

274
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,815
[Cheering]

275
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,813
May I ask
what's going on here?

276
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:39,587
Well, sir, we were burnin' the
Chinese uniforms, sir, because they're infested.

277
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:44,358
Are you telling me some Chinese soldier
came in here wearing an American ladder?

278
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:47,764
Oh, uh, l-I guess that must've
just slipped up there by mistake, sir.

279
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,769
Well, you better
slip it back off, Zale...

280
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:52,999
or your service record is liable
to get one giant hotfoot.

281
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:55,132
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

282
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,211
[Chattering]

283
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,644
You see how loony
they're getting?

284
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:01,840
You know, this may be
just what they need.

285
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,009
Major, when people are
suffering from overwork...

286
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:06,018
do you usually
prescribe arson?

287
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,850
Because if you do, I'm gonna
take another look under that bandage.

288
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:13,985
Look, Colonel, they don't want to burn
the whole camp, just carefully selected bits of it.

289
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:16,996
Actually it's a pretty controlled response
to this place.

290
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:19,828
They might actually
have found themselves...

291
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:22,698
that pressure valve
you're looking for.

292
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,235
All right, let me have
