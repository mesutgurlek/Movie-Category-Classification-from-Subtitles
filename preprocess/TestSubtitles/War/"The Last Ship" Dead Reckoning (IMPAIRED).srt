Get down the stairs.
Now move!

What is it that you want?

Now jump.

You've got to be kidding.

325
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,064
Rachel,
I don't want to hurt you,

326
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:38,932
but that's exactly what will
happen if you don't do as I say.

327
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,635
Now jump.

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,103

It doesn't make sense.

not until yesterday!

Yeah, we'll get to that.

First you're gonna tell me
about your relationship

378

- with the Admiral.
- There is no relationship.

379
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,568
There never was a relationship!

Please, my daughter is
a prisoner on his ship!

381
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:57,006
You almost killed
my entire crew,

382
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,043
so I recommend
you start talking.

383
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,112
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

384
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:10,086
During the hysteria
of the outbreak,

385
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,555
governments were pressuring
their biologists

386
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,724
to deliberately withhold
vital information,

387
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,227
research that could possibly
contribute to a vaccine.

388
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,095
I disagreed.

389
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,999
And I began sharing information
with another scientist,

390
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,300
Sergei Yumanov.

391
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:25,802
Sharing?
You mean leaking.

392
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,237
You don't understand!

393
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:28,972
While governments bickered
amongst themselves,

394
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:31,074
the virus was winning!
I couldn't let that happen!

395
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:35,078
Ruskov suggested he had someone
or something on his ship

396
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:37,280
to help him make a vaccine.
Is that your friend?

397
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,249
Sergei's dead.

398
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:43,119
I'd been communicating with him
on the sat phone.

399
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:47,791
Then two weeks before the
Russians attacked us on the ice,

400
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,125
I called Sergei,

401
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,861
and it was Ruskov
on the end of the line.

402
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:54,631
He'd murdered Sergei

my daughter and my wife.

00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,837
It was a Brit that kept us
in the harbor

406
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:03,706
by pretending to be CO

Quite a performance
by your wife.

408
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:06,810
Kelly had nothing to do
with this.

409
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,379
Ruskov is using her
to get to me

410
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:10,880
and, more importantly, Rachel.

Listen.

412
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:16,853
I did a stupid, stupid thing.
Do what you want with me,

413
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,856
but please don't make my family
pay for my mistakes.

414
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,259
Ruskov will kill them
if I don't do as he says.

What exactly
was your plan tonight?

416
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,644
I was supposed to take Rachel

417
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,085
to the other side of the beach.

418

There's a boat I can use
to get us to the<i> Vyerni.</i>

Who am I impersonating

No, your work is done,

Now it's up to your husband,
and we will see.

See... what?

424
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,743
If he loves his family
as much as you say.

425
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:24,721
I must admit, I have mixed
feelings about his success.

426
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,892
I've come to enjoy
our time together.

427
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,065
Chandler: The Russians
are expecting Quincy

428
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,268
to show up with Dr. Scott
on the civilian vessel

429
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,270
some time tonight
while there's no moon.

430
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,138
The meeting will go off
as planned

431
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,973
with a few important
differences.

432
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:45,742
Sir, unless we completely
cripple the<i> Vyerni,</i>

433
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,110
he'll still have
retaliatory capability.

434
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:50,013
By then, we'll be safely
out of the harbor.

435
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,416
Smith and Berchem
didn't die in vain.

436
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,152
They showed us we can make our
escape through the old canal.

437
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:58,988
Sir, forgive me, but it's one
thing to send a RHIB through.

438
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:01,291
This is a destroyer.
The water's not deep enough.

439
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:02,759
It's not possible.

440
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,227
Exactly why the Russians
won't expect it.

441
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:06,763
At high tide, we'll have
two, three feet clearance.

442
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,301
That canal is so narrow,

443
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,702
we won't have any margin
for error.

444
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,771
And then there's
the coral growth.

445
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,039
It'll rip our hull apart.

446
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:17,473
So we blast ourselves a hole.

447
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,075
But, sir, the minute
we move the ship,

448
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,343
Ruskov will see us
on his radar.

449
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:21,744
He's staring right at us.

450
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,046
Chandler:
He's not looking at us.

451
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,114
He's looking at a red dot
on a radar screen.

452
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:27,450
On that screen, we could be
any ship in this port.

453
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:32,188
Let's prepare the Bridge Team.

454
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,128
Chandler:
Lieutenant Foster.

455
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,197
We need a female
for this mission.

You grew up on a farm.
Can you still handle a rifle?

Qualified as expert marksman
last year.

458
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,807
I can knock the nipples
off a chicken

459
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,442
from a thousand yards, sir.

460
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:55,411
Okay, you're on Alpha Team
with Rowler.

461
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:56,512
Yes, sir.

462
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:01,985
Sir?

463
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,286
I don't feel comfortable

464
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,822
having Lieutenant Foster
on this mission.

465
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,191
She's never seen action
like this before.

466
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,826
Objection noted, Lieutenant.

467
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,333
- She's going.
- Then I'm riding Alpha.

468
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,200
Sir, I've...

469
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:21,204
I've already lost two men while
standing on the sidelines.

470
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:24,474
Search Team couldn't even
recover their bodies.

471
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:26,476
I need to be out there
this time.

472
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,214
Thank you, sir.

638
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:10,869
Did Ruskov have a backup plan?

639
00:39:10,904 --> 00:39:13,839
In case you couldn't get
Dr. Scott off the ship?

640
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:17,809
I haven't the faintest idea.

641
00:39:20,914 --> 00:39:22,114
So, that's it, then?

642
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:25,484
They're dead.

643
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:27,553
You killed my family.

644
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,555
No,<i> you</i> killed your family!

645
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:31,390
You killed them,
and two of my best men

646
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:33,058
the minute you took up
with Ruskov!

647
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,092
I had no choice!

648
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,194
You always have a choice!

649
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:37,396
You could have asked for help!

650
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,965
Instead, you took the fate
of the entire world

651
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,301
in your hands,
and you almost threw it away!

652
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:43,869
And what would you have done?

653
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:46,872
If it were your family
on Ruskov's ship,

654
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,807
what would you have done?!

655
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:57,115
Answer me!
What would you have done?!

656
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:01,386
[Sighs]

657
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:08,827
Niels: [Scandinavian accent]
This is ridiculous.

658
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:11,396
Come on.
I can't believe this.

659
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:14,132
Ah, damn it!

660
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:15,267
Damn it!

661
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:16,535
Elva!

662
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:17,836
[Light clatter]

663
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,338
Elva, this is ridiculous.

664
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,108
[Sighs]

665
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:24,509
You didn't get her, did you?

666
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:26,278
No.

667
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,516
I thought we were all dead.

668
00:40:31,551 --> 00:40:33,852
How bad is the ship?

669
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:35,354
We'll fix it.

670
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:37,122
Yeah, well...
[Scoffs]

671
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:39,524
I mean, I need that woman,
and I need the primordial.

672
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,160
We'll get her and the virus,
I assure you.

673
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:43,996
[Clatter]

674
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,397
No. Damn it!

675
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:48,267
Do I need to send someone in

676
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:50,002
to help you...
clean up?

677
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:53,038
No, please.
I'll do it.

678
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:55,440
Ah!

679
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:57,476
I hate how your men look at me.

680
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,579
Like I'm some sort
of circus attraction.

681
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:12,667
Oh, I'm still waiting
on that microwave oven!

682
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:14,147
I need mice!

683
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:25,070
[Screeching]

684
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:31,142
