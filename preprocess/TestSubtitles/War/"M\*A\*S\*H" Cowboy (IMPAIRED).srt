How do you explain it, Father?

00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:56,821
Bishop O'Hara at the seminary
had a brilliant explanation

Okay.

Well, it's dry now.
And when are they fixing

Probably not till tomorrow.
The electrician's resting
over at Rosie's Bar.

121

127
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,359
The driver could personally
deliver it in person.

- Voila.
- Radar, sometimes I think
you deserve a medal.

No, thank you, Father.
I'm Protestant.

Weird things have been
happening, Father.

134
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,152

two pair in poker since Friday.
- Oh, my.

135
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:50,323
And I ripped four nylons

You're giving me goose bumps.

137

A stray bomb comes from out of nowhere.
Blows up a shipment of chipped beef.

I came from a long line
of short-nosed people.

146
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:24,258
One day my grandfather's camel spit
in the eye of the village witch.

147
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,927
Ever since then, we've been
growin' 'em like this.

148
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:31,029
Would you two please excuse me? I have a
serious technical problem to wrestle with.

149
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,769
Yes, sir.
And thank you, sir.

150
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:48,554
- What are you doing, Radar?
- I'm nailing up a horseshoe, sir.

151
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,649
I can see that.
Who asked you to?

152
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:54,560
I won it from Igor in a poker game.
He says it come off of Man o' War.

153
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,999
That shoe came off Cousin Elmer's
plow horse. Take it down.

154
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:00,831
- Down, sir?
- <i>Yeah, down.</i>

155
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,872
I never swallowed that bilge water
about horseshoes and good luck.

156
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:06,464
And I'm not about to start.

157
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,544
On the other hand,
it is an attractive ornament.

158
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,049
I kind of figured you'd
kind of figure it that way, sir.

159
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:19,816
<i>And, Radar, the end should</i>
<i>point up, so the luck doesn't run out.</i>

160
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,914
Hmm.

161
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:37,900
Stretcher bearers,
on the double!

162
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:43,408
Let's see what we got here. All right.
He's not so bad. This one can wait.

163
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:47,347
- This one can't. He's in shock.
Give me a unit of whole blood!
- Not Corporal Marsh again.

164
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,475
Corporal Flypaper.
I can't get him off my hands.

165
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:51,918
If only I'd gotten his medal
to him in time.

166
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:55,115
- What happened?
- The old man stepped
in front of the ambulance.

167
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:58,217
- I cut to miss him, but hit him
anyway. Wound up in a ditch.
- Put him down.

168
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:00,285
- How is he?
- He's gonna need surgery.

169
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:02,739
He's not gonna get it here.
This man's a whiplash hustler.

170
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,330
Frank, if he doesn't get help, he's gonna die
before you can bat a whiplash.

171
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,105
- A whiplash hustler?
- Korea's crawling with 'em.

172
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,616
Step in front of a U.S. Army vehicle, fake an
injury, then sue Uncle Sam for all he's got.

173
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,776
He's right.
Look at the fake blood.

174
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,480
He's a hustler.
She's an ambulance chaser.

175
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:20,648
I'm his granddaughter, Kyong Ja.

176
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:23,921
Tell the major it wasn't deliberate
before he calls out a firing squad.

177
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:26,928
- But it was deliberate.
- Ha!

178
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:30,124
It's true. Some people pretend
to have accidents, as the major says.

179
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,863
But others are like my grandfather. They
believe they are followed by evil spirits.

180
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:37,703
<i>Oh, yes. They step in front of moving</i>
<i>vehicles to scare the spirits away.</i>

181
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,605
Exactly.

182
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:43,407
<i>[Mulcahy] They also hope the driver</i>
<i>will understand and stop in time.</i>

183
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,041
- Move him into pre-op.
- You're not touching him, Pierce.
Do you read me?

184
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:50,280
Like a comic book.
Shall we?

185
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,288
- [Korean]
- [Hawkeye] Hey, hey. Calm down.

186
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:00,659
<i>He's afraid.</i>
<i>He wants to leave.</i>

187
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,664
I'm a better surgeon
than I look.

188
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:04,723
It's the spirits he fears,
not you.

189
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,962
The only spirits around here
are the ones we drink.

190
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:09,027
At his age, it's useless
to reason with him.

191
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:18,073
He says, remove him.

192
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,885
If the evil spirits don't get him,
he'll kill himself.

193
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,420
All right,
let's get him out of here.

194
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,557
You know, if he doesn't
get surgery, he's gonna die.

195
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:34,723
- I'm afraid it cannot be done.
Unless it's done his way.
- What's his way?

196
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:39,132
The evil spirits must be
exorcised from this place.

197
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:43,002
Well, exorcise is good for you.
We'll send 'em on a five-mile hike.

198
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:49,339
- You believe in spirits too?
- I don't, but he does.

199
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:51,972
He insists on leaving
and treating himself.

200
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:55,245
- With what, Chinese herbs?
- They're his traditional medicine.

201
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,684
All he's gonna get out of
Chinese herbs is a bad cup of tea.

202
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:01,622
- He'll die before he can read the leaves.
- Could you do as he wishes?

203
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:04,125
- Exorcise the spirits?
- Yes!

204
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:06,458
I'll try anything once.

205
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:11,291
Acetyl, salicylic,
phenobarb and arsphenamine.

206
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,801
- My God, it worked.
- [Chuckles]

207
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,964
- Put a cork in that laugh, you little twerp.
- I will in a minute, sir.

208
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,167
- Now!
- Right.

209
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:22,006
The exorcism would have
to be performed by a priestess.

210
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,911
Once the spirits are gone,
my grandfather will let you operate.

211
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,609
- We haven't got time for that.
- She's only a mile away.

212
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,914
- I can drive her, sir.
- You do that, Radar.

213
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:32,113
You do that,
and I'll have your stripes!

214
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,418
You look lousy in stripes, Frank.
Go ahead, Radar.

215
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:38,928
Just a minute. U.S. Regulations do not allow
for heathen rituals on government property.

216
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:42,089
Dangerous talk. If the spirits heard you
say that, they'd turn you into a pumpkin...

217
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:44,633
- or a dedicated doctor.
- Oh, bunko, junko.

218
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,760
- Run along, Radar.
- Permission to run along denied.

219
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,361
- Permission to deny denied.
- You can't do that. I outrank you.

220
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,203
- I have half a mind to tell the colonel.
- I deny you have half a mind.

221
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:55,767
- Then I will see the colonel.
- I'll deny I said anything.
I'll deny I denied anything.

222
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,075
Beat it, Radar.

223
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:07,155
Pierce, you're the most
unmilitary man in this man's army.

224
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,316
Thank you.

225
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,858
First, he brings in Korean civilians
with unauthorized wounds.

226
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:18,423
Now he wants to drag in a pagan priestess
to stir up the local spooks.

227
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:21,561
- Which I don't believe in.
- These local spooks don't spook you, do they?

228
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:25,631
Certainly not. It's poppycock. But, uh,
why incur the wrath of the man upstairs?

229
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,699
Who, MacArthur?

230
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:31,543
I do not intend to idly stand by and
let Captain Pierce conduct his exorcism.

231
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,707
Okay, you can conduct.
I'll play violin.

232
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:37,344
He's joking about me and army rules
and regulations, and it isn't funny!

233
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,411
A comic is only as good
as his material.

234
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,480
It's a little out of the ordinary.

235
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:45,187
I'd rather not operate on a
hysterical patient. All I wanna
do is put the old man at ease.

236
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,492
- I didn't say no, Pierce.
- Not saying no, is that saying yes?

237
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:50,863
Yes. Not saying no
is saying yes.

238
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,925
But what if general staff
should drop in?

239
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:55,402
What if they saw a priestess
exorcising demons?

240
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:59,100
If she knows her stuff, I may have her
exorcise them off the compound.

241
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:02,508
- Sir, you're not taking this seriously.
- No, I'm not. Why are you?

242
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,945
Frank was once the innocent
victim of possession.

243
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:09,007
Through some tragic error, they
exorcised the nice guy and left that.

244
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:11,144
Sir, you can't
go through with this!

245
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,155
Can if I want to.
And it's not you I'll apologize to.

246
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:16,589
- It's the good father.
- Why me?

247
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,719
It's not exactly what they told you
to expect at chaplain school.

248
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,821
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

249
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:24,765
- Not you, Father.
- Yes, me, Major.

250
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,132
Why, you spiritual thrill seeker, you.

251
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:30,138
Wondrous is man and
mysterious the ways of God.

252
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:33,334
And I would have no one shield
my eyes from the glory of His works.

253
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:37,937
- What does that mean?
- It means there's more than
one way to skin a spirit.

254
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:47,779
- Did it again.
- He's indestructible.

255
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:50,621
Not indestructible. Young.

256
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:55,255
If the young weren't so
damn good at surviving wars,
maybe there wouldn't be any more.

257
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:58,266
He's stable. No reason
for you to be here, Doctor.

258
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:02,668
I'll hang around a while.
I wanna see his face when he sees me again.

259
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:09,002
[Sighs]

260
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:15,050
- Hi.
- Captain Hunnicutt?

261
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:18,281
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.

262
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,982
This is getting monotonous,
isn't it?

263
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,252
When did I get hit?
I don't remember.

264
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,920
We sent you home.
Your ambulance had an accident.

265
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:28,828
- Oh, I'm back here again?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:30,889
This is the third time.

267
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,629
One more,
you win a solid gold jeep.

268
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,695
- Oh, geez.
- What?

269
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:39,105
I'm never gonna get out of here.

270
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:43,407
Marsh, you have about as much chance
of dying as you have of becoming president.

271
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:46,915
- Yeah, but three times.
- You can only serve twice.

272
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,611
Boy.

273
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,646
- This is sure a lousy habit we got into.
- I'll tell you what.

274
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:58,455
After the war, you look me up. For old
times' sake, I'll take out your appendix.

275
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,089
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
- I'll see you later.

276
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:24,577
- [Chanting]
- [Bells Jingling]

277
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,041
- Hey, Radar.
- What?

278
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:50,704
- What gives?
- Oh.

279
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,011
Hawkeye says she's an exorcist.
She's chasing away demons.

280
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,814
- No kidding. What's she doing here?
- She's exorcising.

281
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:00,549
Getting all the unauthorized spirits
out of the area.

282
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:03,319
I wonder if she could
exorcise me back to Toledo.

283
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,161
I feel in better spirits already.

284
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,265
- I think my grandfather does too.
- When will his room be ready?

285
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,867
She needs more time
before it's safe to enter.

286
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:58,914
- What's the hold up?
- That lady over there is
trying to evict some spirits.

287
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:01,449
Doesn't have
a ghost of a chance.

288
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:05,283
- Like to lend a hand, but I
wouldn't know where to put it.
- Doesn't look like she needs one.

289
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:18,265
- Heard the overture. Didn't wanna be late.
- You're early.

290
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:21,235
- The floor show
doesn't start for five minutes.
- We wanted good seats.

291
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:23,602
- Would you like to order a drink?
- Negative.

292
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:25,664
Five dollar minimum.
Why waste it?

293
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:29,609
Colonel, Pierce's witch is out there
attracting crowds and disrupting activity.

294
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,544
- <i>[Potter] So?</i>
- Shouldn't somebody do something?

295
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:35,072
- Yes. Book her for the weekend
and we'll sell tickets.
- [Chuckles]

296
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:37,517
Colonel, do you know
what's going on in pre-op?

297
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:41,023
You ask the Sol Hurok of Korea?
He helped arrange the whole thing.

298
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,217
- [Chanting]
- [Bells Jingling]

299
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:45,783
Hell's bells.

300
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:55,568
- [B.J.] I think I'm about
to have a cardiac arrest.
- I'll have one too, on the rocks.

301
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,040
- Who invited you, Corporal Ignerts?
- Be glad I'm here, sir.

302
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:12,209
This may be all that stands between
you and having your chin drop off.

303
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,844
Don't you love
what she's wearing?

304
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:19,219
Nah. Too pushy.

305
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,815
[Potter] Well, Father,
what's your critical opinion?

306
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:26,455
Interesting. Sort of a cross
between a bishop and a bullfighter.

307
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:53,155
- <i>[Hawkeye] You having a good time?</i>
- [Korean]

308
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:57,160
He says he wants us all to come up to his
place for beer and kimchi after the operation.

309
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:59,890
- [Korean]
- Oh, his treat.

310
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,933
- Tallyho.
- If you like the dancer,
you'll love the surgeon.

311
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,399
That heathen display was ridiculous.

312
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,836
Did absolutely no good at all.

313
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:11,364
<i>[Man On P.A.] Attention, all personnel.</i>
<i>Hill 205 has been overrun.</i>

314
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,434
<i>Prepare for incoming casualties.</i>

315
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:16,480
- I thought we lost the P.A. System.
- <i>Oh, I forgot to say.</i>

316
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:20,848
- <i>The P.A. System is now</i>
<i>working again, for some reason.</i>
- Thank you.

317
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,911
That boy's gonna be
awful hard to live with after this.

318
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:27,583
- Margaret, that apparatus is defective.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

319
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,457
- <i>[Hawkeye] I thought the gauge was stuck.</i>
- It's not stuck now.

320
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,826
Hold me. I'm scared.

321
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:34,990
There must be some
logical explanation.

322
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,296
- If there is, you'll never find it.
- I don't follow you.

323
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:41,931
- Look at that.
- That?

324
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:45,134
Why, that's nothing.
Probably never happen again.

325
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:51,777
In about a week,
I'll drop in to see him.

326
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,683
- Meantime, make sure he eats
and gets plenty of rest.
- Yes, Doctor.

327
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:58,654
If he's followed by spirits, tell him not to
jump in front of a car unless it's parked.

328
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:02,318
- Here, Doctor. A gift.
- Oh, thank you.

329
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:05,590
- Just what I needed.
- Not for exorcism. For decoration.

330
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:09,861
I'll use it to chase away the blues,
or the olive drabs.

331
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,993
[Jingling]

332
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:17,897
- Good-bye, Doctor, and thank you.
- Good-bye, Kyong Ja.

333
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:30,047
I don't care if the P.A. Is in working order.
I want somebody to check it out, pronto.

334
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:33,284
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

335
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:37,260
- Radar, you better put the
spirit post back where it was.
- Yes, Colonel.

336
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:39,762
Um, I already did.

337
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,762
- Well, this is it.
- You said that before.

338
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,707
- But this "this is it" is it.
- Yeah, I hope.

339
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:53,539
- Oh, Father.
- Yeah?

340
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:56,102
Oh, yes. Here.

341
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:59,514
May God and a smooth ride
go with you.

342
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,347
- Thanks.
- Break a leg.

343
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:03,512
<i>Thanks a lot!</i>

344
00:23:10,662 --> 00:23:12,721
[Horn Honking]

345
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:19,931
St. Christopher
gets all the breaks.

346
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,645
What's the matter, Frank?

347
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:30,840
This goldarned radio
was working a minute ago.

348
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:35,318
- The evil spirits are back.
They hate radios.
- Try your bells on it, Hawk.

349
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:37,217
That's a lot of monkey doodle.

350
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:41,122
Oh, really? Would you like to make
a little wager? Say five bucks?

351
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:43,786
Oh, let's say ten, huh?

352
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:46,193
You're on.

353
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:49,097
- [Jingling]
- [Grunting]

354
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,199
Excuse me, Major Burns.

355
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:02,940
Colonel Potter wants to see you
in his office about the duty roster.

356
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:05,039
On my way.
Ten bucks, please.

357
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:07,243
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance, will ya?

358
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:10,082
It takes a little longer
with a cheap radio.

359
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,315
## [Radio]

360
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:15,791
Ten bucks.

361
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,919
Lucky stiff.

362
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,226
Wow. That stuff really works, huh?

363
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,564
It's easy. You just gotta
shake the bells a few times...

364
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:27,127
And, uh, put the plug back in.
