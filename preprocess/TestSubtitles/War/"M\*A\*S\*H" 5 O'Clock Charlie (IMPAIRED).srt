the suggestion's been made...

149
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:19,136
that we could use
an oh-four W.W. "nug."

150
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:23,665
<i>Yeah, that's right, sir.</i>
<i>A nug so that we can, uh, uh</i>...

151
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:27,873
What's a nug, sir?
Well, a nug is a, uh...

152
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:32,111
A gun, sir. A 40 "M.M." gun.

153
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,278
- Henry, you gotta be kidding!
- We definitely do not need a nug.

154
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,187
- Keep your snoots out of this!
- We don't need a gun or a nug.

What are you trying to do,
get us into the war?

156
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,018
General, listen, you send a gun up here
and that's gonna draw fire.

157
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:46,087
- That won't do our wounded much good.
- Give me that!

Cardozo, booze?

298
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,578
When I left the States,
I promised my wife...

299
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:45,209
that I wouldn't have a drink
or another woman till I got back to her.

300
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:48,777
- That's nice.
- Gimme a blast.

301
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:52,855
Make it a short one.
I got a date tonight.

302
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:59,331
You know, I been listening.
You guys want another opinion?

303
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,390
You're only a dentist.

304
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,993
Yeah. To you, life is something wet
that hardens overnight,

305
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:06,062
then you put gold on it.

306
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,404
What you wanna do
is forget about Frank.

307

I mean, his kind is indestructible.
They always have been.

308

- That's your opinion?
- Yeah.

309

Play, Phil. Sing, dentist.

310
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,882
What you want to do
is get rid of the dump.

311
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:22,717
You take away the dump,
you take away the gun.

312
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,156
You take away the gun,
you take away Frank's motivation...

313
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:27,750
and the menace is gone.

314
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:30,888
Just for that idea, we're gonna
put you in the Christmas play.

315

Yeah, you can be the talking cavity.

316

But l-I can't give you
four dozen sheets.

317
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,341
Oh, come on, Klein,
you never turned us down before.

318
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,438
Yeah, but four dozen sheets?

319
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:52,178
- We just met four dozen great girls.
- Four dozen!

320
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:59,125
A requisition for 18 gallons
of Mercurochrome?

321
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,627
Yeah. We got a patient
with an enormous cut.

322
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:18,168
I never had a martini that way.
May I?

323
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:21,737
Oh, please.
Goes great with a soap chaser.

324
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,749
Mmm!

325
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,751
I gotta hand it to us, Trap.

326
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,515
We have made that ammo dump
absolutely unmissable.

327
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:32,047
- Even for Charlie.
- Two hours to show time. It'll be over.

328
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,151
And poor Frank won't be able
to play with his "ack-ack" anymore.

329
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:38,062
Hey, let's do something nice for him.

330
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,861
All right. How about a couple
of C.C.'s of the plague?

331
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:44,267
- We could name an infection after him.
- Or make him the infection.

332
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,397
Either way, it's a nice gesture.

333
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,143
- I just had a terrible idea.
- Hmm?

334
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:56,171
<i>What if that creep gets lucky and hits</i>
<i>Charlie before Charlie hits the dump?</i>

335

Hey! This is the nurses' shower!

337
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,382
I waited as long as I could.

338

She's late today.

339
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:17,335
Okay, watch it!
Here he comes. Hurry!

340
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,574
Hi, Frank. Down this way.

341
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:24,543
- We think it's an early abscess.
- Well, why call on me?

342
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,045
Because when it comes to pus,
we always think of you.

This is your arena.
Post-op infections, that's you.

344
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:39,757
Problem is he should've
had antibiotics immediately.

<i>Now you've got a fever on your hands.</i>

00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,363
Fantastic. He goes right to
the heart of the clinical picture.

347
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,367
He's got eyes
in the back of his stethoscope.

348
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:53,896
Doctor, I'm getting ready to do the
4:30 feeding on Thompson. Bed number 6.

349
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:56,875
You do that, Ginger.
Give him the 4:30 feeding.

350
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,877
Kind of fun working like this,
huh, guys?

351
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,839
- We got to pull together more, Frank.
- Yeah.

352

Why, it can't be, Frank.
It's only 4:30.
