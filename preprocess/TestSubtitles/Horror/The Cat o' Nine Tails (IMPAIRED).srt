00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:14,715
I sent Lori away.

629
00:55:15,718 --> 00:55:18,349
I sent her to a friend,
a dear old friend.

630
00:55:18,432 --> 00:55:20,020
That's good.

631
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,240
Well, what do we do now?

632
00:55:25,408 --> 00:55:28,333
What we ought to do is drop everything
and think of our own skins.

633
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:31,675
You're right.
That would be
the sensible thing to do.

634
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:39,946

bits and pieces.
Yes?

636
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:46,336
But it seems Casoni was fired
from his last position.

637
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,222
Couldn't find out any details,
but something fishy there.

638
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:54,273
Isn't there something fishy
in all our lives?

642

Professor Terzi,
I would like to speak to you.

643
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,200
Uh, does it, uh,
have to be now?

644
00:56:31,284 --> 00:56:33,288
It's important.
May I come in just a minute?

645
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:35,377
All right. Come in.
Thank you.

646
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,437
What I'm telling you
is strictly confidential.

647
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:44,943
I must have your word
that you won't publish it.

648
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,656
You have it.

649
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:48,326
First of all,

650
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,334
we're well on our way
to developing
a new wonder drug...

651
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:56,221
which will solve the problems
of hereditary diseases
and malformations once and for all.

652
00:56:56,305 --> 00:56:58,937
Second, X-Y-Y.

653
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:03,197
You must understand
that each individual's
chromosome structure...

654
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:05,913
is composed
of X and Y genes.

655
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:08,921
To simplify this,

656
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:11,510
as you see here...

657
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,599
a triangle is formed...

658
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,609
and 99% of the time...

659
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:22,538
it terminates
with an X and a Y combination
here at the point.

660
00:57:22,622 --> 00:57:25,295
But in very rare,
abnormal instances...

661
00:57:26,465 --> 00:57:29,180
it ends with an X and two Y's.

662
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:35,112
Well, recently an American research team
examined the entire criminal population
of a federal penitentiary...

663
00:57:35,196 --> 00:57:37,910
and they made
a sensational discovery.

664
00:57:37,994 --> 00:57:40,751
Of the 200 convicted murderers
they examined,

665
00:57:40,835 --> 00:57:46,474
an extraordinarily high percentage
had this X-Y-Y pattern
which is usually so rare.

666
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:53,616
So what you're saying is,
this X-Y-Y pattern indicates
a tendency toward violence.

667
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,919
Well, it certainly
represents a tendency
to be abnormally aggressive.

668
00:57:58,004 --> 00:58:03,475
You realize, of course,
that this revolutionizes
psychoanalytic and penal theory.

669
00:58:03,558 --> 00:58:07,444
Eliminating most crimes of violence
would seem to be simply...

670
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,534
a matter of examining
all children at birth...

671
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:14,378
and isolating all those
with the X-Y-Y triad.

672
00:58:15,422 --> 00:58:16,717
I see.

673
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:20,477
Tell me, do you have any idea
about the things that have been
happening around here lately?

674
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,774
Yes, I do.

675
00:58:22,857 --> 00:58:25,532
But I have no intention
of telling you.

676
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:28,705
I value my life too highly.

677
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,757
No, I don't suspect anyone.

678
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:38,480
I think this has just been
a series of accidents...

679
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:41,195
and coincidences.

680

682
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:50,219

everything's perfectly normal.
