01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:04,327
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

658
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:05,479
Okay, listen to me.

659
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:09,080
Listen. Those things hunt
above ground.

660
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:11,304
I think I know
which way they go.

661
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,968
They must have
a route to the surface.

662
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:14,375
So, let's go.

663
01:12:14,441 --> 01:12:17,479
Wait a minute, so what?
We go to where they feed?

664
01:12:18,744 --> 01:12:19,960
Are you fucking
kidding me?

665
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:23,367
Do you want to live?
Silence is your best weapon.

666
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:25,111
Follow me.

667
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:26,616
We're following
the water.

668
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:29,096
I ain't going in no goddamn water.
Juno knows the way out.

669
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,856
So how come
you're still here?

670
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:34,631
Because my light died,
I had no equipment,

671
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:36,168
and my climbing
partner put a pick

672
01:12:36,233 --> 01:12:37,911
through my leg
and ran out on me...

673
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:40,407
There isn't time
for this, God damn it!

674
01:12:40,472 --> 01:12:42,840
We want to get out of here alive,
we follow Juno.

675
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:44,887
No fucking way.

676
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:48,648
God damn it! I brought you
into this hellhole, I'm taking you out.

677
01:12:50,009 --> 01:12:52,472
Wait!
What? It's no good.

678
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,184
Chief!
Shut up, Rios.

679
01:12:57,112 --> 01:12:58,536
Let's move.

680
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,128
Come on.

681
01:13:39,176 --> 01:13:40,327
It's...

682
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,176
We'll have to
go single file.

683
01:14:02,201 --> 01:14:03,865
Spread your weight.

684
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:18,999
Keep it steady.

685
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:27,800
Easy, easy.

686
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,447
We really should do
this one at a time.

687
01:14:33,513 --> 01:14:36,488
You ran out on her,
but you ain't running out on me,

688
01:14:36,553 --> 01:14:38,216
so let's get going.

Give me the bag.

694

Juno, help me, please!
Juno!

695
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:44,680
My arm! Pull me up!

696
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,584
Grab my pick.

697
01:15:52,889 --> 01:15:54,168
Okay. Okay.

698
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:57,065
Cut.
What? Cut what?

699
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,936
Cut it,
or they'll both die!

700
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:00,792
Just fucking cut it!
