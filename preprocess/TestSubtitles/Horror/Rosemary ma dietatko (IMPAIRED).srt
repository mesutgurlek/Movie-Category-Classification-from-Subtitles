supper with us tonight? What do you say?

306
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,252
- Oh, no, we couldn't.
- Why not?

307
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,673
- No. Really, that's very kind of you, but...
- It would be a real help to us.

308
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,093
[Sighs]
First night we'll be alone since...

309
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,762
Are you sure it wouldn't be
too much trouble for you?

310
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,348
Honey, if it was trouble, I wouldn't ask you.

311
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,977
All right. You go ahead and count on us.
I'll have to check with Guy, though.

312
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,147
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer.

313
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,316
Oh, here's your mail.
Nah, ads.

314
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,277
Thank you.

315
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,118
[Door Shuts]

316
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,787
Yoo-hoo!

317
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,930
Donald Baumgart got that part.

318
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,236
It's a bad play anyway.

319
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,032
Even if it folds out of town,
it's the kind of part that gets noticed.

320
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,041
Mrs. Castevet was here...

321
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,710
to thank me for what I said about Terry.

322
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,713
She is the nosiest person I've ever seen.

323
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,925
You know she actually asked
the prices of things?

324
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,469
- No kidding.
- Mm.

325
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,514
She invited us to have dinner with them tonight.

326
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,975
I told her I'd have to check with you
but that it'd probably be okay.

327
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,145
Oh, Jesus.
We don't have to do that, do we, honey?

328
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,939
I think they're Ionely.

329
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,067
We get friendly with an old couple like that,
we'll never get rid of them.

330
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,152
They're right across the wall.

331
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,446
I told her she could count on us.

332
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,952
- You don't have to sulk about it.
- I'm not sulking.

333
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,204
I see exactly what you mean.

334
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,374
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?

335
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,211
- We'll go!
- No, we don't have to if you don't want to.

336
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,380
That sounds so phony, but I really mean it.

337
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,757
Really, I do.

338
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,385
Be my good deed for today.

339
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,888
Okay, but only if you want to.

340
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,391
And we'll make it clear
it's just for this one night...

341
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,935
and not the beginning of anything, right?

342
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,063
Ah, perfect timing!
Come on in.

343
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,315
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes.

344
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,401
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.

345
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,987
I'm fixin' to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

346
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,490
Look, dinner isn't ready just yet,
but sit down there anywhere, love.

347
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,701
Take a seat on the couch.
You're gonna find yourself very...

348
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,537
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.

349
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,247
No, no, no. Don't get up.

350
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,834
Generally I pour these out precisely
as a bartender. Don't I, Minnie?

351
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,921
- Just watch the carpet.
- But this evening I made a little too much...

352
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,674
Ah, there we are.
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

353
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,718
- Now, Mrs. Woodhouse.
- Thank you.

354
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,596
Mr. Woodhouse,
uh, vodka blush?

355
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,931
- Yes, thanks.
- Have you ever tasted one?

356
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,225
- No, no, I haven't.
- It looks delicious.

357
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,936
Minnie.
They're very popular in Australia.

358
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,398
Now, to our guests.
Welcome to our home.

359
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,774
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

360
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
- [Liquid Splattering]
- [Coughing]

361
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,572
The carpet!

362
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,533
- [Roman] Oh, dear.
- Brand-new carpet.

363
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,953
This man's so clumsy!

364
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,956
- Do you come from Australia?
- Oh, no, no.

365
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,543
I'm from right here in New York City.
I've been there, though.

366
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,629
I've been everywhere, literally.

367
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,089
You name a place, and I've been there.

368
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,884
- Go ahead. Name a place.
- [Guy] Fairbanks, Alaska.

369
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,803
I've been there.
Been all over Alaska.

370
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,223
Yes, Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage...

371
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,016
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

372
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,061
- I spent four months there in '38.
- Where are you folks from?

373
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,729
- Well...
- Well, I...

374
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,023
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

375
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,734
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is too.

376
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,363
- Do you travel for business?
- Well, business and pleasure both.

377
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,824
I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was ten.

378
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,868
- You name a place, I've been there.
- [Bell Dings]

379
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,330
Ah! Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks, now.

380
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,082
Roman, take your pill.

381
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,795
[Roman] No pope ever visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.

382
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,339
I heard he's gonna postpone
and wait till it's over.

383
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,051
- [Guy] Well, that's showbiz.
- [Guy, Adrian, Minnie Laughing]

384
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,053
That's exactly what it is.

385
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,181
All the costumes, the rituals...
all religions.

386
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,725
Oh, oh, I think we're offendin' Rosemary.

387
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,561
- No. No.
- You're not religious, my dear, are you?

388
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,731
Well, I-I was brought up a Catholic.
Now I don't know.

389
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,193
- Yeah. You looked uncomfortable.
- Well, he is the pope.

390
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,529
Well, now, you don't need
to have respect for him...

391
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,531
because he pretends that he's holy.

392
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,366
[Guy]
Now, that's a good point.

393
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,327
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

394
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,206
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion...

395
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,208
was given, I thought, in Luther.

396
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,669
Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?

397
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,337
Me? No.

398
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,715
Well, weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?

399
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,717
- No.
- Well, that's strange.

400
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,136
I remember being struck by a gesture you made...

401
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,763
and checking in the program to see who you were.

402
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,224
- Thank you.
- Um, what gesture was that?

403
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,728
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction, uh...

404
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,856
I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

405
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,818
- It was a kind of involuntary reaching.
- That's it. That's it.

406
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:37,488
- It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
- [Guy Chuckles] Come on, now.

407
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,324
No, no. I mean it.

408
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,118
My father was a theatrical producer...

409
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,495
and my early years were spent in the company...

410
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,415
of Mrs. Fiske,
Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.

411
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,917
- Guy?
- Oh, yes, please.

412
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,546
You have a most interesting inner quality, Guy.

413
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,633
It appears in your television work too.
It should take you a long way indeed...

414
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,596
provided, of course,
that you get those initial breaks.

415
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,724
Are you preparing for a show now?

416
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,268
Um, well, I'm up for a couple parts.

417
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,438
- Well, I can't believe
that you won't get them.
- Well, I can.

418
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,067
I'd like to have a spice garden someday.

419
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,527
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.

420
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,531
- You come from a big family?
- Mm-hmm. Three brothers and two sisters.

421
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,909
- Your sisters married?
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,287
- They have children?
- One has two. The other has four.

423
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,165
Well, there's a chance
you'll have lots of children too.

424
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,250
Oh, we're fertile, all right.

425
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,544
I've got 16 nieces and nephews.

426
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,505
My goodness!

427
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,012
Would you like me to wash,
and you can wipe for a while?

428
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,139
Oh, no. This is fine, dear.

429
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,610
Now, Roman, will you stop bending
Guy's ears with your Modjeska stories?

430
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,779
He's only listening 'cause he's polite.

431
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,906
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castevet.

432
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,118
- You see?
- Minnie. I'm Minnie, he's Roman. Okay?

433
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,328
- Okay?
- [Rosemary] Okay.

434
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,664
Okay.
Terrific. Just terrific.

435
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,958
- Good-bye, darlin'. Good-bye.
- Thank you for having us.

436
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,627
- Yeah, it was lovely. Bless you.
- Minnie!

437
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,879
Minnie! Ya great kid, ya!

438
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,507
Whoo!
About that steak, huh?

439
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,844
Oh, my God! And the cake!
How did you eat two pieces?

440
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,387
- It was weird!
- Out of politeness.

441
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,639
That's how I ate two pieces...
out of politeness.

442
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,516
[Rosemary Laughing]

443
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,395
- Only three dinner plates that match...
- Shh!

444
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,440
And all that beautiful, beautiful silver.

445
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,942
- We'll be nice. Maybe they'll will it to us.
- Oh!

446
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,569
Yeah.

447
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,530
- Guess what they have in their bathroom.
- A bidet.

448
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,657
- Jokes for the John.
- No.

449
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,243
A book on a hook, right next to the toilet.

450
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,122
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.

451
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,876
Never even heard
of Forbes-Robertson before.

452
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm gonna go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.

453
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,922
- You are?
- Yeah. He asked me.

01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,411
No, Rosemary.
I'd have seen evidence of it long ago.

1362
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,456
- I won't take anything else from her.
- You won't have to.

1363
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:33,917
I can give you some pills
that'll be adequate these last few weeks.

1364
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:37,254
In a way, this may be...

1365
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,923
the answer to Minnie and Roman's problem too.

1366
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,760
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.

1367
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,636
In fact, confidentially...

1368
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,930
he has no more than a month or two left.

1369
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:50,809
- I had no idea.
- He wanted to pay a last visit
to a few of his favorite cities.

1370
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:54,271
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the baby's birth.

1371
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,607
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.

1372
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:59,985
He'd be extremely embarrassed
if he knew what you found out.

1373
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,113
Suppose we do this:
I'll tell them to leave on Sunday.

1374
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,324
I'll say I spoke to you, and you understand.

1375
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:08,911
- Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.

and your sweet little boy or girl's
layin' safe in your arms.

Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1382
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:24,510
Yeah, you make Guy send us
lots of pictures, hear?

1383
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,095
Yes, I will.

1384
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,931
I'm not going to wish you good luck,
because you won't need it.

1385
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:31,475
You're going to have a happy, happy life.

1386
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,936
Have a good trip, and come back safely.

1387
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:35,979
Mm, perhaps.
But I may stay on...

1388
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:39,733
in Dubrovnik or Pescara or maybe Majorca.

1389
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,735
We shall see. We shall see.

1390
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,404
- Come back.
- Bye, Minnie.

1391
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,239
- Yeah, good-bye.
- Good-bye, Roman.

1392
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:47,825
- Bye. Good-bye.
- Take care, now.

- [Rosemary] Guy?
- Hmm?

1396
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:06,135
Where's my book?

1397
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,012
Oh, I, uh, put it in the garbage.

1398
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:14,685
- What?
- I didn't want you
upsetting yourself anymore.

1399
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,230
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.

1400
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,024
- I wasn't thinking about that.
- That's a terrible thing to do.

1401
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:23,193
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary...

1406
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,139
and spells could not be cast...

- Guy Woodhouse's wife?

- Oh, yes.
- I wanted to know...

Well, I'm splendid.

1417
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,378
I've only broke six glasses today.

1418
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,423
Guy and I are both very unhappy...

1419
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:12,135
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1420
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,224
Well, what the hell, huh?

1421

That's the way it goes, right?

1422
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:24,064
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1423

Vi... Visit? No.

1424
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,237
Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks, huh?

1425
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:33,240
- Yes, that's what I meant.
- Right, right.

1426
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,076
By the way, he has something of yours, you know.

01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:38,328
What do you mean?

- No.

- Yes.
- Oh. Well...

Well, he's got mine, and I've got his.

I thought he'd only borrowed it.

No, no, no, no.
It was... It was a trade.

It's very important.

Oh, my...
It's called Detchema.

Mm.
Well, it's a big improvement...

1462
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:25,704
on your regular, if you don't mind my saying.

1463
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:29,416
That wasn't a perfume. That was
a good-luck charm. I threw it away.

1464
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:33,003
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.

1465
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,970
- Dr. Sapirstein?
- He has the aftershave.

1466
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,682
But it isn't, is it? [Chuckles]
I don't think he has a good-luck charm.

1467
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:48,727
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while, whatever it is...

1468
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:51,938
and when he does... oh, boy!

Haven't you ever noticed?

No.

1471
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:58,612
Maybe you thought it was
your own you were smelling.

1472
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:01,782
What is it, a chemical thing?

Will you excuse me a moment, please?

My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something.

Call me.

Did... did he really say that?

Oh, he didn't say that!

1490

What else was it that he said?

Oh, that... that's wonderful.

- Are you Dr. Hill's patient?

No. Uh, yes.

Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.

1499

It's important.
Tell him to call me, hmm?

- All right.

- Mrs. Woodhouse?
- Yes.

01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,367
- I thought you were in California.
- No.

1510
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:53,119
No, I've been to another doctor...

1511
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,622
and he isn't good, Dr. Hill.

1512
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,999
He's been lying to me and giving me...

1513
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,461
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.

1514
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:04,881
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28?

1515
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:07,550
- Well, I want you to deliver it.
- Mrs. Woodhouse...

1516
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,303
No, please, let me...
let me talk to you.

1517
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:13,223
Let me come and explain what's been going on.

1518
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:15,266
I can't stay too long here.

1519
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:17,852
They'll be coming looking for me.

1520
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:21,022
Dr. Hill?
Dr. Hill, there's a plot.

1521
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,858
I know that sounds crazy.
You're probably thinking...

1522
01:45:23,985 --> 01:45:26,069
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped."

1523
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:28,238
But I haven't flipped, Dr. Hill.

1524
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,907
I swear by all the saints I haven't.

1525
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,576
There are plots against people, aren't there?

1526
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:35,620
Yes, I suppose there are.

1527
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:40,000
Well, there's one against me and my baby.

1528
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:42,752
Come to my office tomorrow
after 5:00, and we'll...

1529
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,296
Now. Right now.

1530
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:47,966
Mrs. Woodhouse, I'm not
at my office now. I'm home.

1531
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:51,011
- I've been up since yesterday morning...
- I beg you!

1532
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,513
I beg you.

1533
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,598
I can't stay here.

1535

- All right.
- Oh, wait. Dr. Hill?

1536
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,607
- Yes?
- My husband may call you and ask if...

1537
01:46:04,734 --> 01:46:07,444
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1538
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,320
Thank you.

1539
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,856

1540
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:48,651
Driver, please, could you wait and watch...

1541
01:46:48,819 --> 01:46:50,987
until I'm inside the door?

1542
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:10,006
He lied to you.
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1543
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,884
The worst thing of all...
he's involved with them as well.

1544
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:16,012
He sleeps in pajamas now.
He never used to before.

1545
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,014
He's probably hiding a mark.

1546
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,558
You know, they give you marks when you join.

1547
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:23,853
All sorts of rituals.
They hold sabbaths there.

1548
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,022
You could hear them singing through the wall.

1549
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,900
Guy... my husband, Guy...
said it was Dr. Shand...

1550
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,653
one of these people, playing a recorder.

1551
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:35,698
Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand
unless he was there with them?

1552
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:39,285
Uh, they're very clever people.

1553
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,704
They planned everything
right from the beginning.

1554
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:44,874
They probably made some sort of deal with Guy.

1555
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:47,418
They gave him success, and he promised them...

1556
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:50,171
our baby to use in their rituals.

1557
01:47:51,257 --> 01:47:55,385
I know this sounds crazy, but I've...
I've got books here.

1558
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,387
Look.

1559
01:47:57,513 --> 01:48:00,849
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart...

1560
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:02,851
and they put a spell on him.

1561
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:05,228
They cast a spell on him and made him blind...

1562
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,230
so that Guy could get his part.

1563
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,149
Look. Here.

1564
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:14,612
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins.
Maybe you heard of him.

1565
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:16,865
A writer.
He wrote stories for boys.

1566
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,993
Anyway, he was my good friend
since I first came to New York.

1567
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:22,662
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.

1568
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,664
And, uh, anyway...

1569
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:27,834
once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me.

1570
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:32,213
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1571
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,884
I was suffering so... You can't imagine
how much I was suffering.

1572
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,261
And they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.

1573
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:41,514
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it...

1574
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,517
also witches' stuff, tannis root.

1575
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:47,770
Hutch came, and he immediately
saw something was wrong.

1576
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,190
He knew about witches, you see?

1577
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:54,402
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup
still on, which he never did.

1578
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,613
They probably called him to come home...

1579
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,449
and steal one of Hutch's belongings,
which he did.

1580
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:02,535
Took his glove.
And they put a spell on him too.

1581
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,955
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.

1582
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:10,835
Now, maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure:

1583
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,254
They have a coven, and they want my baby.

1584
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,968
It certainly seems that way.

1585
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,980
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

1586
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:32,815
I don't believe in witchcraft...

1587
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,652
but there're plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

No, Dr. Shand
is one of these people.

1590
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:43,576
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.

1591

- I've met him once or twice.

1594

1595

No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

02:12:08,713 --> 02:12:10,630
Think about it, Rosemary.

1815
02:12:24,145 --> 02:12:25,812
Oh, God!

1816
02:12:25,938 --> 02:12:28,815
Oh, shut up with your "Oh, Gods,"
or we'll kill ya, milk or no milk!

1817
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:30,942
You shut up.
Rosemary's his mother...

1818
02:12:31,068 --> 02:12:32,819
so you show some respect.

1819
02:12:35,615 --> 02:12:37,991
[Roman] Come, my friend.
Come see him.

1820
02:12:38,117 --> 02:12:39,784
Come see the child.

1821

- [Man] What would you like to drink?
- [Man #2] I should like a Coca-Cola.

1822
02:12:53,215 --> 02:12:55,884
They, uh, promised me you wouldn't be hurt...

1823
02:12:56,010 --> 02:12:59,220
and you haven't been, really.

1824
02:12:59,347 --> 02:13:02,432
I mean, supposing
you had the baby and you lost it?

1825
02:13:03,517 --> 02:13:05,560
Wouldn't that be the same?

1826
02:13:05,686 --> 02:13:08,438
And we're getting so much in return, Ro.

1827
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:23,244
Oh, Guy, let me introduce you
to Argyron Stavropoulos.

1828
02:13:23,371 --> 02:13:27,332
How proud you must be!
Is this the mother?

1829
02:13:27,458 --> 02:13:31,002
- Why in the name...
- Here, drink this. You'll feel a little better.

1830
02:13:31,128 --> 02:13:32,921
What's in it? Tannis root?

1831
02:13:33,047 --> 02:13:36,800
Nothin's in it. Just plain, ordinary
Lipton's tea. You drink it.

02:14:08,666 --> 02:14:10,959
Get away from here! Roman!

1835
02:14:11,085 --> 02:14:13,169
You're rocking him too fast.

1836
02:14:13,337 --> 02:14:16,256
Sit down! Get her out of here.
Put her where she belongs.

1837
02:14:16,382 --> 02:14:19,050
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.

1838
02:14:19,176 --> 02:14:22,178
- Mind your own business!
- Let Rosemary rock him.

1839
02:14:22,304 --> 02:14:24,681
Go on. Sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.

1840
02:14:24,849 --> 02:14:27,767
- Why, she's liable to...
- Sit down with the others, Laura-Louise.

[Crying Continues]

1842

Rock him.

1843
02:14:42,366 --> 02:14:44,701
You're trying to get me to be his mother.

1844
02:14:46,036 --> 02:14:48,204
Aren't you his mother?
