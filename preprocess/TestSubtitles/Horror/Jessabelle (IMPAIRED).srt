Oh, I told her the truth.

370

Um, okay.
I've been having nightmares.

374

and they're so real that I think I'm going crazy.

376
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,804
I dreamed there's this girl.
She looks dead,

377
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,729
and she's trying to get me, kill me.

378
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,847
And there's this man.
It looks like he's been burnt to death,

379
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,728
and he looks at me like I did it.

380
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,804
Like whatever happened to him,
it was my fault.

381
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,844
Well, after everything you've been through,

382
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,008

if you weren't having nightmares, right?

Have you thought about seeing a shrink?

384
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,207
I can't afford it.

385
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,368
I mean, if I had any money at all,

386
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,124
I wouldn't have come home to live with Dad.

387
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,527
I'm flat broke.

388
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,449
And there are these tapes.

389
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,722

that's what that last reading meant...</i>

be watching these anymore.

397

Yeah, I would, but I'd wait,
wait until I was recuperated.

Not when I was still
stuck in this house where she died.

I mean, it's just weird.

And besides,
she's wrong more than she's right.

401

She said you never left town,
you love to swim.

402
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,326
She said Dad was gonna die.

403
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,129
No, she thought you were gonna die.

404
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,044
She said 10 things that were wrong,

405

and you picked one that was almost right.

She thought she saw your death,

408
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,088
and she was wrong about everything.

Maybe you had a twin sister or something.

I never had a sister.
And why would we both have the same name?

What?

622
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,286
Yeah, it's part of their ceremonies.

623
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,961
You call down the spirits,
and they possess you,

624
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,968
and you dance around. That's what they do.

You grew up here, too.
There's voodoo all around this place.

627

They really get possessed?

628

Well, that depends on who you ask.
I think it's like hypnosis.

629

You know, like faith-healing,
speaking in tongues.

that's what you're gonna think is real.
