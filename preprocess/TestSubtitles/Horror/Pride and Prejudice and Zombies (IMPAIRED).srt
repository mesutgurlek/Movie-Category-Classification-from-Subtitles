I must know, Mr. Wickham,

656
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,073
what is amiss
between you and Mr. Darcy?

657
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,031
Are you much
acquainted with him?

658
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,454
More than I wish to be.

659
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,889
He's been here for
less than a month

660
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,891
and is already the least
popular man in the county.

661
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,728
Yes, it always gives me
great pain to see him.

662
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,130
I have been connected
with his family from infancy.

663
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,932
My father managed
the late Mr. Darcy's estate.

664
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,021
Darcy and I
grew up together.

665
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,704
His father treated
me like a second son.

666
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,574
I cannot begin to do
justice to his kindness.

667
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,576
He bequeathed me with the
best living in his gift.

668
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,178
I had my heart set
on joining the church.

669
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,648
But when he was slain
in the Second Battle of Kent,

670
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,970
Darcy ignored his wishes and
gave my living to another man.

671
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,953
What could have induced
him to behave so cruelly?

672
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,489
Pride.

673
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,227
He thought me too low to be
worth his consideration.

674
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,162
I loved his father dearly,
so, I can never expose Darcy

Oh, no.

I am convinced marrying you will

I will of course require you

that some of the stricken

to the urge to feed
upon the living,

and in so doing have
maintained their human ways.

992
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,464
And they have
managed to resist this

The common hordes
look to them for leadership.

1014
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,850
It takes just one of them
to realize their power

1015
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,085
and then to lead
the hordes into battle...

1016
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:25,187
The undead are like locusts.
Locusts.

They have no use for leaders.

Hmm?

Oh, well, um, according
to the Book of Revelation, actually,

01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,202
the Antichrist
shall lead the undead

Thank you, Lady Catherine.

Very generous. Franklin,
are there more scones?

Aristocrats? To what end?

1026
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,484
A treaty.

01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,253
Never.

1029
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,255
Well, then the human
race is surely doomed.

1030
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,960
Your Ladyship, the undead
will always multiply faster

1031
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,528
than the living can procreate.

1032
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,796
Nine months to make a baby,

1033
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:09,765
then 16 years
to make a soldier,

1034
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,668
and one raw second
to make a zombie.

1035
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,504
You must realize, if they were to
organize, we cannot defeat them.

1036
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:18,173
The only hope is to find a way
to coexist with them,

1037
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,809
before they find
their Antichrist.

Because he believes your sister
be inferior to his friend.

1075
