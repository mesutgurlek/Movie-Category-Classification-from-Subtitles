1
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,193
How did you talk me into this, Tommy?

2
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,351
Hell, I must be crazy!

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,559
You know, if the institution
ever found out about this,

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,878
they'd haul our butts
back in in straitjackets, permanent!

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,230
You didn't have to come, Hawes.
This is between me and Jason.

6
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,236
I know, I know, I know.

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,589
I still don't get the therapy here.

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,473
All you need to know
is Jason's dead, right?

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,910
Seeing his corpse
won't stop the hallucinations.

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,520
Seeing it won't,
but destroying it will.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,433
Jason belongs in hell,
and I'm gonna see he gets there.

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,511
OK, there it is, huh?

13
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,911
There's his grave.

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,229
- OK, let's go.
- Wait a second.

15
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,716
- What?
- I got to be sure.

16
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,479
OK, there's your proof.
There's his coffin. Let's go.

17
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,790
- Hand me the crowbar.
- You're not gonna open that.

18
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,831
Hand me the crowbar.

19
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,591
I got it.

20
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,350
I really don't like this.

21
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,238
(Screaming and struggling)

22
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,231
'Die!'

23
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,396
- 'Die!'
- (Girl) 'Tommy!'

24
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,314
'Die!'

25
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,999
- 'Tommy!'
- 'Die!'

26
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,512
(Girl) 'Tommy,
get the hell out of here!'

27
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,551
Where are you going?

28
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,358
What's that for?
Tommy, what are you doing?

29
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,633
Oh, shit.

30
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,999
Die, die! Bastard!

31
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,955
Die!

32
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,510
Oh, boy. He must have
really messed you over.

33
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,955
Yeah, fuck you, Jason.

34
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,711
What are you doing?

35
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,796
Tommy! Would you just leave
that thing alone?

36
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,397
Please!

37
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,988
Tommy, please,
let's get out of here.

38
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,871
My heart can't take any more!

39
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,357
(Screaming)

40
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,674
Hawes!

41
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,956
- Don't shoot! Please!
- Are you in show business?

42
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,718
That was some entrance.

43
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,799
You got to do something.
Jason's alive. He's coming for me.

44
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,400
Relax. You almost got
your head blown off.

45
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,557
- Listen, damn it!
- Don't piss me off, junior.

46
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,830
Look, Jason is alive.

47
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,917
We dug up his body.
I was going to cremate it.

48
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,394
Hold it. What's your name, son?

49
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,955
Tommy Jarvis.
He's even more powerful now...

50
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,389
Didn't that maniac kill
your mother and friends?

51
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,919
Jason murdered them.

52
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,394
You've been in
some psychiatric clinic.

53
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,829
What's going on with the weather?!

54
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,632
Sorry. I didn't know...

55
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,992
No problem, Rick. This is Tommy, a
former resident. He's got some prank.

56
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,555
There's no time for this bullshit!
Jason's got to be stopped!

57
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,754
Hey!

58
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,395
That's known as "screwing the pooch".
Iron this punk.

59
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,433
You got to listen to me!
Jason's coming. He's after me!

60
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,675
I tried to destroy him
but I fucked up!

61
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,188
- You got that right.
- Listen to me.

62
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,231
I'm sorry about your folks,

63
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,636
but no one in Forest Green
wants to remember that maniac.

64
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,309
That's why we changed the name. They
wanna forget this was Crystal Lake.

65
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,669
They don't need you
stirrin' up Jason shit.

66
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,109
Now, just lie down and get some rest.

67
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,196
Tomorrow I'll call that clinic.

68
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,232
Go to the cemetery.
You'll see I'm not lying.

69
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,238
Either you get some sleep
or I'll come in and put you out.

70
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,635
You'll be sorry you didn't listen.

71
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,989
You'll be sorry if you don't shut up.

72
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,031
Take a nap, junior!

73
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,159
Easy! It's hard enough
to read this thing.

74
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,191
Who said to take this cow path?

75
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,312
You admit the sign did say
"Camp Forest Green"

76
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,476
with an arrow pointing this way?

77
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,638
I admit nothing without my lawyer.
We should have left a trail.

78
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,511
Don't start.

79
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,996
So much for the head counsellors
getting back to camp on their own.

80
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,838
Let's get out and start
screaming for help.

81
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,393
- I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
- Darren, we better turn around.

82
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,908
- Why?
- I've seen enough horror movies

83
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,793
to know any weirdo in a mask
is never friendly.

84
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,958
Whoa!

85
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,835
There's no way. If the car drops in
that gully, we'll never get it out.

86
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,996
Do you have a better suggestion?

87
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,558
Yeah. We're gonna scare him.

88
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,354
- We're going to scare him?
- Drive towards him. He'll move.

89
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,994
- Nobody wants to die.
- Least of all us!

90
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,032
Will you just drive?
He'll get out of our way.

91
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,597
Yeah, that really scared the shit
out of him(!)

92
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,554
(Horn)

93
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,795
(Air hissing)

94
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,153
Oh, no.

95
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,829
- We're driving back in reverse.
- The hell we are.

96
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,389
- Where did you get that?
- Don't worry about it. Stay cool.

97
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,113
Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry!
Stop it.

98
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,877
All right, scumbag.

99
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,751
Get out of the road.

100
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,028
Now!

101
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,639
Darren, get back in now.
He'll kill you.

102
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,397
Not if I get him first.

103
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,074
Oh, no!

104
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,192
Please!

105
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,470
Give me a second!

106
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,715
Please!

107
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,677
Please! You can have the...

108
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,118
(Voices approaching)

109
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,152
Dad, you could at least drive out
to Cunningham Road and look for them.

110
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,637
Megan, we don't have time to look for
camp counsellors with car trouble.

111
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,956
Can't you put out
an all points bulletin?

112
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,834
- Can your mother sew, kid?
- Excuse me?

113
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,472
Hey...off.

114
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,511
Oh, sorry.

115
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,669
Darren and my sister Lizbeth
are organising the new campgrounds.

116
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,793
- We don't know what to do.
- And the kiddies arrive today.

117
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,354
I sympathise with you kids.

118
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,995
I'll tell the station in Carpenter
to look out for them.

119
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,270
I've got a bad feeling about it.

120
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,039
Hopefully they're fine,
but with Jason out there...

121
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,594
- Shut up.
- Jason who?

122
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,995
Megan, stay away. He's dangerous!

123
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,508
I'm not dangerous.
Jason is out there.

124
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,632
He's looking for me.
He's probably gone to the camp.

125
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,193
I said shut up!

126
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,196
You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?

127
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,912
- Yes!
- No!

128
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,269
You kids better leave.

129
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,676
This boy is not well.
I need to talk to him in private.

130
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,757
- Come on, Dad!
- Megan! Go back to camp.

131
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,076
- I'll call you if I hear anything.
- Don't beat him up too bad.

132
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,519
He's kinda cute.

133
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,516
Megan, leave!

134
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,949
Whoo! He's cute!

135
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,709
I was gonna call that clinic
to collect you,

136
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,594
but I don't want you around poisoning
people with your warped humour.

137
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,200
They have to be warned, Sheriff.

138
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,870
Jason will return to what's familiar.
It's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.

139
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,470
We'll escort you
to the edge of my jurisdiction.

140
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,230
Then we'll say goodbye and never see
you around here again. Understand?

141
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,871
Shit! Shit, damn!

142
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,436
I know I'll get blamed for this.

143
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,632
They'll say old Martin
ain't a good caretaker.

144
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,148
Hell, I'm a damn high school
graduate.

145
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,760
I deserve this job. I earned it.

146
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,791
Nobody's gonna find out.

147
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,118
Shitheads couldn't
even stick him back in right.

148
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,958
I ain't gonna touch the slimy sucker.

149
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,912
Why did they have
to go and dig up Jason?

150
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,077
Some folks have a strange idea
of entertainment.

151
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,114
(# Pop music)

152
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,673
Anything else?

153
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,711
You guys, I'm getting worried.

154
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,275
- About Jason?
- No. About Darren and Lizbeth.

155
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,676
They should've at least called,
don't you think? Megan?

156
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,517
- What?
- Hello?

157
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,993
Yeah.

158
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,919
This girl's back in the jail cell
with her prisoner of love.

159
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,669
Don't mess with no jailbird, girl.
Those dudes are bad news.

160
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,429
- Oh, and how do you know?
- I seen plenty on TV.

161
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,948
- TV?
- Yeah!

162
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,310
I don't know about that guy, Megan.

163
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,033
He seemed weird
with all that Jason stuff.

164
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,390
Megan, like I told you,
you need a guy like me.

165
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,318
- Guy who's not twisted.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.

166
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,114
Just because our parents
say Jason was only a legend

167
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,196
doesn't mean it wasn't true.

168
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,514
What if he did come back here...

169
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,633
Iooking for the camp counsellor
that caused him to drown as a boy?

170
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,391
Searching for the one
that decapitated his vengeful mother.

171
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,798
And you do know what
today's date is, don't you?

172
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,754
I can think of only one thing...
even more terrifying.

173
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,313
What?

174
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,951
The kids are here.

175
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,036
(Shouting and cheering)

176
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,510
(Woman) You'll trip.
Be careful. You may fall.

177
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,508
There they are and they're all yours.

178
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,157
Think I'd rather deal with old Jason.

179
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,956
Crap.

180
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,517
Once we nail Roy, that's it.
Victory is ours.

181
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,949
It's taking forever. I'm starving.

182
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,549
Larry, that's why your sales
are always behind quota.

183
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,717
Your instinct to eat is
stronger than your instinct to win.

184
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,957
- You're a real ass!
- Better than being all ass!

185
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,351
That is so unfair!

186
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,233
Here we go with unfair again.
War is not fair.

187
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,192
Give me a break.
This is not war, this is a game.

188
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,153
- I want a sandwich, OK?
- Wait till we've killed something.

189
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,239
- Easy! You're an insurance salesman.
- Death is my business.

190
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,477
You become another person
when we're out here, Stan.

191
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,353
- I don't like it.
- This is a man's game.

192
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,358
It requires a man's cunning
and intelligence...

193
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,270
With a woman's touch.

194
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,754
Wait a minute!
I thought Burt shot you!

195
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,597
See any paint?

196
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,236
Sorry, guys, I did in Mr Commando,
weapons and all.

197
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,670
Survival's the name of the game
and that flag is mine.

198
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,751
I can't believe this.
Burt never gets shot.

199
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,793
- Never should have let her play.
- She's a damn company exec!

200
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,229
Now, boys. Don't be spoilsports.

201
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,877
Put on your headbands.

202
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,918
Dumb broad!

203
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,555
She tricked me!
They're gonna laugh for months!

204
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,320
She should have stayed
in the kitchen!

205
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,998
A woman shouldn't be allowed
in these games!

206
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,031
It's not a game, it's life!

207
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,237
Jason really screwed up
that poor son of a bitch's mind.

208
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,989
He really believes that
Jason's still alive, doesn't he?

209
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,749
What worries me is how far he'll go
to try and prove it.

210
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,632
Darn.

211
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,717
Oh, no.

212
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,439
Oh, no.

213
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,876
Oh, my God! No!

214
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,911
Where... Come on!

215
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,156
Where? Oh, no!

216
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,430
Oh, no! Oh, God!

217
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,074
Come on out, you guys.
The game's over.

218
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,395
What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.

219
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,557
Unless he's accidentally pelleted
himself, I'm sure he's lost.

220
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,989
- It's not over till it's over.
- Right.

221
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,632
- (Rustling)
- Shh!

222
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,034
Wait a second. What was that?

223
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,877
- What?
- Nothing.

224
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,911
I could swear I heard something.

225
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,632
- I'm hungry.
- God!

226
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,671
Be quiet.

227
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,957
Oh, my God!

228
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,672
My God!

229
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,551
Help, guys! Help me!

230
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,352
Help! Help! Help! Oh, no!

231
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,356
Help me, guys! Help!

232
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,595
Oh, God!

233
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,917
Help me!

234
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,155
Somebody help me!

235
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,191
He's gonna kill me!

236
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,437
What did I tell you?
Hit the noise and the cherries.

237
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,391
(Sirens)

238
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,870
- Sheriff, wait! You gotta listen!
- I'm tired of listening to you.

239
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,309
I gotta show you Jason's grave!

240
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,918
Come on! Get up!

241
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,473
Get up!

242
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,829
Please. You'll see we dug it up.

243
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,589
Well, he must have got chilly
and pulled the dirt back over.

244
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,155
That's not right.
Somebody covered it over.

245
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,873
- I gotta see it!
- Freeze it, psycho.

246
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,310
Now, see, you made my deputy
draw his revolver.

247
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,113
He's been dying to try
his new laser scope.

248
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,835
Wherever the red dot goes...yebang!

249
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,078
- What's the problem, Sheriff?
- No problem, Martin. It's fine.

250
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,078
- Did you cover up Jason's grave?
- What?!

251
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,429
Don't concern yourself, Martin.

252
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,439
Jason's not in his grave, Hawes is!
You've gotta dig it up!

253
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,596
You've gotta dig it up!

254
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,279
Dig him up?

255
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,317
Does he think I'm a farthead?

256
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,359
(All) Yes!

257
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,075
OK! Is this gonna be
the best weekend ever?

258
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,678
Yes!

259
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,757
- Are we gonna go fishing?
- Yes!

260
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,792
Are we going to scare all the boys?

261
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,796
Yes!

262
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,991
OK. Are we going to...uh...

263
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,749
Are we going to, uh...
not eat Brussels sprouts?

264
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,518
What happened to Cort?

265
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,951
Are you ready? He's teaching
the young men my favourite sport.

266
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,992
- Which is?
- Boy scouting, honey.

267
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,474
Cort? You've got to be kidding?

268
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,999
You've got to be kidding.

269
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,272
You obviously don't know anything
about lndians. None of you do.

270
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
These are called lndian markers, OK?

271
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,232
You have a chief, right,
and he dumps his squaw or whatever.

272
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,272
He decides to pick another woman
and take off.

273
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,675
So he leaves his son with the mother.

274
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,870
Later, the son wants to find his dad

275
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,593
to learn how to kill buffalo
or whatever.

276
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,633
So he comes along, sees the rocks.
Sees his dad went that way.

277
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,478
So he comes up
and knocks them all down

278
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,988
so his mother won't know where to go.

279
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,350
So that's the basic story.
Tells you where to go.

280
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,234
If this is as exciting as it gets,
we're in big trouble.

281
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,031
Let's go.

282
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,869
Like the sign says,
you are now leaving Forest Green.

283
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,070
You are damn lucky, kid!

284
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,917
With the grief you've given me,

285
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,758
you should be leaving wearing your
balls as earrings.

286
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,473
If I see you again,
you can guarantee it.

287
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,109
Let's get the hell
out of here, Rick.

288
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,157
# I'll take you home again, Kathleen

289
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,794
# To where...

290
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,868
# Your heart will feel no pain

291
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,674
# I'll take you home again... #

292
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,473
Oh, Steven. It's beautiful.

293
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,989
God, I love it. I really do.

294
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,437
I don't know.
I mean, I'm sort of hurt.

295
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,029
You thought I brought you
up here just to... Never mind.

296
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,878
Yeah. Well, I guess I do owe you.

297
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,798
Yeah. No, look. I have a headache.

298
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,673
I've been working out.
I'm...sore.

299
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,029
- And, er...
- Forget about it.

300
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,992
It's a messy act and...
What the heck?

301
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,837
Great!

302
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,434
#..again, Kathleen... #

303
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,436
Oh.

304
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,471
Where did the road go?

305
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,511
I can't find the road.

306
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,671
Where is the road?

307
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,110
Kathleen, you led me astray.

308
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,635
What's that? What's that?

309
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,596
(Footsteps)

310
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,198
Darling, you're gonna be
the death of me.

311
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,515
Yeah, but what a way to go, eh?

312
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,677
(Silence)

313
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,715
- Stay here.
- No, Steven. Please.

314
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,751
- Stay here!
- Steven, don't!

315
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,156
- Steven, what's going on?
- Annette, let's go!

316
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,713
Never mind!

317
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,839
- What are we gonna do?
- Get the sheriff!

318
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,911
(Squeaking)

319
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,870
- Pick a card.
- I don't wanna play any more, Sissy.

320
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,832
- Come on, pick a card!
- No, I really don't.

321
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,910
OK. I've got a great game.

322
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,916
It's called Camp Blood.

323
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,359
Great.

324
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,552
First you take this jack of spades,
which is Jason.

325
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,479
Then you have face cards
which represent counsellors.

326
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,351
The queen of hearts is me.

327
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,197
Now, who do you want to be?

328
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,958
Come on, Sissy.

329
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,195
OK. You be the queen of diamonds.

330
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,835
Now, you shuffle Jason up
in these cards here...

331
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,075
and you put them in piles.

332
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,111
The piles represent cabins.

333
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,439
The object of the game is to find out
which cabin Jason is in.

334
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,710
Did Megan say when she's coming back?

335
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,992
Of course not. I bet she took him
a loaf of bread with a saw in it.

336
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,672
I'll call her.

337
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,712
Her dad may know something
about Darren and Lizbeth.

338
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,912
I say if they're not here tomorrow,
we send the kids home. We're not...

339
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,871
(Child screaming)

340
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,994
- She saw a monster!
- Who did?

341
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,958
- It's OK. We're here.
- Yeah, we're here.

342
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,399
What happened?

343
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,591
There was this monster
and he was after me.

344
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,596
He wanted to kill me.

345
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,353
- Where?
- He was everywhere.

346
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,516
You mean you had a bad dream?

347
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,790
No! It was real, just like on TV.

348
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,354
Listen, sweetie. What's your name?

349
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,188
- Nancy.
- Well, Nancy. I'm Paula, remember?

350
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,231
And this is Sissy.

351
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,239
We'll be right out there all night
so nothing can hurt you, OK?

352
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,836
So no more bad dreams
can come around here, huh?

353
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,115
Good. OK, lay down.

354
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,471
There. OK?

355
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,393
OK?

356
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,909
Hey, wait a minute. Where's Cort?
I haven't seen him for hours.

357
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,270
I don't know.
He called somebody and just took off.

358
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,788
Mentioned checking out things
that go bump in the night.

the end of this song.

How much longer?

363
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,352
It's only ten more minutes.

364
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,957
- Fuck!
- (Cort) Ah, yeah.

365
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,672
Wait a second.

366
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,998
- Cort, you didn't already?
- Wasn't that the end of the song?

Great. Just great!

Horace will have my butt.

Who's Horace?

370
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,832
My stepfather and asshole
in residence.

Oh. How did that happen?

- Will you plug the cord back in?
- Who unplugged it?

374
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,030
- I don't know. Just do it!
- It's cold out there!

I don't give a shit! Go do it.

A major pain in the ass.

Hi! This is his daughter Megan.
I met you this morning.

Yeah, hi. Let me talk
to your dad about Jason.

I've got a plan.
First, I need some supplies...

455

My father's looking for you.

456
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,871
Something happened
and he's sure you're responsible.

457
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,276
- If he finds you, he'll...
- Yeah. He made that clear.

458
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,518
Jason is out there. He's headed
back to the camp. He's going...

- Where are you? I'll pick you up.
- What?

If my father sees you in your car,
he'll nail you. Where are you?

Uh, Karloff's General something.
Um...

466
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,669
Alert all officers and stations in a
50-mile radius about this wacko kid.

- I want roadblocks.

00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,117
- That all you found?
- I wish it was.

472
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,756
I'll order up some body bags.

473
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,917
Our boy sure wants us
to believe his story.

474
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,111
Well, he picked the right day
to pull this shit.

475
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,912
What do you mean?

476
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,030
Happy Friday the 13th.

477
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,957
(Heavy breathing)

478
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,397
All right, who's out there?

479
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,795
What's going on?

480
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,151
I think I hear somebody
fooling around out there.

481
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,236
It's got to be Cort.

482
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,192
You know how he loves
to try and scare us.

483
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,231
Teach him a lesson.

484
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,153
(Footsteps, heavy breathing)

485
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,875
(Footsteps, heavy breathing)

486
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,992
(Screaming)

487
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,189
(Bones breaking)

488
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,435
You guys, try not to wake the kids.

489
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,317
(Thud)

490
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,836
I need your car.
You can't come, it's too dangerous.

491
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,510
Leaving that truck in plain sight
is dangerous! Hide it and let's go.

492
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,838
This isn't a game. You're not coming.
I'm already responsible for...

493
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,678
- You said you needed some supplies.
- Yes, but...

494
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,635
Then let's get going. Tell me what
you need, I'll see that you get it.

495
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,673
And nobody drives this puppy but me.
Hide the heap and let's book.

496
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,873
- Can't this tub go any faster?
- You got it.

497
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,754
- You just watch for roadblocks.
- OK. There's one.

498
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,390
- # I'm a rock 'n' roll vagabond... #
- Get down!

499
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,197
# 16 when I left home
and I don't regret a single day... #

500
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,390
Hey! Hey!

501
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,513
# I'm a sucker for a loud guitar,
got one tattooed on my chest

502
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,749
# It's hot July, my mouth is dry

503
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,678
# You know
that I've been screaming... #

504
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,273
Officer Pappas to Sheriff Garris,
do you copy?

505
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,869
I'm here.

506
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,515
We got a different vehicle
that took off when they saw us.

507
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,472
- Got a description?
- The whole enchilada.

508
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,433
It's a '77 orange Camaro.
License number Mary William 85-10.

509
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,948
That's my daughter's car.

510
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,915
How do you want us to proceed, sir?

511
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,791
With extreme care, asshole.

512
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,593
If that kid is with her,
he might do something crazy.

513
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,238
Don't do anything crazy.

514
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,916
# Hard rock summer in the USA... #

515
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,839
I know what I'm doing.
I got you your supplies.

516
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,556
# All year long I saved my pay
and I stashed it in a rusty can... #

517
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,319
If I reach Cunningham Road,
I can lose them.

518
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,271
Stay down!

519
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,031
Whatever you say.

520
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,119
#..at the LA sand,
California screamin'

521
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,197
# Hard rock summer... #

522
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,435
That's what I want.

523
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,596
# Hard rock summer... #

524
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,074
It's gonna be a hairy turn. Hang on.

525
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,876
# I rock all night,
gonna blow this town

526
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,639
# Till morning light
going round and round

527
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,514
# Hard rock summer in the USA #

528
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,039
(Sirens approaching)

529
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,551
Megan, step out of the car.

530
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,957
End of the line.

531
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,312
Oh, shit.

532
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,271
(Door opens)

533
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,315
Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared.
I saw someone at my window.

534
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,397
- Where did you get this?
- I found it outside.

535
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,276
You know what?
Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.

536
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,317
- You know, scaring each other?
- Why?

537
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,749
Grown-ups think it's funny
to be scared.

538
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,360
- What?
- Never mind.

539
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,910
I can't believe it's that late.

540
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,509
- No one called. I better...
- Who are you calling?

541
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,913
Why don't we go find
Sissy and Cort first?

542
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,269
Then you can go to bed.

543
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,073
Wait. What if they try to scare us?

544
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,111
- We'll scare them back!
- OK.

545
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,354
OK!

546
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,711
Let's find 'em.

547
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,957
- I said shut up!
- He's only asking you to look!

548
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,991
You got me where you want me...

549
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,589
If I did, they'd pump your ass
full of formaldehyde.

550
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,710
At least call the camp.

551
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,035
We have.
The phone there's disconnected.

552
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,878
- That means something!
- They should pay the bill.

553
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,672
Sheriff.

554
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,678
Just sit tight, Jason.
When the authorities...

555
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,518
Sheriff, you better take this.

556
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,631
Sheriff Garris.

557
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,071
What time?

558
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,037
I'll be right there.

559
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,670
- What's happened?
- Rick.

560
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,192
Keep an eye on this wacko.
Be back as soon as I can.

561
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,198
- What's going on?
- Make sure my daughter stays put.

562
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,071
Tell me!

563
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,795
They just found Cort and some girl.
Her head was crushed.

564
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,400
Cort had a knife rammed
through his skull.

565
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,634
No.

566
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,593
Tommy Jarvis...
is a psychopathic killer.

567
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,553
- He wants you to believe...
- It was Jason!

568
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,229
- Sheriff, when did it happen?
- For God's sake, Meggie.

569
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,555
Stay away from him, please.

570
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,671
- When did this happen?
- Why?

571
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,439
- What time?
- Eight-thirty, nine. Why?

572
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,392
Tommy was with me all that time, Dad.

573
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,316
Rick...I'll call you from there.
Lock him up.

574
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,473
OK, Flash, into the cage!

575
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,951
I'm sure Sissy and Cort are back
in their cabins by now,

576
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,560
so go back to sleep and don't worry.

577
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,034
But what if I get scared again?

578
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,198
Shh! You know what I used to do
when I was little and got scared?

579
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,037
I would close my eyes
and say a little prayer.

580
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,835
And you know what? Pretty soon,
everything scary went away.

581
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,714
It worked for me.
I bet it'll work for you, too.

582
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,990
- Good night.
- Good night.

583
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,471
See you in the morning.

584
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,591
(Owl screeches)

585
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,511
(Rustling)

586
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,117
Cort?

587
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,717
Sissy?

588
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,239
(Door opens)

589
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,079
(Screams)

590
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,551
(Screaming continues)

591
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,718
(Mouths)

592
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,312
- So what are you drawing?
- So what's it to you?

593
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,032
Pipe down, Jarvis.

594
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,389
I was curious about her drawing.

595
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,919
There. You happy?

596
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,951
No.

597
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,150
- Why?
- Because it stinks.

598
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,468
- OK, give it back.
- Come and get it.

599
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,080
I'll get it for you, babe.

600
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,999
- Come and get it.
- Give it back, punk!

601
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,834
Hey! Hey, hey!

602
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,836
Get your hands off her, animal.

603
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,952
You little turd.
I ought to punch you silly.

604
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,916
Let him out of there, Rick.

605
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,917
Megan! Don't clown around.

606
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,353
I'm not the one with the funny red
nose. Open the cell and let him out.

607
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,675
- Meggie.
- I'm not kidding.

608
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,511
You better do as she says

609
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,791
because wherever the red dot goes...
yebang!

610
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,637
You son of a bitch!

611
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,513
You're really screwing up here,
missy.

612
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,518
Don't... Don't do this, Megan!

613
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,072
Megan!

614
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,557
- I thought he took your key.
- He did. But I've got my hide-a-key.

615
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,113
- No.
- Hey, wait...

616
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,835
I appreciate your help
but I have to finish what I started.

617
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,034
Come on, hot lips, let's go.
You drive, I'll navigate.

618
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,997
(Tyres screech)

619
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,236
Let me know before we blast into
hyperspace. I'll fasten my seat belt.

620
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,113
I got a bad feeling
we're already too late.

621
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,635
Is this gonna work? Why don't
we bring the gun and blow him away?

622
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,753
We can only stop Jason by returning
him to his original resting place,

623
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,791
where he drowned in 1957.

624
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,150
- Lake Forest Green.
- Crystal Lake,

625
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,236
where this nightmare began.

626
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,039
(Nancy crying)

627
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,680
Now I lay me down...
Now I lay me down to sleep,

628
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,517
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

629
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,394
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

630
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,318
- Now I lay me down to...
- (Car doors close)

631
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,035
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

632
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,516
- What's the story here?
- Why don't you nose around?

633
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,028
I'll tell Megan's friends
what happened.

634
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,275
- Holler if you see anything.
- Like what?

635
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,471
Anything that don't belong.
Don't wake the kids.

636
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,071
Come on, handsome.

637
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,597
(Knocking)

638
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,631
(Garris) Girls?

639
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,432
(Knocking)

640
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,277
It's Sheriff Garris.

641
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,158
Hey!

642
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,111
Oh, my God.

643
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,432
(Twig snaps)

644
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,233
(Officer) All right,
come on out of there.

645
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,309
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

646
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,111
Come on out of there.

647
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,037
(Crying)

648
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,992
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing out here?

649
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,589
- Go on back to bed.
- No! No! There's a scary man!

650
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,710
What scary man?

651
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,311
(Bones breaking)

652
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,951
No, no. It's OK. It's OK.

653
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,515
Everything's all right.
Everything's OK, honey. It's OK.

654
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,471
Come on, boys, let's go.

655
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,951
Come on, kids. Come on.

656
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,398
Listen to me very carefully.
I want you all to lie under the beds.

657
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,670
Do not get up until I come back, OK?

658
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,711
Now, move! Hurry! Come on.

659
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,997
(Garris) Come on.

660
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,832
Fuck!

661
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,114
- See? They did show up.
- Yeah.

662
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,549
We'll have to take... Megan, wait!

663
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,318
Oh, God! Dad! Daddy!

664
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,429
(Kids screaming)

665
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:29,951
It's OK. It's Megan. Don't be afraid.
Everything's gonna be all right.

666
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,752
Don't be afraid.

667
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,031
- Is everyone OK?
- Fine.

668
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,197
It's OK. Everything's
going to be just fine, OK?

669
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,351
I'll find my daddy, the sheriff,
then we can all go home, OK?

670
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,790
Now, lie down where you were before
and stay there.

671
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,593
Go ahead.
We'll come back and get you.

672
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,835
I promise. Lie down. Stay there.

673
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,077
- What do you think?
- I think we're dead meat.

674
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,877
(Megan) Daddy!

675
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,877
Dad, answer me! Dad, where are you?

676
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,869
Megan, use your dad's radio
to call for help and an ambulance.

677
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,474
Oh, God!

678
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,277
Daddy!

679
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,111
Daddy, where are you?

680
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,115
Daddy, please come help us!

681
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,798
Daddy!

682
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,400
(Megan screams)

683
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,715
Real dead meat.

684
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,070
So, what were you gonna be
when you grew up?

685
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,071
(Megan) Daddy, where are you?

686
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,233
Daddy, please help us. Please!

687
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,039
No! Not her!

688
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,875
(Bones breaking)

689
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,560
(Megan) Dad! Dad, answer me!

690
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,351
You've got to help me find my dad.
We need his help.

691
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,118
Hand me the padlock.

692
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,550
- Aren't you listening?
- Yes! Hand me the padlock!

693
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,312
- Here! You're going to be sorry.
- I hope not.

694
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,117
(Motor starts)

695
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,151
Megan.

696
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,510
Megan! Get back to the cabin
with the kids.

697
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,199
- Megan, please!
- Wait! You can't do this!

698
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,196
Go before it's too late!

699
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,997
(Screaming)

700
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,433
Megan, no!

701
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,118
Megan!

702
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,077
Megan! Megan, no!

703
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,348
Jason!

704
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,072
Jason! Jason, come on!

705
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,158
Come and get me!
It's me you want, remember?

706
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,150
That's it! Come on, maggot head!
Come on, maggot head!

707
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,350
That's it. Come on!

708
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,677
Tommy! Get out of there!

709
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,994
Hurry!

710
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,110
Hey! Asshole!

711
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,879
It's me you want, remember! Come on!

712
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,957
Come on, chicken shit!
I'm standing here waiting!

713
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,991
Come on, you pussy!

714
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,871
Is he killed?

715
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,871
Stay here.

716
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,270
(Kids cheering)

717
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,955
It's over.

718
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,991
It's finally over.

719
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,276
Jason's home.

720
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,750
# You're with your baby

721
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,713
# And you're parked alone
on a summer night

722
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,151
# You're deep in love
but you're deeper in the woods

723
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,714
# You think you're doing all right

724
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,231
# Did you hear that voice?

725
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:40,273
# Did you see that face
or was it just a dream?

726
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,871
# This can't be real,
that only happens, babe,

727
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,911
# On the movie screen

728
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,190
# Oh, but he's back

729
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:55,074
# He's the man behind the mask

730
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,270
# And he's out of control

731

# And he crawled out of his hole

734
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,598
# You're swimming with your girl
out on Lover's Lake

735
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,835
# And the wind blows cold

736
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,270
# It chills your bones
but you're still on the make

737
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,356
# That's a bad mistake

738
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,948
# Ah, but the moon was full

739
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,788
# And you had a chance
to be all alone

740

# But you're not alone

741
