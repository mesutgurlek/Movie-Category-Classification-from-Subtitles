00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,514
We need to get back
the serratura

164
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,849
and lock them all
away in a pit of fire.

care of, darling.

00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,691
in the Mikaelsons' possession.

169
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,860
By end of day,
we'll have what is ours,

170
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,862
and we'll have taken care
of the only witch

171

You two need a lesson in women.

Could the lesson not be
yours to learn, Rebekah?

180
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,356
Didn't you damn one
of them to eternity,

viciously antagonize the other?

182

Those lunatics actually
believe the prophecy.

You don't, do you?

184
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,648
You'd be foolish to ignore

185

of these omens.

We can't be killed, Elijah.

This prophecy does state one
of us will fall by family.

188
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:42,320
Well, I would never harm you,

00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,161
Yes. Freya. Let's not forget
her allegiance to Finn.

192
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,329
I do want to trust her, but...

193
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,166
So that leaves Nik.

194
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,500
Do you think he's
learned his lesson

195
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,636
about backstabbing his family?

196
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,422
Oh, I think he learns
that lesson all the time.

197

He's just a terrible student.

it takes to grow back?

since this city was a swamp,

294
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,859
but we are all New Orleans,

295
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,779
and now you're gonna hand
over 9 powerful covens

297

your business.

298
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,617
I think you should back off.

299
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,370
Or what? You gonna get
another little teenage girl

300

301

Hoo.

302
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:48,138
I have been holding back
my power for a long time.

303
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,974
Today that stops.

304
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,642
See, I came here for
a little bit of clarity,

305
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:53,477
and I think I just got that.

306
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,980
I'm gonna take back
the regency, Marcel,

307
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:58,731
but you ain't gonna like
what I'm gonna do with it.

308
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,880
While I cannot take away
the feelings of worthlessness

309
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,832
that haunt you now,
I can tell you

310

you will learn
to live with them.

311

I certainly have.

312
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,922
I have also come to find

313
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:25,059
that the very thing you
believe is worth the least

314
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,478
matters most of all.

315
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,731
There is beauty in the courage

316
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:34,068
of the fragile fighter,

317
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,520
those who persevere

318
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,822
despite all they've
been through,

319
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:43,026
those who still believe
there is good in the world.

320

often find we need

321

that light the most.

322
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:57,091

324
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,462

00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:16,026
Yeah, a sister.
Baton Rouge.

327
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:19,062
Go to her.
Enjoy Christmas.

328
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:22,066
In the new year,
you will return to your captain,

329
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,736
and he will welcome
you with open arms,

330
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:28,539
and, detective,

331
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,911
you will remember today
as your darkest day.

332
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:38,132
Tomorrow will be better,

333
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,452
the day after better still.

334
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,420
You will go on.

335
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,182
Give me the bad news, doc.

336
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:56,650
Freya: Aya's stake was cursed.

337
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,102
It infected you.

338
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:01,739
As this mark grows,
you will go mad.

339
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,774
Left unchecked, you will become

340
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:06,994
a relentless,
unstoppable ripper.

341
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:08,946
Aya always was thorough.

342
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,447
Strix always employ a safeguard.

343
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,582
In the event
that we were successful

344
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,168
at retrieving your body,
you were cursed.

345
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,620
You see, if one is on a rampage,

346
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,955
one is not difficult to hunt.

347
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:20,624
Can you fix this?

348
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,292
The spell is carved here.

349
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:25,212
I can... I can reverse it.

350
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,465
I just... Need some time

351
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:31,134
and a hell of a lot of magic.

352
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:41,144
Jackson: She was fine.
Hayley healed her.

353
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,816
This scratch is not healed.

354
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:48,202
This is poison.

355
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:51,649
This is an assassination
attempt.

356
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:01,640
She's waking up.

357
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,394
You ok?

358
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,897
I feel weak.

359
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:12,235
Jackson: Those vampires must
have stabbed her with something.

360
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,370
So The Strix are fond of
this slow-acting poison.

361
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,205
There is an antidote.

362
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,989
If I can get my hands on it.

363
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:23,162
For this, I'll need
a pure silver knife,

364
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,248
some white muskroot.

365
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:26,332
I'll get the knife.

366
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,334
I'll track down the root.

367
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,303
Freya, you can barely
float a feather right now,

368
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:32,505
let alone save the world.

369
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,756
I'll channel Finn.

370
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:36,008
Oh, lovely.

371
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,059
My fate rests in the hands

372
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,177
of our black sheep of a brother

373
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,179
that we have trapped
in a necklace.

374
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,681
I'm sure he's just
leaping to help.

375
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:44,350
Well, he's the only other
powerful witch here,

376
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,602
and you and I are out of options,
sister.

377
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,864
He's packing.

378
00:18:57,865 --> 00:18:59,582
Klaus...

379
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,582
What you did...

380
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,869
Was nothing.

381
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,455
It was not nothing.

382
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:09,291
[Cell phone vibrates]

[Chanting]

386
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:31,314
Finn: The pain you
endure for these monsters

387
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,648
you call family.

388
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,233
Finn.

389
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,702
It isn't worth it, sister.

390
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:40,406
It is.
It has to be.

391
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:42,742
The ingredients are complicated.

392
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,076
Klaus: I don't need the recipe.

393
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,628
I know exactly where I
can find the antidote.

394
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:48,080
I'll be quick.

395
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,582
If The Strix have been using
this poison for centuries,

396
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,418
then Lucien has a cure,
I guarantee it.

397
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,753
Probably keeps it tucked away

398
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:55,587
next to his cure
for werewolf bites.

399
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,924
I'm sure he won't mind if
we break in and borrow it.

400
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:01,677
You go.
I'll be fine.

401
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,479
No.

402
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,764
If I'm going to save my sisters,

403
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:07,767
I can't be worried about you.

404
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:11,938
Right now,
the safest place for you is with me.

405
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,271
Please.

[Hope crying]

Don't fret.
I haven't gone full hellion yet.

408
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:24,282
No more than usual.

409
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:25,751
Well, that's good.
I wouldn't want to

410
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:28,838
have to kick your ass
before I got to hug you.

411
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,123
You know, we need to talk
about your sartorial choices.

00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:33,376
This is positively darling.

413
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,795
That is not mine.
That is Cami's.

414
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,964
She has been staying
here the past few nights.

415
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:41,634
Actually, Jackson and I
have our own place now,

416
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:46,138
although we still can't manage
to stay out of Mikaelson drama.

417
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,807
You don't seem to mind
the family drama

418
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,692
when you need something from us,

419
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:53,311
like a decent dress
or a babysitter.

420
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,814
Excuse me?

421
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,399
But when you're looking
for someone to blame

for your unhappiness,

423
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:00,903
we seem to be the enemy.

Rebekah, you're wrong.

I believed we were friends,

nearly sisters,

429
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,665
but the last time we spoke,

430
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,000
you were planning
on taking hope away

431

from this family forever,

432
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,720
so where do you stand, Hayley?

690

concrete proof

that not one of those things can
