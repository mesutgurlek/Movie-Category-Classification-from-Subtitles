Ah, yes. I had quite a future, didn't I?

Yes, you were working
with Edward Pretorious.

91
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:55,276
I was assisting Dr. Pretorious
with his experiments, yes.

92
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:00,244
What was the purpose
of the experiments?

93
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,878
To stimulate the pineal gland
with resonant vibrations.

94
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,548
The pineal gland. Why?

95
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:12,095
Dr. Pretorious believed that the pineal
was a dormant sensory organ.

96
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,857
- A sixth sense.
- Yes.

97
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:15,022
Well, that's not a new theory.

98
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:17,794
The philosopher Descartes
believed it was the third eye.

99
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,029
It's not a theory, it's a fact.

100
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:22,605
Then your experiments worked.

101
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,571
They proved the theory.

102
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,903
Yes.

103
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:32,445

104
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:37,250
Nothing, at first.

00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,517
- Are they around us now?
- You bet.

111
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,321
Only we can't see them
without the Resonator,

112
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,186
and they can't see us

113
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:15,225
unless they're under the influence
of the vibrations.

114
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:17,387
That's why I had to destroy it.

- The Resonator. Pretorious' invention.

- BLOCH: Mmm-hmm.

00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:28,590
The pineal gland is oversized
and extending through the optic thalami.

147
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,566
Think the tumor is causing his delusions?

148
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,830
I don't think that's a tumor.

149
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:38,131
I think the pineal gland is growing.

150

That's impossible.

00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,504
I know, but the CAT scan bears it out.

152
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:44,274
The pineal stalk
is elongating through the brain.

153
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:47,442
Wait a minute.
I don't know from the inside of brains.

154
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,519
What does all this mean?

155
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,214
Well, it... It could mean
that the experiment they were performing

156
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,791
actually does stimulate the pineal.

157
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:56,723
You mean, he's not crazy?

158
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,095
I don't know.

159
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,926
He actually believes
that he saw these creatures.

160

That still doesn't explain
how Pretorious died,

By locking them up,

169
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:33,094
giving them drugs,
taking their lives away?

170
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,161
I can give him his life back.

171
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,128
I'll give you an expert opinion.

172
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:43,936
Crawford Tillinghast
is a classic paranoid schizophrenic

173
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,738
and a dangerous one.

174
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,746
If I can recreate the experiment,

175
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,817
then I can find out
what happened to Pretorious.

176
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:57,454
I'd like nothing better
than to lock this guy up.

177
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:59,684
I've got a dead man
with his head twisted off

178
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:03,024
covered in some shit
the pathologist can't even identify.

179
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,963
No other fingerprints found
except Tillinghast's,

180
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:09,160
no blood on the ax, no blood anywhere.

181
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:14,639
I wanna know
what the hell happened up there.

182
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:20,903
He's all yours.

183
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,889
You're my patient now, Dr. Tillinghast.

184
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,831
Thank you.

185
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,901
I'll call for an appointment.

186
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,666
No, no, no, wait a minute.

187
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:48,765
You've been released into my custody.
You'll have to come with me.

188
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,708
Where do you plan on taking me?

189
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:52,973
Back to the Pretorious house.

190
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,110
I want you to recreate your experiment.

191
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:58,782
No.

192
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,412
Look, you can either stay here
for the rest of your life,

193
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,458
or you can come with me.

194
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,995
That's not much of a choice, is it?

195
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,423
I believe you, Crawford.

196
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,592
I wanna see what you saw.

197
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,341
Hi. You must be Dr. McMichaels.

198
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,351
No, I'm Dr. McMichaels.

199
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,081
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

200
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,850
- Then you must be...
- This is Dr. Crawford Tillinghast.

201
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,221

(LAUGHING)

203
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:44,823
I'm Sergeant Buford Brownlee,
but my teammates call me Bubba.

204
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,233
I used to play pro football.

205
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:48,964
We were all crazy.

206
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:24,470
Not exactly cheery.

207
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:54,429
Sorry about that. Childproof lock.

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,818
Last stop. Everybody out.

210
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:55,095
Dr. Tillinghast,
would you care to show us around?

211
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:07,077
Doctor, if you're telling us the truth,
the only way to free yourself is to go back,

212
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,211
through this door.

213
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:38,513
Come on, Doc.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

214
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:41,511
Look, I'll show you.

215
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:03,461
See, what did I tell you?

216
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:04,698
(EX CLAIMS)

217
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:07,834
- Bubba, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

218
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:10,039
Electrical cables.

219
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,443
We needed more power
so I rewired the whole house.

220
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,183
Where are the circuit breakers, Doctor?

221
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:23,218
Doctor?

222
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,229
Tillinghast.

223
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,229
Damn it, we lost him.

224
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,133
He knows this place better than we do.

225
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,841
First thing's to find the power.

226
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:58,356
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

227
00:23:58,463 --> 00:24:01,398
I'll bet these cables lead to the Resonator.

228
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:04,161
First we find our missing mental patient.

229

Dr. Edward Pretorious.

- Is that how you hacked up Pretorious?
- That's where I hit it.

244
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:12,065
I knocked a fork off.

There.

There it is.

- What do you want me to do with him?
- Let him go.

248
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:20,005
- Are you crazy, too?
- He's reliving it, the night of the murder.

249
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:21,440
Let him go.

250
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:25,710
DA says you call the signals.

251
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:30,645
Yes.

252
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,050
Yes.

253
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,996
This is how it was.

254
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,735
That's where it ate him.

255
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,533
Wait a minute, what ate who?

256
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,372
We can start in the morning, Crawford.

257
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:00,950
I've started.

258
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:03,984
McMICHAELS: All right.

259
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,785
All this talking about eating
is making me hungry.

260
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,091
How about getting some dinner, huh?

261
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,163
Real danger here is starving.

262
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,200
Pretty, isn't she?

263
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,400
CRAWFORD: She's beautiful.

264
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,209
So how's it going, Doc?

265
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,804
Need some help?

266
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,509
He used to bring beautiful women here.

267
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:44,956
They'd eat fine meals, drink fine wine,
listen to music.

268
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,263
But it always ended with screaming.

269
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,495
And I would just lie there
and listen to them.

270
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:01,271
Screaming.

271
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:06,475
- Your boss had some screws loose.
- He was a genius.

272
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:14,518
It's just that the five senses
weren't enough for him. He wanted more.

273
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:20,517
Is it finished?

274
00:29:21,062 --> 00:29:22,552
Are we ready?

275
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:24,423
Yes.

276
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,339
I had to bypass the computer

277
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,545
because the magnetic field
erased the program.

278
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:41,640
And, of course,
the monitor is completely useless.

279
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:47,053
So the entire system
has to be manually operated.

280
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:50,125
And unfortunately the Resonator
was so severely damaged

281
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:53,992
that I had to convert it
to just an on/ off system.

282
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,033
When we reach 20,000 megahertz,
we throw this switch,

283
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:05,005
and a powerful magnetic field vibrates
these forks at a precise frequency.

284
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:08,440
Stimulating the pineal gland,
allowing us to see with it.

285
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:09,977
Listen to me.

286
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:14,944
Don't move when we're in the field
of the vibrations.

287
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:18,249
- McMICHAELS: Why?
- You move and they may see you.

288
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:21,518
It will see you.

289
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,115
What is this "it" anyway?

290
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:25,661
Pray you don't see for yourself.

291
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:28,789
Now, I'm staying right by this switch.

292
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:31,265
If it appears, I'm shutting down.

293
00:30:32,236 --> 00:30:34,670
Are you sure we're ready for this?

294
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:37,467
- Yes.
- CRAWFORD: No, please.

295
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:42,406
Remember, stay still.

332
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,476
Move toward me, my dear.
I want to see you.

333
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:05,780
- How...
- Did I survive?

334
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:08,921
I am the master here.

335
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,253
Is it...

336
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:16,347
Is it really you, Edward?

337
00:34:16,382 --> 00:34:17,529

Incredible creature.

351
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:23,293
It must have total bodily control
on a molecular level.

352
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,628
Yes, and Edward's mind.

353
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:29,101
He's become the thing that ate him.

354
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:31,399
Crawford, we saw the same things.

355
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:33,633
We've proved you're not insane.

356
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:36,905
- I'm not so sure.
- No.

357
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:39,742
You faced your fear and you overcame it.

358
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,678
You saved our lives.

359

Want some breakfast?

362
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:56,222
How can you eat after that?

363
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,934
Can't work without eating.

364
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:02,436
- What work?
- Well, I've got to record the results.

365
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:05,029
The pineal gland was stimulated.

366
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:09,271
- It gave me one hell of a headache.
- Expansion of the pineal.

367
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,948
I'll have to do a study
of the CAT scans of schizophrenics.

368
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:17,019
If there's a statistical correlation

369
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,351
between schizophrenia
and an enlarged pineal,

370
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:23,153
why, they may be seeing
or feeling what we saw.

371
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,491
Their minds may be influenced
by those creatures.

372
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,195
Well how about the hard-on I got?

373
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,098
Is there a statistical correlation
for that, too?

374
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:40,199
Well, we know that the pineal gland
helps to regulate the sex drive.

375
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:43,474
Perhaps pineal stimulation causes

376
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,481
an accompanying sexual stimulation.

377
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:49,647
There's so much to learn.

378
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:51,847
Well, we learned what we came for.

379
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:56,552
He ain't crazy
and that "it" ate Pretorious' head.

380
00:37:57,395 --> 00:38:00,660
They're gonna think we're crazy,
but that's their problem.

381
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:03,791
Well, we just have to try
the experiment again.

382
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,264
Did you say, "we"?

383
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:10,198
Katherine, you can't.

384
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:12,401
You don't mean
go back up there now, do you?

385
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,037
You always run an experiment twice,
to check the results.

386
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:19,982
Wait, now I saw it get to him, Katherine.

387
00:38:20,086 --> 00:38:22,748
Just exactly what you're feeling,
and it ruined him.

388
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:24,482
Pretorious.

389
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,151
Yes, I'd like to know more about him.

390
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,728
That Resonator is a work of genius.

391
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,362
Were we in the same nightmare?

392
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:38,995
I mean, didn't we just almost all
get eaten by an "it"?

393
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:42,404
All it takes is a hand on the switch.
If it appears, you make it disappear.

394
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:45,773
I got a better idea.
How about if we disappear out the door?

395
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:49,143
Don't you understand? This is the
greatest discovery since van Leeuwenhoek

396
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:51,217
first looked through a microscope
and saw an amoeba.

397
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:53,878
Yeah, but he wasn't down there
with the amoebas.

398
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:56,478
I have to find out
if the pineal gland is really the key.

399
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,924
Okay, fine. Fine, but not here, not now.

400
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,587
- Under controlled conditions.
- But we have control.

401
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,722
No one knows that Resonator
better than you do.

402
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:08,300
You're right.
And that's why no one is touching it.

He died in one.

408
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:27,577
They called his condition incurable.

409
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:32,084
They tried everything,
drugs, shock therapy, even surgery.

410
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:36,455
But they turned him into a vegetable.

411

01:12:12,444 --> 01:12:13,843
(SCREAMING)

664
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,549
God! Oh!

665
01:12:21,821 --> 01:12:24,153
Oh, help! Somebody help!

666
01:14:16,072 --> 01:14:17,437
(SCREAMING)

667
01:14:20,209 --> 01:14:22,508
Crawford, stop.

668
01:14:22,613 --> 01:14:25,377
Crawford, let me go. What are...

669
01:14:25,482 --> 01:14:27,177
Crawford, please.

670
01:14:28,118 --> 01:14:29,881
Crawford, stop.

671
01:14:31,021 --> 01:14:32,386
No.

672
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:36,151
Crawford. Oh, my... Don't.

673
01:14:36,259 --> 01:14:40,252
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I love you, Katherine.

674
01:14:40,364 --> 01:14:43,663
Crawford, we have to get out of here.
The Resonator's going to blow up.

675
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:46,497
- I want us to be together.
- Listen to me.

676
01:14:46,603 --> 01:14:49,629
I set a timing device on a bomb.
We only have a few minutes.

677
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,173
It doesn't matter.

678
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:56,235
If Pretorious can turn on that machine,
then he'll always have a way back here.

679
01:14:56,347 --> 01:14:57,815
He's always here.

680
01:14:58,316 --> 01:14:59,283
(GROANS)

681
01:15:06,991 --> 01:15:08,253
Don't you understand?

682
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:10,657
He won't just influence us, he'll devour us

683
01:15:10,762 --> 01:15:12,957
and the rest of the human race if he can.

684
01:15:13,064 --> 01:15:14,998
You're so beautiful.

685
01:15:15,099 --> 01:15:16,999
Please, Crawford.

686
01:15:18,236 --> 01:15:21,137
It won't hurt, I promise.

687
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:24,906

689
01:15:51,136 --> 01:15:53,731
Crawford, help me!

690
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:00,776
Katherine?

691
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:04,944
Welcome, my dear.

692
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:07,884
Oh, I've been waiting for you.

693
01:16:07,987 --> 01:16:09,386
Edward, no!

694
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:11,150
Yes.

695
01:16:11,257 --> 01:16:16,126
The greatest sensual pleasure there is
is to know the desires of another mind.

696
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:19,892
I know your desires, you impotent pig.

697
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:24,733
We are the most powerful being
in the universe.

698
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:29,435
She'll know, Edward,
how pathetic you are.

699
01:16:30,511 --> 01:16:32,536
How you can't make love.

700
01:16:32,646 --> 01:16:36,104
Maybe you could teach me.

701
01:16:40,988 --> 01:16:42,387
Crawford!

702
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:56,796
All right. Come and get me, eunuch.

703
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,404
This time I'm not running away.

704

(CRAWFORD YELLING)

717
01:19:40,106 --> 01:19:41,630
Katherine, run!

718
01:19:48,048 --> 01:19:49,948
Crawford!

719
01:19:52,452 --> 01:19:53,419

(GROANING)

724
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:16,100
There was a big explosion,
upstairs, at the top of the house.

725
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:18,303
(WHIMPERING)

726
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:33,683
I've called the fire department.
They'll get you to the hospital.

727
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,315
Oh, my, God.

728
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:38,258
What happened up there?

729
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,698
It... ate... him.
