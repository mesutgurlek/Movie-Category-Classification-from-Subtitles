the natives inside it.

in the ground
under the villages.

153
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,100
So they GPS the location,

154
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,978
bulldoze the homes,
and kill the natives.

155

and starve yourself?

00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,793
Because only a freshman
would speak with such insolence.

162
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,127
You can leave now.

163
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,888
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Go.

164
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,596
I said I'm sorry.

165
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,901
JONAH: Justine!

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,244
Alejandro takes his social
work very seriously.

167
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,663
You think?

168
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,240
Sorry. I'll try
and talk to him.

169
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,574
Don't bother!

170
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,244
Anyway, thanks for coming!

171
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,328
I mean it.

172

(EXHALES)

173
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,914
Hey.

174
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,210
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

175
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,133
I didn't mean
to be so flip.

176
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,209
Yes, you did.

177
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,631
Save it.

178
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,430
We need people who are
serious about making an impact.

179
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,132
Not making jokes.
(SCOFFS)

180
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,717
I am serious.

181
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,428
You're a serious student,
which is fine,

182
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,979
but it's really
not enough.

183
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,398
Well, maybe if you gave
someone a chance to learn,

184
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,317
your organization
might be more effective.

185
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,731
What's the cause you
care about the most?

186
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,407
I mean, they're
all important,

187
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,655
but what keeps
you up at night?

188
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,536
Women's rights in Africa.

189
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,832
But how can a white
girl from the suburbs

190
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,125
go to Africa and tell
a village that FGM is wrong?

191
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,582
Exactly.
I'll tell you how.

192
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,959
You organize a group
and you go there.

193
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,791
And you get
media attention.

194
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,547
Right or wrong,
you need cameras on them.

195
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,595
That's the only way
people change their behavior.

196
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,140
The threat of embarrassment.
You must shame them.

197
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,305
Show me how.

198
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,602
I think you're an
idealist, Justine,

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,899
and you have
good intentions.

200
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,189
But you're not
ready for this.

201
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,612
I am. Let me prove it.

202
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,656
ALEJANDRO: The villages
are here, here and here.

203
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,955
The development is going here.
A few miles from the Yajes.

204
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,000
Ten more miles and
the Yajes village is ruined.

205
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,999
And that's the end of
unmanned civilization.

206
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,163
Justine. Nice of you
to join us.

207
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,790
Late.

208
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,462
Sorry, I got off
at the wrong stop.

209
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,758
It's okay.

210
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,383
We leave Saturday.
We get in one day ahead.

211
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,591
So when the bulldozers arrive,
they're in for a surprise.

212
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,425
Who is behind
the development?

213
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,887
It's a private
corporation in Peru.

214
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,643
They hire ex-military to protect
them and to kill the natives.

215
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,566
So we're going to take on a
private militia with our phones?

216
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,521
No. But we're going
to scare them.

217
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,480
And the Peruvian
Government will notice.

218
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,951
Hi. Sorry. How are we
supposed to stream from the jungle?

219
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,869
ALEJANDRO: They have a satellite.

220
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,073
Our contact will
hack us in.

221
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,954
I have 15 sites
ready to stream

222
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,082
and an army of followers
to tweet when we're uploaded.

223
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,876
Once the construction knows
they're on camera,

224
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,254
everything changes.

225
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,260
Just watch.

226
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,761
Justine.

227
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,470
Are you sure you're here
for the right reasons?

228
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,899
Yeah.

229
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,859
Good.

230
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,194
Be careful. The jungle's
a dangerous place.

231
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,116
KAYCEE: This is crazy.

232
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,327
Are you going tree hugging
or bulldozer hugging?

233
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,708
We're staging a rally.

234
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,627
They're going to shoot you
and bury the bodies.

235
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,632
Well, then you can
watch my execution,

236
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,881
because we're going to be
streaming the whole thing.

237
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,633
I'm so watching that.

238
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,464
KAYCEE: This sounds insane.

239
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,970
You know there's always
a non-violent way to make your point.

240
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,301
It is non-violent.

241
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,803
It's not violent yet.

242
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,264
But trust me, these workers
see you fucking up their development,

243
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,144
it's gonna get ugly. Fast.

244
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,851

think about this?

Justine, I need some numbers.
Who are you going with?

248

It's a school trip,
Dad, I'll be fine.

to get vaccination tips.

254

about it?

doesn't mean

01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,676
Help!

989
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:22,017
I'm here! I'm still here!

990
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:47,790
JUSTINE: <i>All the other students
were killed in the crash.</i>

991
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:51,126
I stayed by the fire
as long as I could.

992
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,928
But by the next day,
it had burned out.

993
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,633
If it weren't
for those natives,

994
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:58,841
I'd be dead, too.

995
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,018
They heard the crash
and eventually they found me.

996
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:09,064
They fed me
and guided me out of the jungle.

997
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:12,071
They knew I was lost.

998
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:15,401
That I had accidently
landed in their backyard.

999
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:22,658
I never experienced
any anger or hostility.

1000
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,119
It was the opposite.

1001
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:32,091
I never felt afraid
when I was with them.

1002
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,091
Until the bulldozers
showed up

1003
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:38,640
and slaughtered
them like cattle.

1004
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:45,722
We're all very
proud of you, baby.

1005
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,728
You saved that village.

1006
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,776
DETECTIVE: These natives...

1007
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,692
The Yajes.
The Yajes. I'm sorry.

1008
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,316
Allegedly headhunters.
Cannibals.

1009
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:59,952
Did you ever see any of that sort
when you were there?

1010
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:04,366
Never once.

1011
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,581
ALEJANDRO: Justine!

1012
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,292
Justine!

1013
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:14,751
(GASPS)

1014
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:16,385
I made it.

1015
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:19,797
(SCREAMING)

1016
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,382
(GASPS)

1017
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:27,142
KAYCEE: Hey.

1018
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:28,974
Are you okay?

1019
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:32,026
Yeah, just a nightmare.

1020
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:41,904
MAN: Free Samara!
CROWD: (CHANTING) Let her go!

1021
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:56,627
Free Samara!
Let her go!

1022
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:58,674
Free Samara!
Let her go!

1023
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,885
Free Samara!
Let her go!

1024
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,757
JUSTINE: <i>Hello?</i>

1025
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:41,053
LUCIA: <i>Justine?</i>

1026
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:42,471
JUSTINE: <i>Who's this?</i>

1027
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:44,174
LUCIA: <i>My name is Lucia.</i>

1028
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:46,639
<i>I'm Alejandro's sister.</i>

1029
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:50,309
JUSTINE: <i>I'm really sorry.
I actually can't talk right now.</i>

1030
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,811
LUCIA: <i>I... I found
a satellite photo.</i>

1031
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,351
<i>It looks like my brother.</i>

1032
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,228
<i>We need to talk.</i>

1033
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,446
