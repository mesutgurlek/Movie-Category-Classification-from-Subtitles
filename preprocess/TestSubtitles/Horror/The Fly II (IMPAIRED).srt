And here we have our
1 1 -month-old child.

As you can see, his life cycle is
dramatically accelerated.

42

Now, these are aberrant chromosomes.

of genetic mutation.

These are all dormant, something
in addition to accelerated growth.

00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:39,930
And his non-genetic characteristics?
His learning abilities, for example.

46
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,725
He's got a photographic memory.

47

he consumes information.

some of his secrets died with him.

A stutter, you know, a hiccup.

192
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:09,085
A slight dislocation
of my physical life.

193

Not unpleasant, just a little
interruption of rhythm.

I thought I was in the same telepod.

than it ever did before.

I don 't know. It's possible that...

203
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:47,289
... the teleporter
somehow improved me.

204
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:50,963
In reassembling me, it might have
seen where things could be...

205
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:53,926
...improved theoretically,
and it did it.

-I said to leave me alone, Beth.

Talk to me.
I thought we were friends.

There was an unfortunate incident
in the specimens division last night.

328
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:26,284
Someone broke in
and caused some damage.

329

You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

No.

Of course, he's lying.

Really?

Come here, I want to
show you something.

342

You can't do that.

That's wonderful.
How did you do this?

357
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:31,366
I started from scratch.

358
00:43:31,853 --> 00:43:35,892
Trimble and the rest asked the wrong
questions, made the same mistakes.

359
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:39,205
They were too close to
the problem to see it clearly.

Scientific myopia.

361

They thought of it in terms of
methodology, of physics.

363

your eyes and admire. . .

What is this?

368
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:03,126
Just a little accident.

369
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,603
Well, it's getting all infected.

370
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:07,611
You'd better have it looked at.

371
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:11,772
I have to go now.

372
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:52,408
It's just an infection.

MARTIN:
Don't patronize me, Shepard!

374
00:46:54,693 --> 00:46:57,002
This is obviously not an infection.

375
00:46:57,253 --> 00:47:00,404
What's going to happen?
Will I lose my arm?

376
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:05,010
Of course not. Now this injection
will clear it up right away.

You're going to have to trust me.

Martin, what about the telepods?

647
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:52,535
You must tell me
what the magic word is.

The word is. . . .

649

It's a secret word.

650

Do you remember this room, Martin?

651
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:46,248
This is where you were born
the first time.

652
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:50,731
It's proper that this is the place
for your rebirth, don't you think?

653

You're growing so quickly, my boy.

I'm thrilled to have you back.

How it was naughty of you to run away.

660
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,088
I forgive you.

661
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:22,138
I should thank you. . .

with my telepods.

Don't ever forget that, Martin.

You're a magician,
not an escape artist.
