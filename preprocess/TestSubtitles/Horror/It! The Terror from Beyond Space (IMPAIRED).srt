00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,331
            WE FOUND IT NEAR    
         THE CHALLENGE 141,     

113
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,235
             THE DAY AFTER      
             WE FOUND YOU.      

114
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:44,638
        THERE'S ONLY ONE KIND OF
    A MONSTER THAT USES BULLETS.

115
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:10,497
THE SECOND                      
WE HIT EARTH,                   

116
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,433
I'M GONNA JUMP                  
THROUGH THAT AIR LOCK           

117
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,833
ALL THE WAY                     
TO THE GROUND.                  

118
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,336
THEN I'M GONNA ROLL AROUND AND  
STRETCH LIKE A CAT IN THE SUN.  

119
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,305
            OH, BOY,            
            THE SUN.            

120
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,541
     WE'LL BE 50 MILLION        
     MILES CLOSER TO IT.        

121
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:23,343
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID, I COULD  
 NEVER STAND BEING COLD.        

122
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:25,312
HOW'D YOU EVER WIN THE          
ARDMORE FELLOWSHIP              

123
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,746
IN LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS?     

124
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,449
I WORE LONG UNDERWEAR.          
                    HA HA HA.   

125
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,650
             AAH.               
THAT FIGURES.                   

126
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:31,952
WHAT DO YOU                     
LOOK FORWARD TO?                

127
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:32,786
                     GIRLS!     

128
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,854
                 OH, YOU!       

129
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:38,192
             I THINK I REMEMBER,
         A FASCINATING RESEARCH.

130
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,759
                 WON'T A        
                GEOLOGIST DO?   

131
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:42,196
 YOU'RE, UH, MILITARY           
     PROPERTY, ANN.             

132
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:43,630
             OCCUPIED TERRITORY.

133
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:46,032
EVERY TIME VAN                  
SEES YOU, HE FLOATS,            

134
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,234
 EVEN THOUGH THE                
SHIP IS EQUIPPED                

135
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:48,502
WITH ARTIFICIAL                 
GRAVITY.                        

136
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,270
         [Chuckling]            

137
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:52,072
     THESE DAYS, VAN SEEMS MORE 
     CONCERNED OVER A MANHUNT,  

138
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,507
     THAN A WOMAN HUNT.         

139
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:56,443
IT'S JUST THAT ERIC BELIEVES    
CARRUTHERS' STORY, I DON'T.     

140
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:59,496
     I DON'T BELIEVE IT,        
             NECESSARILY.       

141
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:00,730
            NOR DO I            
         DISBELIEVE IT.         

142
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,866
HOWEVER, ONE THING'S SURE:      
 HE DOES BELIEVE IT.            

143
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,169
 HE HAD TO FORCE HIMSELF TO     
 BELIEVE IT OR HE'D GO INSANE.  

144
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:09,906
         AND I DIDN'T           
         DO THAT, DID I?        

145
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,975
         MISSED YOUR DINNER,    
             COL. CARRUTHERS.   

146
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,044
         I'M TIRED OF           
     RUINING APPETITES.         

147
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,313
     I'D JUST LIKE A COFFEE,    
    IF I MAY, MISS ANDERSON.    

148
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,881
         OF COURSE,             
         COLONEL.               

149
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,284
         BETTER STAY HERE,      
             CARRUTHERS.        

150
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:21,985
                 JIMMY?         

151
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,053
    YEAH.                       

152
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,454
    HERE'S SOME LAST-MINUTE     
         COMPUTATIONS           

153
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,256
             ON ADJUSTING       
             THE ORBIT.         

154
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,657
         LOOK 'EM OVER WHEN     
            YOU GET A CHANCE.   

155
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,426
     YES, SIR.                  

156
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,535
BY THE TIME WE                  
REACH EARTH,                    

157
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,370
I'LL HAVE HIS                   
CONFESSION ON TAPE.             

158
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,764
        COL. CARRUTHERS!        

159
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:19,475
 THANK YOU.                     

160
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:25,681
SUCH A COLD, DESOLATE WORLD.    
    WE SAW SO LITTLE OF IT.     

161
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,351
         SOMETIMES I ALMOST     
         WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.   

162
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,023
I KILLED THEM OR I DIDN'T.      
IT WAS ME OR SOMETHING.         

163
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,292
         I'VE ONLY HEARD THE    
         STORY THROUGH VAN.     

164
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,094
NOW YOU'D LIKE TO               
HEAR MY VERSION?                

165
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:40,863
 ALL RIGHT.                     

166
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:45,969
     IT'S A LONG STORY,         
     BUT I'LL MAKE IT BRIEF.    

167
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,204
                     WE WERE ALL
             OUTSIDE THE SHIP,  

168
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:52,375
EXPLORING THE SOUTHERN TIP      
     OF SYRTIS MAJOR,           

169
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,178
SUDDENLY A SANDSTORM CAME UP    
 AND WE STARTED BACK.           

170
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,480
                 I WAS DRIVING  
                 THE JEEP.      

171
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:00,951
     THE SAND WAS SO THICK      
     WE COULD BARELY SEE.       

172
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,853
     WE WERE ALMOST BACK        
     TO THE SHIP WHEN...        

173
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:08,058
         CARTWRIGHT             
        JUST DISAPPEARED.       

174
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,861
 ONE MINUTE HE WAS THERE AND    
 THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS GONE.   

175
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:14,297
    AS IF SOMETHING HAD JUST    
 PLUCKED HIM OUT OF THE JEEP    

176
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:18,201
 LIKE...CANDY OUT OF A BOX.     

177
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:24,174
     WE HEARD A WEIRD           
        SORT OF SOUND.          

178
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,676
         THEN WE THOUGHT        
     WE SAW A DARK SHAPE        

179
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:31,214
     RUNNING NEAR THE JEEP      
 AND STARTED SHOOTING AT IT.    

180
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,748
     A FEW MOMENTS LATER,       

181
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:36,819
         KENNER AND ALL         
     THE REST WERE GONE.        

182
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:41,358
     I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO     
    MADE IT BACK TO THE SHIP.   

183
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,160
                 WHEN THE       
            SANDSTORM QUIT, I...

184
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,329
                 WENT OUT AND   
             SEARCHED ALL OVER. 

185
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:47,030
                 THERE WASN'T   
                 A SIGN OF THEM.

186
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:50,700
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN             
THE BULLET HOLE                 
IN THE SKULL?                   

187
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,503
        WE WERE ALL SHOOTING    
            AT THIS THING...    

188
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:57,941
         MAYBE THE ONE WHO GOT  
         THE BULLET WAS LUCKY.  

189
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,878
            YOU DON'T BELIEVE   
             ME, DO YOU?        

190
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,913
I DON'T DISBELIEVE YOU.         

191
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,785
            HOW ABOUT YOU,      
             LIEUTENANT?        

192
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:12,588
                 MARS IS ALMOST 
                AS BIG AS TEXAS,

193
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:18,861
                     MAYBE IT'S 
                 GOT MONSTERS.  

194
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,597
CARRUTHERS IS STILL TALKING     
ABOUT HIS MONSTERS?             

195
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,799
         WHY DON'T YOU STOP     
         BAITING HIM, VAN?      

196
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,202
         YOU'RE NOT USING YOUR  
         AUTHORITY VERY WELL.   

197
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,105
I'M NOT DOING IT FOR KICKS.     
BELIEVE ME, CHICKEN.            

198
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,640
I'M JUST PLAYING                
THE ODDS.                       

199
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,410
            YOUR ODDS, BECAUSE  
         YOU THINK HE'S GUILTY. 

200
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:39,315
    ADMITTED.                   

201
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,717
BUT, ANNE, THERE'S A TIME       
FACTOR INVOLVED HERE.           

202
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:43,619
HE'S UNSTABLE                   
RIGHT NOW.                      

203
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,321
IF I CRACK HIS STORY,           
I CAN TURN HIM OVER             

204
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,091
TO THE COURT-MARTIAL TIED       
UP IN A LITTLE PINK RIBBON.     

205
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,226
            WHAT IF HE'S DONE   
         NOTHING TO CONFESS?    

206
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:51,861
THEN HE WON'T.                  

207
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,531
BUT I OWE IT TO THE LIVES       
OF THOSE 9 MEN WHO DIED         

208
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:55,831
TO TRY AND                      
FIND OUT.                       

209
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,267
            DON'T YOU OWE IT    
             TO CARRUTHERS      

210
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,169
             TO TREAT HIM AS    
            A FELLOW OFFICER,   

211
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,970
             NOT AS AN ANIMAL?  

212
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,073
DO YOU THINK                    
HE'S INNOCENT?                  

213
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,007
            I DON'T KNOW.       

214
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,410
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE,      
     OR FOR YOU, VAN.           

215
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,653
    OK, CHICKEN. I'LL LET UP    
        ON THE THIRD DEGREE.

     DO WITH THOSE?             

335
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,713

00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:12,745
BUT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING       
ELSE WE COULD DO.               

341
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,113
             WE COULD'VE TRIED. 

342

GINO WAS PAST HELP--            

343
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:24,590
             WE SHOULD'VE TRIED.

344
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:27,160
SOONER OR LATER, HE'S GOTTA     
     COME OUT OF THE DUCT.      

345
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:30,780
RIGHT INTO                      
THE GRENADES.

BUT YOU HAVE TO REST.

00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:54,169
                DO YOU KNOW WHAT
         HAPPENED TO KIENHOLZ?  

349
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,005
 EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY         
     MUST BE BROKEN.            

350
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:59,241
     I'M NOT SURE THAT'S        
     WHAT KILLED HIM.           

351
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:01,711
 THAT SHRIVELED-UP EFFECT...    

352
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:06,181
     I'LL HAVE TO DO            
        AN AUTOPSY.             

353
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:12,137
                 WHAT IS THAT   
             THING DOWN THERE?  

354
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:16,008
     CARRUTHERS?                

355
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,610
             WHAT IS IT?        

356
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:19,679
    DO YOU KNOW WHAT            
 IT IS, CARRUTHERS?             

357
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,046
                     NO.        

358
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:22,515
         I HAVE A THEORY        

359
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,817
         BASED ON WHAT YOU      
         AND JACK TOLD ME.      

360
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:27,854
YOU SAY IT'S MAN-SHAPED,        
        HUMANOID.               

361
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:30,890
     PERHAPS THERE WAS ONCE     
     A CIVILIZATION ON MARS.    

362
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:36,629
         IT ENDED. DISEASE,     
        WAR, SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

363
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:39,231
 THE MARTIANS THAT WERE LEFT    
     WENT BACK TO BARBARISM.    

364
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,684
             SAVAGE MURDERERS.  

365
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:49,391
             MAYBE THAT'S WHAT  
             WE'VE GOT ON BOARD.

366
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:55,164
     BOB?                       

367
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:58,234
I WAS ONLY 3 FEET               
AWAY FROM HIM.                  

368
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:01,637
HE WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD,        
TRYING TO WARN ME.              

369
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:05,274
I WAS THAT CLOSE AND            
I COULDN'T HELP HIM.            

370
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:08,543
 INSTEAD I RAN.                 

371
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:12,281
 WHY DON'T YOU                  
 HATE ME, TOO?                  

372
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:15,851
AT LEAST CARRUTHERS DID         
WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.      

373
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,188
IF ANYBODY DID A WRONG          
THING, IT WAS ME.               

374
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:23,325
BUT PLEASE BELIEVE ME,          
WE COULDN'T OF SAVED HIM.       

375
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:27,329
GINO KNEW THAT.                 
GINO KNEW THAT HIMSELF.         

376
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:32,334
I DON'T BLAME CARRUTHERS, YOU,  
 I DON'T BLAME ANYBODY.         

377
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:34,703
                 IT'S JUST THAT 
                HE'S DOWN THERE.

378
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:43,128
HOW COULD THAT THING            
HAVE GOTTEN ABOARD?             

379
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:45,364
            AND WHY?            
        JUST TO KILL US?        

380
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:48,668
        WHAT IS THE USUAL REASON
 AN INTELLIGENT CREATURE KILLS. 

381
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:50,302
             IT'S HUNGRY?

         ANY DINOSAURS ON MARS, 

397
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:11,530
 THE GRENADES WOULD             
 TAKE CARE OF THEM,
