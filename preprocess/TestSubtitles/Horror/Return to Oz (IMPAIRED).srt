Can't you sleep?

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,832
It's past 1:00 in the morning, Dorothy.

3
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,136
- Aunt Em?
- What, precious?

4
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:39,256
I wish I could put my head on my paws
and go to sleep like Toto.

5
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,343
AUNT EM: Soon you will.

6
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,222
I just can't see payin' out money
for this doctor when we don't have any.

7
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,558
Garnet said she'd loan it to us.

8
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,810
Garnet. That's charity, Em.

9
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,387
She's my sister.
It's family, not charity.

since the tornado,

and Dorothy hasn't been herself since.

12
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm takin' her to Cottonwood Falls
tomorrow and see if she can be helped.

13
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,492
All she ever talks about
is someplace that just doesn't exist.

14
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,737
Talkin' tin men, walkin' scarecrows,

Aunt Em, look! A key from Oz!

32
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,831
It's just a key to the old house
before the tornado.

- I must've turned it a thousand times.
- No, look, Aunt Em.

It's proof. "O-Z." Oz.

- My friends sent it on a shooting star.

'Cause it's just my imagination.

I know you don't want
to go to the doctor's.

41
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,363
But you just haven't slept the night
right through since the tornado.

He broke his leg, Aunt Em.

65

Giddap.

66
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:42,243
I've never been past Franklin before.

67
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:12,533
The tin woodsman used to be made
of flesh, like everybody else,

68
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,442
but then he cut off his leg.

69
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,028
He had a tin leg made,

70
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,707
but then a witch enchanted his ax,

71
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:25,213
and he kept on cutting off the other parts
of his body, until he was all made of tin.

72
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:28,716
- Even his head was...
- That's all right, Dorothy.

73
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:31,626
You mentioned something about a tiger.

74
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,764
A lion. A cowardly lion.

75
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:39,300
And he could talk too,
like the scarecrow and the tin man?

76
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,470
Yes, all the animals in Oz could talk.

77
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,400
Just how did you get back from Oz?

78
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,393
With my ruby slippers.

79
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,979
Uh-huh. And exactly

80
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,981
how did that work?

81
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,944
You put them on
and you click the heels three times,

82
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,489
and then you said,
"There's no place like home."

83
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,244
Dorothy, where are those slippers now?

84
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:10,957
Dorothy?

85
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,961
I lost them.

86
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,674
They fell off on the way back.

87
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:28,442
Well, I think I know just the thing

88
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,144
to cheer Dorothy up.

89
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:40,162
This electrical marvel will make
it possible for you to sleep again.

90
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:46,002
And it will also get rid of
all those bad waking dreams

91
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,953
that you've been telling me about.

92
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,633
Now, this fellow here has a face.

93
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,177
Do you see it?

94
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:58,671
Here are his eyes,
and this must be his nose,

95
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,883
and this must be his mouth.

96
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,053
But what's this? Dorothy?

97
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:12,143
Why, it's his tongue!

98
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,030
Isn't it?

99
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,399
- Will it hurt?
- No, no!

100
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:22,204
It just manages electrical current.

101
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:26,709
Now, your aunt already knows
that we are at the dawn of a new age.

102
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,546
In just two months,
it will be the year 1900.

103
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:35,083
A new century. The 20th century.

104
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,545
A century of electricity.

105
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,508
The brain itself is an electrical machine.
It's nothing but a machine.

106
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:48,346
When it malfunctions,
a blow to the head, for example,

107
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:51,901
then the brain produces
useless excess currents.

108
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:57,522
These excess currents
are our dreams and delusions.

109
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,779
And we have found out that
sometimes the brain malfunctions.

110
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:08,074
Just like the dreams
that you have, Dorothy.

111
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,881
Now we have the means
to control these excess currents.

112
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,206
Yes.

113
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,626
Fine.

114
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,939
I must get back to Henry
before nightfall.

115
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,806
You understand, don't you?

116
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,071
Here's your lunch pail. I was thinking
we'd only stay a short time.

117
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:40,607
That won't be necessary.
We have excellent meals here.

118
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,821
Now, be a good girl,

119
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,242
and do everything the doctor
and the head nurse tell you,

120
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,796
and I'll be back tomorrow

121
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,331
and we'll go home!

122
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:01,053
I've never left her
out of my sight among strangers.

123
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,755
She's in good hands.

124
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,560
Will you bring Toto
when you come to get me?

125
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,764
I will. Yes, of course I will.

126
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,001
You won't need that!

127
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:00,321
You stay here until
we come and get you.

128
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:04,732

Why did they bring you here, Dorothy?

00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:58,286
Because I can't sleep.

- To do what you told me, Miss Wilson.

Then lie down.

Why do you have to tie me down?

00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:31,967
Pretty soon they'll draw all those
unpleasant dreams out of your head.

Ah. Hmm.

210
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,595
How big is this pond anyway?

211
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:11,130
I don't think it's a pond, Billina.

212
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,515
- I guess it is a pond.
- Told you so.

213
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:27,114
Where did all the rest of the water go?

Where did Kansas go?

215
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,596
This is some place for a chicken coop.

216
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:57,009
When did you learn to talk? I thought
hens could only cluck and cackle.

Strange, ain't it? How's my grammar?

218
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:05,527
If we were in the Land of Oz,
your talking wouldn't be strange at all.

(CLUCKS) There goes the water.

Hmm.

223
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:29,468
- Maybe this is Oz!
- Oz?

224
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,890
Well, I think I'll have a look around and
see if I can find myself some breakfast.

225
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,590
Wait!

226
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:42,930
If this is the Land of Oz,
then this is the Deadly Desert.

227
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,433
Deadly Desert?

228
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:53,074
It surrounds Oz. Last time
I flew over it in the old house.

229
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:57,412
Anything living that touches it
turns to sand.

230
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,738
Just my luck.

231
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,618
If we stay on these stones,
we'll be all right.

232
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:09,915
BILLINA: Careful.

233
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,130
Careful.

234
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:24,138
One, two, three!

235
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,932
There.

236
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:32,239
- Now, let's find something for breakfast.
- It's about time.

237
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:37,118
Then we can go on to the Emerald City
and see my friend the Scarecrow.

238
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:40,487
- Scarecrow?
- He's the King of Oz, Billina.

239
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:51,758
Look, Billina. It's a lunch pail tree.

240
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,460
What happened to breakfast?

241
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,797
Now I know we're in Oz.

242
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,511
Now, make sure
you don't pick a green one.

243
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,348
There's some ripe ones.

244
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,607
This one for now,
and this other one for later.

245
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,955
Come share my lunch with me, Billina.

246
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:24,823
Just a minute.
Nice couple of worms here.

247
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:28,035
I wonder what's inside.

00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:42,017
And a ham sandwich?

250
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:44,436
I'm glad it's not fried chicken.

251
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,105
Oh, Billina, we're back in Oz!

252
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:52,059
Now I can show you all the people
and things that nobody would believe in.

253
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,234
Your Majesty, she has returned to Oz.

254
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:04,696
Good. Keep an eye on her.

255
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:09,961
What's the matter? What is it?

256
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,006
She has a chicken with her!

257
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:15,332
A chicken!

258
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:21,723
BILLINA: Where are all your friends?
Where is everybody?

259
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:26,186
I don't know, Billina. Oz is pretty big.

260
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:29,096
I don't like it. Makes me nervous.

261
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,958
Billina, this is our old house!

262
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:01,096
The one the tornado blew away!

263
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:05,924
- This is how I got to Oz the first time.
- Looks like it was a rough trip.

264
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,446
Billina, this used to be my bedroom.

265
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,148
And in there was the kitchen.

266
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,114
That's where we landed on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

267
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:34,421
- Wicked Witch?
- But where are all the Munchkins?

268
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:37,497
What are you on about, my dear?

269
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:42,169
Oh, no.

270

- Oh, no!
- It's just a yellow brick.

00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,945
No, Billina, you don't understand.

272
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:02,490
This was the Yellow Brick Road.

273
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,692
It leads to the Emerald City!

they have discovered
the Yellow Brick Road

280
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:43,907
and are on their way
to the Emerald City.

Well, Billina,
that was the Emerald City.

- BILLINA: Not moving very fast, are they?
- They've all been turned to stone.

to see a bunch of stiffs.

to do now, Dorothy?

327
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:25,595
What is it?

328
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:30,558
I don't know.

329
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,211
"The Royal Army of Oz."

330
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:51,881
Army? It's just a bunch of old junk,

331
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,250
like the copper kettle
in the yard back home.

332
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:03,133
Look! Billina, some directions.

333
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:11,391
(DOROTHY READING)

334
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:18,356
"For thinking,
wind number one under left arm.

335
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:23,236
"For speaking,
wind number two under right arm.

336
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:29,377
"For walking and action,
wind number three, middle of back.

337
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:35,540
"Guaranteed to work perfectly
for 1,000 years."

338
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:37,584
You don't believe that, do you?

339
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:40,920
I don't know.
I'll wind him up and we'll see.

340
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:44,299
I'll wind up his thinking first.

341
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,512
(TICKING)

342
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,312
I wonder what he's thinkin' about.

343
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,567
I'll wind up his speech,
and maybe he can tell us.

344
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:11,085
Maybe he can tell us
what happened to the Emerald City.

345
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:13,370
(STAMMERING)

346
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:18,291
- Good morning, little girl.
- Good morning, sir.

347
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:22,420
Are you Dorothy Gale?

348
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:25,183
- Yes, sir.
- Pleased to meet you.

349
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,477
I am Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz.

350
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:32,815
His Majesty, the Scarecrow, locked me
in here and told me to wait for you.

351
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:36,110
What happened to the Emerald City?
Where is the Scarecrow?

352
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,948
I do not know. Suddenly everything
living began to turn to stone.

353
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:45,870
When you did not arrive,
I called for help until my voice ran down.

354
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,624
Then I paced back and forth
until my action ran down.

355
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:53,461
Then I stood and thought
until my thought ran down.

356
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:59,300
After that, I remember nothing
until you wound me up. Thank you.

357
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,137
You're welcome.
It was Billina who found the key.

358
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:06,464
- Billina?
- Over here.

359
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,103
Good morning, Mrs. Hen. Where
did you find the key for this place?

360
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:14,649
- Over near the hog trough.
- Hog trough?

361
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,860
- In Kansas.
- Kansas?

362
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,988
The Scarecrow must have
sent it to you somehow.

363
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:25,743
If you don't mind, Mr. Tok,
I'll wind up your action.

364
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:31,749
That would please me very much.
And you may call me Tik-Tok.

365
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,086
Why weren't you turned to stone
just like everybody else?

366
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:39,465
Because I am not alive
and never will be, thank goodness.

367
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:40,633
Hmm.

368
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:45,179
Well, Tik-Tok, the first thing we have
to do is to escape from the Wheelers.

369
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:49,558
They're outside, and said they're going
to throw us into the Deadly Desert.

370
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:53,428
From now on, I will be
your obedient servant.

371
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:57,566
If you keep me wound up.

372
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:03,229
Make sure my think-works are
extra tight, and I will formulate a plan.

373
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,338
Hmm.

374
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:21,623
Lunch pail.

375
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:26,252
These Wheelers can be tricky customers.

376
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:00,537
Oh, my goodness.

377
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,890
You run up the stairs.
I will take care of them.

378
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,493
Come here!

379
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:51,421
You'll be sorry for treating me like this!
I'm a terrible person!

380
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:58,229
I am only a machine, so I cannot be sorry
or happy, no matter what happens.

381
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,316
Where's the Scarecrow?
What's happened to the Emerald City?

382
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,819
Answer her!

383
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:08,614
- Answer her!
- The Nome King!

384
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:11,742
He conquered the Emerald City.
He took all the emeralds.

385
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,653
- He turned everyone to stone.
- What about the Scarecrow?

386
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,546
There's only one person
that knows where the Scarecrow is.

387
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:28,666
And that's Princess M... M... Mom...

388
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,263
- Princess Mombi!
- Princess Mombi?

389
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,891
- I don't remember her.
- Take us to Mombi.

390
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:39,177
No! No! No!

391
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:46,694
WHEELER: Please, let me go.
Please! Please let me go.

392
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:50,030
Please let me go! Let me go!

393
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,242
- All right, Tik-Tok. Let him go.
- Behave yourself, now.

394
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:56,569
I will behave. I'll behave!

395
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:00,541
Behave!

396
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,825
(MANIC LAUGHTER)

397
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,039
I'll be...

398
00:41:11,443 --> 00:41:13,628
You behave!

399
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,384
Hello?

400
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,433
What a mess!

401
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,562
Come on, Tik-Tok.

402
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,823
This Mombi is some housekeeper.

403
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:53,543
I think it is up these stairs, Dorothy.

404
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:03,678
(♪ MANDOLIN)

405
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:49,223
Excuse me, miss,
but are you Princess Mombi?

406
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:53,478
Help me to rise.

407
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:10,244
I think I'll put on
something more appropriate.

408
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:14,665
Come with me.
Your friends can stay here.

409
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,878
We're really looking for the Scarecrow.

410
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:56,249
I think number four will do
for this afternoon.

411
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,500
What do you think?

412
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,369
I think you're very beautiful.

413
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:36,090
I should hope so.

414
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,719
And just who might you be?
What are you doing here?

415
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:43,087
I'm Dorothy Gale.

416
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,225
Dorothy Gale?

417
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:48,811
What's happened to the Scarecrow?

418
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:50,887
Come nearer to me.

419
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:59,279
The Nome King took the Scarecrow and
all the emeralds back to his mountain.

420
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:01,814
And turned everyone else to stone.

421
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,414
You will be rather attractive one day.

422
00:45:08,514 --> 00:45:10,999
Not at all beautiful, you understand,

423
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,961
but you have a certain prettiness.

424
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:17,496
Different from my other heads.

425
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:22,845
I believe I'll lock you in the tower
for a few years till your head is ready.

426
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:26,422
- And then I'll take it.
- I believe you will not!

427
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:28,883
Tik-Tok!

428
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,354
Billina!

429
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:34,722
I am coming, Dorothy.

430
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,902
Do not worry. I will save you.

431
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,188
You, I'll have fried for breakfast!

432
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,358
- Tik-Tok, help me!
- Stop!

433
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:51,614
Oh, dear. My action has run down.

434
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:54,835
This is too bad.

435
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:58,756
My fight with the Wheelers
made me run down faster than usual.

436
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,083
It can't be helped, Tik-Tok.

437
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,096
What will you do with Tik-Tok?

438
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,631
People will think I have a new statue.

439
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,310
Ha.

440
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,731
The Nome King's mountain.

441
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:03,144
If this is Oz, Dorothy, I'd rather
take my chances back in Kansas.

442
00:47:05,547 --> 00:47:08,742
- Billina...
- What?

443
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:14,697
- If only we could just fly away, like you.
- Only in my younger days, my dear.

444
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,315
MAN: Mom?

445
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,193
Mom?

446
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,572
Mom, is that you?

447
00:47:59,768 --> 00:48:02,296
No.

448
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,673
- I'm Dorothy Gale.
- Oh.

449
00:48:04,773 --> 00:48:08,802
For a second there,
I thought my mom had come back.

450
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:12,306
What is this, a man or a melon?

451
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:15,976
A pumpkin, if you please.
My name's Jack.

452
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:18,979
Jack Pumpkinhead.

453
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,315
May I ask a favor of you, Dorothy?

454
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:24,850
Would you please check my head
for signs of spoiling?

455
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:33,192
Any soft spots?

456
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,375
- How does it feel?
- Very nice, sir.

457
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:43,837
Thank you.
I've been alive such a short while,

458
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:47,925
and I'm afraid of spoiling
before I've seen anything of the world.

459
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,877
Could you put some of the rest of me
together again?

460
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:55,849
- Mmm-hmm.
- If you can just tie that arm on.

461
00:48:55,949 --> 00:49:00,052
And then, my other leg
has fallen off too.

462
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:06,693
Are you sure you're not my mom?

463
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:09,061
I'm sure, Jack.

464
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:14,618
Well, my mother built me to scare
that awful witch, Mombi.

465
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:19,572
She stood me in a place where
Mombi would meet me, face-to-face.

466
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,742
And along she came.
Sure enough, she was scared.

467
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:28,256
But then, she was angry.
She has a terrible temper.

468
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,550
I know.

469
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,137
Where did she get
all those different heads?

470
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:37,339
Did you see the headless
dancing girls outside?

471
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:40,727
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's where she got them.

472
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:44,731
Anyway, Mombi was about
to destroy me with her stick.

473
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:49,935
But she decided to test some powder
of life she'd just bought from a magician.

474
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,074
She did.

475
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,952
It worked.

476
00:49:57,052 --> 00:49:59,278
Here I am!

477
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:03,083
Powder of life?

478
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:07,671
You sprinkle it on something
and the thing comes to life.

479
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,840
Does Mombi have any more of it?

480
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,044
If she does, it's in cabinet 31,
with her original head.

481
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:19,516
BILLINA: What happened to your mother?

482
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,352
She vanished. Mombi enchanted her.

483
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,439
After that, she threw me in this corner

484
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,941
and said she was gonna make
a pie out of me.

485
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:30,318
But she was wearing head 22 at the time

486
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,987
and must not have worn it since,

487
00:50:32,087 --> 00:50:33,947
because she hasn't remembered
I'm up here.

488
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:36,398
Jack, Billina, listen!

489
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:38,400
Here's what we have to do.

490
00:50:53,108 --> 00:50:54,917
Oh!

491
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,215
- Is that Tik-Tok?
- Mm-hm.

492
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:23,529
Dorothy?

493
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:25,281
Sh.

494
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,199
Oh.

495
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:32,371
(WHISPERING) Dorothy,
may I call you Mom, even if it isn't so?

496
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:36,009
Oh!

497
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,876
Thank you.

498
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:45,852
Tik-Tok, are you listening?

499
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:48,355
Don't say anything.

500
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,472
This is Jack.

501
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,534
After I'm finished winding you up,

502
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:04,871
go upstairs with him
and we'll explain what you have to do.

503
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:07,614
(WINDING)

504
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:15,331
- Did you understand all that, Tik-Tok?
- I understand it better than you do.

505
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:37,478
(SNORING)

506
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:51,560
- Good. Go and get the head, Jack.
- Yes, sir!

507
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,952
- Billina, where's that cord?
- (SQUAWKING)

508
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,167
- Over here, Billina.
- (GROANS)

509
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,138
That's it.

510
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:05,765
(CLUCKS) What's that?

511
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:08,467
The head of a Gump.

512
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,806
(SNORING)

513
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:33,700
(SNORTS)

514
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:38,038
(SNORING CONTINUES)

515
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:48,850
Here's a broom, Tik-Tok.

516
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,853
It'll make a great tail.

517
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:54,856
Excellent. Now we must Gump the head
in the front

518
00:53:54,956 --> 00:53:56,983
and tie Jack's feet together.

519
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:00,352
Right. Tie my feet together.

520
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:03,730
Bring that mantelpiece to the desk,
and anoint the palms!

521
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,775
Right. Anoint the palm!

522
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,330
That is right, Jack. Left, right, wrong.

523
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,207
What are you talking about?

524
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:16,002
Little girls, pumpkinheads
make chicken fly the coop.

525
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:17,244
Coop?

526
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:40,434
(GULPS)

527
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,932

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,104
Dorothy Gale!

531
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,195
Dorothy Gale!

532
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,271
Where's my powder of life?

533
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:15,237
- Mombi's awake!
- Oh, no!

534
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:18,824
- It's not finished!
- (CLUCKING) Tik-Tok went berserk!

535
00:56:19,017 --> 00:56:22,536
- Tickle, tickle me!
- His brain's ran down.

536
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:26,248
If his brain's ran down,
how could he talk?

537
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:28,968
It happens to people all the time, Jack.

538
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:32,389
Tie the palm leaves to the sofa, quick!
Billina, help him!

539
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,350
- We need another cord!
- Well, hurry!

540
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,103
Thank goodness, Dorothy.
I am all right now.

541
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:40,313
Go to the door and look out for Mombi.

542
00:56:40,413 --> 00:56:42,431
All right, Dorothy.

543
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:49,605
Make sure you do the head,
so it can see where it's going.

544
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:01,376
- It's not working!
- There must've been some magic words.

545
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:04,421
- What were they? Think!
- Think?

546
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,547
You've got to remember!

547
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,675
I wasn't alive then.
How can I remember?

548
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:12,044
Read the directions, Dorothy!

549
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:15,265
- I don't know these words!
- Read them anyway.

550
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,549
"Weaugh, teaugh,

551
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,593
"peaugh."

552
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:22,220
- Peaugh?
- That's it!

553
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:26,224
Hurry!

554
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,320
I'll stop you!

555
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,614
She is coming!

556
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,200
Jack, go help Tik-Tok get aboard.
Billina, get in!

557
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,952
- Wait for me!
- A chicken?

558
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,289
- Can you flap your wings?
- I don't have any wings.

559
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,375
- Now you do!
- I guess you're right, I do!

560
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:45,378
- Jump up, Tik-Tok!
- Help me up, Dorothy!

561
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:50,082
- Easy, is it?
- MOMBI: Dorothy Gale!

562
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,927
So!

563
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:55,796
- Fly, fly!
- Wait for me.

564
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,049
Jack! Jack!

565
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,551
Stop!

Fly! Fly!

569
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,027
We did it!

570
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:31,206
- Help me!
- Hold on, Jack!

571
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:34,469
Here, Jack, give me your hand.

572
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:36,586
Tik-Tok, will you help me pull?

573
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:40,725
Wake up! Wake up, all of you! Get up!
(SCREAMING)

574
00:58:40,825 --> 00:58:43,895
Get up! Wake up! Look!

575
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:46,898
Dorothy Gale is escaping!

576
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:49,526
Go and get them back for me! Hurry up!

577
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,237
All of you! Go on!

578
00:58:52,337 --> 00:58:55,856
And make sure
you bring back that chicken!

579
00:58:57,216 --> 00:59:00,527
Don't come back without them!

580
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:08,628
The last thing I remember
is walking through the forest

581
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:11,204
and hearing a loud noise.

582
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:15,843
And now, here I am,
flying through the air.

583
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:18,638
What am I anyway?

584
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:21,432
You're just a thing

585
00:59:21,532 --> 00:59:23,434
with a Gump's head on it.

586
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,645
We built you and brought you to life

587
00:59:25,745 --> 00:59:29,315
so that you could take us to
the Nome King to rescue the Scarecrow.

588
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:33,736
I may not last very long.
I don't feel too well put together.

589
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,863
Oh, don't say that.

590
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:40,410
How do we know where to land?
It's awful dark down there.

591
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,195
The Nome King's mountain
was straight ahead.

592
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:46,364
I think.

593
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:50,878
The best thing to do is
to keep flying until dawn.

594
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:54,048
Then maybe we can find
a safe place to land.

595
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:56,050
Good idea, Tik-Tok.

596
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,262
Mr. Gump? Can you just
keep flying straight ahead?

597
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,380
(CHUCKLING) I don't think
I could turn if I wanted to.

598
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:07,385
Why don't we just fly back to Kansas?

599
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,058
Whatever happens,

600
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,020
I'm awfully sleepy right now.

601
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,943
And I'm just glad I have
my own head to be sleepy with.

602
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:30,116
(WHISPERING) Good night, Mom.

603
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:32,587
Mmm.

604
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:35,205

Nobody's going to help you.

608

Nobody knows where you are.

609
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,447
There's nobody left
who even knows who you are.

610
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,634
- What are they?
- Wheelers.

611
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:36,859
Mr. Gump, can't you fly any faster?

612
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,728
Not unless one of you wants to jump off.

613
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:41,146
Oh.

614
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:44,649
Tik-Tok, you're the heaviest.

Mom! Wake up! (WHINING)

622
01:02:53,452 --> 01:02:55,354
What's happening?

623
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:58,733
- The ropes are breaking.
- Oh, no!

624
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,810
I knew it! We're gonna fall apart.

625
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:05,865
Are we gonna land now, Mom?

626
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:08,900

- I'll get it!

628

I know how to do this.

Abandon ship!

645
01:04:19,246 --> 01:04:22,682
If I had a stomach, I know I'd be sick.

646
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:35,288
I'm sorry, Mom!

647
01:04:35,388 --> 01:04:37,331
It's all right, Jack!

648
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:39,532
It can't be helped now!

(BILLINA SQUAWKING, CLUCKING)

650
01:04:55,449 --> 01:04:58,436
Hmm. That was a novel
experience, wasn't it?

651
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:00,938
- Pick me up!
- Tik-Tok!

652
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:04,233
Pick me up. Pick me up.

653
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,737
Pick me up. Pick me up.

654
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,156
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

655
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:12,158
Jack, are you all right?

656
01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:16,120
Why are all of you
standing on your heads?

657

Where are we, anyway?

658
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,099
The Nome King's mountain.

(GROANS) Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,689
Tik-Tok, you've got to be more careful.

663
01:05:57,928 --> 01:06:01,832
Yes, Your Majesty? You called?

664
01:06:01,932 --> 01:06:05,118
NOME KING: What is that noise
going on up there?

665
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:11,509
I don't know, Your Majesty.

Well, find out!

JACK: What about the Gump?
He's all in pieces.

668

GUMP: And good riddance.

669
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,218
I'm much happier just being a head.

670
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:27,441
We should tie him back on the sofa.
Then, at least, he could walk.

671
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,434
Oh, no!

672
01:06:30,002 --> 01:06:33,781
Every head must have a body
if it expects to get around.

673
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:37,326
Doesn't look like there's much
of anyplace to get around to.

674
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:42,665
She escaped from Mombi somehow
and crossed the Deadly Desert.

675
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:47,869
Now she is on our mountain
with a small army.

676
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:51,465
NOME KING: She is more powerful
than I thought.

677
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:53,666
What about the chicken?

678
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:59,088
There's no sign of the chicken.

679
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:04,645
This is terrible.
Suppose I meet another Gump.

680
01:07:04,745 --> 01:07:08,149
I'd die a second time, of embarrassment.

681
01:07:08,249 --> 01:07:12,602
I don't think you'll have to worry about
meeting any other Gumps up here.

682
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:16,323
Tell me who you are,

683
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:20,786
and why you have come
all the way to my kingdom

684
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:23,205
and what I can do to make you happy.

685
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,751
- It must be the Nome King.
- Where is he? I don't see anybody.

686
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:30,212
My name is Dorothy Gale, Your Majesty.

687

And these are my friends,
Tik-Tok, Jack and the Gump.

688
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:40,255
Not the Dorothy Gale from Kansas?

01:07:40,865 --> 01:07:42,767
Yes, Your Majesty.

690
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:47,396
We've come to ask you to release the
Scarecrow and restore the Emerald City.

691
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:51,192
You believe that I have
stolen something, Dorothy,

692
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:53,393
and you want me to give it back?

Yes, Your Majesty.

694

If someone steals something,
you think they should give it back?

Yes, Your Majesty.

And what if they don't
want to give it back?

Well,

then we are here

are made here

when someone from the world above

digs down and steals my treasures.

All those emeralds in the Emerald City

719

really belong to me.

I was just taking back
what was mine to begin with.

Oh, I transformed him into an ornament.

Into an amusing and beautiful ornament
for my palace.

I didn't realize
he meant so much to you.

744

He didn't steal the emeralds. They
were there when he became king.

You and your friends
can play a little game,

and I bet that you get
the Scarecrow back after all.

All right, then, where's Dorothy?
Where's the chicken?

- They escaped.
- They went that way.

754

She went into the Nome King's mountain!

We have to warn him about that chicken!

Take me to the Nome King,
you stupid idiots.

757
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:40,522
You can go and inspect
my ornament collection.

758
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,776
Each of you has three chances

759
01:12:43,876 --> 01:12:47,780
to guess which one is the Scarecrow.

760
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,115
If you touch the right object

761
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:55,037
and say the word "Oz" at the same time,

762
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,414
the Scarecrow will be restored

763
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:01,075
and you may leave the palace.

764
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:04,954
Sound fair enough?

765
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:11,887
What else can we do?
He's a very powerful magician.

766
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,505
We're lucky
he hasn't turned us to stone.

767
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:24,983
All right, we accept.

Oh, good!

Why doesn't the sofa go first?

770
01:13:43,769 --> 01:13:45,921
But I don't have anything to touch with.

771

- Thank you.
- Where's the Gump?

- He's turned into an ornament.
- What do you mean?

794
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:30,891
An ornament. A knickknack.

795
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:34,863
He failed to guess correctly,

796
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:38,450
and so now he's become
part of my collection.

- Oh, no!
- But that's not fair!

You said you were willing
to take a risk.

799

It sounds fair to me,

800
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:52,297
and what I think is all that matters.

801
01:15:52,397 --> 01:15:54,466
But you didn't tell us about it.

802
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,593
Well, you didn't ask.

803
01:15:56,693 --> 01:16:00,296
Perhaps you'd like to visit

- Me?

806

Being an ornament will probably be
hardest on you, Dorothy,

807
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:31,003
since you're used to eating and
sleeping and other such activities.

Since I never eat or sleep,
I won't miss them.
