MAN:
It is said that over 150 years ago,

3
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,092
in the town of Darkness Falls,

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,930
Matilda Dickson
was adored by all the children.

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,144
Whenever one of them lost a tooth,
they would bring it to her

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,856
in exchange for a gold coin...

7
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:09,694
earning her the name
"The Tooth Fairy."

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,449
But fate was not kind to Matilda.

9
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:20,329
One night, fire tore through
her home on Lighthouse Point,

10
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,333
leaving her face horribly scarred.

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:31,549
Matilda's burned flesh was
so sensitive to light, she
could only go out at night,

12
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,386
always wearing a porcelain mask,

13
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,557
so no one could
ever look upon her face.

14
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,687
One day, two children
didn't come home.

15
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:49,901
The townspeople blamed Matilda.
They hanged her,

16
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:55,531
tearing off her mask, exposing
her hideous face to the light.

17
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,869
And with her dying breath,

18
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,540
Matilda laid a curse
upon Darkness Falls.

19
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,963
The next morning, the two children
were found, safe and sound.

20
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,843
The town buried their secret
along with Matilda's body.

21
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,933
Since then, there are some
who believe that Matilda visits

the children of Darkness Falls on
the night they lose their last tooth,
