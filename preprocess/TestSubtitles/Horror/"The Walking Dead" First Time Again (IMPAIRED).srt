Oh, no, I'm not proper duty.
This is Holly's shift.

164
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:27,717
I was just walking by.

165
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,853
She asked if I could
relieve her for a few ticks.

166
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,638
I said, "No, thank you"
and she ignored me,

167
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,189
which is obviously
what I should have done

168
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,142
as it's been at least five
ticks and still no Holly.

This is Annie.

171
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,651
Hi.
Good to meet you.

172
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,403
How many of you are there?

173
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,987
13.

174
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,990
I mean, 12.

175
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,792
Annie:
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

176
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,329
I'll close up.

177
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:02,252
<i>(gate squeaking)</i>

179
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:13,763
Anything big happen
while we were gone?

180
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:16,349
Well, we had a meeting
last night.

181
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:19,102
<i>(lock clangs)</i>

182
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:22,572
Oh, yeah?
About what?

183
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:24,491
You might want
to talk to Deanna.

184
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,277
Get it from the horse.
Her mouth.

185
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,028
You know?

186
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:33,083
Right.

187
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,001
<i>Hey, it's good to see</i>
<i>someone like me.</i>

188
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,704
I fully respect the hair game.

189
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,714
- Who put up the wall?
- They did.

190
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,849
There was a man, Reg.

191
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,303
He drew up plans,
made it happen early on.

192
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:54,804
A lot of people in here.

193
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,390
They've been inside
from the start.

194
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:00,894
They had food, energy,
not a whole lot of walkers.

195
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:03,229
They just lived.

196
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,532
They haven't had to survive.

197
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,867
They figured that out,
brought us in.

198
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:10,987
Still might be too late.

199
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,072
Too late how?

200
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:15,542
For them to come around.

201
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,911
We'll see.

202
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,746
You'll have to talk to Deanna.

203
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,831
She's the woman in charge.

204
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,250
She was married to Reg.

205
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:25,969
Was?

206
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,556
Yeah.

207
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,938
What are you doing?

208
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,441
We're--

209
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,693
I wanted to help.

210
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,695
We only need one.

211
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,282
We have two men here.

212
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:59,419
We're not gonna bury killers
inside these walls.

213
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,339
I understand how you feel.

214
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:04,757
I do.

215
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:07,260
But it's not your decision.

216
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:11,097
Tobin.

217
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,099
Rick's right.

218
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:22,809
Take it away.

219
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:25,395
Go west.

220
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,313
Down Branton Road a few miles.

221
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:30,366
<i>Just past the bridge.</i>

222
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:32,652
<i>We don't go out that way.</i>

223
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,456
Let the trees have him.

224
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,353
I shot him
because he killed Reg.

225
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:09,439
That was it.
We didn't have a choice.

226
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,909
You do have a cell.

227
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,446
Not for killers.

228
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,117
I'm a killer, Rick.

229
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,038
I am, and you are, too.

230
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:36,382
Glenn, you there yet?

231
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:38,801
Glenn:<i> Almost. We'll have it
handled before they get here.</i>

232
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,219
<i>And we'll meet you at yellow.</i>

233
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:42,555
Copy that.

234
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:49,896
It'll hold.

235
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,731
Well, that's good.

236
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,900
You know, considering
where we're standing.

237
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,408
Michonne.

238
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,043
Yeah?

239
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,746
Back when you were
in that place...

240
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,133
where I lived...

241
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,755
did you take one
of my protein bars?

242
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,394
No.

243
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:26,482
See, I could have sworn there was
one more peanut butter left.

244
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:30,069
(sighs)
That's how it is, isn't it?

245
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:34,107
You always think there's one
more peanut butter left.

00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:29,245
Hey.

253
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,304

but a lot of them,
maybe most of them,

It's not what I think,
it's what I know.

You can't protect yourself.
I'll show you how,

but right now you have
no idea what you're doing.

280

And if you come out here,
you're gonna die.

281
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:21,430
And it won't be quick
and it won't ever be over

You're coming back with us now.

285

Don't make it hard.

Rick on radio:
<i>Glenn, you have to hurry.</i>

292
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,358
- We need it quiet.
- So what's the plan?

293
00:26:57,812 --> 00:27:00,780
Take 'em out a few at a time.

294
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,576
Nicholas, you're at the door.

295
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:15,795
All right.

296
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:18,080
You let one or two out
and then you close it.

297
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,583
You keep doing that. That's the trick.
That's how we control it.

- Heath--
- Wait, what if he can't close it?

299
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:23,252
- <i>I'll be able to.</i>
- Then we take them on.

300
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:24,920
We take them on?

301
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:27,173
If we get into trouble,
we go behind the building

302
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,391
into the woods
and we draw them away.

303
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:32,178
Hey, you've been out
on runs since he got here.

304
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,430
He knows what he's doing.

305
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,899
Me and Aiden, we didn't.

306
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,071
This was supposed to be
a dress rehearsal.

307
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:44,073
I'm supposed to be
delivering pizzas, man.

308
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:46,742
Daryl's leading them this way

309

and they're closing in.

310
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,162
That noise is gonna pull
the herd right off the road

311
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:51,664
and then we have
serious trouble.

00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,983
finding out
what was around here.

328
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,602
There was a camp at the bottom.

329
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:45,356
The people, they must have blocked
the exits with one of those trucks

330
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:48,025
back when everything
started to go bad.

331
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,944
They didn't make it.
They were all roamers.

332
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:51,495
Maybe a dozen of them.

333
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,281
No one's been back since?

334
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:57,117
DC,

335
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,287
every town worth scavenging are
all in the other direction.

336
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,624
<i>And I never really felt like having a
picnic next to the camp that ate itself.</i>

337
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,460
So all the while the walkers
have been drawn by the sound

338
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:08,796
and they're making more sound
and they're drawing more in.

339
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:11,048
And here we are.

340
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:17,271
Now what I'm proposing,
I know it sounds risky,

341
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,224
but walkers are already
slipping through the exits.

342
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,860
One of the trucks
keeping the walkers in

343
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,728
could go off the edge
any day now.

344
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,231
Maybe after one more hard rain.

345
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,900
<i>That exit sends them east.</i>

346
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:33,070
<i>All of them.</i>
<i>Right at us.</i>

347
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:40,494
This isn't about if
it gives, it's when.

348
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,162
It's gonna happen.

349
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,331
That's why we have
to do this soon.

350
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,501
This is-- I don't even
have another word for it.

351
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:50,004
This is terrifying.

352
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:52,640
All of it.

353
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,476
But it doesn't sound like
there's any other way.

354
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,812
Maybe there is.

355
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:04,235
I mean, couldn't we just
build up the weak spots?

356
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,353
I could draw up plans.

357
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,489
I worked on the wall with Reg.

358
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:10,824
<i>Construction crew--</i>

359
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,526
<i>we can try and make it safe.</i>

360
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,828
Even if we could,
the sound of those walkers

361
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,197
is drawing more
and more every day.

362
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,167
Building up the exits
won't change that.

363
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:22,036
Deanna: <i>We're gonna
do what Rick says,</i>

364
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,088
the plan he's laid out.

365
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,679
I told you all, we're gonna
have Daryl leading them away.

366
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,464
Sasha:
<i>Me, too.</i>

367
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:37,217
I'll take a car,
ride next to him.

368
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:39,553
Can't just be him.

369
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:42,723
I'll keep 'em coming, Daryl
keeps 'em from getting sloppy.

370
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,392
I'll go with her.

371
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:48,395
It's a long way
to white-knuckle it solo.

372
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,199
We'll have two teams.

373
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:55,786
One on each side of the forest
helping manage this thing.

374
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,822
We're gonna have a few
people on watch from now on.

375
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,874
Rosita, Spencer, and Holly.

376
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:03,794
So they're out.

377
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,829
So who's in?

378
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,550
Me.

379
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:11,335
You should keep an eye on her.

380
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:14,088
Keep going with the plans
you talked about.

381
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,723
Maggie: <i>I know, but
this is important.</i>

382
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:18,225
She's important.

383
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:20,394
People are scared.

384
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:22,563
They need to see her come back.

385
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,901
That's not the only reason.

386
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,855
Yeah, it isn't.

387
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,658
Okay.

388
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:36,994
I'm in.

389
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,197
I'd like to help as well.

390
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,116
No.
Who else?

391
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:43,951
We need more.

392
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:46,286
Carter: <i>There's got
to be another play.</i>

393
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:49,873
We can't just control that many.

394
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,626
I said it before,
walkers herd up.

395
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,511
They'll follow a path
if something's drawing them.

396
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,463
That's how we can
get 'em all at once.

397
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:59,800
So, what? We're supposed to
just take your word for it?

398
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:03,470
We're all supposed to just fall
in line behind you after...

399
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,977
After what?

400
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:12,279
After you wave a gun around

401
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,615
screaming,
pointing it at people.

402
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:16,817
<i>After you shoot</i>
<i>a man in the face.</i>

403
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:19,787
- <i>After you--</i>
- Enough!

404
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:29,713
I'll do it.

405
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,415
Me, too.

406
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,251
Whatever you need, I'm in.

407
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,553
Deanna:
<i>Now who else?</i>

408
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:45,229
I'll go.

409
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,434
We have to do this.
I need to help.

410
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,942
You sure you can handle it?

411
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,329
You need people.

412
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:11,455
We'll make this work.
We'll keep this place safe.

413
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,874
Keep our families safe.
We will.

414
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:17,377
The plan.
Go through it again.

415
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:18,712
Man, he just said it.

416
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:22,382
Every part again.

417
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,968
The exact plan.

418
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,271
<i>(walkers growling)</i>

419
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:32,025
<i>(engine revving)</i>

420
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,296
Marshall and Redding.

421
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,382
- We force them west here.
- Deanna:<i> How?</i>

422
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:05,884
We block it off so they
can only go one way,

423
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:08,220
west, away from the community.

424
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:09,838
Carter:
<i>Block it off with what?</i>

425
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,390
<i>Cars.</i>

426
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:13,676
We'll use the RVs,
some of the bigger trucks,

427
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,094
<i>park them end to end.</i>

428
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,146
We'll be drawing them away.

429
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:20,182
- They're gonna keep moving.
- Carter:<i> Yeah, but that many?</i>

430
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:23,652
Just bouncing off some sedans?

431
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,989
And then when they start
slipping through

432
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,491
and the ones that walk away
start distracting the rest

433
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:32,077
and you stop drawing them away?

434
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,698
Man's got a point.

435
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,083
Eugene:
<i>We got plates.</i>

436
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,753
The big-ass metal ones
from the construction site.

437
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:42,538
We can use them
to fortify the whip wall.

438
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,123
It'd help disperse
the force of impact

439
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,874
and direct the walkers clean.

440
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,876
Like a pool table.
Eight ball, corner pocket.

441
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,762
That's an army out there.

442
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,433
And what happens
when this doesn't hold?

443
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:56,935
And they push on through.
The curve in this hillside

444
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:59,104
is gonna send them
right back east.

445
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:01,724
Right back here.

446
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,360
You seriously want to risk that?

447
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:07,062
No.

448
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:10,316
So you need to help us
to make it hold.

449
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:14,069
These walls, you built them.

450
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,789
So you've already
done the impossible.

451
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:19,958
Carter.

452
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,795
Please.

453
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:27,916

(chatter)

458
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:42,134
Hey, what you said before about us
needing to take care of ourselves?

459
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,854
Going out finding more people,

460
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,056
that is taking care
of ourselves.

461
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,229
Your call, though.

462
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,539
Thanks.

463
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,542
You know, I can come
with all of you.

464
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:10,996
You and Daryl have been
teaching me how to shoot.

465
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:13,966
(sighs)
I think you got the hang of it.

466
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,640
Rick:
<i>You should stay back,</i>

467
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:24,760
<i>get a feel for how</i>
<i>people feel now.</i>

468
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,229
<i>We still got a long way</i>
<i>to go with them.</i>

469
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,233
We'll get there.

470
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:33,685
She's in charge.

471
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,904
But you're in charge now.

472
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:49,418
(banging)

473
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,037
- This is a bad idea.
- This is the only idea.

474
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,039
I think there's something
like a dozen in there.

475
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,092
We stay back, we get on opposite
ends, we draw them to each of us.

476
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:58,710
- Try and take down four each?
- No.

477
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,379
This is just me and Heath.

478
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,464
You get back and you stay back.

479
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,850
Things go south, you tell
Rick and you draw them away.

480
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:08,220
Just move back.

481
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,232
He got Noah killed?

482
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,984
He did.

483
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,153
He did more than that.

484
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,075
He lured Glenn into the woods
and tried to kill him.

485
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,294
What the hell?

486
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,212
- Yeah.
- What?

487
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,798
Glenn told me I could tell everyone
if that's what I wanted to do.

488
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,002
Could get Nicholas exiled.

489
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,337
He'd die out there.

490
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,256
Could have done that.

491
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:47,342
You could do that now.

492
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,178
He got Noah killed
and he tried to kill Glenn?

493
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:53,899
Glenn saves people.

494
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:55,851
Even people like that.

495
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:03,742
<i>I couldn't accept it either.</i>

496
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,112
But then I thought about you.

497
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,197
How we were on different
sides of that fence

498
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,199
on the worst day of my life.

499
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,061
And now you're one of the most
important people in the world to me.

500
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:20,959
Things can get better.

501
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,761
We can make them better.

502
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,548
You tell me what you want to do.

503
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:29,518
(sniffles)

504
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,355
I'm just gonna follow
your lead, okay?

505
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,391
Okay.

506
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,194
I'm sorry.

507
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,704
You ready?

508
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:51,406
No. But since you're
doing this thing anyway...

509
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,242
All right.

510
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,396

Here you go.

518

Oh, thank you.

520
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,935
Yeah.

521
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,604
You been with Rick long?

522
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:29,573
Since Atlanta.

523
00:42:29,575 --> 00:42:31,275
And were you a cop, too?

524
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:34,778
Why would you think that?

525

529
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:47,958
You know, to handle things.

533
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:05,893
Got some looky-loos taking a little
constitutional off the shoulder.

534

They starting a damn walkout.

535
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:12,316
You want to have Daryl
circle back?

536
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,151
No.

537
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:16,320

I'll catch up.

547

That was a mess.

548

And Pete.

549
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:18,682
His face just...

cheek to cheek.

552

He was smart and kind.

He was a good man.

566

It was the right call.

00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:08,420
Fire your guns
and draw them back.

651

(Judith coughs)

652
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,963
It's nice out.

653
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,467
Yeah.

654
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:23,018
Hope you don't mind.

655
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,804
I wanted to enjoy
the evening a little

656
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:28,274
and I don't have a porch
over there, so...

657
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:37,283
Get your stuff.

658
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:43,205
You should stay
with us over here.

659
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:47,493
Morgan:
<i>You got room?</i>

660
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:49,545
Rick:
<i>We'll make it.</i>

661
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:52,665
We don't need
to do that anymore.

662
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:56,585
I know you, Morgan.

663
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,923
Even if this is the first time.

664
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:09,648
You want to hold her?

665
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:14,153
(chuckles)

666
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:18,691
Okay.

667
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:28,917
- This is Morgan.
- <i>(Judith coos)</i>

668
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,452
He's a friend of mine.

669
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:32,171
Hey.

670
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,375
Hi.

671
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:42,014
Okay.

672
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:48,020
<i>Let me have a look at you.</i>

673
00:53:48,022 --> 00:53:50,639
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

674
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,698
You with that man Carter,
in the armory--

675
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,785
that's you.

676
00:54:02,787 --> 00:54:04,570
You're still the same man
I met in King County.

677
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,989
The one that came back
and told me it wasn't over.

678
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:11,910
That was you.

679
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:14,963
Same you that's right in
front of me right now.

680
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:21,303
I wanted to kill him.

681
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:26,258
So it would be easier.

682
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:31,397
So I wouldn't have to worry

683
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:33,932
about how he could screw up

684
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:37,653
or what stupid thing he'd do
next because that's who he is.

685
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:41,106
Just somebody who
shouldn't be alive now.

686
00:54:43,027 --> 00:54:44,443
(sighs)

687
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:47,029
I wanted to kill him.

688
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:53,285
But all that hit me and...

689
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:55,871
I realized
I didn't have to do it.

690
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:07,299
He doesn't get it.

691
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,435
Somebody like that...

692
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:15,891
they're gonna die
no matter what.

693
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:22,114

00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:35,077

697
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:37,045
Carter.

- Oh, God.
- Carter. Carter, shh.

700

- (screaming)
- You got to be quiet.

709
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:24,793
That was Carter.

710
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,045
He got bit right in the face.

711
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:28,847
I stopped him.

712
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:40,275
We have a good hour until
we have 'em to green

713
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:43,946
when we hand them off to
Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.

714
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:46,365
Why don't you head back, tell
everyone what's happening?

715
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:48,283
- They should know.
- Okay, Rick, I just--

716
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:49,985
Will you do that for me?

717
00:56:55,409 --> 00:56:57,376
I'll take care of that one.

718
00:56:57,378 --> 00:57:00,546
Michonne, you take point.

719
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,418
I know it's how it is.

720
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,970
I do.

721
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:12,508
Yeah.

722
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,426
I do, too.

Rick:
<i>Hey.</i>

726
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,959
I was just getting
more flares for tomorrow.

727
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:12,756
I know I haven't--

728
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:16,810
I just-- I just thought
it might be best

729
00:58:16,812 --> 00:58:20,430
if I let things be for a while.

730
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:24,351
Ron told me what happened.

731
00:58:24,353 --> 00:58:26,486
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

732
00:58:26,488 --> 00:58:28,989
- He shouldn't have been out there.
- No, he shouldn't have.

733
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,992
You're right.

734
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:35,779
But you can't talk
to him like that, Rick.

735
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:37,831
You can't touch him.

736
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:40,784
Not you.

737
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:43,870
Ron needed to hear
every word I said.

738
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:46,039
That's why I grabbed him.
I wasn't angry.

739
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,757
I was just telling
him the truth.

740
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:53,046
If it's coming from you,
he can't hear it.

741
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:57,717
You got to understand that.

742
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:59,602
He needs to know
how to handle himself.

743
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,888
- I can teach him. I can teach you.
- Rick.

744
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,307
- You need to know how.
- Rick.

745
00:59:06,895 --> 00:59:08,778
When I found out
we could have them,

746
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,064
I asked Rosita
to start showing me how.

747
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:14,401
Okay? She's gonna teach me
and I'm gonna teach Ron

748
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:16,403
and I'm gonna teach Sam.

749
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:23,209
I heard what you were saying
to us at the meeting.

750
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:26,546
And at my house
before, you know.

751
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:32,669
I am gonna fight, Rick.

752
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:44,097
(snarling)

753
01:00:00,499 --> 01:00:01,998
All right,
this is the finish line.

754
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,284
When we make it to green,
we fall back.

755
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:06,870
The ditches and ridges
will keep them on the road.

756
01:00:06,872 --> 01:00:09,839
We head home, but Daryl,
Sasha, and Abraham

757
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:12,208
take them the rest of
the way, 20 miles more.

758
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,793
All right, let's go.

759
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:21,518
Got a question for you.

760
01:00:23,188 --> 01:00:28,141
Just some intel before our
little road trip tomorrow.

761
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:29,976
Ask me.

762
01:00:32,981 --> 01:00:35,115
You doing this
'cause you want to die?

763
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,037
No.

764
01:01:04,813 --> 01:01:07,430
We're gonna take 'em
right past here.

765
01:01:07,432 --> 01:01:10,817
All that noise
could distract them.

766
01:01:10,819 --> 01:01:14,237
We'll clear it on
our way back tonight.

767
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,739
We don't want any
surprises tomorrow.

768
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:19,526
(snarling, banging)

769
01:01:19,528 --> 01:01:22,495
Hey, what you've done,

770
01:01:22,497 --> 01:01:24,697
you're gonna sit
with it a while,

771
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:26,282
'cause I don't want you
out here tomorrow.

772
01:01:26,284 --> 01:01:28,084
You're not ready.

773

You will be.

774
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:33,590
Some time soon,
I'll make sure of it.

775
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:35,542
And then you start
to make it right.

776
