[Thunder crashes,
woman screams]

2
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,319
Aah!

3
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,426
It's love, isn't it?

4
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,062
Sometimes you walk into a house

5
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,040
and you take one look around,
and you know.

6
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,576
And you say, "This is for me."

7
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,544
Oh, I think it's perfect.

8
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,946
It's just what
we've been looking for.

9
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,608
There aren't enough plugs.

10
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,015
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman, now.

11
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,179
That place I showed you
on Sycamore Street

12
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,587
was absolutely,
positively loaded with plugs.

13
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,591
That's right.
There were plenty.

14
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,024
But the steps were too high.

15
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,584
When we get older,
we could trip.

16
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,961
Every house we look at
you find something to pick at.

17
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,659
I just know what I like.

18
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,168
Would you like a divorce?
'Cause I'll bring it.

19
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,830
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that.

20
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,169
I'm gonna find
this house for you.

21
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,641
I am committed to finding
the perfect house for you.

22
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,041
I don't care how long it takes.

23
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,977
Because at Evers & Evers,

24
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,983
we want you to be happy
forevers and evers.

25
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,952
Oh, excuse me one second.
Let me take this call.

26
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,579
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

27
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,385
Hello. Evers & Evers
Real Estate. Jim Evers.

28
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,359
Hey, honey. How's it going?
Do they like the house?

29
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,328
Yes, this house is
still available.

30
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,557
Oh, I knew it.

31
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,064
I told you they were
lookie-Ious.

32
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,964
It's another interested party.

33
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,560
Listen, I'm on my way home
to get ready for dinner.

34
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,070
I'm looking forward to tonight.

35
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,629
Well, are you preapproved?

36
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,699
Yeah, the reservation's at 7:00,
so don't be late.

37
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,506
Okay.
Well, 7:00 is perfect.

38
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,570
Let's get together at 7:00,
and we'll go over your offer.

39
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,138
Okay, honey.
I'll see you later.

40
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,148
See what you did?

41
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,447
We love the house.

42
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,250
We do.
We love it.

43
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,517
Well, then, Mrs. Coleman.

44
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,921
Taking that into consideration,

45
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,517
there's only one thing
left to do.

46
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,394
Let's sign some papers.

47
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,963
Lorraine and Gary.

49
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,798
Just like I promised,
here's the offer.

50
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,565
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

51
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,869
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

52
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,408
We are so grateful.

53
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,104
This is a cause for celebration.
Let us buy you a drink.

54
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,511
Oh, no, really, I can't.
My wife's waiting for me.

55
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,049
This is such a big deal for us.
We have to celebrate.

56
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,948
- I really can't. I'm late.
- We insist.

57
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,613
Please.

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,849
Okay. One quick drink.
Okay. One quick one.

59
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,915
Sir, can I have a ginger ale
over here, please?

60
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,721
Oh, no.
That's not a drink.

61
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,227
Sammy, three Volcanoes.

62
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,730
- Oh, no. No volcanoes.
- They're incredibly smooth.

63
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,822
Oh, we love it here.

64
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,366
We've been coming here
for years.

65
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,833
- It's like Hawaii.
- Yes.

66
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,233
We spent our honeymoon there.

67
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,965
It was fantastic.
Have you been?

68
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,597
- No, never been there.
- Promise me you'll go.

69
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,641
Promise.

70
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,575
I'll go if you sign.
I will go to Hawaii if you sign.

71
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,442
But I got to get going because
it's my anniversary tonight.

72
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,483
Your anniversary?
Happy anniversary!

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,110
Thank you.

- No.

Oh, excuse me.
Did I hear you correctly?

84
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,905
Did you just sell their house?

85
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,136
I sure did.

86
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,405
'Cause we're looking to buy.

87
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,844

of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

[Doorbell rings]

91
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,993
Hi, Sara.
My name's Teddy.

92
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,995
Your husband told me to tell you
he loves you very much,

93
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,463
but sometimes he loses track
of the time.

94
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,296
I'm sorry I'm late.

95
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,427
Happy anniversary.

96
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,095
Happy anniversary.

97
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,333
Yes.
[Gasps]

98
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,467
Look at what he brought you.

99
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,307
Look at that.
Isn't that pretty?

100
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,347
Oh, you know, you have
a wonderful husband

101
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,609
that thinks about you like that
on your anniversaries.

102
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,775
You're so fortunate!

103
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,716
It's beautiful.

104
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,322
It's actually Teddy's fault
that I'm late.

105
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,324
He had a little accident
in the backseat,

106
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,122
cotton all over the place,
but I cleaned it up.

107
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,891
It's okay.
I forgive Teddy.

108
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,864
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that.

109
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,061
I'm on a roll here.
We sold seven houses this month.

110
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,603
What about
the three soccer games,

111
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,435
two birthday parties,
and barbecue you missed?

112
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,873
Did I miss that much stuff
this month?

113
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,077
Okay. We're gonna take off
this weekend.

114
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,908
What?

115
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,039
We're gonna take off
and go down to the lake

116
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,050
like we did last year with
the kids for the whole weekend.

117
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,313
- How's that sound?
- Can we really close on this?

118
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,287
Yes. How about this?
We can close on this.

119
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,846
How about this?

120
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,392
Close on that.
Let me go tell the kids.

121
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,223
All right?
Okay. All right.

122
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,889
Megan and Michael,
big family adventure!

123
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,990
Hey!
Michael Jordan Evers!

124
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,295
Aah! Aah!

125
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,926
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

126
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,437
- Dad! There's a...
- What is it?

127
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,303
- There's a spider in my room!
- There's a what?

128
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,205
There's a spider in my room
on the window.

129
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,210
Why don't you kill it, man?

130
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,212
That's a big spider!

131
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,872
Come on.
It's just a spider, Michael.

132
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,882
How big could it be?
What is this?

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,009
Where's the spider at?

134
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,111
What? Man, you're acting
like it's Mothra.

135
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,246
It's just a spider.

136
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,722
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, Michael.

137
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,815
You're 10 years old.

138
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,225
It's time I teach you how to
kill a spider the right way.

139
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,923
The most efficient way
to crush a spider.

140
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,398
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.

141
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,267
Some people like to use "Life"
or "Time" or...

142
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,132
This is my "Sports Illustrated"
Swimsuit Edition.

143
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,199
What are you doing with it?

144
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,472
- I don't know.
- Yeah, right.

145
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,707
If you can look at this,
you should have enough courage

146
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,305
to kill a spider the right way.

147
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,011
So I'm gonna roll this up
so you get a good grip on it.

148
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,451
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.

149
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,489
That's where you can really get
some good action going.

150
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,185
You want to come across like
that so you really crush it.

151
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,092
You come across this way so
you get his whole escape route

152
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,220
in case he try to go...

153
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,855
You take it, and you whack it.

154
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,627
Go on.
Whack the spider.

155
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,133
I don't want to whack it.

156
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,465
Come on, you got to whack
the spider, Mike. Whack it.

157
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,370
Dad, I'm afraid of spiders.
I can't whack it.

158
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,339
Let me explain something to you.

159
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,868
All your life you're gonna be
facing spiders, okay?

160
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:41,811
I am?

161
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,373
What I'm trying to say is
you should never be afraid.

162
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,146
People know,
they use that against you.

163
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,153
I'm not scared of anything.
I'm your dad, right?

164
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,018
You're my son.
You whack that spider.

165
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,523
I can't whack the spider, Dad.

166
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,026
Come on. Whack it.
You can do it. Whack the spider.

167
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,688
- I don't want to whack it.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

Kill the spider.

I can't whack it!

No, I'm not happy, Megan.

I was trying to make a point

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,169
about how it's important
to whack your own spiders!

It is an old home, Ms. Evers.

And my employer is anxious
to move on.

for you to come alone

But my husband and I work
as a team.

does not take visitors.

However, from your photograph,

186
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,861
he thought you to have
a trustworthy face.

he felt differently.

to meet you tomorrow evening.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

But tomorrow I've got plans
that can't be broken.

- Who is that?

319
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,973
we wanted to commit
the full resources

320
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,479
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

321
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,483
At Evers & Evers, we want you
to be happy forevers and evers.

322
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,416
Please accept
this waterproof calendar

323
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,148
as a token of our appreciation.

324
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,958
Very well.

325
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,019
We shall have to place
other settings.

326
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,530
Who do you have
the settings for?

327
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,797
Master Gracey wishes to discuss
his affairs over dinner.

328
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,031
Oh, I'm afraid we have plans.

329
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,767
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.

330
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,468
Oh, yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darling.

331
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,134
What about our family adventure?

332
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,109
Yeah, Dad.

333
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,612
We'll just have some soup,
and then we'll get going, okay?

334
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,012
All right?

335
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,451
Wow.

336
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,134
Wow.

337
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,341
Nice.
Very nice.

338
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,639
Good job.
Good job.

339
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,704
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to
eat like this every day at home?

340
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,543
The master will be
with you shortly.

341
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,985
Carry on.

342
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,131
I said, "Carry on."
He walks off.

343
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,097
Have you ever seen
a fireplace this amazing?

344
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,265
Incredible.

345
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,832
Ah, we could have one heck of a
wienie roast in that thing, huh?

346
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,436
Seriously.
Look at this detail.

347
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,037
I've never seen
anything like this.

348
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,573
- [Thunder crashes]
- Haven't you?

349
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,850
My grandfather spared no expense
when he built this mansion.

350
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,256
Well, your grandfather had
really good taste in tchotchkes.

351
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,850
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

352
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,021
Charmed to make
your acquaintance, sir.

353
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,929
Edward.
Edward Gracey.

354
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,306
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.

355
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,205
You want to come meet
Mr. Gracey?

356
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,744
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Gracey.

357
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,441
And this is our daughter, Megan,
and our son, Michael.

358
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,221
You have very beautiful
children, Ms. Evers.

359
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,123
I kicked in
some chromosomes, too.

360
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,591
Children.
Madam.

361
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,928
Oh. Nice.

362
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,763
Okay.

363
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,736
Thank you.

364
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,502
The master was very pleased

365
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,976
when he heard you could come
on such short notice.

366
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,708
Normally we would not have
called you here so abruptly.

367
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,773
But we had no other choice.

368
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,716
What do you got,
termites or something?

369
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,913
Big house like this must have
a lot of termites.

370
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,824
No. But lately there have been
more... disturbances.

371
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,458
What do you think
of the house, Ms. Evers?

372
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,657
Oh.

373
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,031
I think it's
absolutely incredible.

374
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,002
The Italian influence.

375
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,765
The Renaissance style
of the molding.

376
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,364
The attention to detail
is stunning.

377
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,774
You never see houses like this.
Or at least I don't.

378
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:24,282
Great care and love went into
the building of this mansion.

379
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,823
This house is my inheritance.

380
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,833
My birthright.

381
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,399
But lately it's become
too much to bear.

382
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,501
Tell me, Mr. Evers.

383
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,372
Do you believe in ghosts?

384
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,173
Ghosts?

385
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,908
Yeah. Sure.
I believe in ghosts. Yeah.

386
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,542
I don't think it's a good idea
to put that on the listing.

387
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,677
You should talk about how many
bathrooms are in the house.

388
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,685
People love bathrooms.

389
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,382
We should play up the toilet
angle and leave out ghosts.

390
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,049
I think that'd be best.

391
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,192
The storm has swollen the river.

392
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,093
How's that?

393
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,497
The storm has flooded the road.

394
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,435
I'm afraid there will be
no leaving the mansion tonight.

395
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,097
What?

396
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:28,010
Of course you are all more than
welcome to spend the night here.

397
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,979
Oh, no.
I really don't think we should.

398
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,948
We've got plans.

399
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,851
I'm afraid there's no other way.

400
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,379
Ramsley will show you
to your rooms.

401
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,634
I believe the children will be
comfortable in this room.

402
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,335
Yeah.
Real homey.

403
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,540
You'll be fine.

404
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,140
Wow.
Hey, listen.

405
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,982
When you flush the toilet, check
and see how quickly it refills.

406
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,078
Good night, Dad.

407
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,645
Good night.

408
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:21,457
I hope you and the madame will
find this room to your liking.

409
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,625
Yeah.
It's great.

410
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,896
It'll be like spending the night
in a fine hotel.

411
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,632
Will there be anything else
that you require, sir?

412
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,401
Are you gonna get us
some chocolates?

413
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,270
Pardon?

414
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,537
You know, the little chocolates
they put on the hotel pillows.

415
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,442
Sometimes they have chocolates
on the pillow.

416
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,980
They have little chocolates
on the pillows...

417
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,709
to have.

418
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,649
What's the problem?

419
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,918
SARA:
In the first place,

420
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,721
we weren't even supposed to
be here.

421
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,158
We were supposed to be
at the lake.

422
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,594
What am I supposed to do,
control the weather now, Sara?

423
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,722
That's not the point.

424
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:56,096
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.

425
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:59,000
Excuse me. This is a big
opportunity for all of us.

426
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,061
Not for us, for you.

427
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,801
The only thing you seem to care
about anymore is work.

428
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,866
Oh, but when I'm working hard,
it doesn't matter

429
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,538
as long as I'm bringing you
home expensive gifts, right?

430
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,212
Hey, what are you...
Hey, Sara.

431
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,344
Hey, Sara, I didn't
mean to say that, okay?

432
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,717
Sara.

433
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,982
Come on.
Stop it.

434
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,717
Sara.
Sara.

435
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,352
I'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?

436
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,690
Aah!
Ooh.

437
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,701
You scared me.

438
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,560
- Pardon the intrusion, sir.
- Yes.

439
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,402
The master was wondering
if he might have a word with you

440
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,566
in the library.

441
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,837
A word? Okay. I'd love to have
a word with him.

442
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,640
Sure.
Let's go talk some turkey.

443
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,874
Yes. Turkey.

444
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,438
- Very good, sir.
- Yeah.

445
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,145
If you will kindly follow me.

446
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,243
Yeah. Of course.
Of course.

447
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,154
Hey, Sara, I'm gonna have a word
with Mr. Gracey.

448
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,191
I'll be back in a minute.

449
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,528
Ramsley, I was just wondering.

450
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,187
Have you ever been
to a tanning salon?

451
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,164
I've got a friend who's got
a really great place.

452
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:02,790
You can get a really smooth tan.

453
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,802
Do something about
that ashy white look.

454
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,735
I'm sure the ladies
would love it.

455
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,866
Yes.
Sounds wonderful.

456
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,477
Would you care for a drink, sir,
while you're waiting?

457
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,142
Yeah. Don't mind if I do.
Thank you, Ramsley.

458
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,276
Oh, wow!

459
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,878
Now, that's class.
That's what I need to do.

460
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,355
Get a big picture of myself
to put on the living room wall.

461
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,654
Adds a touch of elegance
to the room.

462
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,629
Yes, sir.
Very elegant.

463
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,188
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Ramsley.

464
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,102
Mmm.

465
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,762
So, Ramsley, how long
you been a butler?

466
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,431
A long time.

467
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,270
What are the most
important qualifications

468
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,402
in case I might be doing
some interviewing?

469
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,073
Attending to every detail.

470
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,412
Understanding priorities.

471
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,148
And above all,
knowing one's place.

472
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,747
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?

473
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,224
You know, what floats his boat?

474
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,127
The master likes
a great many things.

475
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:11,862
Art, literature, beauty.

476
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,733
And all that stuff about ghosts.

477

[Rumbling]

960
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,213
Megan, you better look faster!

961
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:32,845
Oh, I don't want to do this.

962
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:43,664
Jeez.

Aah!

- Aah!
- [Roaring]

966
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:29,976
Give me your hand.

967
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:36,112
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on!

968
00:57:38,453 --> 00:57:40,614
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!

969
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:41,553
Hold on!

970
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:43,648
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!

971
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,690
Michael!
Michael, open the door.

972
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:49,229
Michael, it's locked
from the outside!

973
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:51,959
Michael, open the door.
Open the door. Michael!

974
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,729
Dad, there's spiders everywhere,
and I don't have a magazine.

975
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:56,634
- Hey, Michael, are you scared?
- Uh-huh.

976
00:57:56,705 --> 00:57:59,731
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.

977
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:01,503
- Daddy's scared right now.
- You are?

978
00:58:01,576 --> 00:58:03,840
Yes, I'm very scared.
Now, please open the door, son!

979
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:06,642
Michael, open the door,
or I'll kill you!

980
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:07,739
That's great.
Keep him calm.

981
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:09,807
Hey, Michael, listen,
it's okay to get scared.

982
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:11,546
Everybody gets scared
now and then.

983
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,917
You just can't let it stop you.

984
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,717
Michael, if you think
you're scared now,

985
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:16,188
wait till the zombies come out!

986
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:17,520
What zombies?

987
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:18,616
Michael!
Hey, Michael, look.

988
00:58:18,693 --> 00:58:20,388
Just open the door.
Please, man.

989
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:21,554
Open the door right now.

990
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,756
Dad, they're coming!

[Screaming]

Michael, open the door
right now!

00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:29,434
Open the door!
Open the door!

994
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:32,473
Open the door right now!
Open the door!

995
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:34,969
Oh!

00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:40,904
Aah!

00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,048
Lock it! Lock it!

00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,246
Okay.
Come on!

00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:47,413
All right.

1000
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,889
Okay. All right.
Get 'em off!

1001
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,949
Okay. Come on.
Get 'em off. Okay.

1002
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:54,359
All right. We got it.
All right. You okay?

1003
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:55,453
Okay.

1004
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,555
My brave little man.
All right.

1005
00:58:57,632 --> 00:58:58,792
All right.
You okay?

1006
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:00,858
Yeah.
You got the key?

1007
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,471
Oh, no.

1008
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:06,630
Wait. Whoa.
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

1009
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,767
There it is.
Okay.

1010
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:09,775
All right.

1011
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:12,142
Now, we went to hell and back
to get this thing.

1012
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:13,408
Where's the door out of here?

1013
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:16,143
First, you must find the trunk.

1014
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,082
Trunk?

1015
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:18,744
Yes, trunk.

1016
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,912
Not door?

1017
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:22,786
No. Not door.
Trunk.

1018
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:26,156
All you said I had to do was
find this key! I got the key.

1019
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:28,059
Now you're telling me this story
about a trunk!

1020
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,721
The key is the answer to all,
remember?

1021
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:32,733
Look, I don't make the rules.
I just work here.

1022
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,735
Okay. That's it.
That's the last straw.

1023
00:59:34,803 --> 00:59:36,634
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

1024
00:59:36,705 --> 00:59:39,037
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down!

1025
00:59:39,107 --> 00:59:41,575
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck!

1026
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,770
I'll show you bad luck.
I'm tired of playing around.

1027
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:45,244
I'm getting nauseous!

1028
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:47,144
You'll get over it.

1029
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:49,249
Please don't drop me.

1030
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:51,444
I'm fragile.
I'm very fragile.

1031
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:52,816
Don't talk to me
about being fragile.

1032
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:55,253
I'm the one that's feeling
fragile right now.

1033
00:59:58,927 --> 00:59:59,859
Is that it?

1034
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:01,691
- That's it.
- Hmm. All right.

1035
01:00:01,763 --> 01:00:03,788
Now we're in business.

1036
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:07,165
Hey, hold her for a second.

1037
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:12,767
All right.
Okay.

1038
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,604
Okay.

1039
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:31,221
How do I know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.

1040
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,089
Find the thing that must be read

1041
01:00:34,162 --> 01:00:36,960
lest your heart be filled
with dread.

1042
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,364
There's nothing in here red.

1043
01:00:42,404 --> 01:00:45,066
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here.

1044
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,903
It's a letter.

1045
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:51,702
"Yes, my dear heart,
I will marry you.

1046
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,805
I will love you
for all eternity.

1047
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:56,316
And tonight at last,
we will be together.

1048
01:00:56,384 --> 01:00:57,408
I do.

1049
01:00:57,486 --> 01:01:00,580
Forever yours, Elizabeth."

1050
01:01:00,655 --> 01:01:02,179
She didn't kill herself.

1051
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:04,225
She wanted to be with him.

1052
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:06,760
Yeah, and somebody gave him
the wrong letter.

1053
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:09,353
RAMSLE Y: Yes.
Well done, Mr. Evers.

1054
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:12,025
I must say I'm impressed.

1055
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,002
You are more persistent
than I would have ever imagined.

1056
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,234
The butler did it?
You got to be kidding me.

1057
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:23,334
I will deal with you two later.

1058
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,811
Why'd you kill her?

1059
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:29,817
Because the master
would not listen to reason.

1060
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,182
He had everything in the world.

1061
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:35,121
And yet he was willing
to throw it all away for love.

1062
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,785
I did tell him
it would end badly.

1063
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,657
You're a real cold dude.

1064
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:44,165
No, Mr. Evers.
I am a rational man.

1065
01:01:44,232 --> 01:01:46,826
It was my responsibility
to the house.

1066
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:48,995
My duty, sir, to see to it

1067
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:53,166
that the boy did not make
a foolish error in judgment.

1068
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:57,507
Running away with that girl
would have destroyed this house.

1069
01:01:57,579 --> 01:01:59,672
It would have destroyed
everything.

1070
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:03,411
And I could not stand by
and watch it all fall to ruin.

1071
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:04,975
Punch his face in, Dad.

1072
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:07,613
Yeah, but first I'm gonna tell
his master what really happened.

1073
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,486
The master must never know.

1074
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:12,288
Edward and his love
will be reunited,

1075
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,294
and this curse will be broken.

1076
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:15,829
That's not her.
That's my wife.

1077
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:18,457
And what she sees in you
I'll never know.

1078
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:20,967
But that is
of little importance now.

1079
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:25,302
The only thing that matters is
that the master's pain must end.

1080
01:02:25,373 --> 01:02:27,637
And it will end tonight.

1081
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:32,146
The curse will be broken,
and we can all finally move on.

1082
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:34,977
All right. That's it, man.
Where's my wife?

1083
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,075
Getting ready for her wedding,
of course.

1084
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:38,483
What wedding?
He can't marry her.

1085
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:39,850
He's dead, and she's not.

1086
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:41,320
True.

1087
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:43,823
But that can be
easily corrected.

1088
01:02:43,892 --> 01:02:48,192
Life, I'm afraid,
is such a delicate state.

1089
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:51,664
If you put one finger on
my wife, I swear I'll kill you.

1090
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:58,300
How wonderful.
You're going to kill a ghost.

1091
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,568
- Leave him alone!
- Stop it!

1092
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:03,872
- Aah!
- Aah!

1093
01:03:03,945 --> 01:03:06,038
Let them go!

1094
01:03:08,516 --> 01:03:09,608
[Muffled screams]

1095
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:12,278
You're gonna let my kids out
of here, take me to my wife,

1096
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:13,878
and let us out of here
right now!

1097
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:17,789
You want out, fine.

1098
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:20,794
Let me show you out.

1099
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:29,363
Now, for the last time,
good night, Mr. Evers.

1100
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:33,474
Aah!

1101
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,202
Ugh!

1102
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:42,578
[Car alarm sounds,
horn honking]

1103
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:44,642
Oh!

1104
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:07,938
This house has waited so long

1105
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:11,843
to have its shroud
of darkness lifted.

1106
01:04:11,913 --> 01:04:18,614
And tonight, for the first time
in, oh, so many years,

1107
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,450
I believe it may be possible

1108
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:25,016
that the story will finally end
differently.

1109
01:04:25,093 --> 01:04:26,788
Sara?

1110
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:30,262
Do you believe that love
is about second chances?

1111
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:32,765
About forgiveness?

1112
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,530
Yes, I do.

1113
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:38,062
Don't you remember?

1114
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,606
Remember?

1115
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,141
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?

1116
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:43,074
Don't you recognize me at all?

1117
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,577
Mr. Gracey.

1118
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,978
I thought certainly bringing you
back to Gracey Manor

1119
01:04:47,048 --> 01:04:48,811
would help you remember.

1120
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:51,283
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.

1121
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,149
Where it happened.

1122
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,314
Where we spent
our last moments together.

1123
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,826
Where we danced together
for the last time before you...

1124
01:04:58,893 --> 01:05:01,327
Before you killed yourself!

1125
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:02,693
But now you've returned to me.

1126
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:05,426
And at long last,
we can be together.

1127
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,092
Why do you not remember?

1128
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,102
You were my world, my life!

1129
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:11,832
And I have loved you in death
as I did in life!

1130
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:13,601
Let me go!

1131
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:15,836
Why do you not remember?

1132
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:19,871
You are her.
You are Elizabeth.

1133
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,074
You must be!

1134
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:23,117
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart.

1135
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:24,776
I am your one true love.

1136
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:26,286
And now we can finally
be together.

1137
01:05:26,354 --> 01:05:27,548
Don't you understand?

1138
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:29,613
Elizabeth,
you must listen to me.

1139
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,124
I'm not Elizabeth!

1140
01:05:31,192 --> 01:05:33,126
Please!
I implore you.

1141
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:35,719
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!

1142
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:44,437
She doesn't remember.

1143
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:45,973
It can't be her.

1144
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,304
It is her, sir.

1145
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:51,641
The gypsy woman
prophesied her return.

1146
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,648
And now the time has come.

1147
01:05:55,383 --> 01:05:56,873
You had best get ready.

1148
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:58,885
But she doesn't remember.

1149
01:05:58,953 --> 01:06:01,547
In time she will, sir.

1150
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:04,990
I assure you she will.

1151
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:13,725
Open up!
Hey!

1152
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,793
Let me in!

1153
01:06:28,783 --> 01:06:30,842
Aah!

1154
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:50,469
Oh, Ramsley,
you have to help me.

1155
01:06:50,538 --> 01:06:53,302
There's something
horribly wrong. Mr. Gracey...

1156
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:56,309
Yes. I know, my dear.
I know.

1157
01:06:56,377 --> 01:06:57,969
He's expecting you.

1158
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:01,777
He's always been expecting you.

1159
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,751
And you haven't put on
your dress yet.

1160
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:07,344
We can't keep
the master waiting.

1161
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:09,287
Waiting?
For what?

1162
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:12,690
Why, your wedding, of course.

1163
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:13,819
My...

1164
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:16,429
I'm not Elizabeth!

1165
01:07:16,497 --> 01:07:18,260
Of course you are, my dear.

1166
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,891
You may not see it yet.

1167
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:22,198
But in time you will.

1168
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,364
You don't actually think I'm
going through with this madness?

1169
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,898
Oh, yes.
I very much do.

1170
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,672
You see...

1171
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:33,737
we wouldn't want anything
to happen to the children.

1172
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:35,749
Now, would we?

1173
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:38,115
Michael!
Megan!

1174
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:39,448
You wouldn't.

1175
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,579
Of course not, my dear.

1176
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:43,783
But that is entirely up to you.

1177
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:50,388
If not, I really do fear
for the children.

1178
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:54,960
Have her ready.

1179
01:07:55,036 --> 01:07:58,631
And this time, any further acts
of insubordination

1180
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:01,573
will be dealt with
in the harshest possible manner.

1181
01:08:01,643 --> 01:08:03,406
But, sir?

1182
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:06,743
There are worse things
than purgatory, madam.

1183
01:08:06,814 --> 01:08:09,214
I can assure you.

1184
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,550
Have her ready.

1185
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:20,658
[Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" plays
off-key]

1186
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,133
Tears of joy.

1187
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,092
What are you doing?

1188
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,424
Hey, you leave me alone.

1189
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,157
Just get out of here
and leave me alone.

1190
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:30,925
Oh, I see.

1191
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,991
You're just gonna sit there,
feeling sorry for yourself.

1192
01:09:34,068 --> 01:09:35,865
You tell me why not.

1193
01:09:35,937 --> 01:09:38,428
This whole thing was my fault.

1194
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:41,373
We should've never been here
in the first place.

1195
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:43,103
Supposed to be at the lake.

1196
01:09:43,177 --> 01:09:46,908
We'd be sitting by a warm fire
right now.

1197
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:49,449
And I made us come here.

1198
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:52,350
And now it's too late.

1199
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,287
No.
It's never too late.

1200
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:58,120
Hey, look, I tried to get in
there, and I can't, all right?

1201
01:09:58,192 --> 01:09:59,625
I tried!
I failed!

1202
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:01,559
You try.
You fail.

1203
01:10:01,629 --> 01:10:03,620
You try.
You fail.

1204
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:07,361
But the only true failure
is when you stop trying.

1205
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:10,768
What do you want me to do?
Huh?

1206
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,601
Try again.

1207
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:21,937
Hold on!

1208
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:24,246
With what?

1209
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:32,615
- Aah!
- Aah!

1210
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:37,958
Elizabeth?

1211
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:44,230
Yes, my love.

1212
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:52,171
I'll be right back.

1213
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:55,010
Okay.
I'll wait here.

1214
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:58,552
Dearly beloved,

1215
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:01,350
we are gathered together here
in the sight of God

1216
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:04,858
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

1217
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:07,759
Dad!
Help us!

1218
01:11:09,864 --> 01:11:12,526
Michael!
Megan!

1219
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,295
Wilt thou, Edward Gracey,

1220
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:20,840
have this woman to be
thy wedded wife,

1221
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:23,468
to live together
after God's ordinance

1222
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:25,705
in the holiest state
of matrimony?

1223
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,008
I will.

1224
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:34,647
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw,

1225
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:37,520
take this man to be
your lawful husband,

1226
01:11:37,592 --> 01:11:43,155
to love and cherish in death
as you did in life?

1227
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,061
I do.

1228
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:45,998
Whoa!

1229
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:54,571
Aah!

1230
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:58,970
From this day forward, you
shall be joined together as one

1231
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:03,244
for all eternity
until the very end of time.

1232

[Speaking Latin]

1233

1234
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:21,425
- Dad!
- Dad!

1235
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:26,968
If anyone has any objections...

1236
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,504
Yeah, I got a few objections!

1237
01:12:37,885 --> 01:12:39,682
The next time I say
we're going to the lake,

1238
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:42,018
- we're going to the lake.
- Let's go.

1239
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:45,049
Get away from her.

1240
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:46,650
I lost her once.

1241
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:48,922
I don't intend
to let it happen again.

1242
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:51,556
This is not Elizabeth.
Ramsley, you tell him the truth.

1243
01:12:51,632 --> 01:12:54,624
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1244
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:55,862
Now you got amnesia, huh?

1245
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:57,996
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.

1246
01:12:58,072 --> 01:12:59,596
He's been lying to you
all along.

1247
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:02,074
I'm warning you, sir.

1248
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,201
Step away.

1249
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:04,869
Don't think 'cause
you pull out your sword

1250
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:06,038
I'm gonna let you marry my wife.

1251
01:13:06,113 --> 01:13:08,308
My patience is wearing thin.

1252
01:13:08,382 --> 01:13:10,612
Elizabeth, please, come along.

1253
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,347
I'm not Elizabeth.

1254
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:14,353
You must be.

1255
01:13:14,422 --> 01:13:16,549
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.

1256
01:13:16,624 --> 01:13:18,285
Ramsley wants you to think
she's Elizabeth

1257
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:20,293
so this curse would be lifted.

1258
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:22,454
That is absurd.

1259
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,122
Forgive me.

1260
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:25,495
If you're gonna kill me,
kill me.

1261
01:13:25,566 --> 01:13:27,056
But on the other side,

1262
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:28,897
I'm gonna be whipping your ass
for all eternity.

1263
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:31,564
So maybe you should read this
before you stab somebody.

1264
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:33,732
- What is it?
- It's Elizabeth's letter.

1265
01:13:33,808 --> 01:13:35,332
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.

1266
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:38,037
The one he stole.
You never saw it.

1267
01:13:46,053 --> 01:13:48,317
What's the meaning of this?

1268
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:52,689
Must we continue to listen
to the ramblings of a lunatic?

1269
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,489
But it is written in her hand.

1270
01:13:54,562 --> 01:13:56,996
Yeah, it's written in her hand.
Explain that, Ramsley.

1271
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:58,827
Well?

1272
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:06,105
Your union was unacceptable.

1273
01:14:06,173 --> 01:14:10,507
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1274
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:12,102
So you killed her.

1275
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:16,115
I told you it would be a mistake
