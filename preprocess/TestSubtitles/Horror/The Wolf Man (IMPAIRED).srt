1
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,882
Talbot Castle,
Mr. Larry.

2
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,887
Welcome home,
Larry.

3
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,769
I'm mighty glad
to be here, Father.

4
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,251
(CHUCKLING)

5
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,526
Hasn't changed
much, has it?

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,967
Not in 300 years, except for
a few modern conveniences.

7
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,121
Do you know
Paul Montford?

8
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,004
Sure. Just dropped
in to say hello.

9
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,684
Welcome home,
Larry.

10
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,091
We used to snitch
apples together.

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,241
(LAUGHING)

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,401
Now he's chief constable
of the district.

13
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,970
Which reminds me, I've
got to get to work.

14
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,451
See you tonight about
9:00, Sir John?

15
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,602
Fine. Glad to have
you back, Larry.

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,284
Thanks. Bye-bye.

17
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,323
So, old Paul turned
out to be a cop, huh?

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,886
Cop? Yeah, a cop. Policeman.
You know.

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,247
He's Captain Montford,
retired.

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,326
LARRY: Father.

21
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,444
I'm sorry about John.

22
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,244
Your brother's death
was a blow to all of us.

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,649
Sit down, won't you?

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,646
You know, Larry, there's developed
what amounts to a tradition

25
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,802
about the Talbot sons.

26
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,450
The elder, next in
line of succession

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,329
and so forth, is
considered in everything.

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,529
The younger frequently resents
the position in which he's found

29
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,090
and leaves home,
just as you did.

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,924
Yes, but, Father,
I'm here now.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,365
Fortunately.

32
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,088
But isn't it a sad commentary
on our relationship

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,241
that it took
a hunting accident

34
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,924
and your brother's
death to bring you?

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,923
ItreaHyisn%
as bad as it sounds.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,411
I've watched every
bit of news about you.

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,041
I was mighty proud when you won
the Belden Prize for research.

38
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,248
The whole business
is probably my fault.

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,685
See, the tradition
also insists

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,969
that the Talbots be the
stiff-necked, undemonstrative type.

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,884
Frequently, this has been carried
to very unhappy extremes.

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,371
Don't I know that.

43
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,771
Larry.

44
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,241
Let's decide, you and
I, that between us

45
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,561
there shall be no
more such reserve.

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,450
I'll do everything
that I can, sir.

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,329
Well, that should
be considerable.

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,482
You know, the 18 years you've been
away should have qualified you

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,131
to be of immeasurable
benefit to the estate,

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,885
since, in a great many ways, we are a
backward people, but don't quote me.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,121
(DOOR CLOSES)

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,441
SIR JOHN:
What have we got there?

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,806
It's from London, sir.

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,441
I think it's the new
part for the telescope.

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,205
Of course.
Come along, lad.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,523
Come on. Up to the attic.
It's an observatory now.

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,485
There you are, sir.
I think that has it.

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,483
I'll have
a look at it.

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,681
It's excellent! Where'd you
learn such precision work?

60
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,922
Optical company
in California.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,970
We did quite a job on that
Mount Wilson Observatory.

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,247
Are you interested
in astronomy?

63
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
Not especially.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,082
I'm all right with tools.

65
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,688
In fact, I've done quite a little
work with astronomical instruments,

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,240
but when it comes to theory,
I'm pretty much of an amateur.

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,846
All astronomers
are amateurs.

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,686
When it comes to the heavens,
there's only one professional.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,681
Fine.

70
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,447
Well, I've got some things to do
before lunch. I'll leave you to it.

71
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,529
GWEN: Good afternoon, sir.
May I help you?

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,127
Why,yes. I'm looking for a gift.
Something in earrings.

73
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,931
Certainly. We have
some very nice ones.

74
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,611
There's these diamond ones.
They're very smart.

75
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,125
Or how about
these pearl ones?

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,601
No. I don't think
any of those will do.

77
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,287
What I'm really looking for
is something half-moon shaped

78
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,526
with spangles on it.

79
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,489
Golden.
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,324
We haven't any
like that just now.

81
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,801
Oh, yes, you have.
Don't you remember?

82
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,724
On your dressing table,
up in your room.

83
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,801
In my room?

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,645
Yes. Would you mind
getting them for me?

85
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,247
(STAMMERING) Well,
they're not for sale.

86
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,005
Well, I can't say
that I blame you.

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,162
They look so well on you.

88
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,761
Well, perhaps my father can help you.
I'll call him.

89
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,410
No, no, that
won't be necessary.

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,041
As long as I can't have the
earrings, perhaps I...

91
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,770
I'll buy a cane.

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,843
Tell me, how did you know about
the earrings in my room?

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,005
I'm psychic. Every time I see a
beautiful girl, I know all about her.

94
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,048
Just like that.

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
What kind of
cane would you like?

96
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,082
We have daywear
or eveningwear.

97
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,645
It doesn't matter.

98
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,202
There's this one, it's very smart.
Solid-gold top.

99
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,567
No, I don't think
that'll do.

100
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,043
Well, how about the little dog?
That would suit you.

101
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,610
No, thanks.

102
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,605
Well, here's one.
Would make a good putter.

103
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,210
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, it would.

104
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,327
That's funny.
Another dog.

105
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,004
No, that's a wolf.

106
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,844
A wolf?
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,130
A wolf and a star.

108
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,050
What does that mean?

109
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,724
I thought you said
you were psychic.

110
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,442
I am, but this is only wood and
silver, and it hasn't blue eyes.

111
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,926
Well then, that stick is
priced at three pounds.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,402
Three pounds? 15 dollars
for an old stick?

113
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,289
Well, that's a
very rare piece.

114
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,091
It shows the wolf and the pentagram,
the sign of the werewolf.

115
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,049
Werewolf?
What's that?

116
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,045
That's a human being who, at certain
times of the year, changes into a wolf.

117
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,202
You mean, runs around
on all fours

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,284
and bites and snaps
and bays at the moon?

119
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,727
(EXCLAIMS) Even worse
than that, sometimes.

120
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,527
What big eyes
you have, Grandma.

121
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,770
<i>Little Red Riding Hood<i>
was a werewolf story.

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,561
Of course, there have been many others.
There's an old poem,

123
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,241
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night

124
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,926
"May become a wolf
when the wolfsbane blooms

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,604
"and the autumn
moon is bright"

126
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,524
Yes, but what's this
pentagram business?

127
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,523
Every werewolf is
marked with that,

128
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,683
and sees it in the palm
of his next victim's hand.

129
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,366
Look, lady, if you're trying
to scare me out of here,

130
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,647
you're not
getting very far.

131
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,046
I'll take the cane.

132
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,451
(LAUGHS)

133
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,921
Please tell me, have you
ever seen me before?

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,561
Of course. How do you suppose
I knew about the earrings?

135
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,125
I can't remember ever...

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,486
Tell you what we'll do.

137
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,803
We'll take a little walk tonight
and we'll talk it over.

138
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,927
No.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,650
(HORSES APPROACHING)

140
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,721
See you at 8:00.

141
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,847
No!

142
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,286
Gypsies, huh?

143
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,169
Yes, they're
fortune-tellers.

144
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,402
They pass through
here every autumn.

145
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,006
You know, I haven't had
my fortune told in years.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,525
How about tonight?

147
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,681
No.

148
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,328
Fine, I'll be
here at 8:00.

149
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,962
Yes, that's the
sign of the werewolf.

150
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,247
That's just a legend,
though, isn't it?

151
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,688
Yes, but like most legends, it
must have some basis in fact.

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
It's probably an
ancient explanation

153
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,208
of the dual personality
in each of us.

154
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,248
How does it go?

155
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,449
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night

156
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,649
"May become a wolf

158
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,728
That's funny.
That's the same thing

159
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,962
the girl in
the antique shop said.

160
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,611
SIR JOHN: Oh, you met
Gwen Conliffe, have you?

161
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,880
So that's her name!

162
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,485
I was just looking
the town over.

163
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,086
Naturally. Continue
to look it over.

164
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,884
But I want you to know
not only the pretty girls,

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,042
but the old men and women
and the young men.

166
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,407
Get to know all about them, Larry.
They're nice people.

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,484
They're your people. After all,
you're going to run the estate.

168
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,563
Of course, I want to
know all of them.

169
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,564
You seem to have made
a pretty good start.

170
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,166
Run along.
Get on with the good work.

171
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,561
All right, thanks.
Good night.

172
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,051

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,363
Oh! It's you.

175
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,489
Why, of course.
Who did you expect?

176
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,085
Why, nobody.

177
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,447
I told you I couldn't
go out with you.

178
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,205
And yet you wore those
earrings that I like.

179
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,044
Well, that was
just because I...

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,451
Oh, come on.

181
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,682
I don't want to go alone.

182
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,161
I'm really
afraid of the dark.

183
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
And, you see,
I wore my cane, too.

184
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,361
Jenny?

185
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,124
This is Jenny Williams. She wants
to have her fortune told, too.

I'm very pleased
to meet you, Mr...

Just call me Larry.

So you know
that one, too, eh?

Of course. Everyone
knows about werewolves.

We've come to have
our fortunes told.

Can you really
read the future?

I will not disappoint you,
my lady.

Will you step inside, please?

202

Do you mind
if I go in first?

203
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,723
No, no.
Go right ahead.

204
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,290
Go on, silly.

boy's got, isn't it?

We didn't come down to
listen in on Jenny, did we?

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,605
No.

209
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,682
Well, maybe if you took
a little walk with me,

210
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,967
I could tell
your fortune.

211
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,926
So you're
a fortune-teller.

212

Uh-huh.

213
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,571
Is that how you knew
about the earrings?

214
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,091
Well, not exactly.

215
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,481
You see, a telescope has
a mighty sharp eye.

216
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,570
It brings the stars so close that
you feel you can almost touch them.

217
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,608
- A telescope?
- Sure.

218
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,728
And it does the same thing
to people in their rooms.

219
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,643
That is, if you point it
in the right direction.

220
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,767
Oh, you wouldn't.

221
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,730
Well, now, I was only
testing the refractor.

222
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,124
I didn't know about you, and, all
of a sudden, there you were.

223
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,487
Well, from now on, I'll be
sure to draw the curtains.

224
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,928
Don't do that! I mean,
not on account of me.

Yes, I'm afraid I do.

tell you I'm engaged.

there.

him in the Guards.

here, looking after the estate.

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,643
- Make a note of that, Twiddle.
- Very well, sir.

316
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,085
What's this?

(EXCLAIMS)

318
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,241
A stick with a
horse's-head handle.

319
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,448
It's not a horse's head.
That's a wolf's head.

320
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,445
Mr. Frank? Them tracks back there.
A wolf!

321
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,249
- Make a note, Twiddle.
- Very well, sir.

324
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,491

at those tracks.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

328
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,163
Larry. Shouldn't you
be in your bed?

329
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
No. I'm all right.

330
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,361
Good morning,
Larry.

331
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,441
This is
Dr. Lloyd.

332
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,046
You frightened us
last night, my boy.

333
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,329
I'm sorry. I guess I
did kind of pass out.

334
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,761
Is this
your stick?

335
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,171
Why, of course.

336
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,447
That's the one I
killed the wolf with.

337
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,048
Larry, Bela the Gypsy
was killed last night.

338
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,726
They found your
stick by the body.

339
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,043
You mean, Bela the
fortune-teller?

340
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,121
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,004
I only saw
a wolf.

342
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,248
He bit me.
Look here.

343
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,331
Well, that's funny.

344
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,009
It must have healed up.

345
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,770
Larry, Paul wants to ask
you some questions.

346
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,966
Why, sure, sure.
Go ahead.

347
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,883
No, I think we ought
to leave him alone.

348
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,644
What's the
matter with you?

349
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,768
Paul wants to question him.
Go ahead, Paul.

350
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,923
Yeah, go ahead. But don't
try to make me believe

351
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,321
that I killed a man when I
know that I killed a wolf.

352
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,927
Yes, yes. We're all
a little bit confused.

353
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,048
He needs a good rest.

354
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,605
We'll talk to
you later, Larry.

355
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,330
Come on, Doctor.

356
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,209
Coming, Sir John?

357
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,362
Yeah. I'll be
down in a minute.

358
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,451
Now, Larry, will you stop
worrying and let me handle this?

359
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,330
But they're treating
me like I was crazy!

360
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,802
I'm not accusing him
of foul play, Sir John,

361
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,850
but, after all, two people are
dead, and I am chief constable.

362
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,968
That's no reason to make a
great mystery out of it.

363
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,485
You talk like a
detective in a novel.

364
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,291
Now, please, gentlemen. There's
a very simple explanation.

365
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,051
A dog or a wolf attacked Jenny
Williams, that's proven.

366
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,851
When she cried for help, Larry
and Bela went to her rescue.

367
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,970
It was dark. Excitement and confusion.
The Gypsy was killed.

368
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,530
What about
Bela's bare feet?

369
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,762
He just didn't have time
to put his shoes on.

370
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,410
And what about this
nonexistent wound?

371
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,641
Larry imagined
he'd been bitten.

372
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,371
After all, the beast jumped at
him and tore his coat to shreds.

373
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,169
Still, he insists
he received a wound.

374
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,366
You tell me his
coat was bloody

375
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,487
when the two women
brought him in.

376
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,801
Surely, a wound
can't heal overnight.

377
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,168
The patient is mentally disturbed.
Perhaps the shock did it.

378
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,323
I'd rather you didn't bother
him with questions just now.

379
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,926
You policemen are
always in such a hurry.

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,321
As if dead men
hadn't all eternity.

381
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,006
Well,you'll be declaring
me a mental case next.

382
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,651
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no.
I wouldn't dare.

383
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,324
Thank you.

384
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,846
In return, I won't question your
patient again, until you think fit.

385
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,285
Thank you.

386
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,010
It's the Gypsy
fortune-teller.

387
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,923
And the man
that killed him.

388
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,004
PRIEST: But, my dear woman, we can't
bury this man without prayer.

389
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,765
There is nothing
to pray for, sir.

390
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,686
Bela has entered a much
better world than this.

391
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,651
At least, so you ministers
always say, sir.

392
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,044
And so it is. But that's no reason
to hold a pagan celebration.

393
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,929
I hear your people
are coming to town,

394
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,049
dancing and singing
and making merry.

395
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,411
For a thousand years, we Gypsies
have buried our dead like that.

396
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,610
I couldn't break the custom
even if I wanted to.

397
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,126
Fighting against
superstition is as hard

398
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,567
as fighting
against Satan himself.

399
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,611
The way you walked was thorny,
through no fault of your own.

400
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,487
But as the rain
enters the soil,

401
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,086
the river enters the sea,

402
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,644
so tears run to
a predestined end.

403
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,285
Your suffering is over,
Bela, my son.

404
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,725
Now you will find peace.

405
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,842
But, my dear, there's nothing
they can accuse you of.

406
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,567
Now, here, why don't you go
up to your room and lie down?

407
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,007
I don't want to
be alone, Father.

408
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,845
As soon as I close
my eyes, I see Jenny.

409
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,489
I'd rather stay here.

410
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
Why, of course, my dear.
Of course.

411
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,521
Well, ladies. What
can I do for you...

412
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,601
Where is she?

413
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,761
CHARLES: Why, what do you
want to know from her?

414
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
I want to know why she left my little
Jenny all alone with the Gypsy.

415
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,845
Well,I suppose she
didn't want to be there

416
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,160
while the fortune
was being told.

417
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,401
Oh, what a lie!

418
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,050
You know she just wanted to
walk out in the dark with...

419
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,441
Now! You mustn't speak
of my Gwen like that.

420
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,285
(SCOFFING) Listen to him!
There's a fine father for you.

421
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,044
How dare you permit her to
walk out with other men

422
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,485
when she's engaged
to Frank Andrews.

423
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,800
CHARLES: She didn't
do anything wrong.

424
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,006
"Anything wrong"?

425
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,650
It's because of her that my
little Jenny was killed.

426
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,801
Now, that's enough!

427
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,884
She's to blame. I always knew that
innocent little face was just...

428
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,689
CHARLES: Now come on, outside!
Outside, all of you.

429
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,967
You'll not get rid of me
before I know the truth.

430
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,690
I want to know
what she was doing

431
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,364
while my little
Jenny was being murdered.

432
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,930
I'll tell you
what she was doing.

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,684
All right, tell me.

434
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,565
Come on. Come on.
Speak up. What was it?

435
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,165
Don't you dare touch me.

436
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,890
You and your fine daughter.

437
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,406
You've not heard
the last of this.

(DOOR CLOSING)

439
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,561
What's gotten into them?

440
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,290
Well, I...
I really don't know.

441
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,163
I'm sorry, sir, about getting
Gwen into this mess.

442
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,844
But there really
wasn't anything wrong.

443
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,922
I trust
my daughter, sir.

444
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,925
I hope that she didn't
hear all this row.

445
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,001
Tell me, is she in?

446
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,844
Yes, she's
in the parlor.

447
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
May I see her, please?

448
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,685
Why, of course.

449
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,091
Thank you.

450
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,841
Larry!

451
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,362
Oh, you...
You heard them.

452
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,566
Yes.

453
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,851
I suppose you can't
blame them too much.

454
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,208
Kind of a mess, isn't it?

455
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,523
I came over to tell you
how sorry I am about Jenny.

456
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,207
Tell me, just exactly
what did happen?

457
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,044
Well...

458
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,044
I saw a wolf attacking her,
and I killed it.

459
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,202
In the fight, it bit me.

460
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,282
This morning,
there's no sign of the wound.

461
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,726
Now they're trying
to make me believe

462
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,485
that I killed Bela,
the fortune-teller.

463
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,249
Well, maybe there wasn't a wolf.
It was dark and foggy,

464
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,766
and, well, perhaps
the story I told you

465
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,366
about the werewolf
confused you.

466
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,250
Why does everyone insist
that I'm confused?

00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,607
Hello, Mr. Conliffe.
ls Gwen in?

470
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,206
Yes, but she
has a visitor.

471
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,362
Larry Talbot?
Yes.

472
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,523
Well, that's all right.
I want to see him, too.

473
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,601
Larry, this is
Frank Andrews.

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,241

(GROWLING)

477
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,291
You'd better take
him outside, Frank.

478
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,442
All right.
Come on, come on.

479
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,650
So that's him, huh?

480
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,530
Yes. We grew up
together.

481
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,602
He looks like
a nice enough chap.

482
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,011
What does he do?

483
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,050
He's the gamekeeper for
your father's estate.

484
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,760
Oh.

485
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,088
Glad to know you,
Andrews.

486
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,645
I just came over to see
that Gwen was all right.

487
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,688
I guess I'd
better be going now.

488
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,807
Goodbye, Gwen.

489
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,042
Goodbye.

490
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,404
Frank, why were
you so rude?

491
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,801
Well, I'm sorry,
but...

492
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,327
I couldn't take my eyes off
that walking stick of his.

493
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,880
Gwen, be careful,
will you?

494
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,001
Careful?

495
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,367
Yes. He's been away
for 18 years, I know,

496
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,842
but he's still the son
of Sir John Talbot.

497
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,810
I see. And I'm
the daughter of Conliffe,

498
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,848
who owns the antique
shop, is that it?

499
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:19,211
Yes, that and, well, there's something
very tragic about that man,

500
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,291
and I'm sure that nothing but harm
will come to you through him.

502
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,806
Now aren't you
glad I brought you?

503
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,289
There's Larry Talbot.

504
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,886
Let's go and
say hello, eh?

505
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,009
I just wanted to show you
that I'm not jealous.

506
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,130
Larry Talbot!

507
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,725
Saw you walking
along by yourself,

508
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,086
thought you might
like to join us.

509
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,491
Well, thanks. I was
just on my way home.

510
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
Don't say that.

511
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,922
Come on. We'll have
some fun together.

512
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,126
Please do,
Larry.

513
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,247
Two guns,
please.

514
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,606
Yes, sir.

515
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,130
See what you can do.

516
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,770
All right.

517
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,086
He seems to be able
to handle a rifle.

518

(GUN FIRES)

519
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,531
Go ahead and shoot,
before he bites you.

520
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,125
Bad luck.

521
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,850
(GUN FIRES)

522
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,890
See? Nothing to it.
Care to try another one?

523
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,520
No, thanks.
You win.

524
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,130
He's unstrung.

525
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,729
Long trip.

526
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,371
That unfortunate accident
the other night.

527
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,405
MALEVA: You have been
a long while coming.

528
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,766
I'm not buying anything.

529
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,888
And I am not
selling anything.

530
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,849
I expected you sooner.

531
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,330
I remember you.

532
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,290
That night,
and in the crypt.

533
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,885
Go inside.

534
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,523
You killed the wolf.

535
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,843
Well, there's no
crime in that, is there?

536
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,082
The wolf was Bela.

537
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,846
You think I don't know the
difference between a wolf and a man?

538
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,890
Bela became a wolf,
and you killed him.

539
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,646
A werewolf can be killed
only with a silver bullet,

540
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,884
or a silver knife or a stick
with a silver handle.

541
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,361
You're insane. I tell
you, I killed a wolf!

542
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,283
A plain, ordinary wolf!

543
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,362
Take this charm.

544
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,523
The pentagram,
the sign of the wolf.

545
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,762
It can break
the evil spell.

546
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,211
Evil spell,
pentagram, wolfsbane.

547
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,203
I'm sick of the whole thing!
I'm gonna get out of here.

548
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,241
Whoever is bitten by
a werewolf and lives

549
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,482
becomes a werewolf himself.

550
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,725
Quit handing
me that.

551
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,450
You're just
wasting your time.

552
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,482
The wolf bit you,
didn't he?

553
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,848
Yeah. Yeah,
he did.

554
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,163
Wear this charm
over your heart always.

555
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,801
All right,
I'll take it.

556
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,881
What's it worth to you?
I'll give you...

557
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,564
Do you dare to
show me the wound?

558
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,687
What?

559
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,161
Do you dare to
show me the wound?

560
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,487
Go now,
and Heaven help you!

561
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,526

562
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,045
Gwen!

563
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,690
Gosh, I'm glad
to see you.

564
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,489
I thought you
left with Frank.

565
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,404
We had a quarrel,
and then I...

566
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,767
Well, I'll take
you home, then.

567
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,409
We better go this way.

568
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,409
Quite a hectic night,
wasn't it?

569
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,720
Yes.

570
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,764
What's that?

571
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,330
That?

572
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,603
That's a charm. I just
saw the old Gypsy woman.

573
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,164
They give you quite
a sales talk, don't they?

574
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,651
Let me see.

575
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,682
The pentagram.

576
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,809
Yes. She said that
I was a werewolf.

577
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,083
But surely you...

578
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,009
Well, you don't
believe that...

579
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,600
Gwen, I won't
need this.

580
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,404
I want you to have it.

581
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,484
It'll protect you.

582
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,528
Protect me? From whom?

583
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,161
Me. Just in case.

584
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,566
I never accept a present without
giving something in return.

585
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,610
Here's a penny.

586
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,324
That isn't enough.

589
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,245
I must go, too.

590
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,731
But, Gwen...

591
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,364
Hey, hey, hey! What's
all the excitement?

592
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,522
There's a werewolf

Mr. Twiddle?

598
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,286
Of course I did. Otherwise,
I'd be snuggled all in bed.

599
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,771
Sounded like
a wild animal.

600
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,808
Might be some beast
the Gypsies left behind.

go and have a look.

Yes.

You're up early.

617
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,370
Yes. I heard people
in the corridor.

618
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,566
Is there
anything wrong?

619
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,484
Richardson was killed last night.
The gravedigger.

620
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,006
The tracks lead
up to this house.

622

624
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,603
Where do you
suppose a wolf came from?

625
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,604
He might have escaped
from the circus or a zoo.

626
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,810
What is this story about a
man turning into a wolf?

627
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,689
You mean the werewolf?

628
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,807
Yes, sir.

629
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,530
Well, it's an old legend.

630

You'll find something like it in the
folklore of nearly every nation.

00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,483
The scientific name
for it is lycanthropia.

632
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,642
It's a variety
of schizophrenia.

633
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,006
That's all Greek to me.

634
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,531
Well, it is Greek.

635
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,809
It's a technical expression
for something very simple.

636
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,043
The good and evil
in every man's soul.

637
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,249
In this case, evil takes
the shape of an animal.

638
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,087
I can figure out
most anything

639
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,766
if you give me electric
current and tubes and wires,

640
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,649
something I can
do with my hands.

641
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,245

you can't even touch...

with you, Larry?

00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,121
Oh...

644
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,489
Oh, nothing, sir.

645
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,961
But do you believe
in these yarns?

646
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,730
Larry, to some people,
life is very simple.

647
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,566
They decide that this is good, that
is bad, this is wrong, that's right.

648
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,608
There's no right and wrong,
no good and bad.

649
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,729
No shadings and grays,
all blacks and whites.

650
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,768
That'd be
Paul Montford.

651
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,080
Exactly.

652
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,242
Now, others of us find
that good, bad, right,

653
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,926
wrong are many-sided,
complex things.

654
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,570
We try to see every side.

655
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,883
But the more we see,
the less sure we are.

656
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,521
Now, you ask me if I believe
a man can become a wolf.

657
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,246
Well, if you mean, can he take on the
physical characteristics of an animal?

658
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,006
No. It's fantastic.
However, I do believe

659
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,562
that most anything can happen
to a man in his own mind.

662

You know, Larry,
belief in the hereafter

663
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,850
is a very healthy
counterbalance

Last night, it caught
up with Richardson.

667
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,010
Many's the grave
he dug for others.

668
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,320
Now they're
digging one for him.

669
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,687
I don't dare open my door
anymore, for fear of that beast.

670
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,286
That beast. Has
anybody ever seen it?

671
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,522
I don't think
it even exists.

Why? They'll
laugh at you.

688
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,090
There's no question
about it. It's a wolf.

689
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,811
Probably hiding in the woods somewhere.
What about traps?

690
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,086
We've got to do
something before

completely hysterical.

Come along,
Larry.

694
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,610
We're discussing this wolf that seems
to be roaming the countryside.

695
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,401
Yes, you saw him. What's he like?
Is he a big fellow?

696
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,164
It isn't a wolf.

What do
you mean?

698
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,610
It's a werewolf.

699

Werewolf?

700
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,006
Maybe he's right.

701
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,730
Let's have a hunt
and drive it out.

702
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,451
That'd be a valuable addition to
anybody's collection of animals.

703
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,729
Just imagine having a stuffed werewolf
staring at you from the wall.

704
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,121
LLOYD: I wouldn't
joke about it, Paul.

705
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,443
Doctor, do you believe
in werewolves?

706
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,124
Why, I believe that a man
lost in the mazes of his mind

707
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,487
may imagine
that he's anything.

708
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,326
Science has
found many examples

709
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,289
of the mind's
power over the body.

710
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,921
The case of the stigmata appearing
on the skin of zealots.

711
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,126
Self-hypnotism.

712
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,010
But if a man isn't even
thinking about the thing,

713
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,128
isn't interested in it,

714
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,488
then how could he hypnotize
himself with it?

715
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,451
It might be a case of mental
suggestion plus mass hypnotism.

716
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,682
You mean by that,
that he could be

717
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,489
influenced by
the people about him?

718
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,886
Yes. Come now, Doctor.

719
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,651
You're letting your science run
away with your common sense.

720
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,883
Have you ever met
a werewolf, Doctor?

721
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,485
Not that I know of.

722
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,087
Doctor, can these
sick people be cured?

723
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,164
Not they. An asylum's the
only safe place for them.

724
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,288
Any disease of
the mind can be cured

725
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,170
with the cooperation
of the patient.

726
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,641
Well, while you gentlemen are
figuring it out scientifically,

727
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,131
I think I'll go
and set a few traps.

728
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,884
Yes, I'll help you.
We may not find

729
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,246
anything more
than a diseased mind,

730
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,966
but even that
may be interesting.

731
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,166
Doctor, I've got
to talk to you.

732
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,841

go and get some rest.

Go on, Larry.

734

You're the one
I want to talk to.

735
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,531
I didn't like what you said
to him about mass hypnotism.

736
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,523
Sir John, your son
is a sick man.

737
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,045
He's received
a shock that has caused

738
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,884
definite
psychic maladjustment.

739
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,405
You must send him
out of this village.

740
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,369
You're talking
like a witch doctor.

741
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,124
If my son is ill, the
best place for him is

742
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,850
in his own home,
proving his innocence.

743
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,570
Does the prestige
of your family name

744
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,165
mean more to you
than your son's health?

745
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,605
Oh, nonsense.

746
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,170
The one way for him
to get cured is to stay

747
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,123
here and fight
his way out of this.

748
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,890
And I tell you that
shock therapy is too

749
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,564
strong for him in
his present state.

00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,891
I hear you
talking to someone?

788
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,610
It was Master Larry.

789
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,369
All right.
Go along.

790
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,321
Who was that?

791
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,561
Larry Talbot.

792
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,531
Larry!

793
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,806
Gwen,
I'm going away.

794
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,363
Away? But why?

795
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,489
I've got to go.
I can't stay here any longer.

796
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,121
Let me go with you. I'll fetch a few
things and be back in a minute.

797
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,441
No, no.
I'm going alone.

798
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,761
But I can help you!

799
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,407
You wouldn't want to run away
with a murderer, would you?

800
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,086
Larry, you're not.
You know you're not.

801
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,926
I killed Bela.
I killed Richardson.

802
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,527
If I stay around here much longer, you
can't tell who's going to be next!

803
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,486
Wait...

804
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,564
It might even...

805
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,846
Please!

806
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,287
I've still got the charm
you gave me, remember?

807
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,880
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but I'm afraid.

808
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,364
Larry! What is it?

809
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,365
Your hand.

810
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,330
I can't see anything.

811
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,164

813

I'm going with Larry.

814
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,964
No, it's no use!

815
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,370
Going out, Larry?

816
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,210
Father, I've got to
get away from here.

817
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,766
Bela the Gypsy
was a werewolf.

818
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,161
I killed him with
that silver cane.

819
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,567
I was bitten. Look.

820
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,168
The pentagram.

821
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,164
That scar could be made
by most any animal.

822
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,641
Yes, but it's the
sign of the werewolf.

823
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,484
They say that he can
see it in the palm

824
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,324
of the hand of
his next victim.

825
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,289
That's hard to believe.

826
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,601
I saw it. Tonight.
In Gwen's hand.

827

you get rid of this fear,

They caught
nothing in the traps,

835
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,571
so now they're
going to hunt the wolf.

836

and pentagrams.

You're not a child, Larry,
you're a grown man,

and you believe in the
superstitions of a Gypsy woman.

No, but the scar!

caught in a trap tonight.

I don't know
how I got there.

853
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,202
The old Gypsy woman
helped me get away.

854
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,084
And now they're all
out hunting for me.

855
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,764
Listen to me.

856

You're Lawrence Talbot.

857
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,446
This is Talbot Castle.

858
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,081
You believe those men can come
in here and take you out?

859
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,164
No. I'll go out to them.

860
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,727
I can't help myself.

861
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,486
Then I'll see to it that
you can't go out to them.

862
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,130
Come on, Larry.

863
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,803
There. You're fast
to the chair,

864

and I'll bolt the door

Oh, no.

886

through all this hullabaloo.

cured, tonight.

Strapped him to the chair.

891

Turned him to the window so that
he'd see something of the hunt.
