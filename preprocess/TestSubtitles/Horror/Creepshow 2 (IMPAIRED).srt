1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,589
(Bell tolling)

2
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,480
(Man laughing)

3
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,116
(Cackling)

4
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,476
I've never seen anyone so impatient, Billy.

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,793
As if your life depended on
getting the first copy off the presses.

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,155
(Cackling)

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,072
Aaah!

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,589
(Screeching)

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,589
(Cackling)

10
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,431
(Screeches)

11
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,310
(Thunder crashes)

12
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,835
(Thunder crashes)

13
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,750
(Booming voice) Welcome, kiddies...

14
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,991
to another edition of Creepshow.

15
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,757
It's amazing that you boors and ghouls
keep coming back for more.

16
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,675
You must be gluttons for punishment, eh?
(Guffaws)

17
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,433
Well... (Chuckles)

18
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,594
I guess you bloodsuckers
enjoy being repulsed, eh?

19
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,355
You're loyal to the gore.
Well, that's good.

20
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,079
We don't want any dead wood

21
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,879
in our fraternity of fright fairs

22
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,715
that just happens to be the subject
of our first nauseating novella,

23
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,553
a nasty little bonecracker titled

24
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,189
Old Chief Wood'nhead.

25
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,748
- (Dog barking)
- (Creep chuckles)

26
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,191
(Hammering on metal)

27
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,637
(Engine humming)

28
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,553
# Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care

29
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,238
# Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care

30
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,152
# Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care

31
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,113
# As long as I'm drinking
Jimmy's crack corn #

32
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,111
(Laughs)

33
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,354
Now, you stop that grinning. You've heard
me sing that silly song a thousand times.

34
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,631
Yeah, it's time for a touch-up, my old friend.

35
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,439
The sun's bleachin' out your colours again.

36
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,270
Now, I'm gonna try and keep
my hands steady.

37
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,910
But I ain't what I used to be.

38
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,309
There.

39
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,631
That ain't too bad. That ain't too bad at all.

40
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,557
We've got to keep your war paint fresh.

41
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,073
A big chief without war paint
is like...is like..

42
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,675
Like a storekeeper without a town
to sell his goods to.

43
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,349
Martha, me and the Chief been standing
on this porch for 30 years.

44
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,352
- We ain't about to move now.
- (She scoffs)

45
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,193
I'm not asking you to move, Ray.

46
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,191
I wouldn't want to move myself.

47
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,875
Well, what are you asking, Martha?
What do you want me to do?

48
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,078
I want you to quit, Ray. Just quit.

49
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,116
(Ray) Quit?

50
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,794
- You mean close the store.
- (Martha) Yes.

51
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,270
While you still have time left
to get something out of life

52
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,794
instead of always putting in.

53
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,756
Martha...

54
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,628
This store...made it possible
for us to get married.

55
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,114
This store sent the girls off to school.

56
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,915
This store has given us the savings
to give to our grandchildren.

57
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,234
This store, Ray, at one time,
sat in the middle of a thriving young town,

58
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,357
which seemed to have a future to it.

59
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,396
Look at it now.

60
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,474
The town of Dead River is
finally living up to its name.

61
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,949
It's dead, Ray.

62
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,115
The jobs have moved away,

63
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,430
the money has moved away...

64
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,232
Ray, it's been four days since you've had
a cash-paying customer.

65
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,030
It's been four weeks since anyone gave you
any money on a credit account.

66
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,317
(Sighs) If you keep supporting these people,

67
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,233
we won't have anything to leave
to the grandchildren,

68
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,311
except good intentions.

69
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,557
Well, there's worse things to inherit...

70
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,710
than good intentions, Martha.

71
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,158
- Good intentions built this country.
- Good intentions tore this country down.

72
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,196
They're beginning to tear you down.

73
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,999
Do you think these people care about you?

74
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,278
They'll take your charity until it dries up
and then they'll leave you.

75
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,797
You and...that wooden lndian of yours.

76
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,676
I won't dry us up, Martha.

77
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,716
I promise you that.

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,550
It's just that we took a lot of healthy profits
out of this town.

79
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,713
I'd just like to give some of them profits back
in its time of need.

80
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,633
(Engine spluttering and revving)

81
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,551
Oh, there's Benjamin Whitemoon.

82
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,158
Hmph! In a chauffeur-driven limousine.

83
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,151
Now, Martha, be nice to him.

84
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,993
Oh, I'll be nice to him all right.

85
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,355
Because you want me to be.

86
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,477
But don't let him take too much advantage.

87
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,028
You're too good to these people, Ray.

88
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,709
(Gears crunching)

89
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,350
Oh, dust all over your war paint, Chief.

90
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,796
I should have learned by now
never to paint you on a dry day.

91
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,236
Yatahey, Ray Spruce.

92
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,553
Howdy, Benjamin.

93
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,351
Yatahey, Chief Wood'nhead.

94
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,233
(Laughs) The Chief says Yatahey.

95
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,390
What can I do for you this afternoon?

96
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,314
- May we go inside?
- Oh, yes. Sure, sure.

97
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,477
What can I get for you, Benjamin?

98
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,677
I am ashamed to stand inside this place

99
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,558
while my people are so much
in your debt, Ray Spruce.

100
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,589
There's no shame for an honest man,
Benjamin.

101
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,830
Times have been tough for all of us.

102
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,429
What do you need?

103
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,913
Good afternoon, Martha Spruce.

104
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,751
Good afternoon, Benjamin.

105
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,356
I have brought you this.

106
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,591
What in the...? What in the world is this?

107
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,353
It is the "alinneh".

108
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,158
(Speaks Navajo)

109
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,268
These are the things
my people hold precious.

110
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,388
Each family has offered
one of its most cherished treasures.

111
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,870
You will keep them until our debts are paid.

112
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,235
If we cannot pay in two autumns,

113
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,959
the "allineh" are yours forever.

114
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,632
No!

115
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,359
No, no. There's no way I can accept this.

116
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,510
(Speaks Navajo)

117
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
(Speaks Navajo)

118
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,036
Uh, wait, Benjamin.

119
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,838
Wait.

120
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,388
Wait. Wait.

121
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,398
Wait.

122
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,113
Look.

123
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,149
There's no way in hell I'm going to take
these things away from your people.

124
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,197
It is a bad thing to borrow.

125
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,316
It is a worse thing to beg.

126
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,312
While you hold the "allineh",

127
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,197
we are borrowers.

128
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,032
We can still have pride.

129
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,712
If you give the treasure back to us,

130
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,030
you make us beggars again.

131
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,351
Such insult could never be forgiven.

132
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,755
(Speaks Navajo)

133
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,992
Good afternoon, Martha Spruce.

134
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,508
Goodbye, Benjamin. I mean...

135
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,034
(Clears throat)..good afternoon.

136
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,876
- Keep them safe.
- I'll guard them with my life.

137
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,477
Times are gonna take an upturn, Benjamin.

138
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,711
(Sniffs) I can smell prosperity in the air.

139
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,671
(Speaks Navajo)

140
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,591
I wish that it could be.

141
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,070
Hágoónee, friend.

142
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,594
Hágoónee.

143
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,398
(Martha) Oh, Benjamin.

144
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,789
I was just scolding Ray.

145
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,872
I was telling him that he puts
too much trust in people,

146
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,475
that they've never earned it
and they don't deserve it.

147
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,351
Well, you, you and your people have
certainly proven me wrong.

148
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,117
Hágoónee, Chief Wood'nhead.

149
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,789
(Car starting up)

150
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,909
(Ray) Oh, this is good country, Martha.

151
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,189
It'll come back to life some day.

152
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,195
It'll come back to life.

153
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,869
I'll finish your war paint
tomorrow, Chief. (Chuckles)

154
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,351
That's a promise.

155
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,073
How!

156
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,469
(Roars with laughter)

157
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,352
Go ahead, boys. Take what you want.

158
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,275
Wait a minute.

159
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,396
You...you can't just come in here...

160
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,358
Shut up, white eyes. Just shut the fuck up.

161
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,830
Or I'll shove something in your mouth
to keep you quiet.

162
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,832
Hey, Sam. Why don't we shove this
in his mouth?

163
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,433
(Whirring)

164
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,590
No! Shove this in his mouth.

165
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,877
Heep big! (Cackles)

166
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,076
You're disgusting.

167
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,593
Sam Whitemoon, you're a disgrace
to your people.

168
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,113
I said shut up, old man.

169
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,513
Your uncle Benjamin was just here.
He's one of the best men I know.

170
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,717
Hard to believe the same blood flows
in your veins.

171
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,189
I guess you don't hear so good, shitface.

172
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,589
I said shut up!

173
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,835
We're just here to do a little shopping.

174
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,037
We didn't get everything we needed
last time we were in.

175
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,759
You asked us to leave.
Remember, old man?

176
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,592
You were stealing things.

177
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,636
(Scoffs) We're stealing things now.

178
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,110
Why don't you ask us to leave, pruneface?

179
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,397
(Drawling) Yeah, why don't you
run us out of town, Sheriff?

180
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,313
Ask us nice. Say please.

181
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,552
- Pretty please, with sugar on it. Rarrr!
- (Cash register tings)

182
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,871
- Is this all the cash you got?
- That's all.

183
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,634
- Empty your pockets.
- I haven't got...

184
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,790
Empty your fucking pockets, asshole.

185
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,873
(Sam) Or I'll ask my buddy to bring me
something off the hardware shelf

186
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,713
that I can use to slice off your fingers.

187
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,791
(Crashing)

188
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,193
Fat Stuff

189
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,632
When we came in the back,
I saw a purse. Go get it, lady.

190
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,073
(Cash register closes)

191
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,789
Move, lady, or I'm gonna blow off
your old man's... (Navajo)!

192
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,079
- Any cute stuff back there...
- (Slap)

193
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,558
..I'll pull this trigger.

194
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,030
- This thing work?
- What?

195
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,873
The photo machine, does it work?

196
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,518
Yes.

197
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,794
(Sam) Look at this.

198
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,031
Phooo, look at this sweetheart.

199
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,716
Tell me this ain't a movie star.

200
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,795
What, are you kidding?

201
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,235
They gotta make me a movie star.

202
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,711
Hey, as soon as they see this hair,

203
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,394
they're gonna say, "Sam,

204
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,038
"get over here.

205
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,588
"Get in front of these cameras.

206
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,910
"There's 1 00 million women out there,

207
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,037
"just waiting to run that hair
between their legs."

208
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,437
Nine years it took me to grow this hair, man.

209
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,795
I'm not just fucking around here.

210
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,677
I'm going to Hollywood, man.

211
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,513
This hair is gonna get me paid and laid.

212
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,153
Over here, lady.

213
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,398
(Louder) Over here, lady.

214
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,310
Now, I want you to stand right over here

215
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,198
and don't move, OK?

216
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,759
Give me that.

217
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,072
(Buzzer and whirring)

218
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,518
Look at this.

219
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,349
Look at this.

220
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,034
Hey.

221
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,712
Hey, you know that movie,

222
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,191
about the guy that's got, like,
superpowers and shit because of his hair?

223
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,238
Then this bitch cuts his hair off.

224
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,958
And he gets weak.

225
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,315
He gets like an ordinary guy.

226
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,436
You know that movie?

227
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,999
I'm better-looking
than the guy in that movie.

228
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,275
- Don't you think?
- (Pinball dings)

229
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,956
Here, take a look.

230
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,553
Take a look.

231
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,635
Uh-uh! Stay right where you are, old man.

232
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,950
Unless you wanna see your lady in pieces.

233
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,473
Sam.

234
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,075
There's no cash around here,
we got all the shit we need. Let's go.

235
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,912
Not yet, rich boy.

236
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,038
- Did you know my buddy here was rich?
- No.

237
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,035
Well, his old man's rich. His old man
bought my buddy here a Firebird.

238
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,636
A fucking Firebird
that's gonna fly us all to Hollywood, USA.

239
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,318
And one more step and...bam!

240
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,673
Sam, there's nothing left for us to take.
There's nothing here we need.

241
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,957
Maybe there's nothing else you need,
rich boy.

242
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,115
But there's something else I need.

243
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,393
Go get your car, Cavanaugh.

244
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,435
Get your fucking car, rich boy. We're leaving
for LA sooner than we figured.

245
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,556
Hey, Cavanaugh.
You run out on me and I'll find you.

246
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,632
I ain't running out on you, Sam.
I ain't running nowhere.

247
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,429
- We're all in this together.
- Yeah, I know that, Sam.

248
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,712
There's one more item you have to turn over
if you want this woman to live.

249
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,552
What is it?

250
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,632
That bag of rock candy
my uncle brought here today.

251
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,596
That's it in your hand, isn't it?
Toss it over here and I'll let the lady go.

252
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,229
Sam, what are you talking about?
What do you mean, rock candy?

253
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,359
There's $10,000 worth of silver and stone
in that bag, man.

254
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,838
- The keys to the city of Los Angeles.
- (Martha yelps)

255
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,914
- Is that true, old man? Let me see.
- Sam, you can't take this.

256
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,958
This belongs to your people, to the tribe.

257
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,793
- No! Stop it!
- These are treasures

258
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,598
your people have had for years.

259
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,591
- If you take them...
- Stop it!

260
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,477
(Gunshot)

261

262
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,755
Martha?

263
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,278
Martha?

264
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,713
Let's go, Fat Stuff.

265
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,189
We got some money that needs spending.

266
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,556
Holy shit! Holy Jesus!

267
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,596
I've never seen nothing like that before.

268
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,113
Yeah.

269
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,392
Well, now you've seen it.

270
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,473
Now you're gonna forget it.

271
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,154
- Forget it?
- That's right, Fat Stuff.

272
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,037
Forget it.

273
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,395
We're going to Hollywood, Vince.

274
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,151
Hollywood?

275
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,515
You mean all of us? Me, too?

276
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,400
I wouldn't leave you behind, Fat Stuff.

277
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,393
Shit, man. I gotta have my slave with me
wherever I go.

278
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,759
Hollywood.

279
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,958
It's OK.

280
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,712
There's nobody around.

281
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,836
We're outta here.

282

We're outta here, Fat Stuff.

283
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,072
We're outta here, man.
We're outta here for good.

284
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,718
No more of this bullshit, man.

285
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,558
No more eatin' dust for a livin'.

286
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,992
There ain't no dust in Hollywood, man.

287
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,192
And there ain't no fuckin' tribe of

Yeah, whatever you say, Sam.

294
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,875
We all go home, round up
whatever shit we wanna take.

295

Rich boy, you pick me up at eleven.
Then we'll go get Fat Stuff.

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,431
'Don't you realise me?'

323
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,876
'There is something vaguely familiar about
you but, my, how you have changed.'

324
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,510
- (Thud, splintering glass)
- (Horse whinnies on TV)

325
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,438
(Smashing glass)

326
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,795
'Poor Diablo.'

327
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,759
- (Smashing glass)
- 'He wouldn't whinny if Loco wasn't around.'

328
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,592
'l look but I don't see...'

329
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,157
(Smashing glass)

330
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,036
'Look, Cisco, he realises me
even in my stripes.'

331
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,588
'Yes, Loco has more sense than you.'

332
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,955
(Whirring)

333
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,434
'You'll regret double-crossing me, Cisco.'

334
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,195
'l still say it's for your own good, Bob.
I know what I'm doing.'

335
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,909
- 'Why do you want to...?'
- Look at this sweetheart.

336
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,389
There's no way this kid can miss.

337
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,438
'And we don't like to do that to our friends.'

338
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,829
- 'Friends, my eye.'
- (Thud)

339
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,997
No.

340
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,877
You're not alive, man.

341
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,872
You can't be alive.

342
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,679
Come on, man! Come on!

343
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,918
(Blood-curdling yell)

344
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,995
(Yell continuing, slowing fading)

345
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,750
(Chickens clucking)

346
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,671
Now...

347
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,752
may your spirit rest, old warrior.

348
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,672
Hágoónee.

349
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,759
Hágoónee.

350
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,191
(Creep) 'Well, kiddies,

351
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,558
'that was quite a price
for young Sam Whitemoon to pay.'

352
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,915
'To pay, huh?'

353
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,037
Here's your package, Billy.

354
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,318
COD. Nine dollars and 99 cents.

355
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,597
Quite expensive for a toy
ordered out of a funny paper.

356
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,389
Creepshow is not a funny paper.

357
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,835
And this is no toy.

358
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,717
Well, what is it then?

359
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,792
It's a Venus flytrap bulb.

360
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,392
A Venus what bulb?

361
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,395
Venus flytrap. It's a plant that eats meat.

362
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,755
(Roars)

363
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,073
All that stuff's a jig.
Those are probably just petunia bulbs.

364
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,754
I don't think so, Mr Haig.

365
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,036
Still here, kiddies?

366
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,910
Well, if old Chief Wood'nhead
didn't drive you away,

367
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,549
you might enjoy this next splintering tale

368
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,871
whittled from the same wormwood.

369
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,270
It's a splashing little ditty

370
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,239
about some people who are
left stranded without a paddle

371
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,154
on a sea of blood.

372
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,232
This bubbly bonbon is titled...

373
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,390
The Raft.

374
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,675
(# Rock music blaring)

375
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,715
(Tyres screeching, hooting)

376
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,276
(Man)..thank you for waiting.

377
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,318
- (Woman) Pass the joint.
- (Man) Pass the joint!

378
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,197
Ha-ha!

379
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,636
Whoa! Pass the joint! Pass the joint!

380
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,237
It's almost Halloween, Randy. Cascade
Reach has been closed since Labor Day.

381
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,993
The raft will be there. I saw it last week.

382
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,674
We were on a geology field trip.

383
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,799
Just cos you saw it there last week
don't mean it's gonna be there now.

384
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,077
- (Hooter plays tune)
- Hey, Rachel!

385
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,350
Quiet down. You talk too much.

386
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,034
The raft... It'll be there. The raft...

387
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,076
(Coughs)..will be there.

388
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,354
A little bit of...

389
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,000
(Continues coughing)

390
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,274
Whoo!

391
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,349
Because what?

392
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,591
A little bit of summer
that somebody forgot to clean up.

393
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,830
The guys that own the lake

394
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,754
don't pull the raft in until the lake's
almost ready to freeze.

395
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,274
Well, it had better be there, Poncho.

396
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,798
This has been a long 50 miles.

397
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,348
I don't believe we're going swimming.

398
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,749
Why not? It'll be fun.

399
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,711
Right? (Whoops)

400
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,393
Whoa, personal foul.
Illegal use of hash, number 32.

401
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,514
- (Mimicking applause)
- The crowd goes crazy.

402
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,511
(Tyres squealing)

403
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,675
(Whooping)

404
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,955
Whoo! Whoa, yeah!

405
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,510
- (Girl laughs)
- Man!

406
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,513
There it is, just like you said, man.

407
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,789
God, it's beautiful.

408
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,878
It's so quiet.

409
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,157
There are only
a few summer homes on the lake.

410
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,238
Yes, everyone's gone by mid-September.

411
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,515
- (Whoops)
- You're actually gonna do it?

412
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,556
Swim out to that raft.

413
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,876
(Laughter)

414
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,633
(Girl) Stop! Deke!

415
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,957
Let's go!

416
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,119
- Jesus!
- Easy, Cisco! That water's 45 degrees.

417
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,998
50, tops. Your heart could stop.

418
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,033
I'm a premed. I know about these things.

419
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,988
Let's go.

420
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,028
(Deke) Let's go!

421
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,594
- Shit!
- (Laughter)

422
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,840
Come on! It's not so bad once you're in.

423
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,717
That's bullshit. Bullshit, man.

424
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,952
Just playing Deke's game
cos you hope to get laid out here.

425
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,669
Too damn cold to get laid.
Balls are gonna turn into ice cubes.

426
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,228
(Laughs)

427
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,436
Let's go, Poncho! Vámonos.

428
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,829
- Vente.
- Oh, Cisco.

429
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,718
Oh, Poncho!

430
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,268
(Randy) Laverne, Rachel, come on!

431
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,559
Oh, this is crazy, totally crazy.

432
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,200
(Boys whoop)

433
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,272
Yeah!

434
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,915
Oh, God! Oh, God!

435
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,355
(Gasps)

436
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,670
(Shrieks and gasps)

437
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,274
(Rock music still blaring)

438
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,031
- (Randy) Whoa!
- Whoo!

439
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,279
Hey, Poncho, how are you doing?

440
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,793
OK.

441
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,596
(Duck quacking)

442
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,311
Whoo!

443
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,038
(Duck squawks in distress)

444
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,389
- (Grunts) How you doing, Poncho?
- OK.

445
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,438
You think it's cold now, man.
Wait till you get out.

446
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,036
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, you are slow, Poncho.

447
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,270
Cold enough for you. Huh?

448
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,033
- You sobered up yet?
- Yeah.

449
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,475
I'm sober. I'm s-s-sober.

450
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,438
- How are you doing, ladies?
- (Girl) Go to hell!

451
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,553
Oh, Jeez.

452
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,632
Laverne, Rachel, swim! Come on!

453
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,552
(Deke) Come on, Rachel.

454
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,993
Come on.

455
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,798
- Look out.
- Don't tip the raft.

456
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,713
Don't tip the raft. Come on, Rachel.

457
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,234
# Don't tip the raft, don't tip the raft, baby! #

458
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,231
Ow! I really hurt my knee.

459
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,598
Come on, you'll be all right.

460
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,631
Randy, that hurt! What is it with you?

461
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,075
Laverne, swim faster!

462
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,993
Laverne, come on! Swim faster!

463
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,719
- Come on!
- Randy, what is your problem?

464
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,878
Man...

465
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,473
Help me get her up here!

466
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,313
(Randy) Swim! Swim!

467
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,958
Faster!

468
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,992
Swim! Come on, Laverne!

469
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,036
Come on.

470
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,076
- Come on.
- (Laverne gasps)

471
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,358
Randy, have you gone crazy?

472
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,069
This thing, I don't know what the hell it is.

473
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,754
It's an oil slick. I guess.

474
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,389
It's not. Have you ever seen
a perfectly round oil slick?

475
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,156
- I've never seen an oil slick at all.
- (Laverne) I'm cold!

476
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,073
Besides, Poncho,
I don't believe in oil slicks, man.

477
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,631
I only believe in what I can smell, taste...
and touch.

478
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,512
Hey, baby, smoke one of these.
This will make us all feel better.

479
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,831
- Looks like it was going for the girls.
- Come on, Poncho!

480
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,558
You said you'd sobered up!

(Music blaring on radio)

485
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,073
You ever even seen an oil slick, Poncho?

486
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,031
(Laverne) Ow! (Giggles)

487
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,553
Mmm. (Squeals)

488

(Laverne giggling)

489
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,911
Well, how about it, Poncho?
You ever seen an oil slick?

490
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,754
Randy and I saw one on the Cape
about four years ago.

491
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,116
We pulled birds out of the surf
and tried to clean them.

492
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,876
Ooh, mucho ecological, Poncho,
mucho ecological.

493
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,512
That oil slick we saw was just
this big sticky mess in the water

494
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,797
and streaks and smudges.

495
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,836
It looked like an accident.

496
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,511
This thing doesn't look like an accident,

497
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,478
it looks like...it's on purpose.

498
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,791
Well, what is it then, Randy?
What is it?

499
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,075
(Bubbling)

500
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,071
I-I don't know.

501
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,038
I can't get grieved about it, man. I mean...

502
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,155
(lnhales sharply)

503
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,276
No matter how hard I try,

504
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,794
I just can't get worried about it.

505
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,440
You know what I mean? (Laughs)

506
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,834
(Laverne) Oh, Deke! (Laughs)

- Get away from there, Rachel!

511
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,913
Randy!

512
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,797
(Screams)

513
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,350
(Giggling) What happened to her?
Did she fall in?

514
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,351
H-H-Help! It hurts.

515
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,868
No, Randy, no!

516
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,270
(Screams) It hurts!

517
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,476
Oh, my God!

518
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,358
(Randy) Rachel! Rachel!

519
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,352
Randy, no! She's dead, can't you see that?

520
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,393
It ate Rachel. It fucking ate her up, man!

521
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,755
- What is this thing, Poncho?
- I don't know.

522
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,319
I don't know.

523
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,870
Come on, man. You read
the science books. You're the brainball.

524
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,359
What the fuck is that thing?

525
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,477
Nothing like this in any science book
I ever read.

526
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,154
(Laverne, hysterical) Deke, it ate Rachel!

527
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,834
- (Screams)
- Shut up!

528
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,559
- Think we can swim past it, Randy?
- No!

529
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,791
Stop it or I swear to God
I'm gonna smoke you.

530
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,189
I'm not kidding.

531
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,748
Poncho, do you think we can swim it?

532
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,229
You saw how fast it took Rachel.

533
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,993
Maybe it was hungry then. Maybe it's full.

534
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,799
(Randy) Why don't you try, Deke?

535
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,031
We're gonna wait.
We'll wait for it to go away.

536
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,588
The thing came, it'll go away.

537
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,114
- (Breathes heavily)
- It came when we came.

538
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,191
I saw it come.

539
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,714
Like it smelled us.

540
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,836
Maybe if it's full like you say...

541
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,115
it'll go away.

542
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,078
But if it still wants chow...

546
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,314
Hey! What is this shit, Poncho?

547
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,310
It looks like it's going under the raft.

548
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,309
Did it go under us? Did it go under the raft?
Is it under us?

549
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,994
Yeah, and I'm gonna swim for it. Right now.

550
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,629
No! Don't leave us here! Don't!

551
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,838
I'm fast and I can make it.
You've gotta go while it's under the raft.

Laverne, you're choking me! Stop!

564

Now, listen. I'm gonna put you down.

- It can't?

567
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,556
I can't hold on. I'm not Deke.
Now get down or I'll drop you.

568
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,110
- Keep on the boards.
- No. My God!

I'm tired, Laverne.

I'm going to sit down.
You're going to watch for a while.

No, I can't.

You've got to, Laverne.
You'll watch, then I'll watch.

We'll take turns.

580

581
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,468
And watch the shore for lights...

We'll hold each other.

00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,359
I think we've got time for
one more creepy concoction.

645
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,671
Our last morbid masterpiece,

646
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,912
which I call The Hitch-Hiker.

647
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,756
(Cars hooting)

648
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,633
Jesus! It's 1 1 :15.

649
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,153
I gotta go.

650
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,754
Something must be wrong
with your alarm clock.

651
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,795
What?

652
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,872
Something must be wrong with
your alarm clock.

653
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,272
(Sighing) Oh, yeah.

654
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,476
Must have been a power outage.

655
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,836
It always goes to twelve like this
when the power goes off.

656
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,068
- What time did you say it was?
- 1 1 :1 5.

657
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,197
- Goddamn piece of digital junk.
- (Alarm beeps)

658
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,840
Could land me in divorce court.

659
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,596
- Why don't you use a wind-up alarm clock?
- Cos I don't have one.

660
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,433
- Get one. I'll pay for it.
- (Car hooting)

661
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:57,833
No, I hate the way they sound. They sound
like school bells between classes.

662
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,833
This electronic alarm sounds like...

663
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,672
early-morning birdsong.

664
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,991
It makes me think
that I'm waking up outdoors.

665
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,594
I didn't know you were the outdoor type.

666
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,914
Annie, please. Come on.

667
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,788
You've got your Mercedes.
I'm never gonna get mine at these prices.

668
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,634
It's what you quoted me.
It's what I've been paying you.

669
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,757
A special introductory rate.
That's what this was.

670
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,719
I see. Hook 'em, then up the price.
Is that it?

671
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,916
Are you hooked?

672
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,831
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

673
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,878
I do my job well, I expect to be paid well.

674
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,714
Now, come on. I counted six orgasms.

675
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,234
And you probably had others...

676
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,596
silently, so I wouldn't get a swelled head.

677
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,396
You charge by the orgasm?

678
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,117
Good idea. Maybe I should.
Then I'd have something to work for.

679
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,236
- Piece work.
- (Annie laughs)

680
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,356
You have no shame.

681
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,758
Next week.

682
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,556
Unless I get a better-paying job.

683
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,279
Bye, love.

684
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,794
I hope you're not in Dutch.

685
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,519
I can get you a good attorney
if it comes to that.

686
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,670
I've got a good attorney.

687
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,193
My husband.

688
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,396
And I don't wanna lose him.

689
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,474
Without him,
you'd never get your Mercedes.

690
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,437
(Laughs)

691
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,868
Mrs Annie Lansing,

692
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,678
winner of the 100-yard dash,

693
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,399
will attempt to do the impossible.

694
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,516
Twenty miles in...

695
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,797
seven minutes.
Jesus, that really is impossible.

696
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,956
Maybe he'll be late.

697
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,112
No, not Mr George Lansing, Esquire.

698
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,716
- Unthinkable.
- (Tyres screech)

699
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,756
1 1 :30 means 1 1 :30.

700
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,675
Not 1 1 :29...

701
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,072
not 1 1 :31...

702
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,277
but 1 1 :30.

703
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,715
What will I say?

704
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,512
I was...

705
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,478
I was out with Trudy and Jim.

706
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,319
No.

707
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,834
We'll see Trudy and Jim on Saturday.

708
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,473
I, uh...

709
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,277
I...went to see a movie.

710
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,873
I went to get laid, George.

711
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,757
There's this wonderful guy.

712
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,312
He charges $150, but that's for six -
count 'em! - six orgasms.

713
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,599
That's, uh...

714
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,870
$25 a pop.

715
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,597
Not bad.

716
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,671
What do you think, George?

717
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,320
- Shit!
- (Tyres screech)

718
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,269
"It's real leather, Mrs Lansing.
That will cost you $1,743 dollars."

719
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,437
Damn!

720
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,351
Jesus!

721
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,950

(Alarm beeping)

726
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,713
Hey, buddy!

727
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,030
What the fuck happened?

728
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,872
Looks like a hit and run.

729
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,439
Yeah?

730
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,393
Car blew by me a little while ago.
Couldn't see the lights.

731
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,153
Don't know what the hell it was.

732
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,470
Looks like a black guy, huh?

733
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,634
- (Man answers)
- 91 1.

734
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,358
I want to report a hit and run.

735
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,874
- The victim's dead.
- What's happening?

736
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,350
What do you think's happening?
Guy got creamed, that's what.

737
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,793
It happens all the time.

738
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,797
About a quarter mile from
the on-ramp on 395.

739
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,472
Right.

740
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,317
(Hooting)

741
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,273
All right, Annie.

742
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,749
Calm down.

743
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,432
Think.

744
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,036
Think rationally.

745
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,909
Can you live with this?

746
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,992
That's the question.

747
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,438
A guy's dead.

748
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,799
No.

749
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,872
You don't actually know that.

750
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,678
You don't know that...

751
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,637
for certain.

752
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,637
It's done.

753
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,312
It was an accident, a legitimate accident.

754
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,392
So why should I fuck up my life, right?

755

I could always turn myself in

I don't think the truck saw me.

01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,792
Three thousand, maybe four...

811
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,109
"Four thousand, Mrs Lansing,

812
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,909
"and the car will look like
you just drove it out of the showroom."

813
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,120
(Laughs) "What happened, Mrs Lansing?"

814
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,953
Oh, I ran over some guy

815
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,669
and over and over and over and over...

816
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,352
and...

817
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,472
No.

818
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,120
No, it's impossible!

819
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,838
(Gasps) No.

820
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,436
(Wailing) Oh, God!

821
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,592
"That'll cost you, Mrs Lansing."

822
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,231
(Owl hooting)

823
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,231
(Moans softly)

824
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,310
I hit a tree.

825
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,275
I hit a tree, that's all.

826
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,550
The whole thing was a dream.

827
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,199
There was no hitch-hiker.

828
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,474
There was nobody at all.

829
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,357
Oh, Jesus.

830
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,192
(Groans)

831
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,916
Jesus.

832
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,668
But where the hell am l?

833
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,633
Oh, I've gotta get back on the road.

834
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,392
(Sighs)

835
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,469
You are one screwed-up broad,
Mrs Lansing.

836
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,557
(Sighs)

837
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,355
Maybe I've had a concussion.

838
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,274
What are you supposed to do
for a concussion?

839
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,194
(Sighs) "Well, concussion, Mrs Lansing."

840
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,150
"That'll cost ya.

841
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,800
"$27,000.

842
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,678
"l know it sounds like a lot

843
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,197
"but you're gonna look like you just
drove yourself out of the showroom."

844
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,718
Mrs Lansing the money machine.

845
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,392
Ha!

846
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:12,473
Well, at least this will explain
why I'm getting home so late.

847
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,199
"l had an accident, dear.

848
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,955
"lt was a really frightening experience."

849
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,955
I don't believe it.

850
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,508
He's not home.

851
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,351
For the first time in recorded history,

852
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,590
he's late.

853
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,830
My car gets smashed...

854
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,354
my brain gets bent...
and he's late.

855
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:16,514
Thanks for the ride, lady.
Thanks for the ride.

856
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,591
(Screams)

857
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,318
Thanks for the ride, lady.

858
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,118
(Screams)

859
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,476
Thanks for the ride, lady.

860
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,076
How much do you want?

861
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,918
Annie?

862
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,709
Annie.

863
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,918
(Creep) 'There's a lesson for you kiddies.

864
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,673
'Never pick up hitch-hikers.'

865
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,435
On the hood of your car. (Chuckles)

866
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,399
(Engine starts)

867
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:44,713
Well, (Sniffs) it's time for this boogie man
to...boogie.

868
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,032
I'll be slayin' ya, boors and ghouls.

869
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,872
Till next issue,

870
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,635
try to stay scared, eh?

871
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:00,868
Ooh, I almost forgot about young Billy.

872
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,589
I think he's found his way

873
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,477
with his friends.

874
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,028
(Creep cackles)

875
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,878
Kid, I'm gonna put you in traction.

876
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,872
Get ready for some serious pain.

877
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,838
- 'Serious pain.'
- (Bullies laugh)

878
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,998
(Roars)

879
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,468
(All scream)

880
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,994
No! (Screams)

881
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,470
No, no, no, no, no!

882
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,550
(Screams)

883
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,276
(Yells)

884
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,955
The Venus flytraps.

885
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,157
Giant Venus flytraps.

886
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,390
They eat meat.

887
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,989
(Cackling)

888
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,269
Oh-ho!

889
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,359
(Screeching)

890
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,631
(Cackles)
