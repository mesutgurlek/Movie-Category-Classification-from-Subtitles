00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,456
        BUYING AND SELLING,     
        LIVING AND DYING.       

226
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,525
THE WEAVE OF LIFE.              

227
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:48,962
            WHY DID MY SISTER   
            DIE, DR. LEON?      

228
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,598
HAVE YOU NOT                    
BEEN TOLD?                      

229
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:51,599
    OF COURSE HE HAS.           

230
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,600
WELL, THEN.                     

231
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,501
            I WANT TO HEAR IT   
            FROM YOU, DOCTOR.   

232
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:02,643
    HER...DEATH WAS             
    INEVITABLE, I FEAR...       

233
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,312
    UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES--   

234
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,649
        THIS CASTLE,            
    THIS ODIOUS ATMOSPHERE.     

235
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,602
            WHAT HAS THE CASTLE 
            TO DO WITH IT?      

236
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:13,537
WHAT HAS THE CASTLE--           

237
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,640
            IT'S TOO LATE NOW,  
            CHARLES. I...       

238
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,542
            I DIDN'T WANT       
            HIM TO KNOW.        

239
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,610
        KNOW WHAT?              

240
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:24,648
YOUR SISTER'S DEATH             

241
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,650
WAS CAUSED BY FAILURE           
OF THE HEART, SIR,              

242
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:27,952
DUE TO TOTAL SHOCK.             

243
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,821
LITERALLY,                      
SHE DIED OF FRIGHT.             

244
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,689
            WHY DID YOU         
            NOT TELL ME?        

245
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,825
I THOUGHT                       
TO SPARE YOU, SIR.              

246
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,326
            YOU THOUGHT         
            TO DECEIVE ME!      

247
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,527
        THAT'S NOT TRUE.        

248
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:38,545
WHAT IS ALL THIS?               

249
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,531
                SHOW ME WHERE   
                IT HAPPENED.    

250
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,734
VERY WELL.                      

251
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,902
        NO, NICHOLAS.           

252
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,070
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY,           
MY DEAR.                        

253
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,972
WE WERE WRONG...                

254
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,810
VERY WRONG TO HAVE KEPT         
THE TRUTH FROM MR. BARNARD.     

255
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,013
NOW WE ARE DOUBLY               
SUSPECT IN HIS EYES.            

256
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,564
        SUSPECT?                

257
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,566
COME.                           

258
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:04,905
NICHOLAS, YOU SHOULD NOT        
BE DOING THIS, YOU KNOW.        

259
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,439
YOU'RE NOT WELL.                

260
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:09,810
        IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED,   
        CHARLES.                

261
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,912
        COME.                   

262
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,877
                WELL?           

263
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,466
        Francis:                
        A TORTURE CHAMBER?      

264
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,801
            YES, MR. BARNARD.   

265
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,603
            IT WAS MY FATHER'S. 

266
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,605
    SEBASTIAN MEDINA.           

267
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,408
    ONE OF THE INQUISITION'S    
    MOST INFAMOUS DEGRADED--    

268
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,609
PLEASE, SIR.                    
THAT IS ENOUGH.                 

269
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,843
    MR. BARNARD,                
    CAN YOU NOT SEE--           

270
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,345
        WHAT WAS MY SISTER      
        DOING HERE?             

271
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,683
SHE COULD NOT                   
KEEP HERSELF AWAY.              

272
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,335
        THAT NOISE I HEARD.     
        IS THAT WHAT WAS--      

273
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,437
            NO, SIR. THAT       
            PARTICULAR DEVICE   

274
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:45,306
            WAS NOT IN OPERATION
            AT THE TIME.        

275
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:46,307
        WHICH DEVICE?           

276
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:48,676
            IT'S IN AN ADJOINING
            CHAMBER DOWN THERE. 

277
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,979
    PLEASE, MR. BARNARD,        
    DO NOT GO THERE. I...       

278
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,815
        I DO NOT WISH           
        TO DISCUSS IT.          

279
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,651
                THE STORY, SIR. 

280
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,152
                IN DETAIL.      

281
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:05,192
    THIS WAS MY FATHER'S WORLD, 
        MR. BARNARD.            

282
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,260
SPARE YOURSELF                  
AT LEAST THIS, NICHOLAS.        

283
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,663
        HOW CAN I SPARE MYSELF? 

284
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,165
            WAS HE NOT          
            MY FATHER?          

285
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,068
            AM I NOT THE SPAWN  
            OF HIS...           

286
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,204
            HIS DEPRAVED BLOOD. 

287
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:20,474
HIS DEPRAVITY                   
IS NOT YOURS, NICHOLAS.         

288
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,509
WHY SCOURGE YOURSELF            
BECAUSE OF IT?                  

289
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,111
    YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED ME,   
    DON MEDINA.                 

290
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,915
        I SHALL NOT DWELL UPON  
        THE HISTORY OF THIS...  

291
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:32,152
        THIS BLASPHEMOUS        
        CHAMBER.                

292
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,556
SUFFICE IT THAT THE BLOOD       
OF A THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN     

293
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:38,392
WAS SPILLED                     
WITHIN THESE WALLS.             

294
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,961
LIMBS TWISTED                   
AND BROKEN!                     

295
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,464
EYES GOUGED                     
FROM BLOODY SOCKETS,            

296
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,131
FLESH BURNED BLACK.             

297
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,700
        WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME  
        THESE THINGS?           

298
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,402
        WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO    
        WITH MY SISTER?         

299
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,538
I SHOULD NEVER                  
HAVE BROUGHT HER HERE.          

300
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:55,058
SHE WAS TOO SENSITIVE,          
TOO AWARE.                      

301
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,227
        AWARE OF WHAT?          

302
00:19:57,294 --> 00:20:01,098
THE MALIGNANT ATMOSPHERE        
OF THIS CASTLE.                 

303
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,033
IT DESTROYED HER.               

304
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,936
        MY SISTER WAS A STRONG  
        AND WILLFUL WOMAN,      

305
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,504
        NOT SUBJECT             
        TO THE INFLUENCE        

306
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:08,772
        OF ATMOSPHERES.         

307
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,544
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY         
A MATTER OF HOURS, MR. BARNARD. 

308
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:17,948
 YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT IT IS     
 TO LIVE HERE...                

309
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,952
MONTH UPON MONTH,               
YEAR AFTER YEAR...              

310
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,388
BREATHING THIS INFERNAL AIR,    

311
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:28,191
ABSORBING THE MIASMA            
OF BARBARITY                    

312
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,360
WHICH PERMEATES THESE WALLS,    

313
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,313
PARTICULARLY THIS CHAMBER,      

314
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:36,683
BUT IT DID NOT BOTHER HER       
AT FIRST, EITHER.               

315
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:40,454
OUR LIFE WAS GOOD...            

316
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:44,023
RICH WITH THE SHARED            
PLEASURES OF OUR LOVE.          

317
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,049
    Nicholas: EACH MORNING      
    I WOULD BRING HER BREAKFAST.

318
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,887
    IN THE AFTERNOONS,          

319
00:20:56,954 --> 00:21:00,824
    SHE USUALLY SAT FOR ME      
WHILE I ATTEMPTED ALL IN VAIN   

320
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,161
    TO CAPTURE HER BEAUTY       
        ON CANVAS.              

321
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,430
    I DID THAT PORTRAIT WHICH   
    YOU SAW IN HER ROOM BEFORE, 

322
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:11,334
    BUT IT IS ALL INADEQUATE    
TO RECALL THE LOVELINESS OF HER.

323
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:19,142
    WE DINED, SOMETIMES ALONE,  
ENJOYING INTIMATE CONVERSATION, 

324
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,745
    SOMETIMES WITH THE DOCTOR.  

325
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,513
[PLAYING HARPSICHORD]           

326
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:27,217
        AND EVERY NIGHT,        
    ELIZABETH WOULD PLAY FOR ME.

327
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:36,593
    LIFE WAS SIMPLE, QUIET,     
    RICHLY PLEASURABLE,         

328
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,930
    AND THEN THE DARKNESS       
        BEGAN TO FALL.          

329
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:45,635
    MORE AND MORE, ENTERING     
    HER ROOM IN THE MORNINGS,   

330
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:47,170
    I WOULD FIND HER AWAKE      

331
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:49,973
    AND DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD   
    NOT SLEPT ALL THE NIGHT.    

332
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,875
    I TRIED TO FIND OUT WHY,    

333
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,077
    BUT SHE HAD NO EXPLANATION. 

334
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,414
    HER APPETITE BEGAN TO FADE. 

335
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,683
        SHE BEGAN TO LOSE       
        WEIGHT AND COLOR.       

336
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,385
    I TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT,    

337
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:05,521
        BUT SOMETHING           
        KEPT HER FROM IT.       

338
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,025
    I WOULD COME UPON HER       

339
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,594
    WANDERING IN THE CORRIDORS  
            AT NIGHT.           

340
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,764
    I TRIED TO FIND OUT         
    WHAT WAS WRONG,             

341
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,132
    BUT SHE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER,

342
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:19,736
    EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SOMETHING
        WAS OPPRESSING HER.     

343
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,905
        OH, GOD, HELP ME        
        FOR MY BLINDNESS.       

344
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,706
    I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.          

345
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,578
    THEN ONE DAY                
    SHE DISAPPEARED.            

346
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:31,748
    FRANTIC, I SEARCHED         
    THE CASTLE FOR HER.         

347
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:43,710
        AND THEN I KNEW.        

348
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:47,497
THE CASTLE AND ITS AWFUL HISTORY
        HAD OBSESSED HER.       

349
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,234
        THESE VERY              
    INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE,     

350
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,887
    WHICH WERE MY BIRTHRIGHT    
        AND MY CURSE,           

351
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,840
    NOW TORMENTED HER AS WELL,  

352
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,376
    INFECTING HER WITH A KIND   
    OF HAUNTED FASCINATION.     

353
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:03,630
    I WATCHED HER DRAWN TO ONE  
        AND THEN ANOTHER        

354
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:07,734
    AS IF THE AURA OF PAIN AND  
SUFFERING WHICH SURROUNDED THEM 

355
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:11,271
    WAS LURING HER TO SICKNESS  

356
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,774
        AND TO DEATH.           

357
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:21,481
IMMEDIATELY, I MADE MY PLANS    
TO LEAVE THE CASTLE WITH HER.   

358
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,418
    WE WOULD TRAVEL FOR A WHILE,
        RESTORE HER SPIRITS,    

359
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:26,853
    AND THEN MAKE OUR HOME      
        ELSEWHERE.              

360
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,390
    THEN ON THE VERY EVE        
    OF OUR DEPARTURE...         

361
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,191
                    [SCREAMING] 

362
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,961
        WE HEARD A SCREAM       
            FROM BELOW,         

363
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,898
    THE MOST HIDEOUS            
    BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAM       

364
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,033
        I HAVE EVER HEARD       
            IN MY LIFE.         

365
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,240
    JUST BEFORE SHE DIED,       
    SHE WHISPERED A NAME.       

366
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,974
        SEBASTIAN.              

367
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,527
                SEBASTIAN.      

368
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:12,099
                SEBASTIAN.      

369
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,711
MR. BARNARD.                    

370
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,045
                    DO헤.       

371
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:27,447
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?           

372
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:29,382
                YES, OF COURSE. 

373
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,184
                HOW IS          
                YOUR BROTHER?   

374
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,185
BETTER, THANK YOU.              

375
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:34,521
DR. LEON                        
IS STAYING WITH HIM.            

376
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,525
I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU          

377
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:40,893
TO PLEASE BELIEVE HIM,          
MR. BARNARD.                    

378
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,895
HE HAS TOLD YOU                 
THE TRUTH.                      

379
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,700
                HAS HE?         

380
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,167
    YES.                        

381
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:49,602
IN NOT TELLING YOU              
BEFORE,                         

382
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,904
HE ONLY MEANT                   
TO SPARE YOU PAIN.              

383
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,709
HE IS A GOOD MAN,               
MR. BARNARD,                    

384
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,177
A KIND AND GENTLE MAN,          

385
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,247
AND I KNOW THAT                 
HE ADORED YOUR SISTER.          

386
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:10,523
I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE HIM,    
DO헤 MEDINA,                    

387
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:13,860
BUT I FIND IT                   
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO.        

388
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:17,630
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM     
I CANNOT HELP BUT SENSE,        

389
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:21,901
A KIND OF FEARFUL               
TENSION THAT--                  

390
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,103
I'M SORRY...                    

391
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,172
BUT AN AIR                      
OF DEFINITE GUILT.              

392
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,860
        OF COURSE HE SUFFERS    
        FROM GUILT, MR. BARNARD,

393
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:32,562
        BECAUSE OF              
        WHAT OUR FATHER DID,    

394
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,799
         BECAUSE OF WHAT        
         HAPPENED TO ELIZABETH. 

395
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,835
            PERHAPS IT WILL HELP
            YOU TO UNDERSTAND   

396
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,503
            IF I TELL YOU       
            SOMETHING           

397
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:41,972
            THAT HAPPENED       
            TO NICHOLAS         

398
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,974
            WHEN HE WAS         
            JUST A BOY.         

399
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:48,511
            ONE DAY, WHILE      
            NICHOLAS WAS PLAYING

400
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:50,247
            IN THE LOWER        
            CORRIDOR...         

401
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,586
    Catherine: HE HAD BEEN      
    FORBIDDEN BY OUR FATHER     

402
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:59,089
    TO ENTER THIS CHAMBER       
        AT ANY TIME.            

403
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:02,642
    THE CURIOSITY OF YOUTH,     
            HOWEVER,            

404
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,280
OVERCAME HIS FEAR OF CHALLENGING
    OUR FATHER'S DISCIPLINE.    

405
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:09,382
    HE HAD TO SEE THE CHAMBER.  

406
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,178
        SUDDENLY,               
    THERE WERE FOOTSTEPS.       

407
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:04,353
    IT WAS OUR FATHER.          

408
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:08,324
    WITH HIM WERE OUR MOTHER    
    AND OUR UNCLE BARTOLOME,    

409
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,093
        WHO WAS                 
    OUR FATHER'S BROTHER.       

410
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,662
    AT FIRST, IT APPEARED THAT  
    FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON

411
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,832
    OUR FATHER WAS ACTUALLY     
        CONDUCTING THEM         

412
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,735
        ON A TOUR               
    OF HIS GHASTLY CHAMBER.     

413
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:57,174
    NICHOLAS COULD SEE THAT     
BOTH OUR MOTHER AND OUR UNCLE   

414
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,576
    WERE UNEASY, FRIGHTENED.    

415
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:03,279
        OUR FATHER'S            
    SMILING AFFABILITY          

416
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:06,549
    AS HE DESCRIBED THE WORKINGS
    OF THESE HELLISH INSTRUMENTS

417
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,753
    TURNED NICHOLAS' BLOOD COLD.

418
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:13,656
    HE WATCHED THEM WITH        
A MOUNTING SENSE OF PREMONITION.

419
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:18,394
    SOMETHING WAS WRONG,        
    MOST TERRIBLY WRONG.        

420
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:21,198
    EVEN HE, NO MORE            
    THAN 10 YEARS OF AGE,       

421
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:24,434
    COULD SENSE IT LIKE         
A DARKENING VAPOR IN THE AIR.   

422
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,203
    THERE WAS NO REASON         

423
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,739
    FOR OUR MOTHER AND OUR UNCLE
        TO HAVE BEEN THERE.     

424
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,524
            AAH!                

425
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:32,925
    Catherine: AS HE STRUCK,    

426
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:36,863
    HE KEPT ON SCREAMING        
    AT HIS BROTHER ONE WORD     

427
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,731
        OVER AND OVER--         

428
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,335
    "ADULTERER! ADULTERER!"     

429
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,804
    AND THEN HE TURNED ON HER.  

430
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:45,922
            AAH!                

431
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,842
    Catherine: ACCUSING HER     
    OF VILE DEBAUCHERIES        

432
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,178
    WITH HIS BROTHER,           

433
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:53,180
    CURSING HER AS FAITHLESS,   

434
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,182
        PROMISING HER           
    THE AGONIES OF HELL         

435
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,834
        AND PAYMENT             
    FOR HER INFIDELITY,         

436
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:02,371
         AND THERE BEFORE       
     MY BROTHER'S VERY EYES,    

437
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,125
        OUR MOTHER              
    WAS TORTURED TO DEATH.      

438
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:13,166
            EVER SINCE THEN,    

439
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:16,469
        NICHOLAS HAS BEEN UNABLE
        TO LIVE AS OTHER MEN.   

440
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:19,238
        ALWAYS, HE IS HAUNTED   
        BY THE MEMORY           

441
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:20,907
        OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY.   

442
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:23,176
        YOUR SISTER'S DEATH     
        CAME VERY CLOSE         

443
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:26,112
        TO DRIVING HIM INSANE,  
        MR. BARNARD.            

444
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,448
            I BEG OF YOU,       

445
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:31,417
            HAVE PITY ON HIM.   

446
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,303
             HELP HIM           
             BY BELIEVING HIM.  

447
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,941
I WILL TRY,                     
DO헤 MEDINA.                    

448
