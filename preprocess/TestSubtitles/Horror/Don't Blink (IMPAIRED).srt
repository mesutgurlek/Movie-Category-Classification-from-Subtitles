00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,464
I'll ride in the fucking trunk.
Okay, all right.

476
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,166
Jack?

477
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,934
It's on empty, I have two
gallons, that's 40 miles tops.

478
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,138
Hey, what about... what about
getting in the gas pump?

479
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,544
We could... we could break into that, we could
pull that shit up with buckets or something.

480
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,104
Crap, I don't know.

481
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,513
The pump don't work like that.

482
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,382
The gas is in a tank under the
ground, under the concrete.

483
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,547
Without the pump's pulling it
up, it's inaccessible.

484
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,988
Fuck!

485
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,548
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

486
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,653
Wait, however, we could take the gas from all
the cars, put it in one tank, all right?

487
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,195
It might not be much, but it might
be enough to get us away from here.

488
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,202
You mean, like siphon the gas? Yes, from our
four cars and five or six that are sitting here.

489
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,965
Well, could everyone fit
into Jack's car?

490
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,029
If the girls sit on the guys'
laps, maybe.

491
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,972
Okay, so it'll be uncomfortable. I
don't think we should go anywhere.

492
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,305
What? Are you f...

493
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,366
I don't think it's a good idea.

494
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,141
Are you fucking kidding me?
We have no idea what's going on.

495
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,978
How do we know that whatever happened
here hasn't already passed through?

496
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,245
Ah, I'll take that risk.

497
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,480
Well, maybe I'm not willing
to take that risk, Alex.

498
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:29,616
Look, look, Jack, the animals all
decided that whatever happened here...

499
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,490
was bad, and they decided
to leave.

500
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,989
You know, I like to think I'm
smarter than a fucking squirrel.

501
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,258
I get the message. Get out!

502
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,164
You know what, I don't want to run out of
gas another 100 miles down the road...

503
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:43,501
in the middle of the night, with ten
people and no fucking idea where we are!

504
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,509
At least here we have food and
water and shelter.

505
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,239
Maybe we can call for help.

506
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,413
[CLAIRE] Jack's right.

507
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,950
There's probably a phone inside.

508
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,010
There is probably
a phone inside.

509
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,183
So can we please,
please just cool our jets...

510
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,624
and really think about what
we're gonna do next...

511
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,162
before we make this
situation any worse?

512
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:12,668
Please... just relax.

513
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,603
Okay? Okay, yeah.

514
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,607
Yes, fine, yes.

515
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,109
Yes.

516
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,204
Okay. Okay.

517
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,382
Okay.

518
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,043
Tracy, did you see a phone...

519
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,084
Trace?

520
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,419
<i>Tracy?</i>

521
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,754
She was just here.

522
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,517
She came back with me, right?

523
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,584
Yes.

524
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,685
Did anybody see her go anywhere?

525
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,459
I didn't.
Maybe she went to the bathroom.

526
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,399
She wouldn't go to the bathroom
without saying something to somebody.

527
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,993
Tracy! We'll go look for her.

528
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,740
Let's find a can and a hose and
get the fuel out of these cars.

529
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,241
[ALEX] How are we doing?

530
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,286
Tastes like shit.

531
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,221
Yeah, I'll get you mouthwash
later, but how much gas we got?

532
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,282
Not enough. Fuck! Really?

533
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,056
Did you find the gas key?

534
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,098
It would help if I knew
what it looked like.

535
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,795
Well, the car by the pumps
is empty, so is yours.

536
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,732
Of the cars here, I got maybe
two and a half gallons combined.

537
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:27,072
They put it all in Jack's car. Just gonna
have to see how much I can get out of Noah's.

538
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,704
Any luck finding Tracy?

539
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,179
No.

540
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,244
How about a phone?

541
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,445
No one's found one yet.

542
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,146
Jesus Christ, they have
to have a fucking phone...

543
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,747
they have a internet site,
for Christ's sake.

544
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,157
Goddamn it!

545
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,718
Okay, look, even if Noah's car
has four gallons in it...

546
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,821
that still leaves us
less than half a tank...

547
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,364
which gets us about halfway
back, and then we're done.

548
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,403
So what do you want to do?
You want to stay here?

549
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,598
No!

550
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,768
But I'm not so sure I want
to be out there, either.

551
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:05,542
What if it's just some crazy guy thats
running around, killing people?

552
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,105
You think it's a crazy guy?

553
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,582
I don't know.

554
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,726
Well, if it's a crazy
guy, it's the cleanest,

555
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:12,339
quietest crazy guy
I've ever seen.

556
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,754
I haven't seen any blood,
no sign of struggle.

557
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,621
Yeah, I know.

558
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,594
I wish it was a crazy guy, because
I can fuck up a crazy guy.

559
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,829
But I don't think
that's what it is.

560
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:33,107
Sam, I need to know
you're with me.

561
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,508
I'm with you.

562
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,841
Okay. Yeah.

563
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,852
What do you think of Noah?

564
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,256
Dude, he's creepy as fuck.

565
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,418
Weird. Right?

566
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,722
Yeah.

567
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,334
[SAM] Any luck, Jack?

568
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,401
No... nothing.

569
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,551
[ELLA] He's gone!

570
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,280
What's wrong? What's wrong?

571
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,756
No, no, no,
look at me, look at me.

572
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,724
Who's gone? Noah.

573
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:28,161
We were just walking behind the
house, and calling for Tracy...

574
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,893
and I just took my eyes
off him for a second.

575
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,162
He's gone.

576
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,226
No one else was there
when it happened.

577
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,572
Fuck... okay,
everybody inside, okay?

578
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,475
Inside? Dude, we gotta go.
Inside, let's not bullshit.

579
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,706
Look, Jack, man, we gotta leave.

580
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,214
Not fucking now!
Jack, we need to go!

581
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,479
Alex, goddamn it! I'm not fucking
leaving without Tracy, all right!

582
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,712
All right.

583
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,652
Do you fucking hear me! Yeah!

584
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,589
Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay.

585
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,626
I'm sorry. Okay.

586
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,286
I'm sorry. It's okay.

587
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,354
So damn sorry. Okay, all right,
come on, we're going inside.

588
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,627
Okay, we're going inside.
Everybody inside, let's go.

589
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,793
I just need a minute, okay?

590
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,336
Yeah.

591
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,874
( DOOR CLOSES)

592
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,925
Okay, we obviously
have a situation here.

593
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,760
That may be the single biggest
understatement I've ever heard.

594
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,596
Lucas!
Dude, I'm with him on this one.

595
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,697
Okay, so what do we know?

596
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,777
We know that it looks as if
everyone that was here is now gone.

597
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,543
They all left in a hurry.

598
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,845
Yes, good, yeah.

599
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,648
We know that all
the animals have gone...

600
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,282
and that it's way hotter at this
time of year than it should be.

601
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,952
So, what can cause all that?

602
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,930
Okay, what can make everything
disappear, including the insects?

603
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:13,628
Um, look, a poisonous gas cloud,
a chemical spill...

604
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,728
No, there'd be dead bodies
all over the place.

605
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,899
There'd be insects and birds
and critters everywhere.

606
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,637
Not necessarily.

607
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:27,513
I mean, sometimes, you know, when birds sense
something bad is coming, like an earthquake.

608
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,577
You know, maybe whatever happened here, they
figured it out ahead of time and took off.

609
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,386
Okay, that's possible, yeah.

610
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,792
Yeah, like they ran ahead of it,
like in a forest fire or something.

611
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,321
Okay, look, if it was something
man-made, like a poisonous gas cloud...

612
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:48,837
then that would explain why everyone
who was here left in such a hurry.

613
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,406
I mean, it was an emergency
and they were evacuated.

614
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,914
So Noah and Tracy were evacuated...
Claire? That's what you think?

615
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:04,942
Look, I know everyone's upset, but I
really think we need to get out of here.

616
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,490
And if what Claire says is right, that the
people who were here before got evacuated...

617
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,584
we need to leave.

618
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,424
What about Tracy and Noah?

619
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,358
I don't know.

620
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:24,330
I don't know, but how does staying here
and having the same thing happen to us...

621
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,965
how does that help them...

622
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,636
In any way?

623
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,744
How much gas did you salvage?

624
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,682
About half a tank.

625
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:40,814
About a half a tank, well,
that's not enough.

626
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,052
It's not enough
to get help or to escape.

627
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,560
It's enough to get away.

628
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,028
Unless whatever it is we're dealing

01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,564
Bullshit.

953
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,936
Fucking bullshit! Come on.

954
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,447
Guys, what the hell? It's me.

955
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:37,382
Is it? Is it you? I don't know.

956
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,215
Who else would I be?

957
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:44,190
Demon, alien, spirit of an
ancient Indian burial ground.

958
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,990
You tell me. I'm open to any sci-fi
bullshit explanation at this point.

960
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,032
This is insane.

Nah, nah, no...

962
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:57,504
this isn't even the tip
of the insane iceberg, buddy.

963

marched through here all fucking night.

from the Big Beyond...

965

Well, thats just the lettuce
on the fuck-you sandwich.

966
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,951
Okay.

967
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:16,320
Look, I... I know that I don't know
you guys that well, all right?

968
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:21,226
But... what is it
you think I did?

969
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,197
Alex, what are you gonna do?
Huh?

970
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,563
I mean, you can't shoot him.

971
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:29,330
Oh, really, Claire? Can't I?

972
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,462
Are those the rules?

973
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:35,475
You know, because I think my
shoulder would disagree with you!

974
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,476
I could just... I could just
shoot him, just shoot him...

975
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:49,046
and blow his fucking ass away and if
he comes back, he'd be a zombie...

976
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,283
or something.

977
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:54,226
Would that-would that
explain any of this shit?

978
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,593
Not really, no.

979
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:00,099
Where's Ella? Where's Ella,
she'll know that it's me.

980
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,033
Yeah, where is Ella?

981
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:13,045
No... no... really?

982
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,280
Goddamn it.

983
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:26,589
What? Where is she?

984
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,665
She's where the fuck
you just came from, asshole!

985

What is going on?

986
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,231
Alex, that's enough,
okay? Let's...

987
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:42,208
<i>Yeah, but what
ii he knows, man.</i>

988
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,538
What if he knows where she is?

989
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,273
What if he knows where she is,
where they all are?

990
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,373
What if we can get them back?

991
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,315
He doesn't.

992
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:55,982
Are you sure? Because I'm not.

993
01:06:56,045 --> 01:07:02,326
I mean, I'm not even sure
if he's human, Jack.

994
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,524
[NOAH] Please? Shut up.

995
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,658
Please! I said, shut up!

996
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,998
Just stop it! Okay?

997
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:12,596
What do you want me
to do, Claire? Huh? Hm?

998
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:15,164
What do you want?

999
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,370
Just don't hurt him.

1000
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:21,347
Okay, well, how am I supposed to
get information out of him, huh?

1001
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:25,284
What? You want me
to ask him nice?

1002
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,048
Okay.

1003
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:37,690
Hey, uh... hey, Creepy Noah,
what's going on, huh?

1004
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:44,135
I don't know.

1005
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:48,733
He doesn't know. Are you
satisfied with that answer?

1006
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,641
Yes.

1007
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:53,111
Are you? Yes.

1008
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,147
Yeah, I'm not.

1009
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,758
Now what is going on?

1010
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:11,322
I don't know.

1011
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:13,628
I can't hear you!

1012
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,568
What do you want me to say?

1013
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,175
I want you to say something...

1014
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,677
that makes everything
make sense.

1017
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,310
Fuck off. It's enough!

1018
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,751
What, you stop me on the second
bullet, but not the first?

1019
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,814
Was the second bullet
just a tad excessive?

1020
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,121
I mean, you could have stopped
me at any time, Jackie.

1021
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,582
You could just come over and
you could have punched me again.

1022
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:46,624
Nice shot, by the way, you really... you
really cleaned my clock there, chief.

1023
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:50,762
Your dirty, little secret is that you
want answers just as bad as I do.

1024

But you don't have
the stomach to get 'em.

1025
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,285
Alex, we all want answers!
Okay?

1026
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:13,452
We all want them,
but not like this.

1027
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,292
Not like this, please?

1028
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,291
Fine.

1029
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,738

1030

go when they disappear...

1032

nothing safe comes back from that dark place.

1033

Claire, help me!

1034
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,761
Agh!

1035
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:51,593
Sure, he looks like Noah now,
but when we go to sleep...

1036
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,601
he'll turn into a pod,
control our minds.

1037
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,570
I mean... Please, God!

1038
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,867
He might be making me
do this right now.

1039
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:12,184
Whatever took him
the first time...

1040
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,280
take him back.

1041
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:21,556
[NOAH] Please! Let me back in!

Don't you get it?

1048
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:15,679
We're all gonna disappear and then everything
we've ever done, it doesn't matter.

1049
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,312
Do you smoke?

1050
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,583
No.

1051

They're delicious.

1052
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,985
You know, I could
shoot you both.

1053
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:33,022
I could take the vegetable there
upstairs and I could rape her.

1054
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,638
Doesn't matter.

1055
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:50,446
Because we're all
going to be erased.

1056
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:54,886
If I gave you
a blank video tape...

1057
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,390
would you care
what was on it before?

1058
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:05,694
It could be a snuff film,
but why would you give a fuck?

1059
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,531
So, yes, I may have done some
monstrous things...

1060
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:16,474
but I don't think
anybody's ever gonna know.

1061
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,414

Yup.

both shall live.

they didn't leave a trace.

1067

Not even a spot of blood.

1068
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:51,969

stopped yelling.
