was a federal matter.

170
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,962
You disobeyed a direct order...

171
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,972
to stay out of the building.

172
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,632
Don't let this get out.

173
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,437
It's a war down here.

174
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,570
You're a soldier,
and you take orders.

175
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:45,582
We're fighting
for our lives down here...

176
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,609
and you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!

177
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,151
I don't roll over for anybody...

178
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,591
especially the feds...

179
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,185
without a goddamn
good explanation!

180
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,187
Take this equipment up
to the third floor now.

181
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,347
Let's move!

182
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,226
Let's go.

183
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,701
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

184
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,034
What the hell's
going on here?

185
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,198
Insubordination.

186
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,707
Disregard for direct orders...

187
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,208
from a supervising officer.

188
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:49,212
Now get back to your cage
at Alvarado.

189
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,372
I'll show you
insubordination...

190
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,211
you son of a bitch!

191
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:53,716
No, no, no!

192
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,046
Where you running to?

193
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,053
You don't need this, Mike.

194
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,383
It's not worth it.

195
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,548
Relax.

196
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,024
Oh, fuck!

197

¤ [Spanish Rap]

198
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,546
[Tony Pope]
Here's an update.

199
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:26,048
In the midst of a shootout...

200
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,210
five members
of one Colombian drug gang...

201
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,720
were apparently ambushed
by their bloody rivals...

202
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,221
<i>the Jamaican Voodoo Posse... </i>

203
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,724
<i>who escaped</i>
<i>without a trace again... </i>

204
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,225
<i>making total fools... </i>

205
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,228
Back there.

206
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,628
Listen, lady,
you got a backed-up toilet...

207
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,223
call a plumber, not the cops.

208
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,235
This license is expired.

209
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,361
Bullshit.

210
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,234
I paid that fee
six months ago.

211
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:49,739
I'll kick your ass!

212
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,240
Sit down!
Right now!

213
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,298
Move!

214
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,640
Just calm the fuck down!

215
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,753
And all you got to do...

216
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,756
is tee it high and let it fly.

217
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,759
Ah-ooh!
Dead solid perfect.

218
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,260
Now, remember,
for distance...

219
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,765
you got to hold it
gently, but firmly.

220
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,265
Lieutenant Harrigan!

221
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,767
Detective Lambert,
Rampart Division.

222
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:19,769
Kid, just have a seat.

223
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,771
I'll be right with you.

224
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,931
Hey, Cap.

225
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,599
Don't start with me, Mike.

226
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,267
Heinemann's
so far up my ass...

227
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:27,675
I won't sit down
for a week.

228
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,679
We're not
winning this war.

229
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:32,807
You have to play
the game on this one.

230
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,818
"Effective immediately,
a federal task force...

231
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,286
"under the direction
of Special Agent Peter Keyes...

232
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,290
"will be investigating
criminal activities...

233
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,825
"involving the trafficking...

234
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,156
and distribution of
controlled substances. "

235
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,789
And you will extend him
your full cooperation.

236
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,130
You're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

237
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,136
The feds are calling
the shots on this.

238
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,466
My hands are tied.

239
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:55,596
Yeah?

240
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,766
Captain Pilgrim.
Peter Keyes.

241
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,276
Well, it's good
to meet you.

242
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:01,868
Nice to meet you, sir.

243
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:03,277
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan...

244
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,542
Special Agent
Peter Keyes, DEA.

245
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,481
I've heard
a lot about you.

246
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:11,282
I'm sorry for this
jurisdictional intrusion.

247
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:14,483
Don't mean to be
stepping on your toes...

248
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:15,752
but we're attempting...

249
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:18,192
to prevent King Willie's
voodoo gangs...

250
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,287
from taking over
the entire West Coast.

251
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:23,299
I wish I could tell you more...

252
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,801
but we have a large number...

253
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,895
of deep-cover operatives
involved here.

254
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,906
You know how it is.

255
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:32,807
We all have a job to do.

256
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,311
I'm sure we can respect
each other's situation...

257
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,472
and act responsibly.

258
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,210
Well...

259
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:43,549
um, cooperation...

260
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,213
is my middle name.

261
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,224
I'll see you around.

262
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,232
Lieutenant,
I'm the new transfer.

263
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:05,070
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

264
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,575
Who is this dude?

265
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,975
Yeah, what an asshole.

266
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,407
All right, Danny,
what we got?

267
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,780
What do we got?

268
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,752
Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

269
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,254
The next minute...

270
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,755
they're all shish kebab...

271
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,621
not one bullet wound.

272
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,421
Wasn't the drugs or money.

273
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,927
There's a shitload
of that.

274
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:27,429
Maybe King Willie
brought in some outside talent.

275
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,931
He's making his big move.

276
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,934
A pro would have split
the moment he heard the action.

277
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,435
More than one
we would have seen.

278
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:36,439
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute...

279
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:40,443
and then took out four men armed
with machine guns by hand...

280
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:43,446
and then got by us.

281
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:46,915
Maybe we should
give him a job.

282
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,452
Me and my partner
bolt up the stairs...

283
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,953
somebody's screaming
bloody murder...

284
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,319
- you got to hear this. You got to hear this.
- What?

285
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,449
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

286
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:56,959
See that guy there?

287
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:59,962
That's Freddy's replacement.

288
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,931
This guy's Jerry Lambert...

289
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
the Lone Ranger
from Rampart station.

290
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,902
That's the Lone Ranger?

291
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:10,134
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioner.

292
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,801
I said,
"Lady, you are under arrest. "

293
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,310
And she said, "Why?"

294
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,972
I said, "Your husband's dead.
You killed him. "

295
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,481
- Know what she said without missing a beat?
- No.

296
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,987
She said, "I stabbed
that son of a bitch plenty of times.

297
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,024
- He never died on me before. "
- [Laughs]

298
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,489
Uh-oh.

299
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,824
Looks like he's putting
the moves to Leona.

300
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,761
His first big mistake.

301
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:40,166
I have heard about you.

302
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,499
Yeah?

303
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,165
Yeah.
Like your last partner got shot.

304
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,299
What?

305
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,307
Well...

306
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,707
Oy!

307
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,508
Try that cowboy shit
with me, fucker...

308
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,844
and you can
kiss these good-bye.

309
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,384
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.

310
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:59,513
Well, well, I see
the three of you have met.

311
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:02,524
Lambert,
if you're feeling up to it...

312
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,356
why don't you
limp your way in...

313
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,021
and go see the lieutenant.

314
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,531
- He wants to talk to you.
- Yeah.

315
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,123
Aah!

316
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,634
You're a bad girl.

317
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,033
Ooh, I liked that.

318
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,401
No, no, no!

319
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:19,135
Goddamn, is that bitch
on the rag or what?

320
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,543
This is what
I call the speech, kid.

321
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:28,550
I only give it once,
so pay attention.

322
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:31,815
Until now, it's all
been fun and games...

323
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,755
cops and robbers,
Dunkin' Donuts...

324
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:36,725
but you're in the shit now.

325
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:39,057
Metro Command
is a war zone.

326
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,562
I've paid my dues.

327
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,064
I busted my ass
to get my transfer.

328
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,294
And that scares
the shit out of me.

329
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,063
Nobody
requests to come here...

330
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,071
unless they're looking
for a reputation.

331
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:50,731
There's no room

00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:16,090
The federal team brought in
their own forensic examiners.

658
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:17,790
I am the medical examiner...

659

and chief pathologist in the city.

660

They've cut me out completely.

661
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:25,599
Any way to look at evidence
the feds have collected?

662
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,333
They must have run tests.

- It won't be easy.

I pried this
from Danny's hands.

665
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:35,380
It's what took him
into the rafters.

666
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:36,710
It has no weight.

667
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:38,410

670
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,026
Astonishing.

- Military?
