<i>Moving to new frequency. Solar interference. </i>

00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:23,676
<i>Incoming transport detected. </i>
<i>Docking procedures engaged. </i>

3
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:28,486
<i>Thermal sensors detect</i>
<i>humanoids, level 36.</i>

00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:45,464
<i>Humanoids advancing,</i>
<i>deck 47.</i>

5
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,151
<i> Long wait, demon,</i>

6
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,318
<i>for such a short game. </i>

7
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:19,160
<i>Now curiosity is satisfied. </i>

8
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:22,866
<i>And it's time... </i>

9
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,499
<i>for revenge. </i>

10
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,282
<i>Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>consider yourself relieved. </i>

11
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,081
<i> What else, Chamberlain?</i>

12
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,749
He's rerouted all available power
to his personal quarters...

13
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:45,453
and he's shut down
most of the ship.

14
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:48,088
I want you to check everything out
and find out why.

15
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,098
Yes, sir.

16
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:54,330
So, we have the company's
most productive space station...

17
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,601
hijacked and taken out of orbit
by the man who built it.

18
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:00,767
We have the man himself
immersed in ancient history,

19
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,607
<i>letting the whole place</i>
<i>go to shit. </i>

20
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,477
- <i>Evaluation?</i>
- Wacko.

21
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,109
<i>I wasn't asking you, Carducci. </i>
<i>I was asking the expert. </i>

22
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,121
<i>Well, Rimmer?</i>

23
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,625
Great man didn't live up
to your expectations, did he?

24
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:21,459
I'm sure he will, sir, as soon as I
can begin my interrogation.

25
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,199
Where's your crew?

26
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,969
<i>I made them leave. They're headed for</i>
<i>Earth. Look, time is of the essence. </i>

27
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,169
Was there some
technical problem?

28
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,439
No. Yes.
Yes, that's it.

29
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:39,674
There's been a technical
problem, and you...

30
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,912
all of you have to get the fuck
off this station right now.

31
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,514
- When we go, you come with us.
- No, you don't understand.

32
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,581
Help me, then.

33
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:53,253
What's your name?

34
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,388
Rimmer.

35
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,626
I'm playing the endgame
here, Rimmer,

36
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,861
finishing something
that began centuries ago,

37
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,700
and I don't have the time
to help you understand.

38
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:06,105
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what you're playing with. </i>

39
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,541
What are you afraid of?

40
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:11,307
Whatever it is,
it's here...

41
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,610
in this station.

42
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,382
That and things your little
rational mind couldn't even dream of.

43
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,488
But I dream.

44
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,220
Oh, I dream.

45
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,320
<i>Parker was right. </i>
<i>You are crazy. </i>

46
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,365
<i>I built this place</i>
<i>for a reason:</i>

47
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,561
To create the biggest trap
in the galaxy.

48
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:37,128
- <i>What did you expect to catch?</i>
- Hell is what I'm going to catch.

49
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,970
And I'm going to burn it away
in a blaze of light.

50
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,408
You're serious,
aren't you?

51
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:47,182
If I tell you
the whole story,

52
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,844
<i>will you let me finish</i>
<i>what I began?</i>

53
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:57,288
<i>Centuries ago,</i>
<i>a man, an ancestor of mine,</i>

54
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,521
Phillip L'Merchant,

55
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:03,053
<i>built a puzzle box,</i>
<i>the first box,</i>

56
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,066
<i>his finest work. </i>

57
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:09,801
<i>Commissioned by a wealthy</i>
<i>aristocrat named De L 'Isle,</i>

58
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:12,363
<i>a man obsessed</i>
<i>with black magic,</i>

59
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,739
<i>a leader of the occult. </i>

60
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,540
<i>Phillip was so proud</i>
<i>of his work,</i>

61
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:20,377
<i>a work that would</i>
<i>establish his name,</i>

62
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,249
<i>his family... my family. </i>

63
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,847
<i>He didn't know the great power</i>
<i>the box held... </i>

64
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,155
<i>and the unspeakable things</i>
<i>it would release</i>...

65
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,252
<i>the evil,</i>

66
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,093
<i>the sins,</i>

67
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,099
<i>the pain. </i>

68
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:45,432
- Is it done?
- Done.

69
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,807
- <i>Is it wonderful?</i>
- Wonderful.

70
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:50,846
Are you brilliant?

71
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:55,214
The finest toy maker in France.

72
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,946
Oh, what does it do?

73
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,738
<i>Oh. It doesn't</i>
<i>actually do anything. </i>

74
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,011
It's my masterpiece.

75
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,713
You simply
couldn't understand.

76
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:35,621
I was working to a commission
to a very specific request.

77
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,989
<i>It's almost midnight. </i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>

78
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,827
- The Chateau De L'Isle, to deliver the box.
- Now? Why?

79
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,594
Because my work might be
appreciated there.

80
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:53,770
It's late.
Stay with me.

81
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,408
Stay with us.

82
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,984
I must go.

83
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,113
My son will be born
in a better place than this.

84
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,419
This is only the beginning.

85
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,426
I can feel it.

86
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,559
All alone in this
dark, dark world.

87
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:49,223
<i>No home, no family. </i>

88
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,663
Not even christened,
I understand.

89
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,402
<i> Jacques,</i>

90
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,965
<i>show this child</i>
<i>to a chair. </i>

91
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:09,947
Enjoy.

92
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:22,197
Careful!

93
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:26,667
I'd be mortified if you
sliced your little finger.

94
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,772
Such a gentleman.

95
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,674
<i>Are you always</i>
<i>such a gentleman?</i>

96
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,110
No.

97
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,113
Not always.

98
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,456
<i>Monsieur De L 'Isle is</i>
<i>France's greatest magician. </i>

99
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:09,938
- What is this?
- So you don't bruise.

100
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,602
<i>Easy, Jacques. </i>
<i>Keep the pressure steady. </i>

101
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,741
She has spirit.
Splendid.

102
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:01,261
Now we can begin.

103
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:30,417
Ahh, L'Merchant.

104
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,087
As precise as your pieces.

105
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:36,461
As timely as your toys.

106
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,365
<i>And where is the box?</i>

107
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,301
<i>Pay him, Jacques. </i>

108
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:47,442
Thank you.

109
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,775
<i>Good night, toy maker. </i>

110
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,327
Take her in
to the laboratory.

111
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,937
<i>Find the right instrument. </i>

112
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:19,668
<i>We must make a clean... </i>
<i>incision... </i>

113
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:31,083
<i>so that we can</i>
<i>remove the innards... </i>

114
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:35,751
<i>so we can replace</i>
<i>the flesh again. </i>

115
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:39,519
<i>Yes, the gizzard. </i>

116
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,965
We'll scrub this.

117
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,748
<i>Now we can raise her up</i>
<i>off the ground. </i>

118
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,682
<i>That's it. </i>

119
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:33,826
<i>Walk now amongst us!</i>

120
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,883
- <i> My God. </i>
- <i>Fear not, Jacques. </i>

121
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:54,787
Remember your lessons.

122
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:59,317
A summoned demon
is yours to command.

123
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:02,090
<i>Unless you stand</i>
<i>in hell's way. </i>

124
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,596
Yes.

125
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:13,070
He who summons the magic...

126
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,975
<i>commands the magic. </i>

127
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,510
<i>You are... </i>

128
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,518
<i>Angelique. </i>

129
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,618
<i>He who summons the magic</i>...

130
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,922
Commands the magic.

131
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:40,329
<i> 'Tis no story, Auguste. </i>

132
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:44,236
<i>I saw what I saw,</i>
<i>heard what I heard. </i>

133
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,672
<i>The box opens</i>
<i>the doors to hell. </i>

134
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:51,270
This is the 18th century,
Phillip, not the dark ages.

135
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:53,644
<i>The world is ruled</i>
<i>by reason. </i>

136
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,411
We even got rid of God.

137
00:18:56,485 --> 00:19:00,012
And if there is no heaven,
then it follows reasonably...

138
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,953
that there is no hell.

139
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,255
I was at its very window
last night!

140
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:09,889
Very well.
Suppose, for the sake of argument,

141
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:13,731
<i>that what you fear happened</i>
<i>has happened. </i>

142
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:18,136
A box that can open the gates of hell
must be able to close them.

143
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,176
The box belongs to people with
little interest in closing such doors.

144
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,475
Well, then the solution
lies literally in your hands.

145
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:29,813
You've designed a machine
that you fear can bring forth demons.

146
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:33,719
- Yes.
- Then design a machine that can destroy them.

147
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:45,299
<i>Phillip had the design. </i>

148
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:49,997
<i>That design. </i>
<i>It seemed an impossible task. </i>

149
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:53,166
But he had to try,
try something.

150
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,678
And his only hope
was to steal the box,

151
00:19:56,745 --> 00:20:01,182
the puzzle box that he had created
with his own hands.

152
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,460
<i> Unbutton my shirt. </i>
<i>Yes. </i>

153
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,067
<i>Turn around. </i>

154
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,607
<i>Oh, yes. </i>

155
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:04,329
<i>Toy maker, you have</i>
<i>such pliant fingers. </i>

156
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,403
<i>I want them</i>
<i>to play with me. </i>

157
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,305
And take my soul?

158
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:21,182
It's already gone, toy maker.

159
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,657
<i>Demons will walk the Earth,</i>

160
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,320
and you're responsible.

161
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,762
Think of that.

162
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:35,292
You and your bloodline cursed 'til the end
of time because of your little puzzle box.

163
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,602
What are you waiting for? Kill him
and come back where you belong.

164
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:56,389
Such pliant fingers.

165
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,919
My God!

166
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,451
Please forgive me.

167
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,794
I didn't know
what I was doing.

168
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,528
We've got to
get you out of here.

169
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:43,230
It's too late.

170
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,169
<i>They're back. Save yourself. </i>

171
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:51,701
Save the child.

172
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,924
Jacques was right.

173
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,325
Demons did walk the Earth,

174
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:11,024
the same way they're walking
this station right now.

175
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,932
From a puzzle box?

176
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:16,766
Angelique had many boxes
made from his design,

177
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:19,170
<i>but it wasn't enough. </i>

178
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:22,074
<i>She wanted a box that</i>
<i>would open the gateway forever. </i>

179
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:25,136
- And your family?
- <i>Was the key. </i>

180
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,011
But they treated it
the same way you treat it.

181
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,519
Like a fairy tale.
But their blood remembered.

182
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,549
<i>And as the generations</i>
<i>passed,</i>

183
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:38,491
there were Merchants
who dreamed of puzzle boxes...

184
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,858
and doors leading to hell.

185
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:45,194
And then one of them
met... Angelique...

186
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:48,701
much, much later.

187
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:53,474
Even in sleep,
you want me.

188
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:56,010
Even in dreams,
you watch me.

189
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,607
Yes, I know.

190
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,979
I know what's
in your heart.

191
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,286
John Merchant.

192
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:16,489
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

193
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:18,829
Are you okay?

194
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,994
Oh, God, I woke Jack again.

195
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,167
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

196
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,514
You look terrible.

197
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:38,442
I'm worried, and I really think
you should see someone.

198
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,988
You know I've been
having these dreams all my life.

199
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:44,184
John, honey,
they're getting worse.

200
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:48,252
It is your goddamned grandmother.
She was weird, John.

201
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,165
You remember those stories about how, how
important you are and how important the family is?

202
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:56,033
Honey, she put stuff
in your mind.

203
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,164
Not all of it.
There are other things.

204
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,142
Things that feel
like memories,

205
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,610
impossible memories.

206
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,672
And they just don't haunt my dreams,
they haunt my work.

207
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,516
- <i>Everything that I've done</i>...
- I don't want you haunted, and I don't want you hurt.

208
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:15,385
It's not that.
It's... It's stress.

209
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:19,154
<i>It's this this banquet thing. </i>
<i>I hate crap like this!</i>

210
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:21,661
Oh.
Then you shouldn't be so good.

211
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,531
- <i>But it's not ready. I'm not sure if it will work. </i>
- Right.

212
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,331
<i>So that's why your face</i>
<i>is on this magazine cover. </i>

213
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,579
L'Merchant!

214
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:41,480
The bloodline continues,
toy maker.

215
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,645
I'm restless,
and you're bored.

216
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,590
I think we should
see America.

217
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:52,149
Screw America.

218
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:55,253
Then I would like your permission
to go by myself.

219
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:03,331
Don't you want to know
why I'd like to go?

220
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,174
<i>Is that your final word?</i>

221
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,119
Angelique,
let's make this clear.

222
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,851
What you want
is irrelevant.

223
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,860
It's about what I want.

224
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,728
After 200 years, you should know
what those things are.

225
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,567
Jacques,

226
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:11,127
have I ever
disappointed you?

227
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,005
- No.
- Close your eyes.

228
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,977
- Don't move.
- Why?

229
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:23,650
So you won't bruise.

230
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:27,210
- Is this a new game?
- Oh, yes.

231
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,651
<i>It might hurt... </i>

232
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:36,926
Just a little.

233
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:44,763
<i> Jacques, do you remember</i>
<i>De L 'Isle's lesson?</i>

234
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,001
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.

235
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:56,349
Enjoy.

236
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:02,084
<i>I forget. </i>
<i>You like it rough, don't you?</i>

237
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,388
<i>Please!</i>

238
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,952
Yes, you like it rough!

239
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:33,086
<i>It hurts. </i>

240
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,882
It hurts.

241
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,993
Oh, please. Please.

242
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:49,560
You broke the number-one rule, Jacques.

243
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:51,571
You tried to stand
in hell's way.

244
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,869
What are you talking about?

245
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:57,878
The toy maker's bloodline
has survived.

246
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:04,275
The box.

247
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,286
America.

248
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,137
<i> It's both</i>
<i>my pleasure and honor... </i>

249
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,268
to present this award on behalf
of the architectural community...

250
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:06,006
to Mr. John Merchant.

251
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,014
John.

252
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,589
Thank you.

253
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:17,852
I've always thought
that the...

254
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,520
applause from your peers
is the best kind of applause,

255
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:24,326
and I am truly touched
by, uh, your reception...

256
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,696
and by this award.

257
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,975
Originally,
when I had put myself...

258
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,785
Leonardo da Vinci
once said that no work of art...

259
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:51,882
is ever completed,

260
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,951
only abandoned.

261
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:57,156
And I never understood
what he meant until now.

262
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,000
Thank you.
Good night.

263
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:09,475
Very nice speech.

264
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,679
<i>Honey, it's okay. </i>
<i>Let's just go. </i>

265
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:22,650
<i> Toy maker. </i>

266
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:25,955
<i> I know I brought it with me. </i>

267
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,864
- Idiot!
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

268
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:40,533
- I didn't even see you.
- Oh, forgive me.

269
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:43,202
- I'm very sorry.
- That was very rude.

270
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,782
Now I'll have to think of a way
to make it up to you.

271
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,620
<i>Why are we going to the basement?</i>
<i>At least tell me your name. </i>

272
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:02,561
Do we really need to know
each other's names?

273
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,326
Mystery woman, huh?

274
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,130
Aren't you excited
by mystery?

275
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:11,000
Ooh, yeah. You bet.

276
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,205
You seem to be pretty
familiar with this place.

277
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:18,575
I'm just following
my instincts.

278
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,487
Do you like games?

279
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,857
You're a dream.

280
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,527
Almost.

281
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:52,505
<i>Close your eyes. </i>
<i>Trust me. </i>

282
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,514
Okay.

283
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,700
What's going on?

284
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:19,835
Can I look now?

285
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:21,841
<i>You can look now. </i>

286
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:28,677
Time to play another game.

287
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:40,026
I have such sights
to show you.

288
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:43,730
All right.

289
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,452
What's happening?

290
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,663
Angelique.

291
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,345
Things seem to have changed.

292
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:53,189
Hell is more ordered
since your time, Princess.

293
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:56,662
And much less amusing.

294
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:03,799
- <i>The box did this?</i>
- <i>A man did this. </i>

295
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:08,604
But the box called him.
It called to his blood.

296
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:10,610
His ancestor made the box...

297
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:14,079
<i>and would have unmade</i>
<i>all of us. </i>

298
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,447
You've been away too long,
Princess.

299
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:20,612
This is not a room.

300
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:24,055
This is a holocaust...

301
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,458
waiting to wake itself.

302
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,000
If we could just move
this whole thing right up...

303
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,161
to give it
a little more height.

304
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,797
- There's a woman here to see you.
- Tell her to have a seat, okay?

305
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:42,070
- Okay.
- <i> John Merchant and Associates. </i>

306
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:50,817
I know you.

307
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:54,184
You've no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you again.

308
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:59,784
This is all very good.

309
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:03,290
You're the one
we've been waiting for.

310
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,128
Who are you?

311
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,668
A friend, I hope.

312
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,795
A client, I'm sure.

313
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,350
Is this yours?

314
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,352
No.

315
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:34,155
This has been in my family
for hundreds of years.

316
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,924
<i>I'm working on something</i>
<i>based on it. </i>

317
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,330
- May I see it?
- Nobody's seen it.

318
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,928
Then let me be the first.

319
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:47,634
<i>To put it simply, it's something</i>
<i>I want to do with mirrors and lasers. </i>

320
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:52,042
See, in theory, it's possible.

321
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:55,446
Perpetual light.

322
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:58,679
<i>Trapped light feeding off</i>
<i>its own reflections. </i>

323
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,324
<i> I haven't perfected</i>
<i>the light yet. </i>

324
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:07,122
<i>Something's missing,</i>
<i>and I can't make it work. </i>

325
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:09,628
<i>It'll go for a few seconds... </i>

326
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,131
then it'll blink out.

327
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,536
<i>Sometimes a few seconds</i>
<i>are more than enough,</i>

328
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,540
<i>toy maker. </i>

329
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,211
What did you call me?

330
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:30,582
You think you don't remember,
but your blood knows.

331
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,585
Let it remind you.

332
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:38,658
- Angelique.
- You know me from dreams.

333
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:41,661
John Merchant.
John L'Merchant.

334
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:47,260
We have a destiny...

335
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,268
together.

336
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,772
I don't believe in destiny.

337
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:57,144
You think your work
on the building was an accident?

338
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,202
It called to you, John.

339
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:03,416
We have great work to do.

340
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,418
I shall be in touch.

341
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:54,067
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

342
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:04,769
What time is it?

343
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:11,011
- Hello.
- L'Merchant.

344
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:13,679
I have to see you.

345
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:15,688
- <i> Can we meet? Today. </i>
- <i> Yeah. Okay. </i>

346
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:18,122
- <i> We'll go over it tomorrow. </i>
- At your office.

347
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:21,286
Okay. Bye.

348
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:23,523
Business.

349
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:26,327
Some Japanese client.
Got no sense of time.

350
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,878
I grow impatient
with the Princess.

351
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:48,786
Human acquiescence is as easily
obtained by terror...

352
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:51,051
as by temptation.

353
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,768
- New building.
- Must be.

354
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,070
- Settling?
- Yeah. Settling.

355
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:12,169
Still hungry?

356
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:16,910
Ready for something that screams?

357
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:21,549
<i> So she starts</i>
<i>asking me all kinds of weird questions. </i>

358
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,681
<i>Like what?</i>

359
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:27,193
Like, would I do it with a woman
that used to be a man?

360
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:29,991
- Like with a guy that had it cut off?
- Yeah.

361
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:32,897
Hormones, the whole bit.

362
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,993
- So, what'd you say?
- I mean, I guess so.

363
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,436
If she was cut
and all.

364
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,971
- What's this?
- It's a door.

365
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:48,378
<i>I know it's a door,</i>
<i>but it isn't on the chart. </i>

366
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:51,717
Genius college boys.

367
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:35,326
A pity the mirror will not
show your true beauty, Princess.

368
00:43:35,396 --> 00:43:39,856
Your human admirer
may not sense it,

369
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:45,200
but I can smell
the exquisite stench...

370
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,797
of what you really are!

371
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,333
<i> You know, I'm starting</i>
<i>not to like this so much. </i>

372
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:54,677
- You know, I was just thinking the same thing.
- Well, maybe...

373
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:56,682
Shit!

374
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,951
- <i>We should check it out. </i>
- Speak for yourself.

375
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:12,530
This is getting weird.

376
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,533
You coming?

377
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,365
<i>Go ahead. </i>
<i>Check it out. </i>

378
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:19,372
Well, at least
watch my back.

379
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,374
You got it.

380
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:38,853
You look like death, Princess.

381
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,705
Temptation is illusion.

382
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,799
But the time for trickery
is past.

383
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:59,539
In this game, we show ourselves
as we really are.

384
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,049
What's that?

385
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,244
The beauty of suffering.

386
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,647
You are no different
from that beast...

387
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:13,852
that sucks the bones
you throw to it.

388
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:18,964
And you, Princess.

389
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:21,398
What are you?

390
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:03,636
You scared the shit out
of me, man! What's wrong with you?

391
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,871
My flashlight died.
I tripped and fell.

392
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:08,176
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>we stick together. Always. </i>

393
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:10,808
Together. Right.

394
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:28,728
Someone's messing
with our heads.

395
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:38,340
<i> Freeze!</i>

396
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:42,508
- Just back it up against the wall!
- You heard him. Back it up!

397
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,551
Don't make us
put some pain on you.

398
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:47,348
Pain?

399
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:50,322
How dare you use that word.

400
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,790
He's got pins
in his head.

401
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,795
What you think of
as pain...

402
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:58,798
is only a shadow.

403
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:01,858
Pain has a face.

404
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:06,971
Allow me to show it to you.

405
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,237
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

406
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:14,371
I... am... pain.

407
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:21,979
I know your fear.

408
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,989
I hear it.

409
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:30,158
"Please, don't separate me
from my brother. "

410
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:34,326
<i>I give you my word... </i>

411
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,335
<i>that will never happen. </i>

412
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:41,334
A lesson, Princess.

413
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:45,504
<i>Work with me,</i>
<i>or for me. </i>

414
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:05,984
Temptation is worthless,
Princess.

415
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:09,085
<i>Suffering is the coin</i>
<i>of the realm. </i>

416
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:13,428
I will teach your human Merchant
about the value of suffering.

417
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,991
I will buy his secret...

418
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:18,629
with a bounty of pain.

419
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:23,135
<i>They say</i>
<i>the greatest suffering... </i>

420
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,474
a parent can know...

421
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,377
is the loss of a child.

422
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,160
Honey, Mommy'll be back
in five minutes, okay?

423
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:50,828
- Jack.
- Mom, I'm concentrating.

424
00:49:58,512 --> 00:50:01,572
- <i> I don't know what I'm doing here. </i>
- <i> I had to see you. </i>

425
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,653
Whatever you want.

426
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,320
We were good together, John.

427
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:17,896
Yes.

428
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,034
We will be again.

429
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:22,157
<i> Mommy!</i>

430
00:51:39,882 --> 00:51:43,648
<i>Oh, God!</i>

431
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:46,984
Oh, thank God!

432
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:50,287
- <i> Jack, honey, baby, come here. </i>
- I can't, Mommy.

433
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:53,021
He won't let me.

434
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,560
<i>What, baby?</i>

435
00:51:57,633 --> 00:51:59,931
- <i>Mom. </i>
- Oh, God.

436
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:03,369
Young... unformed.

437
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:09,468
Oh, what appetites
I could teach him.

438
00:52:09,545 --> 00:52:12,981
Just give him to me, please!

439
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:15,881
Oh, you suffer beautifully.

440
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:19,409
But I am here for business,
not pleasure.

441
00:52:19,488 --> 00:52:22,980
- Just tell me what you want.
- Oh, I want bait.

442
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:28,186
Live bait.

443
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,897
Bobbi! Jack!
Bobbi!

444
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:14,008
You stay here.

445
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:31,678
<i>Oh, thank God. </i>

446
00:54:31,753 --> 00:54:33,948
John, don't!

447
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:38,349
<i>Easy. </i>

448
00:54:43,132 --> 00:54:46,966
I don't know who
or what you are...

449
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:49,299
and I don't care.

450
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:52,306
I just want my wife
and my kid back!

451
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:55,036
Oh, I understand...

452
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:58,112
how you love this boy.

453
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,308
<i>You have plans for him. </i>

454
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:03,817
<i>Hopes and dreams. </i>

455
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:06,946
A whole imagined future...

456
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:10,389
where you love him
and watch him grow.

457
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:14,088
- Yes.
- Then complete your work.

458
00:55:15,297 --> 00:55:17,629
<i>Or, though the boy</i>
<i>will not die here,</i>

459
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:21,931
for a thousand years his dearest wish
will be that he had!

460
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:23,471
For God's sake!

461
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:27,373
Do I look like someone
who cares what God thinks?

462
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:31,141
Just tell me what you want.

463
00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:37,518
The box.

464
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:41,717
<i>Apathway to hell... </i>

465
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:46,294
made by
an ancestor of yours.

466
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:50,357
The room downstairs...

467
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:54,027
potentially
a bigger pathway.

468
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,330
You will help...

469
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:03,435
to fulfill its promise.

470
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,378
Come on!

471
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:48,988
Come on, Jack.

472
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:50,991
This way.
Come on!

473
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,823
- We're gonna split up. Take the other stairwell.
- What?

474
00:56:53,895 --> 00:56:57,854
I've got a plan. Jack, it'll be okay.
All right? You can do it.

475
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:08,176
Come on, you bastard.
It's me you want.

476
00:57:08,243 --> 00:57:10,609
<i>Don't flatter yourself. </i>

477
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:15,639
I don't want you, child.
I want what you were born with: A gift.

478
00:57:15,717 --> 00:57:18,151
The lights.

479
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,680
<i>Oh, no. Not light. </i>
<i>Darkness is where you find me. </i>

480
00:57:27,296 --> 00:57:31,289
<i>Good. </i>
<i>Stand your ground. </i>

481
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,934
Family man.

482
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:39,503
The box,

483
00:57:39,574 --> 00:57:42,065
once thought so powerful,

484
00:57:42,144 --> 00:57:44,078
is only a model.

485
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:48,606
<i>What you will give me</i>
<i>is the true version. </i>

486
00:57:48,684 --> 00:57:51,676
No longer will we have to
seep into your world...

487
00:57:51,753 --> 00:57:54,688
like pests through cracks
in the baseboards.

488
00:57:54,756 --> 00:57:57,919
Once and for all,
we will open the gates,

489
00:57:57,993 --> 00:58:00,052
lay low the ramparts.

490
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:03,961
<i>Isn't that what the Princess</i>
<i>wants from you?</i>

491
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:07,729
Isn't that the game
that you two have been playing?

492
00:58:07,803 --> 00:58:11,136
- This isn't a game.
- Oh, yes.

493
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:14,369
This <i>is</i> a game.

494
00:58:15,744 --> 00:58:18,542
And now it is time...

495
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:20,547
to play.

496
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,014
I shall go first.

497
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:31,590
Daddy!

498
00:58:33,228 --> 00:58:35,253
<i>Run!</i>

499
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:40,927
It is time to open
the pathway... forever.

500
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,765
<i>That's impossible!</i>

501
00:58:58,186 --> 00:59:01,713
No. No!

502
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:31,210
Does this pathway
work both ways?

503
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:39,489
<i>Toy maker. </i>

504
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:41,756
Come here, Jack!

505
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:46,593
So young.

506
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:50,069
So tender.

507
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,265
- So ripe.
- <i> Daddy!</i>

508
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,504
- Get your hands off of him!
- Get your hands on the console, toy maker.

509
00:59:56,578 --> 00:59:59,604
<i>You have work to do. </i>

510
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:08,889
<i> Open the pathway for me!</i>

511
01:00:16,231 --> 01:00:19,029
The toy maker's design.

512
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,414
Do it!

513
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,587
- Jack!
- Daddy!

514
01:00:56,905 --> 01:01:00,966
- Run, Jack!
- No more games.

515
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:24,965
- Jack!
- Mommy!

516
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:28,491
You go play with your dog,
you bastard!

517
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,343
The boy lived.

518
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:11,470
He carried
the bloodline,

519
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:15,073
the guilt for what
our family had begun.

520
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:18,415
And how to undo it.
Did he carry that too?

521
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:22,684
Yes. It was passed down
through the generations.

522
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:28,189
It came upon me first
in my dreams.

523
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:30,925
My blood was speaking to me
while I slept,

524
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:34,025
telling me to make good the damage
L'Merchant had done...

525
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:37,071
all those centuries ago.

526
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:40,298
Dr. Merchant,
what were you doing...

527
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:44,106
when Parker and I found you
in your cabin?

528
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:48,013
<i>Summoning a demon</i>
<i>or two. </i>

529
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:50,017
Maybe more.

530
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:53,646
- And did you succeed?
- <i>Oh, yes. </i>

531
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:57,055
It was much easier
than I thought.

532
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:51,669
Merchant, do you hear me?

533
01:03:55,183 --> 01:03:57,151
I know you're watching.

534
01:04:02,123 --> 01:04:05,684
We'd almost given up
waiting for you to play.

535
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,593
Long wait, demon,

536
01:04:08,663 --> 01:04:10,597
for such a short game.

537
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:14,123
Short? Ohh.

538
01:04:14,202 --> 01:04:18,002
Is that any way to treat
an old friend of the family?

539
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:22,669
<i>No. Tell the truth,</i>
<i>Merchant. </i>

540
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:25,736
You're pleased to see me.

541
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:28,009
Your impatience...

542
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,244
has matched my own.

543
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:32,343
Perhaps.

544
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:39,016
But now curiosity
is satisfied.

545
01:04:39,094 --> 01:04:40,994
<i>And it's time for revenge. </i>

546
01:04:41,062 --> 01:04:44,498
<i>Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>consider yourself relieved. </i>

547
01:04:44,566 --> 01:04:47,091
Not now.
I let them out!

548
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:51,297
What's wrong with this
is I don't believe in hell.

549
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:54,671
<i>But it believes in you,</i>
<i>and it's out there right now. </i>

550
01:04:57,412 --> 01:04:59,346
I don't frighten easily.

551
01:04:59,414 --> 01:05:02,781
<i>Well, stop thinking</i>
<i>and start feeling!</i>

552
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:05,877
Your gut knows that I'm
telling you the truth.

553
01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:10,186
There's something in this station
right now that wants our souls.

554
01:05:10,258 --> 01:05:13,716
And whether you believe in hell or not,
it's gonna take us there.

555
01:05:13,795 --> 01:05:17,891
<i>Solar alignment in place. </i>

556
01:05:17,966 --> 01:05:20,560
- Twenty-three minutes to
complete mission. -

557
01:05:20,635 --> 01:05:24,401
Please...
get off this station.

558
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:27,339
Let me save
at least one soul.

559
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:29,603
We go together,
or we don't go at all.

560
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:33,204
Then we go together.
Just let me finish.

561
01:05:35,283 --> 01:05:38,980
Rimmer, we're pulling out as soon as
Parker finishes checking Merchant's cabin.

562
01:05:39,053 --> 01:05:43,114
Get him out of there now.
You don't know what they're capable of!

563
01:05:43,191 --> 01:05:48,026
Rimmer, escort the prisoner to his cell
and prepare to leave at 04:30 hours.

564
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:54,201
What the...

565
01:05:59,274 --> 01:06:02,209
<i> Help! Help!</i>

566
01:06:02,277 --> 01:06:06,680
- <i>Save me! Hurry!</i>
- My God!

567
01:06:06,748 --> 01:06:09,182
- <i>We're trapped!</i>
- <i>Hurry!</i>

568
01:06:11,986 --> 01:06:15,422
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Get us out of here!</i>

569
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:19,085
<i>Hurry!</i>

570
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,094
<i>In here!</i>

571
01:06:51,025 --> 01:06:52,959
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

572
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:57,396
<i>The remnants of a most</i>
<i>unsatisfying victim. </i>

573
01:06:57,465 --> 01:07:00,195
<i>Still... </i>

574
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:02,498
you're here
to change all that.

575
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:06,265
<i>Aren't you?</i>

576
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:36,462
<i> Merchant has a plan. </i>

577
01:07:37,872 --> 01:07:40,067
Kill them all.

578
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:44,674
I keep trying to raise Parker.
He's not responding.

579
01:07:44,746 --> 01:07:47,010
- I'm going to go check it out.
- He's dead!

580
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:50,642
And if you don't let me out to finish
my work, you're all dead!

581
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:23,984
Chamberlain.

582
01:08:24,052 --> 01:08:27,579
Parker's dead.

583
01:08:27,655 --> 01:08:30,647
- What?
- <i>Parker's dead. </i>

584
01:08:30,725 --> 01:08:34,752
Oh, God.

585
01:08:34,829 --> 01:08:38,765
Don't know what the hell's
going on.

586
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:41,734
Just remember:
Shoot first.

587
01:08:41,803 --> 01:08:43,737
<i>Out. </i>

588
01:09:19,507 --> 01:09:23,204
<i>Help me, please!</i>
<i>Please, help me!</i>

589
01:10:16,531 --> 01:10:20,160
Please.

590
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:23,203
Help me.

591
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,024
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

592
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:55,228
What the fuck planet
are you from?

593
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:58,670
<i>Come on. </i>

594
01:12:08,976 --> 01:12:13,072
- Can you still do it? Can you stop them?
- I can try.

595
01:12:13,147 --> 01:12:15,581
I need a couple of minutes to get
the coordinates locked in from here.

596
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:18,050
Give you a chance to get to the ship.
Go. Now!

597
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,215
- <i> We can't</i> <i>leave without Carducci. </i>
- Carducci, come in!

598
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,850
I'm going after him.
Get to the ship.

599
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:27,417
That weapon
will not protect you!

600
01:12:30,164 --> 01:12:33,156
But I know something
that will.

601
01:12:59,227 --> 01:13:01,161
Oh, no.

602
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:04,631
He said it could protect me.

603
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:06,667
<i>He told me what to do. </i>

604
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:08,668
Please, go ahead.

605
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:17,075
It's a box.

606
01:13:17,144 --> 01:13:19,078
<i>It's just a box. </i>

607
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:24,409
Thank God
for men of reason.

608
01:13:28,522 --> 01:13:30,387
<i> Finish it. </i>

609
01:14:34,155 --> 01:14:37,921
<i>Now the final movement</i>
<i>begins. </i>

610
01:14:40,261 --> 01:14:43,697
Soon the bloodline
will be severed.

611
01:14:46,534 --> 01:14:50,368
You and your ancestors have
proved worthy opponents.

612
01:14:50,438 --> 01:14:52,531
The taste of victory...

613
01:14:52,606 --> 01:14:55,370
is almost bittersweet.

614
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:05,679
<i>Glorious, is it not?</i>

615
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:08,415
<i>Perfect. </i>

616
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:11,549
The creatures that walk
on its surface,

617
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:14,321
always looking
to the light,

618
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:19,025
never seeing the untold oceans
of darkness beyond.

619
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:23,469
<i>There are more humans alive</i>
<i>at this moment... </i>

620
01:15:23,537 --> 01:15:27,496
than in all
its pitiful history.

621
01:15:29,543 --> 01:15:32,341
The Garden of Eden.

622
01:15:33,748 --> 01:15:37,616
A garden of flesh.

623
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:45,017
<i>Nowhere to run this time,</i>
<i>toy maker. </i>

624
01:15:46,127 --> 01:15:48,061
No escape.

625
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:52,526
Double back down this hallway
and get to the shuttle.

626
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,331
- You've got five minutes, Rimmer.
- Together, you said.

627
01:15:56,404 --> 01:15:59,396
- I'm not done here.
- Well, then, I don't go.

628
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:01,703
I'm coming right after you.

629
01:16:01,776 --> 01:16:03,971
Just be ready.

630
01:16:04,044 --> 01:16:07,571
We're not gonna have much time
once this thing goes.

631
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:10,917
Trust me.

632
01:16:10,985 --> 01:16:13,749
<i>I'm not going to sacrifice myself</i>
<i>if I can help it. </i>

633
01:16:13,821 --> 01:16:16,085
I'm not that crazy.

634
01:16:28,335 --> 01:16:30,496
Oh, my God.

635
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,189
Here, doggie.

636
01:16:57,531 --> 01:17:00,967
Play dead.

637
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:16,339
<i> Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>two minutes to complete mission. </i>

638
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:21,150
Two minutes.
Two centuries.

639
01:17:21,222 --> 01:17:24,783
It all ticks by
so quickly.

640
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,224
You are so very like
your ancestor.

641
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:30,661
Did you know that?

642
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:33,996
I have the distinct
sense of deja vu.

643
01:17:34,068 --> 01:17:36,628
The same defiance,

644
01:17:36,704 --> 01:17:40,731
the same faithless hope
in the light.

645
01:17:40,808 --> 01:17:44,005
- And what do you have faith in?
- <i>Nothing. </i>

646
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:49,015
I am so exquisitely empty.

647
01:17:54,388 --> 01:17:57,824
Then it won't hurt you
to die.

648
01:17:57,892 --> 01:18:00,258
Will it?

649
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:03,057
I cannot die.

650
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,691
I am forever.

651
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:15,465
<i> Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>one minute to complete mission. </i>

652
01:18:17,945 --> 01:18:20,379
Where are you,
toy maker?

653
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:25,084
Here.

654
01:18:25,152 --> 01:18:28,952
<i>Hologram. See, it's all done</i>
<i>with mirrors. </i>

655
01:18:29,023 --> 01:18:30,888
Like this.

656
01:18:40,134 --> 01:18:42,864
What have you done?

657
01:18:42,937 --> 01:18:45,269
I have faith in the light.

658
01:18:45,339 --> 01:18:48,274
- What?
- <i>The light, demon. The light. </i>

659
01:18:53,013 --> 01:18:56,210
- Endgame, demon.
- No!

660
01:18:57,985 --> 01:19:00,317
I cannot die!

661
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:47,124
<i> Welcome to oblivion. </i>
