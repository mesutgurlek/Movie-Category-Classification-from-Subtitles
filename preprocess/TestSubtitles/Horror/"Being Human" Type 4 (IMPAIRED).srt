00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,880
I didn't fetch you back here
to do anything. Just...just be here.

Mm-hm?
Where's Annie?

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,160
Mm...er...probably off
on one of her midnight rambles.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,720
She doesn't need sleep,
unlike some of us.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,760
Can I have a word?
But...oh.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,160
Can't it wait until the morning,
or at least until after I've peed?

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. After you pee.

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,320
I can't go now.

HE SIGHS
Finally.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,640
You knew?

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,320
Oh, Mitchell, Annie is many things
but subtle she is not.

35
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,200
You've rescued her from hell.

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,080
That kind of thing tends
to turn a girl's head.

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
How long have you known?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,240
I don't know. A couple of weeks.
Pretty much since she came back.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,960
And, for future reference,
no-one says "fancy" any more.

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,120
And you didn't think to tell me?
Um...no, because I'm not 12.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Did you...did you seriously
not pick up on any of this?

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,760
That whole guardian angel business.
OK, so she hasn't actually told you.

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,960
Oh, wow. We are 12, aren't we?

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,280
No, she hasn't told me
she "fancies" you.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,440
She doesn't need to.
Her body language is deafening.

Oh, why don't you take a picture,
you nosy bitch?

You can see me?
What?

No, not today, thank you.

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,080
But who knows? You... you two
could be good for each other.

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,520
She could be good for me. But...
And you'll be good to her.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,400
Of course. I'd never...

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
If you're thinking about doing this,
don't go into it lightly.

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
This is no little thing.
This is Annie we're talking about.

George.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,760
You've got to know
I would never hurt her.

HE CHUCKLES
Yeah, I know.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
Sure, I was just...

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,080
So, are you...
are you gonna ask her out?

66
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
This could be so cool!

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,400
I don't know.
I mean, how would it even work?

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,160
With a ghost?
What do you mean?

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,800
Er...

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,480
Guys, I'm in trouble.
There's a dead woman after me.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,400
What...what happened? Are you OK?

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,640
I was walking past this club
on Westland Street.

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,960
You know, that...
that down-market version of Ritzy's.

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Yeah, I know, like that's really
possible.

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,840
Anyway, this dead woman got thrown
out of the club, but...
but she could see me.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,480
BANGING ON DOOR
And she followed me home!

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,520
Why didn't you just
"Rentaghost" home?

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
That would be...that would be
because...

79
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
BANGING ON DOOR
I was under a lot of pressure, OK?

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,880

A drunk dead woman, shouting.

You! I know you're bloody in there!

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,400
That's not a ghost. I can smell her.
Come on!

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,760
You think you're so bloody...
What, from here?

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Well, of course you can smell her.
She's got a body.

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,520
I'm sure I mentioned that.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,520
So, she's dead but she's got a body?
Which is rotting.

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
This is not good.
That's why I'm so scared!

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,200
If she was just dead dead, no
problem. But that is just weird!

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
No, hold on. Hold on a second here.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,240

Oh! I thought we were
supposed to be the scary ones.

101
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,120
Go and check the window.

102
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
Go!

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,840
Go on.

104
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,640
She's mental! Of course she is.

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,520
There's a car slowing down.
I think people can see her!

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Well, of course they can see her!
She's got a body!

107
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,040
We've got to let her in.
BOTH: What?

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,200
We have a shouting pissed corpse
on our doorstep.

109
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,240
Right, and you want
a shouting pissed corpse inside?

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,960
She's gonna draw attention
to the house, Annie, to us.

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,280
What if somebody calls
the police, huh? Oh...!

112
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
Come on!

113
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,120
Well, she...she's stopped shouting.

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,640
What's she doing now?
GIRL SOBS

115
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,320
Crying, I think.

116
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
And then just sitting.

117
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,920
But she's still quite loud.
She stinks.

118
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,280
SHE SOBS

119
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Um...um...

120
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Would...would you like some tea?

121
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,680
Huh?

122
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,360

Straighteners!

129

Straighteners?
Yeah.

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,680
Oh, good. Great.

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,800
Because that will solve everything.
Mm-hm.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Nina... um...
can I borrow your straighteners?

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,960
Yeah, sure, course.

A dead woman with a body
followed Annie home.

137
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
Of course.

138
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,120
Here.
You do it, babe.

139
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,360
So, um...what do we call you?
Anything you like, sweetheart.

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Ow! Oh, sorry! Look,
you got caught there.

141
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Caught a little bit of your hair.
Sorry. Don't worry, babe.

142
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,960
I can tell
you're not used to a beauty regime.

143
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,120
Well, um...I'm Mitchell.

144
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,760
Oh, hi, Mitchell. I'm Sasha.

that's a beautiful dress, Sasha.

151
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,320
What a wonderful cut. Have you, have
you been to a hospital recently?

152
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,880
OK. Confession time.

153
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,160
I was involved in a car accident.
But, you know, it wasn't my fault.

154
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,040
I was texting while I was driving,
but that's not making a phone call.

155

In my Beemer, Prussian blue,
heated seats, all the extras.

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,640
So, you died, did you?

159
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,960
SQUELCHY CRUNCH
Well, no. Obviously I didn't.

160
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,280
Yeah, but apparently
it was touch and go.

161
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh, and let me tell you, the
doctors were very interested in me.

162
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,720
Wouldn't leave me alone.
Kept on prodding and poking me.

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,760
And I said, "You'd better warm
that up before you put it near me."

164
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,040
SHE LAUGHS

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,440
Ooh. I know, what is that smell?

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
I think someone's in denial.
How can she not know she's dead?

167
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
It solves one mystery, anyway.

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
The mortuary suddenly
being off limits.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
No, that was a chemical leak.
Or they were hiding a zombie.

170
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
Oh, Christ.
Are we really gonna call her that?

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, dead body moving about?

172
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,640
Can I just take a little step back
to point out how insane this is?

173
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,160
Mitchell, what the hell is she?
How should I know?

174
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,320
At least she's not attacking us.
Don't they usually attack people?

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,520
No, they don't usually do anything,
because they don't usually exist.

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,640
What about eating brains?

177
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,600
I don't know the rules. I know that
she can be seen and she's rotten.

178
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Mm-hm, I can vouch for that.

179
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,360
Do you think she'll continue rotting
until she's, you know, soupy?

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,160
Oh! We should take her back. Whatever
she is, she's not our problem.

181
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,960
She's the hospital's problem.

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,520
Oh, I hate to say it, but I agree.
Really?

183
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,120
Well, medically,
we can't do anything for her here.

184
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,040
If anyone can help her,
they're at the hospital.

185
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
OK, so we're all agreed.

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,600
Yeah, all of us but Annie.

187
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Sorry about all that earlier,
calling you a bitch and that.

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
It was out of order.

189
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
I was a bit pissed.

191
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,120
I wanted to get a bit of
Dutch courage before I went home.

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,600
Home?
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,240
I thought, you know,
bit of a drink, put on a bit of slap

194
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
and then go and
see my fella, Gethin.

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,080
He's a scrum half
for the Cardiff Blues, you know.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,200
Ah, that's nice.

197
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,400
SQUELCHING

198
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,120
Anyway, um...you got a mirror?

199
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,640
Um...I don't actually
think we do, no.

200
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,560
I don't... I don't think
your friends like me much.

201
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,400
What? No! Don't be...don't be
so silly.

202
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,520
They're just like that.
Oh, it's all right.

203
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,680
Happens all the time, you know.

204
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,920
Guys get awkward, start showing off,
and the girls get jealous.

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
I get it a lot.

206
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,440
So, um...what's Mitchell's story?
Is he single?

207
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,640
No. No, he's my boyfriend.

208
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,200
Really?
Yep.

209
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Really.
Wow!

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
You did well there, didn't you?

211
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,800
Didn't I?
Annie? Do you want to...

212
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,920
Please, yes. Good.
..and I'll take over for, um...

213
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,200
She has got to go.

214
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,520
Wow! That was easy.

215
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,680
Yeah, we thought
we'd have to persuade you.

216
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,080
What with you both
being dead and all.

217
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
She may well be dead,

218
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,960
but that is pretty much all
I have in common with that...

219
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,800
that...chavalanche.

220
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,120
Great. That's settled. I'll leave
it all in your capable hands.

221
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm going back to bed.
Whoa, whoa. What?

222
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,160
Annie's invisible to normals.
You can't be seen on CCTV.

223
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,440
I think you can manage sneaking one
zombie back into a hospital.

224
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
Now, I am taking my lady friend
back to bed.

225
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,840
Good night.

226
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,000
What?
Aw.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,280
Good night. Night.

228
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,720
SHE GIGGLES

229
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Ooh.
What's that?

230
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,240
That's the tag from her toe.
It was stuck to her shoe.

231
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh.

232
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,680
SHE HUMS A TUNE

233
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,640
So, um...how are we gonna convince
her to go back to the hospital?

234
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,480
We're not.

235
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,280
Not yet.
What? Why?

236
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,520
Check out the time
and date of death.

237
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,440
Let's pay a visit to the morgue.

238
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,480
HE URINATES
Oh.

239
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Oh.

240
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Oh.

241
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,920
HE STOPS URINATING

242
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,600
TOILET FLUSHES

243
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,000
DOOR OPENS

244
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,280
Nina. Nina?

245
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,800
Mm-hm?

246
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
Is this yours?

247
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
I thought, it can't be Mitchell's
because he's a man,

248
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,240
nor Annie's cos she's dead, it can't
be Nina's cos she's on the pill.

249
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,280
You're on the pill.

250
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Why would you be needing
a pregnancy test? Are you late?

251
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
When were you thinking
about telling me? Look...

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,320
I was looking for the right moment.
OK, I'm not busy now. Are you busy?

253
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,960
Fine. I'm pregnant.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,720
Oh, my God. But you're on the pill.
Yes. I am.

255
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,200
But we had sex when we weren't
exactly ourselves

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,360
and apparently, the pill wasn't
designed with werewolves in mind.

257
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
But you know
these tests can be wrong.

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Look... Oh, I've done three tests.
I'm pregnant, George.

259
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,200
It's happening.

260
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Or rather, it's not.
I can't... I can't...

261
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,360
I can't let this go any further.

262
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,640
Um...I'm sorry.

263
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,600
OK, so, um...let me get this
straight.

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,840
If I hadn't have found this,

265
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,320
would you have just had an abortion
without telling me? No.

266
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,400
I was planning...
God. You were just going to do it.

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,960
No discussion, no nothing.
Don't you dare judge me.

268
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,720
This isn't some...
some teenage mistake, George.

269
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,000
This is a child of...monsters.

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,840
I mean, who even knows
what it could be?

271
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,360
Just the idea is terrifying.

272
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
It could be fine.

273
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,800
We're both fine! Most of the time.

274
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,600
It's my body, George.
Yeah, well, part of it isn't.

275
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Excuse me?
There is part of me in there.

276
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,480
As the father, I have as much right

277
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,920
as you to decide what
happens to our child.

278
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,560
HE HUFFS

279
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,560
I only got up for a pee!

280
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,600
DOOR HANDLE RATTLES

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,080
Is that blood?

282
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
Oh, that can't be good.

283
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,640
SHE PANTS: I'm already dead.
I'm already dead. I'm already dead.

284
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,960
'I'm already dead.'

285
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,400
What's that?
Where?

286
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
There.

287
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
Hey.

288
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,720
Bingo.

289
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,160
I don't think it was just Sasha.

290
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,880
I've got four subject sheets here.

291
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,680
All came back to life
all at the same time.

292
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,320
I think they were testing them,
trying to find out what they were.

293
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
How they worked.

'SCREAMS'

297
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,720
I know the feeling.

298
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Does it say anything
about anaesthetic in there?

299
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,960
Yeah.

300
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Um...anaesthetic ineffective.

301
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,880
How did you know?
They did it anyway.

with them afterwards?

305
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,120
Incinerated them...

306
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,920
as a biohazard.

307
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,000
Were they still alive
when they burned them?

308
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
I don't know.

309
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, doesn't matter anyway,
does it?

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,120
Because they weren't really alive,
were they?

311
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,480
And the dead don't feel
real pain.

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,360
SHE WHEEZES

315
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
SIREN IN DISTANCE

316
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Funny, somehow I thought
you'd be taller,

317
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,880
you know, close up, like.

318
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm sorry, do I know you?

319
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,040
Oh, no. No, no, no. No. God, no.

320
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,680
No, it's just that, um...

321
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,960
well, um... it's just that
I'm like you, you know.

322
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,440
OK, all right, easy, easy.

323
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,040
So, you're a vampire? Yeah, yeah,
I am a brother of the blood.

324
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Name's Graham.
Well, Graham was my mortal name.

325
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,640
But when I was reborn to the night,
I took the name of Siddion.

326
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
Graham's fine.

327
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,840
Siddion, I don't know what I was
thinking. It's a shit name.

328
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,720
Yeah, um...all right, Graham.

329
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,320
Um...I'm kind of busy right now
so can I help you with anything?

330
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,040
Oh, God, I feel a little bit
embarrassed now,

331
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
but I am a little bit
of a fanboy.

332
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Or I could say fang boy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

333
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,480
And I was a massive
Neil Diamond fan.

334
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,520
Do you know Neil Diamond?

335
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
No, doesn't matter. But, um...
that kind of gave me the idea.

336
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
So, now I'm on a sort of pilgrimage,
you know, like a star tour,

337
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,160
and I'm visiting all the legends in
our little world, so naturally...

338
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,320
You came to see me.
Oh, my God.

339
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,520
You are up there with the greats.

340
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,160
What you did in Bristol,
it was just...

341
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,280
Remind me again. No, wait.
You don't need to be modest.

342
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,280
You got a whole chapter of vampires
to renounce blood. Amazing.

343
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
Are those boots Paul Smith?

344
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
Excuse me? Just wondering
where you got your boots.

345
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah, listen, um...Graham, I have
stuff that I really need to do, so...

346
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh, God, yeah. No, of course.
Of course.

347
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,800
Well, it has been such a privilege
to meet you, Mitchell.

348
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,280
And, um...maybe
I could catch you again some time?

349
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.
Maybe some time.

350
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
SOFTLY: Brilliant.

351
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
CLUNK
Yaaah!

352
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,680
SHE GROANS

353
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,480
Oh.

354
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Hungover?

355
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
Yeah, yeah, just a bit.
BONES CRUNCH

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Er...where did you two
disappear to last night?

357
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,760
Oh, to the hospital.

358
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,560
We went to find out
what happened to you.

359
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,880
We know about the others
and we know about the experiments.

360
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't know what
you're talking about.

361
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,800
I think someone else
has been drinking.

362
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, look, it's OK.

363
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,120
You're not alone.

364
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,040
We're all a bit...
different in this house.

365
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,320
How do you mean?
OK.

366
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
Well...

367
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm a ghost,

368
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,000
Mitchell's a vampire, and
George and Nina are both werewolves.

369
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,600
BOTH GIGGLE

370
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,040
Fuck off!

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,840
Werewolves!

372
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,360
HE SNIFFS

373
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
Oh, no.

374
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm ju... I've g...

375
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,280
Mitchell, wake up.

376
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,960
She's still here.
Who?

377
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,160
Who? Who do you think? She's a
little bit mouthy, little bit dead.

378
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,600
There have been developments.

379
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,560
What kind of developments?
Um...won't be a tick.

380
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,240
Mitchell, is she still here?

381
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,800
Yeah, there's been developments.
I was asking Mitchell.

382
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,320
Can you guys keep it down?
She can hear you.

383
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,240
Oh, great. Come on in. Apparently,
we're having a house meeting.

384
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,760
Look, so...so what's changed?

385
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,960
There were others like her
at the hospital.

386
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,360
They were experimenting on them.

387
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,520
Basically, they tested them to
destruction. They burnt them up.

388
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,920
Well, look, that's
a really horrible story,

389
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,680
but is this really the best place?

390
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,720
She's got nowhere else. We do have
a spare room. This was a B&B.

391
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
Oh, what? We're a supernatural
hostel now, are we?

392
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,920
What next, a mummy?

393
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,200
Look, I have had
ghost friends before.

394
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,800
This one just happens to be
in a dead body.

395
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,280
Oh, so you're friends now, are you?
You bloody hated her last night.

396
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,240
Shh! This is not about
whether or not I like her.

397
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
This is about
trying to do the right thing.

398
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Look, she is rotting!
She smells like off meat.

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Don't be so deadist.
Excuse me?

400
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,880
It's like racist,
but for dead people.

401
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,400
Have you just spent the whole night
making up words?

402
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,760
No, I have spent the whole night
watching footage

403
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,680
of screaming people
being dissected.

404
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,480
We owe her, George.
We owe her? Why do we owe her?

405
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
She came back to life two weeks ago.

406
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,680
All of them did, when I was
on the other side. Saving me.

407
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,360
So, hang on, what are we saying?
That death's door was engaged?

408
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,080
Her spirit couldn't pass over
because of me.

409
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,120
We made her.

410
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,920
We owe her. All of us do.

411
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
Guys?

412
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,960
OK, the address
is 37, The Mount, Cyncoed CF23.

413
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
WHEELS RATTLE

414
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,600
Have you got it?

415
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Hey. Nice boots.

416
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,520
Mitchell, this is brilliant,
the two of us working together.

417
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,640
Oh, my God. I wish I had a camera.

418
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,840
Not that it would do me much good,
because we don't show up on photos.

419
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,640
Which is doubly ironic, considering
what I used to do for a living.

420
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
Go on, guess, Mitchell.

421
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,600
You can't work here.
Bingo, photographer.

422
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,480
SEAGULLS CRY

423
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,960
Hey. You gave us a bit of a scare
there, wandering off like that.

424
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
Oh, yeah, sure I did.

425
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,120
You don't have to worry about me
any more. I'm home. Do you like it?

426
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,760
It's Gethin's money but my taste.

427
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,840
This is not happening.
Cara says hello.

428
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
What did you say?

429
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,160
Yeah, she got over that whole
pretending to kill

430
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,080
and bricking her up thing.

431
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,680
You'd have to ask her, though.

432
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,200
Where is she?
Don't know.

433
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,480
She's around, though.
Digging up trouble somewhere.

434
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,520
What do you want?

435
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,720
All I want to do
is mop a few floors, Mitchell.

436
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,840
Is that too much to ask?

437
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,680
Bring it on!
BEEPING AND THUDDING

438
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Oh, and the brilliant Welshman's
dominated this round.

439
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,920
Here comes the big finish.
It's a straight right.

440
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,760
GETHIN CHATTERS
AND GAME BEEPS

441
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,840
No, no, Gethin's got him.
He's got him.

442
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,440
Gethin's gonna finish.

443
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,640
BEEPING

444
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,520
Oh, he's got him.
He's got him. He's got him again.

445
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,160
You bastard!
HE GASPS

446
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,400
This is how you do grief, is it?
Playing on your bloody video games?

447
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,080
You should be in your bed,
crying your eyes out!

448
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Um... maybe we should... Sasha!
Jesus! God! That's you, innit?

449
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,920
That's really you.

450
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,360
What's happened to you?
What's happened to you...?

451
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,360
They told me you died.
Yeah, well, plainly they were wrong.

452
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
I was suing them. They'd lost
the body. Consider it found.

453
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,760
Sasha, maybe we should... Yeah,
hang on! Did you mourn me at all?

454
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,440
Course I did, course I did!
We had a wake and everything.

455
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,640
A lovely big party.
You'd have been pleased as punch.

456
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,080
Oh. Do you still love me?

457
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
Course I do.
Mm.

458
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Stay back!
What? But it's just me, babes.

459
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,720
Don't do that. I'm just the same
as I always have been.

460
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,120
Your little pumpkin.

461
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
Get away from me!

462
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,120
Oh!
Eurgh. Eurgh.

463
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,400
Gethin!

464
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,040
Geth!

465
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,720
Shall I, um...?

466
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
SQUELCHING

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,800
Uh. Oh.

468
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,720
Mm.
Oh.

469
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,280
Wow.

470
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,560
Oh.

471
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,120
Right, I'm gonna just...

472
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,960
SHE GASPS

473
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
Um...we should probably go, Sasha,
cos he's bound to call the police.

474
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,360
No, he's not. What's he gonna say?
"My dead girlfriend came back..."

475
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,800
Oh, cos I am dead.

476
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,320
Aren't I? I keep saying I'm not.

477
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,840
But...oh, I can smell myself.

478
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,720
Oh, God.

479
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,920
Well, there are worse things
than being dead.

480
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,880
Just look at me. You can
be seen and heard by others.

481
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,360
And I can't.
What, you're really a ghost?

482
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,440
Yeah.

483
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,080
But you've stayed so pretty.

484
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,000
Like the dead stay pretty
in our memories.

485
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,480
You don't think of them like me.
You never picture them rotting.

486
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,720
But I can feel it happening inside
me like heat, like a compost heap.

487
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,200
And I know what happens when
things rot. They don't last.

488
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,640
No, no, you don't know that.

489
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,480
I mean, who knows
what the rules are to this?

490
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,920
I thought when I died that would be
it for everything and it wasn't.

491
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,840
And it doesn't have to be for you.

492
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,800
No, we can...we can help you
find your way. It'll be fine.

495
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
Nina, I'm sorry.

496
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,760
I really wish we were normal.

497
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,080
I really wish we were having
a nice normal argument

498
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,360
about the pros and cons
of unwanted pregnancy

499
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,400
but...

500
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,680
we are not normal.

501
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,000
And maybe... It's not always
about the wolf, George.

502
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,040
So, what are you saying?

503
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,760
I've got other stuff, old stuff,
going on in my head.

504
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,000
It's...

505

SHE SIGHS:
It's not you.

506
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,960
It's not you, it's me.

507
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,040
No, it's becoming a mother

508
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,560
and, um...all that means.

509
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,360
You see, um...

510
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,240
...my mum used to hit me.

511
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,520
All the time.

512
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,880
For my own good, you know, and she...

SHE SNIFFS

514
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,040
...always reminded me that,
um, I was a mistake

515
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040
and, er...I'd ruined her life,

516
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,240
and I was worthless,
and I would never amount to anything.

517
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
She...

518
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,760
she made me hate myself.

519
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,880
I'm sorry. You've...
you've never said.

520
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,920
No, there's never really a good time
to bring up that conversation.

521
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,360
See, this...this thing inside me,
whatever it is...

522
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,240
..it's a baby...

523
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,960
and I will become a mother,

524
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,040
and that terrifies me
more than any werewolf bullshit.

525
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,640
SHE LAUGHS

526
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,560
You see, I was...I was pretty messed
up even before you scratched me.

527
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,040
No, you're not.

528
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,880
You are strong
and you are beautiful.

529
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,640
You are not in this alone.
I will always be there.

530
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,360

Are we having a party?
Er...not quite.

534
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,280
It's getting-ready music.
Girlie night out.

535
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,680
Thought Sasha needed something
to cheer her up,

536
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,720
such as getting pissed in a loud,
dark room that smells of sick.

537
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,480
Yeah, it is a fine tradition,
but, er...

538
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,120
Mm-hm?
..won't she be seen?

539
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,240
Ah. Make-up.

540
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,960
Works wonders. Mm-hm!

00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,680
And how are you?
Me?

543
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,360
Uh-huh.
Oh, you know me.

544
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,240
Always chipper.

545
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,720
I never use the word chipper.
I don't know why I used it then.

546
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,360
And you? Yourself? You.
Are you...are you great today?

547
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Are you milking a cow in there?
Ha-ha-ha!

548
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,520
So funny. Oh.

549
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,320
I must say, Mitchell, your old
friend is very, very interesting.

550
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,000
Two sugars, just like Mitchell. Oh,
cheers, love. All right, big fella?

551
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,640
Graham was just telling me
about the time you went skiing.

552
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,600
Funny. I don't remember that at all.

553
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,120
Well, it was more
falling than skiing.

554
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,960
We spent more time that week on
our backs, with snow in our mouths,

555
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,080
than on the skis.

556
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,360
I don't remember it
because it didn't happen.

557
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,240
Yeah, he was tough back then too,
when he was training me.

558
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,560
Such a hard taskmaster. All he used
to say was, train, train, train.

559
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,520
Train, bloody train.

560
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,160
You remember that, Mitchell?
Bloody train?

561
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,680
Yes!

562
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,080
Yes, I do, now that you mention it.

563
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,760
I don't know how I forgot about
that. That's really weird.

564
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,560
We don't want to bore
Annie with that.

565
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,680
Why don't I give you the tour?
Tour?

566
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,280
Great.
We have a tour?

567
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,880
Yeah.
Oh.

568
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,720
After you.

569
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,560
Oh.

570
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,400
And this is the cellar!

571
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,760
You...are in my home with my friends.
That is a big no-no.

572
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,680
They could be my friends, too.
No, they couldn't!

573
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,840
And you've got a spare room.
I could move in.

574
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,680
Be nice to have Annie
down the corridor.

575
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,360
Don't you even think about it.

576
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,600
That girl, she's really
holding a torch for you.

577
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,160
And I'm thinking she doesn't know,
does she, about his greatest work.

578
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,840
About all those people
you ripped apart on that train.

579
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,360
The Box Tunnel 20.

580
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,040
And I think she needs to know.

581
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,600
I think she needs to know
about the real Mitchell.

582
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,760
See how she feels about him then.

583
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,080
Or we could maybe...

584
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,920
..just maybe forget
about the whole thing.

585
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Sit down, watch a bit of Wipeout.
Have a biscuit.

586
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,400
I think that'd be for the best,
don't you?

HE SIGHS

588
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,600
Listen, er...
I've got a lot of stuff on tonight.

589
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,520
So, um...I'll catch you soon, yeah?

590
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,680
Come on, shake hands.
I'll teach you the cool one.

591
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,800
Shake.

592
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,000
OK, so first it's the normal one,
then clasp the thumb,

593
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,080
bit of that, bit of that,
bump the fist, and we're done.

594
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Not really feeling the friendship,
though.

595
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
But we can work on that.

596
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,320
Mitchell.

597
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,120
All right, mate.

598
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,560
See you later.

00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,560
this isn't the way.

780
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,920
You don't get it, do you?

781
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,960
I want to be the new legend that
vampires whisper about in the night.

782
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,200
The new king of blood.

783
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,520
Starting from now.

784
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,880
Apologies, ladies and gentlemen!
Undercover ticket inspector!

785
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,760
Get your tickets out!
Get off me!

786
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,320
He didn't have the right ticket!
Bitch!

787
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,520
Shut up, shh.

788
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,280
GRAHAM GASPS

789
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,560
So, what now, eh? You gonna kill me?

790
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,640
Cos you don't kill other vampires,
Mitchell. Cara proves that.

791
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,520
D'you wanna throw me off the train?
Go on, that's fine.

792
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,680
Cos there's plenty of other trains.
There's plenty of other targets.

793
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,120
And I swear to you,

794
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,840
what I am gonna do will make
your little massacre

795
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,600
look like a fucking paper cut.

796
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,080
How messed about are we, huh,
are vampires as a species,

797
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,080
that my story
can be seen as inspirational?

798
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,640
It has to end.

799
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,240
This story...has to die.

800
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,160
And it's gonna hurt.

801
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,040
I'm sorry.

802
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,960
I'm so sorry.

803
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,360
Tell...tell people
that you liked me.

804
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
I will.

805
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,680
SASHA WHEEZES

806
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,880
Do you know what I wish?

807
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,080
I wish I'd done more.

808
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,000
You know, of everything.

809
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,600
Even the stupid stuff.

810
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:01,320
Like, every night that I went
home early cos I was a bit tired,

811
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,520
I just wish I'd stayed out
and danced and laughed

812
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,640
and lived.

813
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,320
Cos nights like that
won't come your way again.

814
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,560
Even Gethin.

815
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,720
I just wish I'd loved him more.

816
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,000
And kissed him more.

817
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,880
And held him more.

818
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,760
We talked about having a baby.
I just kept on putting it off.

819
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,640
Saying, you know, can't afford to
this year. We're going to Belize.

820
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,440
We're buying a new rug. A new car.

821
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,000
What does any of that matter now?

822
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,480
You got to promise me you won't
let those chances pass you by.

823
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,040
I promise.

824
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,720
Cos it all goes. It all falls away.

825
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,600
The looks.

826
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,400
Money.

827
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,360
Lovers, friends.

828
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,720
Not all your friends.

829
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,360
No.

830
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,960
Not all your friends.

831
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,160
And the ones that are there at the
end are the real ones, aren't they?

832
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,720
Yeah... Yeah.

833
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,480
Thank you...

834
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,520
for being my friend, Annie.

835
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,240
It's easy.

836
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,440
SHE SNIFFS

837
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,680
Live, Annie.

838
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,120
Seize the day.

839
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,840
I will.

840
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,960
How is she?
She's gone.

841
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,360
Sorry.

842
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,960
George.

843
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,640
SHE SIGHS

844
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,200
Would you like to have...

845
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,040
a little...

846
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,440
hairy baby with me?

847
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,800
Yes, I would.

848
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
HE CHUCKLES

849
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,880
Are you OK?

850
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,320
No.

851
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
No, I'm not.

852
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,280
Listen, I need to...

853
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,800
I need to tell you something.

854
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,000
I've done such things, Annie.

855
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,400
I've done such terrible...

856
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,920
..unforgivable things.

857
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,440
And I need to tell you.
No, you don't.

858
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,360
I need to do this.
No, you don't.

859
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,120
Mitchell, listen.

860
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,600
I know what you are.

861
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,760
I've known since day one.

862
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,960
But all those things you've done,
they're in your past, right?

863
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,880
It's who you are now that counts.

864
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,560
And...and what you've done for me,

865
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,520
..for George, for all of us...

866
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,360
..that's the man I know.

867
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,120
That's the man I trust.

868
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,840
And...

869
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,160
..that's the man I want.

870
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,520
Do you forgive me?

871
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,480
We need to know if the baby
will survive the transformation.

872
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,600
I've been such a bad girl.

873
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,760
You can't outrun me.
Definitely can't outfight me.

874
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,680
You can't even outlive me.

875
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,640
