Hi.

I finished your book.

10
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,639
I finished your book.

You don't have to sign.

12
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,476
I know you can read my lips,

13
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,936
but I am getting better.

14
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Better.

15
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,689
- I um... I want to practise.
- Cool.

16
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,235
Taking another class with John.

17
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,486
- John?
- It's fun!

18
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,908
I am way better at understanding it
than actually doing it, but...

19
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,786
So, what did you think?

20
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,954
What did I... What did I think?

21
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,249
- I loved it.
- Thank you.

22
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,332
I um...

23
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,461
I loved Riley.

24
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,963
I loved Erin.

25
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,465
- Thank you.
- They were great characters.

26
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,552
I tried to guess the ending.

27
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,225
I am usually on point with that
sort of thing, but I was way off!

28
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,768
How did you do that?
How do you...?

29
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,520
How do you come up with that?

30

Makes me crazy.

32
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,823
Any possible outcome
is like a movie in my head...

33
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,615
with many endings.

34
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,493
- A frustrating movie.

37
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,377
I have a voice in my mind.

38
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,966
Does the voice sound like a kid?

39

You were 13 when you got sick?

It sounds like my mom.

Thank you. I have to find her.

Can you?

196
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,574
You have seen it now, haven't you?

197
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,794
"Seriously, Maddie.

198
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,506
Maybe you could come back
and live with me."

It's not good for anyone to be so alone,

00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,559
I can come in any time I want.

00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,895
And I can get you any time I want.

203
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,689
But I'm not going to.

that's when I'll come inside.

Do you understand me?

208
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,457
Nod your head if you understand me.

209
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,214
Good.

210
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,010
Then we can have some fun.

- Drop it! Hands behind your head.

00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,208
- Take it easy. I'm a friend.
- Hands where I can see 'em.

00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,251
I don't want any trouble.
Just do what I say.

00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,796
My name is John Stanley.

283
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,630
- I said, "On your knees," sir.
- OK!

284
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,800
I'm a neighbour,
just looking for my girlfriend.

285
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,426
- Show me some ID.
- It's in my wallet, OK? Take it easy.

286
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,346
- Hands where I can see 'em.
- I'm just gonna go for my wallet.

287
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,557
I'm gonna put my phone down
and reach for my wallet. Take it easy.

00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,281
- You live next door?
- Yes, sir.

00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,408
OK.

290
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:25,911
OK.

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,166
I am sorry to scare you.

292
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,333
There has been a...

293
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,209
Phew!

294
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,921
Jesus! Um...

00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,757
- What the hell happened here?
- I don't know. Um...

296
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,258
I responded to a call.

297
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,302
I got here and found the place like this.
There was someone inside.

298
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,471
He came running past me
and knocked me cold.

299
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,599
I woke up without my phone,
my gun or my radio.

300
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,893
I need to call for backup.

301
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:51,311
- Do you know who lives here?
- Yeah, it's Maddie.

302
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,981
Maddie Young. She's a friend of ours.

303
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,065
Does she live alone?

304
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,901
Yeah. My girlfriend comes here
all the time. I thought maybe...

305
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:57,986
What is her name?

306
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:00,362
It's Sarah. Sarah Greene.

307
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:03,950
OK. Sarah. I'm sorry.
Can I use your phone to call for backup?

308
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,659
I should have called it in already,

309
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:08,121
but I just started this job,
and when I got here...

310
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:11,040
- Are you police?
- Deputy. Just barely, though.

311
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,753
I can call the Sheriff,
if I can just use your...?

312
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:18,965
Here you go.

313
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,257
Thanks.

314
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,101
Yeah, I got a 7-19 here at 811 Fairhope.

315
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,562
Signs of possible forced entry.
Suspect is at large on foot.

316
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,651
No one else here,
but a neighbour just showed up.

317
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,279
Yeah. OK.

318
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:44,573
See you soon.

319
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,493
Hey, did you see that?

320
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,875
Yeah, I did.

321
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,295
This girl, Maddie,
does she have a boyfriend?

322
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,631
No, I don't think so.

323
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,381
Hm.

324
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:06,221
Family nearby? Anybody else that could
possibly have access to the house?

325
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:09,431
No, she pretty much keeps to herself.

326
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,227
- Is your arm OK?
- Oh, yeah.

327
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:15,897
The guy just ploughed into me.
He hit me like a truck.

328
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,860
He must have been...
well, just about your size, actually.

329
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:22,028
You know, like a jock.

330
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,238
Linebacker type.

331
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:25,197
Scary guy.

332
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:28,201
Can I get that back?

333
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:30,829
The phone.

334
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,579
Oh!

335
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,705
[chuckles]

336
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,875
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

337
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:39,170
So stupid of me. Force of habit.

338
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:50,722
You said you responded to a call.
Was that from Maddie?

339
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,893
From the dispatcher... actually.

340
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,314
They said someone had called it in.
I just assumed it was the resident.

341
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:03,069
Yeah, because she wouldn't be able
to make that call. She's deaf and mute.

342
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,154
Huh.

343
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,871
Well, I guess it must have been

Pretty rough.

351
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,831
Has she always been unable to hear?

352
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,127
No, not always.

353
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,173
Since she was a teenager, I think.
Meningitis.

354
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:16,142
Still, to live alone like this...
she must be able to get by.

I can't swear to it, but...

356
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,941
...I'm pretty sure she has a spare key
in that planter on the porch down there.

Yeah, it's right down there,
on that corner.

So, who do you think it was?

362
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,915
Like, a burglar?

363
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:42,751
- I hope it wasn't something worse.
- I am sure they are fine.

364
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,380
If they called it in,
they probably got the hell out of here.

[intruder] Oh, yeah. Look at that. Jeez!

So, how long do you think it will take
for the cavalry to arrive?

368
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:58,892
About ten. Fifteen, maybe.

Really?

370
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:04,815
I'm glad you happened across me. I could
have been out here all night, bleeding.
