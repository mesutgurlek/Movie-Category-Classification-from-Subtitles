And the virgins of the different
towns would stomp the grapes

Wait a second, OK?

321
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,270
It's OK.

322
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:28,586
- I was thinking about the
energy of the universe.
- What?

323
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,790
The energy and how it brings
people together, and there's
really no such thing

324
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,792
as a coincidence.

325
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:40,564
And my corporation,
my law firm, we just
oversaw a corporate merger...

326
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,366
What? Sorry?

327
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:45,703
The merger, it's like a company
that we did the deal for,

328
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,772
they bought a modeling agency
in Los Angeles.

329
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,109
So now, randomly I have all
these contacts,

330
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,111
with these modeling agents.

331
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,480
Pollo, told you to say that?

332
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,051
No... It's coincidence.

333
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,655
The business is full of idiots
that think just because I'm
Russian I'm starving.

334
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:08,525
Last year, I made a hundred
and fifty grand.
How about you?

335
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,964
You think it's too late
for me to become a model?

336
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,300
Well, maybe you lose ten pounds

337
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,404
and don't put so much
gel in your hair.

338
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,905
Maybe you have a chance.

339
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,544
You think maybe I have a chance?

340
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,217

You left me all alone!

How's that helping Team Gringo?

Come on Gringo, there's a

Hey look, look, look.
The cleaning lady isn't
dancing with anyone.

367
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:06,129
Oh maybe I'll tell her
my father owns half the country,
that seems to work.

368
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,666
OK Gringo, if you wanna get
fucked, then call your Ex.

Nobody likes you here.

Unlike you who
everybody likes,

371
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:15,439
clearly it has nothing to do
with your Father's money.

Look Gringo,
I am not your buddy, OK?

That's Ariel. So we don't need
to pretend we like each other.

Monica, you should
take her home.

And you want to ruin it for me.

You want me to be as
miserable as you.

That's not going to happen.

I'm sorry if you're incapable of
having fun without drugs.

- That's not my problem.
- So, what is your problem?

402
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,655
Because you never gave a
shit about me until Daddy
started paying you to.

00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,025
So go back to India,

were in the bathroom,

off to India to find herself?
