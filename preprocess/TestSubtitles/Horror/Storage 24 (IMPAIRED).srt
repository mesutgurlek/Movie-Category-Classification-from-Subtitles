316
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,990
We're Iooking for the guy who works
here. Thought you might have seen him.

317
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,798
No.

318
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,312
Where's... Where's Nikki and prick-face?

319
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,196
They've gone to get a snack.

320
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,590
Oh, there's the Iamp
from when the time that...

321
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,432
(SHELLEY) Mm-hm.

322
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,752
Yeah.

323
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,670
Hm? What?

324
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,149
Hm. Just...

325
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,230
Charlie wants you
to go and Ieave us alone

326
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,433
so that we can talk about the
relationship that we don't have. Again.

327
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,950
No, I didn't say that. That's not
what I meant. I didn't say that.

328
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,594
But, Shelley,
if you wanna discuss it, we can...

329
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,234
Look I'II...
I'II Ieave you guys to it, yeah?

330
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,992
No. Mark, stay.

331
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,869
Charlie, it's over. Accept it, move on.
I can't keep having this conversation.

332
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,548
Just tell me what I did wrong.
Give me something.

333
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,278
(SHELLEY) Nothing.

334
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,755
Nothing. I just...

335
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,273
I just don't Iove you anymore.

336
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,075
I don't know how to
make it clearer to you.

337
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:41,512
You don't excite me.
You don't make me happy.

338
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,116
You don't make me anything.

339
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,072
Why won't you accept it?

340
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,236
- (CHARLIE) Shelley, Iet's just...
- Charlie, Charlie, Ieave her. AII right?

341
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,431
Let her calm down.

342
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,435
- Jeez.
- Look, I'II go talk to her. Yeah?

343
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,993
Yeah, thanks, man.

344
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,236

You all right?

347
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,759
I can't take it anymore, Mark.
He's getting on my Iast nerve.

348
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,349
- He's upset.
- Yeah, well, he's not going on

349
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,953
at anyone else all the time.

350
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,948
Why do I have to deal with this Iike
I'm the only one who's done anything?

351
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,720
- You don't.
- Really?

352
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,316
- Mark.
- Come here, get in.

353
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,151
Mark, stop.

354
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,075
When are you gonna
tell Charlie about us?

355
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,035
Not yet.
It'd kill him now if he found out.

356
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,191
You're gonna have to
tell him eventually.

357
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,952
I know.

358
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,350
Are you sure about us?

359
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,591
- You should go back to him.
- In a minute.

360
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,431
Not here.

361

(CHARLIE) We're Iocked in.

363
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,792
I went down to find the guard
or receptionist, but I couldn't find him.

364
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,353
(NIKKI) Where is everyone?

Where is everybody?

367
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,671
I told Shelley how I felt about her

368
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,196
so she had to get as far away
as humanly possible from me.

369
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,995
- And Mark's gone after her.
- Right.

370
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,830
- And Chris, has he come back yet?
- Do I Iook Iike I give a fuck?

371
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,759
Why do you have to
be such a dick, Charlie?

Shut up, I'm not talking to you.

How Iong has it been going on?

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,915
When we were together? Since we
split up? I wanna know. Just tell me.

one of your work trips to Brighton,

395
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,149
you were going to see him?
