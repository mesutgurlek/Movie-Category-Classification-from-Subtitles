1
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,358
It is all gone!

2
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,596
Well, how can it possibly
be fucking gone?

3
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,948
There was 40 grand in there.

4
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,355
Yeah, eight months ago
there was 40 grand in there.

5
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,711
Eight months! How many
fucking scatter cushions do you need?

6
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,229
(Woman) Don't talk to me like I'm a cunt!

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,111
Baby? Are you all right?

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,037
It doesn't make sense.

9
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,109
I know!

10
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,630
You haven't worked
a single day for eight months.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,868
Take the money for the Jacuzzi
out of the holiday dough.

12
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,835
I can't have it out of action
cos it's for my back.

13
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,188
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,675
Wake up, Jay!
There's no fucking holiday money!

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,677
And there is nothing wrong
with your back!

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,870
It's all in your fucking head.

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,919
(Motor sputters)

18
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,429
Fuck. Fucking...

19
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,599
Jay!

20
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,434
Ouch!

21
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,269
Jay!

22
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,835
Jay!

23
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,914
Oh!

24
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,158
Jay!

25
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,039
- 24 tins of tuna?
- Yeah, they were doing a deal.

26
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,674
Can you stop spinning?
You're doing my head in.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,310
- You should've done me a list then.
- I did! It was on the fridge, you left it!

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,318
- 10 bottles of wine?
- You invited 'em.

29
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,351
What do you want to drink, Shel?
Herbal tea?

30
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,199
Oh, look, it says toilet roll
and it's underlined twice.

31
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,029
Oh, 197 pounds. And, no, you didn't
get any toilet roll, did you,

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,718
just, you know, loads of bottles of wine.

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,956
- That's good, Jay.
- I'll pop round the newsagents.

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,638
They'll have it, won't they?

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,596
(Sighs) You're in serious danger
of turning into a miserable cow, Shel.

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,110
I'm not going to sit here and have you
glaring at me for another half hour.

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,435
Sam? Sammy?

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,152
Babe, he's got loads of stuff.

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,919
- He doesn't need any more.
- It was four and a half quid, you wally.

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,995
He's got loads.

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,633
- En guard!
- Cool.

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,558
Daddy's promised
to do bedtime stories tonight.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,309
Yeah, we can do that, mate.

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,750
(Agitated talking in Swedish)

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,913
(Shel sobs and continues
talking in Swedish)

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,828
(Intermittent sobbing and talking)

47
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,073
(Swedish conversation continues)

48
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,636
(Groans, shouts)

49
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,070
Get him! Come on, Sam!

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,429
(Jay) 'There were once
these two brave and honorable soldiers,

51
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,438
'and they were in charge
of guarding a man in a car.'

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,630
(Sam) I want a story about king Arthur.

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,593
(Jay) My story is better.
(Sam) No, it isn't.

54
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,119
Are you listening, cos you can go
straight to sleep without one?

55
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,719
What kind of car?

56
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,759
A bullet-proof one.

57
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,471
They were driving around this city,
you see.

58
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,595
What city?

59
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,957
Bagdadistan.

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,354
So there were these insurgents
and they made a bomb

61
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,994
and it blew up the Humvee
in front of the column.

62
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,678
It's not real though, is it?

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,597
No, not any more, no.

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,917
You shouldn't shout at Mummy.

65
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,471
Well, she started it, mate.

66
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,231
You are a bit lazy though.

67
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,311
- Who says?
- Mummy.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,237
Does she now?

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,115
And me.

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,519
Do it, Daddy.

71
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,679
OK.

72
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,916
One, two, three...

73
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,950
Abracadabra.

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,152
Hi, how're you doing?

75
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,590
You're looking gorgeous as usual...
Ahh... please God

76
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,711
It's so good to see you. Hi.

77
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,989
- Fiona.
- Come on in.

78
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,678
- You?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,592
Canny wee tipple... your favourite?

80
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,479
(Fiona) Is that you?

81
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,558
Mmm! Swedish National service.

82
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,159
I didn't know they made girls do that!

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,157
Oh, they don't!
They don't, I wanted to do it.

84
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,236
Why should the boys
get to have all the fun, eh?

85
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,038
(Fiona) Here you both are...

86
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,191
- What uniform is that?
- Security assignment.

87
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,548
Is it dangerous?

88
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,830
In danger of getting your knickers
ripped off later, big girl.

89
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,393
(Chuckles)

90
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,278
The money's good.

91
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,876
The money's really good, Jay.

92
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,469
I can't.

93
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,439
Here.

94
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,359
Try one of these.
Blow your fucking head off.

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,277
I'm not eating anything red
at the moment.

96
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,395
- Does Shel know?
- What, about the diet?

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,999
No, about the job.

98
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,190
Might have mentioned something
in passing.

99
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,793
No wonder she's been
on my fucking back. Don't do that, Gal.

100
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,514
I wish someone would fucking clarify
the chain of command here.

101
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,949
- Who's wagging the dog?
- (Shel) Jay! Jay!

102
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,319
Coming.

103
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,079
That's cleared that up.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,718
Fuck off.

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,748
We are done. Bon Appétit.
Tuck in, everyone.

106
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,199
(Gal claps) Well done.
(Fiona) Thank you.

107
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,196
Aww!

108
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,595
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you. It's not my worst.

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,029
- Army and Navy.
- Gravy?

110
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,912
(Gal) Your track record's good.

111
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,075
Dig in.

112
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,076
(Shel) And now... Cheers and welcome.
(Gal) Yeah, cheers. Here's to you.

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,279
- Lots of love.
- Cheers.

114
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,469
Thank you, thank you...

115
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,318
(Shel) Is there anything here
that you want, Fiona?

116
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,555
(Fiona) I'm really happy.
(Shel) You sure?

117
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,557
(Jay) What are these
little chef's hats about?

118
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,636
(Shel) I just thought...
you could pick them up with your fingers.

119
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,194
They're little Swedish chefs.

120
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,788
(Imitates The Muppets' chef)

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,797
Who is gonna say Grace,
are you going to say Grace?

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,433
Oh, Stop.

123
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,437
- Not at my table.
- No?

124
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,278
No, no.

125
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,913
I could do it in Irish for you.

126
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,837
So what-what sort of...

127
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,349
Do you just sell anything? I don't...

128
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,551
No, it's kind of...

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,559
No, it's mainly...
sort of IT stuff and, you know.

130
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,439
It's commercial sales.

131
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,994
It's not like knocking on doors
and, you know.

132
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,429
- With a suitcase.
- Yeah, it's not flannels and tea towels.

133
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,755
(Laughter)

134
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,713
I know you would assume that
from Gal's accent, but...

135
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,434
It was all right, kinda,
when I was younger and stuff

136
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,790
and when we first
come out of the army.

137
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,959
But it's not, you know...
As Sam is getting older and stuff.

138
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,638
It's sort of difficult for him.

139
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,990
He wants his dad, you know.

140
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,156
So, you have to deal with that
while I am away, don't you?

141
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,872
I think it's hard on us.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,434
Three months starts pushing it
we used to say.

143
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,677
- (Fiona) Three months?
- Sometimes, yeah.

144
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,109
- (Fiona) Wow.
- Bit like being a single mum.

145
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,950
- Can I just nip to the loo please?
- Mmm, course.

146
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,275
- It's just round the corner.
- OK, thanks.

147
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,039
(Jay) The lock's not great,
but we know you are in there,

148
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,197
so I don't think Sam will get
the shock of his life.

149
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,633
- Top up?
- Oh, yeah.

150
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,115
- I'll get it. I'll get it sit down, sit down.
- Sure?

151
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,276
- Old world, new world?
- Whatever you fancy, darling.

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,118
Whatever, mate.

153
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,552
Christ. You need a circular saw
to get through this meat.

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,278
Because you took the entire rack.

155
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,755
- I thought...
- I'd cut them all up, hadn't I?

156
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,598
I thought there was three big ones.

157
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,917
You could've said to me, darling.

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,519
Do you know what, unlike you,

159
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,631
I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of everyone.

160
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,955
As for this, what's all this game?

161
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,991
We've got every dinner set
and bit of cutlery known to man.

162
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
You've served the gravy
in a fucking Pyrex.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,434
What's that about?
It's like a chemistry set.

164
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,191
(Gal's footsteps return)

165
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,230
(Gal) Is that all right?
(Shel) Yeah, that's my favourite.

166
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,679
So, what do you do, Fiona?

167
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,193
Human resources.

168
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,829
Hatchet man.

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,229
Sorry. Hatchet person.

170
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,477
What is it?
I mean what does that entail?

171
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,034
If there is a department
that is under-performing then...

172
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,789
I go in and assess
the extraneous manpower

173
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,275
and de-force accordingly...
I'm waiting for a comment!

174
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,719
(Laughter)

175
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,752
(Fiona) I know there is one coming.
(Jay) You sort of sack people?

176
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,629
It's not personal.

177
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,830
It is probably personal to them...

178
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,239
...and their families.

179
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,999
When was the last time you cared
about the welfare of a family?

180
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,395
Oh, yeah I know, eight months ago.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,471
There's a bigger picture
in the business world.

182
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,476
Your picture doesn't stretch any further
than your front door, does it mate?

183
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,919
You mean the Jacuzzi.

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,591
I think the 80's recession
was a lot more glamorous.

185
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,872
No this is, this is much worse.
There's a lot of dirty work to be done.

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,276
I'll tell you one lot
who had no time for extraneous.

187
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,515
The Nazis.

188
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,789
Here we go.

189
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,070
I just wish
I could have had a go at them.

190
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,509
Difficult for a man to know
where he stands these days.

191
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,790
You should've had a crack
at the Mick, mate.

192
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,753
A tour of duty in Belfast
would've done you the world of good.

193
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,235
I've never understood
the whole Irish thing.

194
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,557
Cos, I mean,
it's all the same religion, so...

195
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,159
Not really, love.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,989
They're all Christian.

197
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,513
- That's true.
- That's debatable.

198
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,471
What do I get? Fucking Iraq!

199
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,916
- Iraq's over. What about now, eh?
- Yeah?

200
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,192
I've finished.

201
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,832
Abracadabra!

202
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,514
(Jay, shouting) That's my fucking pal,
in front of my fucking pal.

203
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,756
(Shel) That's not just your fucking pal.
It's not just your fucking pal.

204
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,199
It's not just your fucking house, Jay!

205
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,871
(Gal) Come on, mate,
let's get you to bed.

206
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,072
(Shouting continues)

207
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,078
Don't you pay any attention to them,
they're just over excited.

208
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,235
Why?

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,316
Because they've been drinking,
all right?

210
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,158
Don't you ever drink, do you hear me?

211
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,793
- Promise?
- Not even water?

212
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,239
Especially not that shit.

213
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,432
Do you know the government
puts stuff in it that shrinks your balls!

214
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,753
But you fall out with people, don't you?

215
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,440
You fall out with your mates, but then
you become friends again, don't you?

216
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,873
That's just what mummys
and daddys do sometimes.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,595
That's why they're mummys and daddys
because they're best friends, you know?

218
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,280
Sometimes they fight,
sometimes the argue.

219
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,753
You know...

220
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,235
But it doesn't mean anything.

221
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,998
So, don't be worrying, all right?

222
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,833
Good lad.

223
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,198
Sorry.

224
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,799
(Fiona) No. Don't be silly.

225
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,198
How old's your boy?

226
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,756
- Sammy is seven.
- Oh.

227
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,029
You?

228
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,752
No. I never wanted any.

229
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,073
You'll change your mind.

230
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,796
No, I don't think so.

231
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,114
I love kids though...

232
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,273
He was the one, you know?

233
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,672
The love of your life?

234
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,279
No. The one who started it.

235
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,039
Knock. Knock.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,879
Where?

237
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,598
Local, UK.

238
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,153
How many on the list?

239
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,632
Three. Not too strenuous.

240
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,879
How much?

241
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,956
Don't ask. Shel got it.

242
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,109
It's nice.

243
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,832
What do you think of Fiona?

244
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,837
Is she the one
you met at your sister's?

245
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,678
No, Boxercise.

246
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,358
What?

247
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,438
Hey man, I tell you, a lot of fit women.

248
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,630
It relieves your sexual tension as well.

249
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,591
Fuck's sake.

250
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,676
Hey, don't knock it till you've tried, you.

251
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,915
She likes it rough then?

252
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,157
- Wouldn't you like to fucking know?
- I'm too old for that shit, so are you.

253
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,911
Yeah? Speak for yourself, granddad.

254
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,315
- Kiev was...
- Yeah, yeah... I know.

255
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,552
Listen man,
that was eight months ago.

256
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,275
You've got to get back on the horse again.
Do you know what I mean?

257
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,436
It's all right, it's all right.

258
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,440
The old team back together again.
The two musketeers!

259
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,039
We gonna do it?

260
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,356
Fucking get rid of that.

261
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,630
(Gal, whispering) Come on sweetheart.
Come on.

262
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,116
Are you OK? All right?

263
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,433
(Gal) 'They'll never find that body.'

264
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,235
(Jay laughing) 'You could put
almost anything in front of it.'

265
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,077
It doesn't matter how disgusting it is

266
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,988
as long as you put that after it,
you're safe...

267
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,798
Fritzl could have got away with it.

268
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,314
It's OK, cos I don't have my gloves on.

269
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,030
Who'd have thunk it?

270

It's an offering, not an insult.

319
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,992
No. She's taking the piss.

320
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,791
It's a cat, it can't take the piss.

321
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,197
What is it?

322
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,117
Oh no, Jay!

323
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,789
It's a rabbit.

324
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,433
Put it in the outside bin.

325
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,393
Fuck am I. I'll cook it up
with some onion and garlic.

326
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,317
Not in my kitchen!

327
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,919
Oh, yeah.

328
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,278
Oh, just get rid of it, babe.

329
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,232
Smell of that.

330
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,678
What's Daddy doing?

331
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,638
Daddy's showing off.

332
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,833
What's he eating?

333
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,198
He's eating a rabbit.

334
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,758
Where from?

335
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,677
From the cat.

336
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,952
Daddy thinks the cat brings us
little presents.

337
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,548
The cat thinks we don't eat enough
in this house.

338
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,194
I just think the cat
likes killing rabbits.

339
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,388
(Bell tolls)

340
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,438
- Hey!
- (Gal) Who goes there?

341
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,709
(Laughs)

342
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,478
You all right?

343
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,552
- It was a good one last night, weren't it?
- Eh?

344
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,113
A good one last night.

345
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,878
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

346
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,435
- Nice food and all that.
- It had its moments.

347
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,633
Where's Fiona? Off de-forcing?

348
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,072
Fuck knows.

349
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,599
What?

350
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,835
I think I was
a bit of a bad boy last night.

351
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,956
I woke up this morning
with a 'Dear John' taped to my cock.

352
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,832
You're joking.

353
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,439
No.

354
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,439
Oh, mate.

355
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,839
Get your shit together,
the client's expecting us.

356
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,318
I like this car.

357
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,192
Looks nice but it's a dog on corners.

358
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,799
Here - better safe than sorry.

359
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,717
It's a bit over the top for a meeting, innit?

360
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,193
Do you know who's in there?

361
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,799
Cos I fucking don't.

362
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,952
You come with recommendations.

363
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,318
They're well earned.

364
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,475
Good.

365
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,194
Necessary.

366
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,435
Ah, fuck!

367
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,679
It's all right.

368
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,878
No, it's not.

369
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,991
I hear Kiev was stormy.

370
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,270
I'm in the process of rewriting it.

371
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,229
Good.

372
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,834
It's important to learn
from one's mistakes, I always find.

373
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,119
Fuck, that was dramatic.

374
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,196
I'm bleeding on the carpet.

375
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,916
None of them ever say please or thank
you - that's what really fucks me off.

376
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,429
I mean, good manners cost nothing,
sure it doesn't.

377
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,075
How did he know about Kiev?

378
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,236
He was just letting you know
that he knows.

379
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,833
- What does that mean?
- Psychology, isn't it.

380
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,558
(Groans)

381
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,268
Fucking hell.
Is that your wanking hand?

382
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,994
- No.
- Hmm. Well, you know...

383
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,509
...every cloud...

384
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,669
- One of each?
- Take 'em yeah.

385
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,995
They say that's quite good.

386
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,509
I need to stop
and get a bandage or something.

387
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,870
Got to get through reception
without them noticing.

388
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,956
It's fucking swollen.

389
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,479
I'll walk on that side.

390
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,158
You stay on the left
and I'll walk on the right.

391
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,759
OK.

392
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,670
I could do with clearing up the sink
a little bit.

393
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,472
- Leave that to me, I'll do it.
- OK.

394
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,352
(Distant conversation)

395
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,069
Did you take one of those
this morning, babe?

396
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,431
Yeah, that's all right,
it's like six a day or something.

397
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,519
Handsome.

398
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,599
You going to be all right?

399
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,157
(Monkey whooping)

400
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,872
See you soon.

401
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,831
Back in the house - you'll get wet feet.

402
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,439
(Whispers) Go.

403
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,719
Bye.

404
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,799
I love this bit.

405
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,190
We're not going
to the fucking seaside, Gal.

406
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,319
Thank you.

407
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,271
Can you put your PIN in there, please?

408
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,789
Here on business?

409
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,797
- Crackers.
- Excuse me?

410
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,639
Novelty key rings. Paper hats.

411
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,876
Plastic fingernails. Doggy charms.

412
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,592
- They're my specialty.
- Sorry?

413
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,676
You wouldn't be, love, honestly.

414
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,998
You don't look like sales.

415
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,190
- Have the rooms got free Wi-Fi?
- No.

416
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,476
I'm afraid that card's been declined.
Let me just try that one more time.

417
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,113
Yeah, do.

418
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,715
I'll just ring for authorization.

419
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,434
It's OK I'll get it.
Don't worry about it - I'll get it.

420
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,428
Hello, Shel?

421
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,869
Yeah, they just declined my card
at the hotel.

422
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,869
Yeah, they declined it.
No, there's no money in it.

423
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,151
One I look like a right mug,
and two it draws attention to me and Gal.

424
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,840
Straight away - who are these people
who can't afford to pay for the room.

425
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,474
- My name is Richard.
- (Receptionist) Nice to meet you.

426
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,079
Friends call me Dick.

427
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,794
(Jay) I can't believe
you haven't had ten minutes to do it.

428
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,797
You could have done it on your phone.

429
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,671
The soap's nice.

430
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,950
- Is it still in the wrapper?
- Yeah.

431
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,989
Nice. I fucking hate dirty soap.

432
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,952
So, what do you reckon?

433
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,479
Do the usual,
follow this guy around:

434
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,511
See what he gets up,
who he hangs out with?

435
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,073
What, do it properly, you mean?

436
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,115
Not just mow him down in a hail of bullets
like some Hackney crack head.

437
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,389
Yeah.

438
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,353
Yeah.

439
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,118
(Laughing)

440
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,319
He's 45 and lives
in 14 Coldwater Road.

441
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,516
If he's got a dog,
do we shoot the dog too?

442
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,119
Yeah, well...

443
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,515
Dogs are ten a penny,
aren't they?

444
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,878
I just wanted to say 'thank you'
to Justin.

445
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,310
His teachings have helped me put
everything in perspective.

446
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,079
I haven't had an anxiety attack
in three weeks.

447
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,235
Don't listen to them.

448
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,238
It's like a fucking worm
boring through my skull.

449
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,353
It's like a graveyard and they still
fucking plod up next to us.

450
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,232
(Justin)... you could intersect
with the group

451
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,670
when I saw you having trouble
rationalizing your emotional response

452
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,313
to Duncan's departure.

453
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,078
I can't wait to see him rationalize
your emotional response.

454
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,077
- Don't.
- (Chuckles)

455
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,191
- I'm gonna kill 'em, Gal.
- Don't kill 'em, mate.

456
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,629
I am, I'm gonna massacre
that table of people now.

457
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,397
In a hotel.

458
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,748
I ain't gonna shoot 'em, Gal.

459
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,269
I'm going to do 'em one at a time
and do 'em slow.

460
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,118
- With a butter knife?
- Yeah.

461
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,073
(Group member) We should have a song.
We should have a song.

462
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,830
- A song... OK, shall I get the old guitar?
- Yeah, go on then.

463
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,678
Oh fuck, here we go.

464
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,554
You're expecting Jeremy Beadle,
aren't you?

465
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,036
- But he's dead, he can't help you!
- He's not going to play that guitar, is he?

466
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,832

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,756
Not as hard as a dinner plate.

479
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,233
(Chuckles)

480
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,239
God loves you.

481
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,474
Does he?
Well, tell God from me...

482
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,479
If you're the kind of people he hangs
about with, stay out of my way.

483
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,557
No more guitar mate,
not in restaurants.

484
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,432
There is a time and a place.

485
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,519
And your time and place
is in a very isolated location

486
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,155
where no one is likely to be
for about a fucking hundred years.

487
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,508
OK?

488
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,754
Cos Jimmy Hendrix you ain't.

489
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,632
(Guitar smashes onto floor)

490
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,309
Very sorry about my friend,
please accept my most humble apologies.

491
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,079
And if you are speaking to the big man,
put a word in for us, will you?

492
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,428
Get them all a drink, love.

493
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,869
Double orange juices all round.

494
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,998
It don't look like
the house of a major villain, does it?

495
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,031
Oh, for fuck's sake,
a fucking priest! Brilliant!

496
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,957
You'll enjoy this one, Gal.

497
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,118
Yeah well, at least it's not a toddler.

498
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,912
What's he got there?

499
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,831
Oh, a new brief case.

500
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,799
You're worried.

501
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,319
Maybe.

502
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,118
He's probably shagging kids.

503
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,789
Might get you a pass
on all the other terrible shit you've done.

504
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,717
It's complicated.

505
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,834
As a parent I'd do them all,
even if I weren't getting paid.

506
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,554
Just for the record,
I've hardly done any terrible shit.

507
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,391
(Music plays over dialogue)

508
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,558
Turn round.

509
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,398
Thank you.

510
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,236
Why do you think he had that smile
on his face?

511
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,078
Probably at peace, you know.

512
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,319
Don't know how much at peace I'd feel

513
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,032
if I was getting a bullet
in the back of my head.

514
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,916
(Jay) 'Can you see me, yeah? '

515
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,071
(Shel on speaker)
'Yeah, sorry I just woke up.'

516
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,599
- 'Sorry.'
- 'No, it's fine.'

517
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,438
'It's just... Sam was up in the night.'

518
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,516
- 'Is he all right? '
- 'Oh yeah, he's fine.

519
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,631
'Bad dreams about the cat.

520
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,591
'How's your room?
I couldn't tell when I booked.'

521
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,073
Yeah, it's all right.

522
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,036
- 'On schedule? '
- One down.

523
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,276
- 'Clean? '
- Yeah, course.

524
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,356
Don't worry, I'm all right.

525
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,277
'Babe, Fiona came round.

526
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,112
'With a present for Sam.'

527
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,071
That's a bit weird.

528
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,475
'I didn't like her at first,
but I don't mind her now.

529
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,318
'What do you think? '

530
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,273
- You could do with the company.
- 'Yeah, that's what I thought.'

531
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,519
- Don't let her anywhere near the garage.
- 'I'm not an idiot.

532
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,359
'I've got to go - Sam's calling, all right? '

533
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,791
- Do you miss me?
- 'Of course I do'.

534
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,751
'AIways'.

535
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,552
'Love you.'

536
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,236
(Distant thunder)

537
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,355
(Gal) Looks like nothing this bloke.
(Jay) They all look like nothing, Gal.

538
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,471
He does look
like my uncle Terry though.

539
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,068
Uncle Terry, that's a new one.

540
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,189
(Laughs)

541
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,311
He wasn't a special uncle,
he actually was my uncle.

542
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,590
- Right.
- Yeah, he was a cunt.

543
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,076
He wasn't one of the people
your old man took money off of

544
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,553
to be your special uncle?

545
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,958
Oh, come on now. It's a family do.

546
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,637
Have you spoken to Fiona?

547
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,919
No.

548
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,318
She's been round at the house,
talking to Shel.

549
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,318
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah...

550
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,479
Says she's waiting.

551
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,079
What, for me?

552
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,950
Well yeah, I'd imagine so.

553
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,034
I'll leave her dangling a bit longer.

554
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,957
Do you know what I mean,
keep 'em keen, eh?

555
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,719
Gal, give her a ring.
I don't want some...

556
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,311
...glary eyed phantom kipping
in my front room when I get home.

557
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,749
Don't you dare
talk about my Fiona like that.

558
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,871
She's a good looking girl.

559
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,229
She's a bit of a fucking demon in bed
as well, I tell you.

560
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,998
- Yeah?
- Oh!

561
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,599
Fucking hell!

562
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,475
- Details?
- You know...

563
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,309
Put it this way, I had to shave
my pubes afterwards.

564
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,239
Gal?

565
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,078
What, are we off?

566
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,034
Right, we'll go and see
what is in that lock-up first.

567
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,349
Really?

568
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,436
I thought we were
just going to observe?

569
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,193
No, we are going to go
and have a look, mate.

570
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,477
Lovely... it's a wank den.

571
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,917
You don't get shot
for having a wank den.

572
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,879
Porn business?

573
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,797
There's not enough of it.

574
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,479
No, you're right.

575
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,189
(Scream on TV)

576
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,833
Fuck.

577
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,757
- Uh.
- What?

578
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,074
You don't want to fucking look
at that boy, I'll tell you.

579
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,191
Well, I've got to now, haven't I?

580
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,478
Fucking hell, mate.

581
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
(Screaming and wailing from TV)

582
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,190
(Screams) Help. Help!

583
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,239
(Glass breaks)

584
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,431
There's been a mistake.

585
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,959
Oh, yeah?

586
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,150
Mistaken identity.

587
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,034
Just remembered we're your burglars?

588
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,434
Really?

589
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,710
If you are, take what you want.

590
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,158
(Gal) I could do with some reassurance

591
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,272
that the world's
not full of murdering perverts.

592
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,753
We saw the lock-up.

593
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,918
- Christ.
- (Gal) Yeah.

594
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,590
(Gal) It's game on, big lad.

595
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,234
Yeah, don't bother. Fucking freak!

596
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,519
(Gal) Listen mate...

597
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,477
I've seen your wee film.

598
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,112
I'm just the librarian.

599
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,597
Who for?

600
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,192
This is not fair.

601
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,958
I'll show you 'not fair'.

602
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,359
Please.

603
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,109
Don't - because it makes me
hate you more, yeah?

604
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,719
Who films it?

605
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,070
I can't tell you that.

606
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,078
(Screams)

607
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,037
(Screams)

608
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,391
(Cries out)
He lives at Greenwold Street.

609
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,670
15 Greenwold Street.

610
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,312
Where do you keep your money?

611
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,794
- In the safe.
- Which room?

612
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,708
Top of the stairs on the right.

613
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,793
Does he know?

614
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,229
What?

615
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,396
Who you are.

616
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,558
He doesn't, does he?

617
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,229
What the fuck are you talking about?

618
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,671
Before he comes back...

619
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,277
...I just want to say...

620
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,839
...thank you.

621
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,439
For what?

622
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,950
(Whispers) I'm glad to have met you.

623
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,839
Nice.

624
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,159
I understand.

625
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,428
You have to do
what you have to do.

626
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,997
(Screams)

627
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,157
(Screaming continues)

628
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,799
Thank you.

629
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,919
Thank you.

630
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,831
You crazy fucking bastard.

631
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,159
Oh, fuck!

632
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,479
You can clean this fucking mess up
yourself, you know that?

633
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,079
Fine.

634
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,757
I'm getting a fucking bag.

635
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,711
(Jay) Let's nip round to that house
on Greenwold Street.

636
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,478
(Gal) Fuck that, you need
a long lie down, big lad.

637
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,716
I'm going to Greenwold Street
right fucking now.

638
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,752
- What the fuck is Shel gonna say?
- Then don't fucking tell her then.

639
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,359
Fuck!

640
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,277
You're well off list here, man.

641
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,911
Right! Don't hang about.

642
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,191
If I'm not back in twenty minutes,
come and get me.

643
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,311
Don't you worry, I will.

644
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,157
Fucking first job in months
and he's gone off again, for fuck's sake.

645
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,910
(Shrill whistling)

646
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,990
Oh, for fuck's sake.

647
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,270
Jesus Christ.

648
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,557
(Whistling stops)

649
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,837
(Banging)

650
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,756
Was that twenty minutes?

651
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,677
Let's get the fuck out of here.

652
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,236
What the fuck are we going to do
with him now?

653
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,593
Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.

654
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,158
(Gal) You're covered in blood.

655
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,359
(Jay) I'll burn 'em.

656
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,471
They say the sign of a good painter
and decorator?

657
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,278
- What?
- Clean overalls. No bodging.

658
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,279
Point taken.

659
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,637
(Jay) It doesn't feel wrong.

660
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,271
They were bad people.

661
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,758
They should suffer.

662
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,238
I used to love looking at fires
when I was a kid.

663
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,194
Hi babe, I wasn't expecting you back...

664
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,394
- We haven't got any food.
- That's all right we'll go out.

665
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,919
Erm, it's a school night.

666
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,439
I just want to see Sammy, yeah?

667
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,836
No, he's on a play date, babe.
Can we talk about this later?

668
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,957
Hi Jay, you back?

669
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,752
(Shel) We've just had a glass of wine.

670
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,154
Yeah, and a moan.

671
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,839
- Do you want to join us?
- Er...

672
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,520
Yeah... I should get me...
all my bits and bobs.

673
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,792
- I should go.
- Oh no, don't be silly. You were here first.

674
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,070
No, stay. It's all right isn't it?

675
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,359
Yeah.

676
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,999
Shel!

677
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,991
Jesus, Jay!

678
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,799
(Shel) Oh, God!

679
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,070
It's infected, babe.
You've got to go see a doctor.

680
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,679
I'm not going.

681
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,879
No...

682
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,790
I'll get some cream or something.

683
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,989
(Doctor) 'Would you say
you were suffering from stress? '

684
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,872
(Jay) 'Yes.'

685
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,595
'Do you experience fatigue? Nausea? '

686
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,188
Erm... Yes. No.

687
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,032
Why do you think that is?

688
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,957
Any particular reason?

689
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,079
No.

690
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,997
Professionally...

691
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,111
Some financial stuff.

692
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,358
I've got a family.

693
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,791
Now what about your sex life,
how's that?

694
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,319
Normal?

695
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,273
Listen, my wife said I had to come,
so you could look at my hand and...

696
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,594
You're fine!

697
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,397
Yeah, but my hand isn't.
Do you want to have a look at it?

698
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,318
Better still, I can give you some advice.

699
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,510
What happened to Dr Bapkin?

700
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,994
The past is gone.

701
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,835
The future

702
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,757
is not yet here.

703
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,989
There is only ever this moment.

704
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,549
(Shel's voice echoes) 'Jay!

705
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,559
'Jay!

706
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,909
'Jay! '

707
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,559
Bloody...

708
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,597
Kids maybe?

709
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,759
Maybe gypsies.

710
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,999
You all right, sweetheart?

711
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,917
Someone's murdered the cat.

712
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,950
(Jay) Fucking loved that cat.

713
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,119
Didn't know.

714
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,030
No, neither did I till it happened.

715
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,559
- Look...
- What?

716
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,471
- It's a message, isn't it?
- Yeah, received loud and clear.

717
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,996
We lifted enough money the other night,
we could sack half this job off, man.

718
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,599
What?

719
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,960
There's pictures of us
outside the priest's house, Jay.

720
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,230
They've got a file on fucking Kiev.

721
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,193
- Where the fuck did they get that from?
- So fucking what?

722
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,390
Listen man,
let's just knock it on the head.

723
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,034
It's not doing your head any good and it's
fucking not doing mine any good either.

724
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,071
Yeah, I think you are right,
we should just give up.

725
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,794
We should let things like this happen
and not do fuck all about it.

726
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,957
We're doing a fucking job, man.
It's not a crusade, all right?

727
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,629
Right! Then you don't bother, but when
I start something, I fucking finish it, Gal.

728
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,749
Yeah I know, I know.

729
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,156
I've been standing around watching
how you fucking finish it.

730
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,510
- You're arsehole's gone, mate.
- Listen man.

731
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,950
I can't fucking work with you any more
if you're going to go fucking over the top

732
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,672
every time you get
a fucking lump hammer in your hand.

733
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,392
(Mockingly) Oh, I'm sorry, Gal.

734
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,318
I'm really sorry, mate.
I'm so sorry.

735
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,953
I'm really sorry.

736
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,593
- More?
- Listen, man!

737
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,518
You're going in there
like a fucking psycho on crack,

738
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,959
what the fuck's going on?

739
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,231
- Wait until you see me after this shit.
- Brilliant!

740
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,956
I'm going to go and bury my fucking cat
and you fuck off out of my gaff.

741
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,557
- (Gal) There, that's me done.
- What?

742
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,433
- Listen, I can't do this anymore.
- No, no, Gal please? Please.

743
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,031
He needs to get help.

744
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,469
- I know.
- All right, listen. Don't cry.

745
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,830
- Don't cry.
- Thank you.

746
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,597
(Sobs)

747
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,839
Don't cry, please don't cry.

748
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,678
I'll call you.

749
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,719
We'll chat your mum up.

750
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,719
Get a puppy.

751
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,437
- OK.
- Yeah?

752
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,919
Has she gone to heaven?

753
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,071
I dunno, mate. Maybe.

754
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,039
Cat heaven.

755
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,030
You wanna talk to your uncle Gal really
about that side of things.

756
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,159
Come here.

757
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,999
Where have you been?

758
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,714
We went for a walk to look for foxes,
didn't we, mate?

759
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,876
- Dad said I could have a puppy.
- Did he?

760
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,797
Yeah, we're going to call it Arthur.

761
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,399
What if it's a girl?

762
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,317
Gwinny.

763
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,238
Hey you, young man, why don't you
go upstairs, get out of those dirties,

764
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,238
- and we'll have a bath in a minute, yeah?
- OK.

765
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,237
I don't want to talk about it.

766
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,589
Really? He's ready to walk.

767
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,229
Good! He's gone soft.

768
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,318
Wake up.
You wake up, fucking wake up!

769
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,788
Do you think if you get replacements
they'll let you go free of the contract?

770
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,518
Is that what you want?

771
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,113
It doesn't look good,
but if we're compromised here...

772
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,398
We can get you top draw replacements.
They even look like us.

773
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,150
- It is your job.
- What if we say...

774
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,396
...fuck you very much and good night?

775
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,354
Then you die.
And your families, they die.

776
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,710
No wriggle room on that then?

777
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,349
No.

778
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,789
How long
have we been working for you?

779
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,992
- Please, don't embarrass yourself.
- I'm asking you a straight question.

780
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,992
I see you, what you are.

781
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,633
What are we?

782
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,149
- You're cogs.
- What?

783
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,159
What the fuck is this?

784
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,799
Reconstruction.

785
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,798
So, keep turning.

786
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,437
What do you mean by fucking
reconstruction?

787
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,357
Fuck off man...
Get your hands off me.

788
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,955
- What's this?
- I'm leaving.

789
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,479
What?

790
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,273
I'm taking Sam to the cottage,
just until the job's over.

791
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,909
You know you're in serious danger
of losing this.

792
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,879
Is that what you want?

793
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,349
No.

794
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,670
- Be good for mummy yeah?
- Yes.

795
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,510
OK, watch your head, watch your head.

796
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,197
Turns out he's an MP.

797
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,799
Is that more acceptable
than a priest?

798
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,717
I can't say I'm not relieved.

799
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,039
Well, his name's on the list.

800
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,390
- That's all that matters.
- OK.

801
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,399
You sure?

802
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,715
You don't want to go and have
a little cry about it to Shel?

803
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,070
I might do if I could find her.

804
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,679
She's gone on holiday.

805
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,314
That's funny, she never mentioned
anything to me.

806
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,637
That's funny. I don't really understand
why you're calling my fucking wife, mate,

807
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,829
I'll be honest with you.

808
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,758
- Right, you're her husband, aren't you?
- Yeah, leave this now, Gal.

809
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,359
No.

810
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,357
You shouldn't fucking treat your wife
like a doormat.

811
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,959
- All right. Thanks.
- Know what I mean?

812
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,719
She's a lovely wee woman,
and you treat her like a fucking mug.

813
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,308
All your relationships
have been so very successful, Gal,

814
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,034
so thanks very much for your advice,
you cunt.

815
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,756
Oi! What the fuck was that? Fucking...

816
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,597
Not in the face, fuck!

817
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,517
Not in the fucking face.

818
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,519
(Glass breaks)

819
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,558
I'm telling Shel you started it.

820
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,159
She thinks I'm a saint.

821
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,397
She doesn't know you.

822
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,273
I'll go get a new one.
She won't even notice.

823
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,595
She notices everything.

824
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,390
I can't get that Fiona
out of my head, you know.

825
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,909
- Really?
- Yeah, I think it might be love.

826
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,432
- You don't really know her, Gal.
- Yeah well, you know.

827
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,309
These things happen
like that some times.

828
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,832
She gaffer-taped your cock.

829
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,349
I'm putting that down
as an erotic cry for help.

830
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,868
I can't remember
what I was like before Shel.

831
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,517
Probably a Ionely fucker, like me.

832
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,916
They say there's someone
for everyone, mate.

833
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,474
Yeah, it's not much to ask, is it?

834
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,760
Right, let's go and kill this MP then.

835
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,359
Yeah.

836
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,838
(Heavy clang)

837
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,678
- Got it?
- Yeah.

838
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,599
(Helicopter approaches)

839
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,517
- Did you hear that?
- What?

840
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,917
- Chopper?
- Don't know.

841
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,918
The air's good.

842
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,758
Yeah, we should do this more often.

843
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,359
What, kill rich people?

844
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,879
No, get out in the fresh air.

845
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,039
Dinner's on me.

846
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,079
Do you want a cup of tea?

847
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,350
Yeah, lovely.

848
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,472
We'll go down and have a look
at his gaff tomorrow.

849
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,318
What's the plan?

850
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,635
I can't be bothered with anything flash.

851
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,910
So we're not just gonna drag him
down to the village square

852
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,031
and chop his head off
with a fucking axe?

853
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,079
Eh?

854
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,069
Leave it till two or three, then.

855
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,188
Let's go down and get an idea
of the layout of the house.

856
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,518
You look right at home.

857
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,271
The two musketeers, eh?

858
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,753
♪ Oh Mr. Bunny, it's gonna get cold

859
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,189
♪ I'm taking your coat off your back

860
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,073
♪ Hey Mr. Bunny, what do you think?

861
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,792
♪ What do you think about that? ♪

862
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,357
(Gal) That's not right.

863
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,959
(Jay) What?

864
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,877
One man living in all that.

865
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,510
None of its right, Gal.

866
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,759
That's why we're here.

867
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,718
(Gal) Come on, let's bed down.

868
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,400
He's probably
fucking the scullery maid anyway.

869
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,279
Gal.

870
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,919
Gal.

871
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,679
You awake?

872
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,512
Well, I wasn't, but I am now.

873
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,719
What?

874
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,319
I'm...

875
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,992
...really sorry about that stuff.

876
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,957
Yeah, I know.

877
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,830
I don't know where it comes from.

878
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,470
Listen, you're a fucking madman,

879
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,989
but you're my best mate
and I love you, so...

880
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,717
Let's just leave it at that, eh?

881
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,319
Cheers.

882
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,479
(Slow, steady drumbeat)

883
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,079
Gal?

884
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,797
- Gal?
- What?

885
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,070
What the fuck? What?

886
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,317
(Drumbeat continues)

887
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,350
Get your shit together - lively.

888
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,718
(Distant thunder)

889
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,112
(Pulsing drumbeat)

890
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,917
(Hammering accompanies drumbeat)

891
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,517
(Beating stops)

892
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,438
- There's too many of them, man. Don't!
- Fuck this.

893
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,519
Jay!

894
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,757
(Shrieking)

895
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,319
(Hurried footsteps)

896
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,359
(Door clangs)

897
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,999
Fuck it, come on.

898
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,719
(Jay) Are you sure
you know where we are?

899
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,159
Yeah, yeah, I am.

900
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,436
- What's wrong?
- Shush.

901
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,239
Come on.

902
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,150
Fuck! It's been bricked up.

903
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,794
- It wasn't supposed to be here...
- I thought you'd fucking scouted!

904
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,911
It wasn't supposed to be here, man.

905
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,515
(Shrieking)

906
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,552
They are coming
from the other way, Gal.

907
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,109
Jay!

908
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,229
(Shrieking)

909
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,949
(Thumping)

910
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,677
Jesus Christ.

911
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,519
Jay?

912
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,119
Jay?

913
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,278
Jay?

914
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,549
(Shrieking)

915
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,918
(Knife is unsheathed)

916
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,919
(Shouts) Gal?

917
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,199
Gal?

918
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,074
(Howling reverberates around)

919
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,829
(Jay) C'mon mate. Jesus,
let's get you out of here mate.

920
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,439
(Gal) I can't move mate,
they've slashed...

921
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,357
They've slashed my fucking legs.

922
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,913
(Groaning)

923
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,189
(Jay) We've got to go.

924
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,799
Come on, please get up.

925
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,719
I'm done, mate.

926
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,159
Fuck.

927
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,438
Gal, we've got to, mate.

928
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,236
Tell Shel I'm sorry, will you?

929
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,796
Just do it, do it.

930
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,311
I'm sorry.

931
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,429
Thanks.

932
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,318
(Jay) It's all over.

933
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,878
(Sobs)

934
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,239
Can we go home now?

935
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,798
(Sam) Is he sick?
(Shel) Tired, very tired.

936
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,719
Shall we take you back to bed?

937
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,588
Get down.

938
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,351
Make sure Sam is all right
and turn the lights off upstairs.

939
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,277
- Let's leave, babe.
- No, we can't go anywhere.

940
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,072
They've slashed
the fucking tyres.

941
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,679
What the fuck is that?

942
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,713
It's too noisy!

943
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,119
Just fireworks.

944
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,238
I don't think there are many of them...

945
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,439
Listen, I'm going out there
to find them, yeah? Take that.

946
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,719
I love you, yeah.

947
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,438
(Muffled gunshot and heavy thud)

948
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,516

(Woman's sings in distance)

960
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,114
(Guttural singing continues)
