I'll get in front of them

8

Daryl, Abraham, Sasha,

And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna walk
back through the front gate after.

60

Pull our blinds at night.

64
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,715

All of them.

71
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,914
The plan that Rick
put into place

72
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,300
stopped that from happening.

73

I wanted to try to get into
a cannery and scavenge,

<i>to keep looking for people.</i>

We did what I wanted...

78
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,611
and we wound up in a trap
set by those people.

79
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,996

<i>Those people who attacked us...</i>

82
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,957

two meals out of this.

97
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:02,475
The soups and sauces can be stretched
out with some extra water.

98
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,145
What difference does that make
if we'll be dead tomorrow?

99

- I can't.

100

left watching my family starve.

102
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,078
Sorry, Olivia. I just
don't see the point.

103

Spencer:

Stop.

105
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,539
Right now, stop it.

106

This stuff is for everyone.

107
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:38,211
We need to make it last

108
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,180
Why don't you go make sure
the gate's closed, Spencer?

109
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,966
Yeah.
That was me.

110
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,435
I did that.

111
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,973
But that truck
outside the walls,

it'd be inside

I did that, too.

114

Where were you, Bruce?

116
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,711
Doing this will start us down
a road where nothing matters.

117
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,298
Where no one else matters.

118
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,670
And then we'll all look back
at this moment right now

119

The flashlights,
the rebar, the rope.

You lower them off the wall

maybe spin them.

126

That way, the walkers
are drawn to each one

<i>Not since I saw her with you.</i>

182
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,151
I think she went over the wall

183
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,604
and now she's trapped out there.

This isn't for me.

192

It's for Enid.

Or, I mean, 'cause she
was anyway, right?

195
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,767
So you want to just
leave her out there?

196
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,386
I told her to stop
going over the wall,

197
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,137
I told her there's
bad people out there

198
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,889
and that it's stupid
and dangerous.

199
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,608
Not if you know
what you're doing.

200
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,480
Well, I'm not gonna let you go.

Carl, you're not
going out there.

He'll go out there to find you,

209
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,920
And then somebody's gonna die.

210

His wound's infected.

I don't know
what the hell to do,

222

so it doesn't really
matter what I'm being.

I think he's gonna die.

235
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:11,701
And I'm so scared about
what's happening in here

236
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:15,238
that I can't think about
what's happening out there.

<i>And that's actually good.</i>

238
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,577
And I don't know
what to do with that.

239
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,797
I just want him to live and
for the roamers to go away.

240

And for a doctor
to show up at the gates

"War and Peace."

243

But here comes
the end of the world.

244

She just wanted to.

But, um...

331
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:08,531
I think she went out
there after the attack.

332
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,366
What, she's still out there?

333
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,785
Yeah.

334
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:15,672
We don't know where she is.

335
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:18,207
You know, but she knows
how to take care of herself.

336
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:22,345
And we can't go out there.

Carl wanted to try.

338
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,432
I stopped him. I told him
I'd tell you if he did.

339
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:28,051
And then, um--
I don't know.

340
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,218
I just thought
I should tell you--

341
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,887
Do you know where he is now?

342
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,188
Yeah, he's back at the house.

343
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,723
I saw him on the porch
with Judith.

344

I can keep guard, if you want.

Down there, they're
guarding the place now.

you said back at the quarry.
