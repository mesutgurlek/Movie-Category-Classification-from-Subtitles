00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,354
All right. Come on.
Let me show you the shop.

156
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,954
Sounds good.

157
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,728
So we do a little bit of everything here.

158
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,269
Livery work and rolling stock.

159
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,568
Custom work for the building trade.

160
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,209
When your blows are even and you can work a straight piece of metal,

161
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,509
those will be your tools.

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:18,050
It's hard work, but we manage to make
something that lasts a generation or two.

163
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,175
It gives you a sense of pride.

164
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,481
[ Chuckles ]
I reckon that's true.

165
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,217
- [ Whimpering ]
- What do you say? You ready to get started?

166
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,793
- Yes, sir.
- All right then.

167
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,293
How was your walk?

168
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,816
Like carrying around a
30-pound sack of flour.

169
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:42,397
Slow day?

170
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,477
Oh, I'm sure it's only a matter of time
before someone comes in...

171
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,843
from getting caught on a rusty nail
or falling off a ladder.

172
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,041
When I was traveling
through Selena last month...

173
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,017
there was a rash of copperhead snakebites.

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,055
It felt like every day
someone was dragged into the clinic.

175
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,353
I haven't had anything
as exciting as a snakebite in months.

176
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,917
You should be grateful
to have a healthy community to serve.

177
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,057
It's our job as doctors to care about even
the most minor illness or affliction.

178
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,103
And our patients deserve
and need our compassion.

179
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,196
That's right out of a textbook.

180
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,276
Belinda, are you sure there isn't anything
you'd like to talk to me about?

181
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,436
You can tell me anything. You know that.

182
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,517
- [ Moans Sharply ]
- What is it?

183
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:31,716
It's a quick, sharp pain and a
shortness of breath and minor faintness.

184
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,224
- Let's get you to an examination room.
- It's not necessary.

185
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,386
- Is the baby moving?
- It isn't that.

186
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,522
[ Groans ]
It's nothing to be concerned about.

187
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:44,296
Let me finish some things up,
and we'll get you home.

188
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,275
You know, my pa says walking's good
for a man's constitution.

189
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,278
You always walk?

190
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,780
Well, lately, I've been riding.

191
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,646
- You walking on my account?
- No. No.

192
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,414
I got a horse to give to Lillian...

193
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,490
but he's still a little green and testy.

194
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,391
I've been breakin' him,
gettin' ready for her to ride.

195
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,396
I figured I'd give him and me the day off.

196
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,797
I know nothing of saddle horses,
only a harness pro.

197
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,597
- I stick with wagons.
- You're better for it.

198
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,600
I really wish you would just sit down
after what happened today.

199
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,076
- What happened today?
- Absolutely nothing to be concerned about.

200
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,147
And that's coming from the doctor in me.

201
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,182
When you go home,
who will deliver your baby?

202
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,410
My mother-in-law. She's a midwife.

203
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,079
Well, I wish I was the one
delivering your baby.

204
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,156
It's a doctor's job after all.

205
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,487
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

206
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,023
Ladies, if you don't mind,
I brought home a guest for supper.

207
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,034
Ahh. Ah.

208
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,267
And you must be Joshua. Welcome to our home.

209
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,706
- It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Owens.
- Uh, that's ‘‘Dr. Owens."

210
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,194
You're a doctor?

211
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,941
Yes, as is my best
friend, Dr. Annie Watson.

212
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,107
It's a pleasure to meet you, Joshua.

213
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:09,711
Ma'am. It's funny. I just had no idea women
were allowed to be doctors.

214
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,017
- Allowed?
- No. I just-

215
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,961
And just who would
we need permission from?

216
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:14,922
Go easy on him, Lil.

217
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,487
He just got here. I'm sure he's aware
of what women can accomplish. Hmm?

218
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,328
Apparently not.

219
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:28,033
That's our daughter, Lillian.
We raised her to speak her mind.

220
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,506
You'll get used to it.

221
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:35,706
Well, now, let's go get washed up.

222
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,908
It smells like my favorite.

223
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,077
- Well, she certainly is your daughter.
- Indeed.

224
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,924
- Miss Owens?
- Mr. Coil.

225
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,903
I just want you to know...

226
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,839
I meant no disrespect earlier.

227
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,844
I would express an opinion,
but I'm not sure I'm allowed.

228
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,676
Well, I'd very much like to
hear your opinions.

229
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,716
I think you're very old-fashioned.

230
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,718
Women can pursue any career
they want these days.

231
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,720
They already have female lawyers,
doctors and ministers.

232
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,790
A town in Kansas even had a woman mayor.

233
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,452
Well, I have no objections to your mother
and aunt being doctors. I swear.

234
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:27,589
It's just-
Well, I've never met a lady doctor before.

235
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,602
I'm apologizing.
I guess I'm just not doing a very. Good job.

236
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,865
Apology accepted.

237
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,602
- Well, I 'll leave you to your schoolwork.
- Well, this isn't for school.

238
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,692
So you read for fun?

239
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,480
I'd read just about all day
if Ma and pa would let me.

Well, all right.

I'll leave you to your book, Miss Owens.

- How are you?
- I feel fine.

247
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:53,312
- Is everything all right?
- I can't get pregnant.

248
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,786
Belinda, you're young and healthy.

249
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,857
It may just take some time.

250
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,553
It's just- I think Lee is so disappointed.

251
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,528
- Have the two of you talked about it?
- Yes.

252
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,099
And he says he's fine
with the way our lives are.

253
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,532
But recently,
he's been at work more than ever.

254
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,763
His business is booming.

255
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,805
He's had to hire help.

256
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,273
You're probably right.

257
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,123
I'm really glad you're
back and we can talk again.

258
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,039
Me too.

259
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,014
- Oh!
- Annie, what is it?

260
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,144
It's that pain again.

261
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,484
And it's more severe this time.

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,558
Oh, I feel light-headed.

263

Belinda, I think something is really wrong.

- Is she gonna be all right?
- I believe so.

265
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,483
- The baby?
- He should be fine for now.

266
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,952
Annie thinks it was preterm labor,
but I just don't know.

267
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,089
- Why?
- I think it's eclampsia.

268
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,963
That sounds serious. What is it?

269
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,061
It's a condition of pregnant women,
but it's not well understood.

270
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,231
What makes you think that Annie has it?

271
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,831
Well, the symptoms
include muscle aches and pain...

272
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,640
severe agitation,
unconsciousness, seizures.

273
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,478
- Did she have a seizure?
- No, but she has all the other symptoms.

274
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,985
Well, I'll telegraph Peter first thing in
the morning, tell him what's happened.

275
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,147
Thank you.
And let him know I think it's best...

276
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,747
that Annie stay here
for the remainder of her pregnancy.

277
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,295
- Bed rest is crucial.
- While I'm at it, I'll wire his mother.

278
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,456
- You said she lives in Spartan?
- Thank you.

00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,931
[ Clucking ]

280
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,267
Do you really think this is necessary?

281
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,432
Total rest for you, Mrs. Watson,
and a dark room is conducive to rest.

282
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,478
To being lazy, you mean.
I cannot just lay around all day.

283
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,174
- I'm a doctor, remember?
- But I'm your doctor.

284
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,275
And this is my home. And if it is eclampsia,
you know bed rest is called for.

285
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,877
- Don't you think you're overreacting?
- Perhaps.

286
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,787
But if I'm not, I won't be sorry later.

287
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,794
- I love you.
- I love you too.

A pear for my peach.

289
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,468
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay home with Aunt Annie?

290
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,976
No. You just run along to school.

291
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,980
I'll post a note on the clinic. If someone
really needs me, they know where to find me.

292
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,518
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

293
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,712
- Bye, Ma.
- Have a good day, darlin'.

294
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,085
- Bye, pa.
- Bye.

That girl kicks up a cloud of dust
everywhere she goes.

Here you go.

Is this your way of telling me
not to come home for supper?

298
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,134
The other one is for Joshua.

299
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,514
A young man just starting off-

look like he could use
a few more good meals.

301

- Do you have any idea how much I love you?
- It never hurts to hear it.

What took you so long?

618
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,944
I'm sorry, Lloyd.
There was a little bit of a line.

There's always an excuse.
Let's get out of here.

No, you don't!

You are selfish...

and rude and contemptuous.

00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,290
And you can't see the forest for the trees.

Doc Owens is trying
to save your wife's life.

She's dying.

You get her over to the clinic...

637

and you beg Doc Owens
for more of that tonic.

- Don't talk to me like that.
- I'll talk to you anyway I want-

[ Woman ]
I admire women like that.

641
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,548
And you better pray
to the merciful and good Lord...

[ Woman ]
Amen. Amen.

I gave you a double dose,
so do not take any more today.

No, ma'am.

Starting tomorrow morning,
take two teaspoons every morning.

And if you don't get your strength back
in four days, get back in here.

I'd like to apologize.

The last time we spoke, I lost my temper.

What do I owe you for the tonic?

651
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,419
Only that you allow her to keep taking it.

652
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,498
We don't need no charity.

653

The first one was already paid for.
This is just a replacement.

Well, not anymore.

My apprentice wants to court Lillian.

His name is Joshua.

But don't think too long.

- Lillian's grown up.
- I'm having a hard time with it.

664

You're having a hard time
letting her grow up.

665
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,805
I'm just trying to protect her.

666
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,941
I don't think she needs protection
from Joshua.

667

He's a very nice young man.

668

That's all you have to say about it.

All right.

Tomorrow I'll give Joshua
my permission to court Lil.

672

Don't think I don't know
about your little excursion with Annie.

673
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,252
This town is filled with gossips. You can't
keep a secret for more than five minutes.

674
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,086
It's a pretty little town, Sikeston.

675
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,752
I can see why you like it here.

676
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,522
May I ask why you feel the need

677
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:15,093
to go against every
instruction I have for Annie?

678
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,930
I don't deliberately go against your word.

679
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,530
- We just disagree about how to treat her.
- This isn't a competition.

680
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,168
If a patient came to you
with gangrene or pneumonia...

681
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,712
I wouldn't dream of telling you
how to treat them.

682
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,974
That's your business.

683

Babies are my business.
Have been for 30 years.

684

It's just that there's been
so many new advancements.

685
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,988
Sometimes the old ways are best.

686
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,550
Annie may have a serious condition which
could be fatal to both her and the baby.

687
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,267
Are you sure?

688
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:48,962
Of course I'm not sure,
but I'm not taking any chances.

689
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:53,799
So it's true what they say
that doctors only practice medicine.

690
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,074
This conversation obviously
isn't getting us anywhere.

691
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,773
So Annie tells me you're barren...

692
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,849
or, uh- or having trouble anyway.

693
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,544
I don't think that's any of your concern.

I see this problem a lot.

695

If you want, I can give you some remedies
that are guaranteed to work.

696

I know how it's done, Mary.

697
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,924
I don't think there's
anything wrong with you.

698
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:22,397
- So, what do you think is the problem?
- You're too high-strung.

699
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,866
Folks worry too much about work, family...

700
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,268
or whether or not they can have a baby.

701
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:31,671
Then years go by and nothing happens.

702
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,266
Then one day they decide to stop trying...

703
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:38,474
and before you know it,
they find they're with child.

704
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:42,177
So your sage advice for me is to relax.

705
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,153
Read a book before you go to bed.

706
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,281
Take some deep breaths.

707
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,520
And before you know it,
I'll be back to deliver your little one.

And I got a lot of work to do.

00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,418
He shortchanged fathers in that area.

760
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,888
[ Laughs ]
Yeah. Yeah.

761
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,754
I really wish you would get some rest.

762
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,627
I feel fine.

763
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,360
Looks like someone may have been wrong
about my condition.

764
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,198
Perhaps.

765
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,535
So, have things improved with Lee?

766
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,541
He says he isn't bothered, but...

767
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,612
I still sense that he's disappointed
we can't have a baby.

768
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,787
Well, maybe you're just
being overly sensitive

769
00:47:31,788 --> 00:47:33,376
and you think that he's disappointed.

770
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,041
Maybe.

771
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,451
You know, I'm starting to think
that maybe she regrets marrying me.

772
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:42,423
Now, Lee, that is just plain nonsense.

773
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,687
She's proud as a peacock
that she married you.

774
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:48,196
- Maybe.
- Have you spoken to her about it?

775
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:52,598
Uh, in a roundabout way.
Of course she says I'm wrong.

776
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,728
But still, she seems kind of distant lately.

777
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,036
She's got something on her mind.
Most women do when they get like that.

778
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,236
Hmm. You know, we're, uh...

779
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,008
trying to have a baby.

780
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,279
- So far, no luck.
- You have to have faith.

781
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,287
Sometimes it's hard, Reverend.

782
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:16,985
Talk to her about your feelings.

783
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,346
I best be getting home.

784
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:21,394
Mrs. Davis will give me an
earful if I'm late for supper.

785
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,490
Yeah, myself included.

786
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,737
Well, I see...

787
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,310
you didn't need my help
putting supper on the table.

788
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,505
- You were taking a nap, Mary.
- We just wanted you to be able to rest.

789
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,174
I'll rest enough when I'm dead!

790
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,082
Give me that knife before you cut yourself.

791

[ Exhales Sharply ]

792
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,550
So, do you miss your family?

793
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,564
I do. My pa's a farmer back in Pennsylvania.

794
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,260
He wanted more for me
than spending my entire life plowing fields.

795
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:03,032
So he said if l got good enough,
maybe I can find some work in Philadelphia.

796
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,040
Sounds like he cares about you a lot.

797
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,373
Yeah, my family's pretty close.

798
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:12,437
It's kind of strange though,
you know, being out here all by myself.

799
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,609
I have three sisters and two brothers
and not a moment of peace.

800
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,119
Back at the boardinghouse
I got nothin' but quiet.

801
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,213
I know what you mean.
I mostly grew up in an orphanage...

802
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,919
until Ma and pa adopted me when I was 10.

803
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:28,691
I'd spent so long in a room with other kids
I couldn't wait to have a room of my own.

804
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,462
- Now I miss having someone to talk to.
- You have me.

805
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,163
I do, don't I?

806
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,701
So tell me something.

807
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,677
How'd you ever find a place
like this anyway?

808
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,906
I stumbled across it by accident
while riding one day.

809
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,382
And it's so far off the main road,
so no one really comes out here.

810
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:53,650
So I brought some of my old stuff,
and now it's where I come to be alone.

811
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,418
I can see why.

812
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,086
Captain Nemo had a cave near the ocean
where he went to escape.

813

- This reminds me of it.

- Well, the timber still seems sound-
- I wouldn't do that.

815

Whoa.

816
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,402
Not as sound as you may think.

817
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,567
Yeah, you're probably right.

818
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,077
I think it's best we pack up.

819
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,243
Well, I'm happy to see
you and Mary are getting along.

820
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,685
You know,
her fertility advice to me was to...

821
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,121
relax and read a book before bed.

822
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,251
- Did you try it?
- Of course not.

823
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,159
She's been doing this longer
than we've been alive.

824
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,425
I can't believe you, Annie Watson.

825
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,524
You've spent three years
in medical school...

826
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,695
five years practicing medicine and you're
gonna believe that woman's folk magic?

827
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,705
It's rubbish, plain and simple.

828
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:48,267
We ask people to believe in things
they don't understand and they do...

829
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,109
because they have trust and faith in us,
just like they have faith in the Lord.

830
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,116
Okay, it is not the same thing,
and we're talking about Mary here.

831
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,244
Why do you have such a hard time
believing in Mary's ways?

832
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,188
Look, okay, Mary is a lovely woman...

833
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,282
but you have to admit,
she's a little touched in the head.

834
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,987
She doesn't like me anymore than I like her.

835
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,463
Really?
The other day at the general store...

836
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,727
Mary defended you to the ends of the earth.

837
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,463
- What are you talking about?
- The man with the anemic wife?

838
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,233
The one that you said
was such a success story?

839
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,275
Mary is the reason
that he brought her back to you.

840
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,572
That's why Lloyd McQueen
brought his wife back to me?

841
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,341
Mary unloaded on him like a tornado.

842
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,576
Spoke up for you
and just plain made him cower.

Hi, pa.

847
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,934
You were supposed to be home for supper.

848
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,766
Joshua and I weren't that hungry, so we
decided to stay out a little while longer.

849
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,306
Well, it's well past supper.
That's more than a little while.

850
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,932
Why are you so angry?

851
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,841
I thought I could trust your judgment,
but apparently I was wrong.

852
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,574
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you can't spend any more time...

00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,980
with Joshua Coil until I say so!

854
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,484
You'll go to school, help your mother
at the clinic and come straight home.

855
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,147
- For how long?
- As long as it takes me to trust you again.

856
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,692
That's completely unfair.
Joshua's only two years older than I am...

857
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,818
and no one tells him what to do.

Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:50,493
Uh, Mr. Owens told me
how much trouble I caused the other night.

00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,900
I just wanted to come by and say how
sorry I am for keeping Lillian out so late.

866
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,600
You needn't place the blame all on yourself.
She's old enough to know better.

Pa said you couldn't go out with Joshua.

He said nothing about the two of you
seeing each other.

Sorry to get you into trouble.

You didn't do anything
wrong, and neither did I.

878
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,146
I'm a grown woman and I don't need my pa
deciding how late I can and can't stay out.

- Well, he doesn't need to be.

There's no need to be cross, Lillian.

you get off punishment.

much sleep with or without him.

You may not be able to go with her,
but you'll see her there.

carrying luggage and walking into town.
