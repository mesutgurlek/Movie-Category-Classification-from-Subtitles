00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,289
That's a green limb, you fool.

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,524
What do you want to do?

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,593
Put out my fire 'fore
I get it started?

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,695
'Tain't neither green.
It's dry as a bone.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,732
You sass your pa once more,
I'll take a strap to you.

9
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,101
Now you get over to the wagon
and get them wet sacks.

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,763
I don't want no fire
around that wagon.

11
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,061
Look at it go now.

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,896
Wind's just right.

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,799
It'll be up
in them trees in no time.

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, how far'll it burn?

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,769
Oh, on up through the canyon.

16
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,037
Up that ridge, I expect.

17
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,574
500, 1,000 acres.

18
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,342
Make a nice piece of land.

19
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,311
That's a lot of trees'll burn.

20
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,712
Can't eat trees.

21
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,549
Well, the stock can eat grass,
and the grass'll burn, too.

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,819
Grass'll grow back in,
thicker and richer than ever.

23
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,887
Fire purifies the land.

24
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,657
Always like to burn over
my land before I start.

25
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,852
(horse approaching)

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,628
Somebody's coming.

27
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,722
I can hear as good as you can.

28
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,537
Who are you, and what in tarn
are you doing with that fire?

29
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,005
I'm Jeb Hoad.

30
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,007
This is my daughter, Willow.

31
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,411
I'm clearing myself
a piece of land.

32
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,281
I might settle down here,
if'n I like the look of it bare.

33
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,851
Why, you crazy fool, you're
gonna burn the whole range.

34
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,852
Give me that sack.

35
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,718
Get some more of these
sacks and help me.

36
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,425
Let that fire alone!

37
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,791
You'll get yourself killed!

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,466
Shoot him, Pa!

39
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,534
Shoot him good!

40
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,636
(gunshot)

41
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,139
Now look, you-- you try
reloading that cannon,

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,903
I'll put
a hole right through you.

43
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,454
(gunshot)

44
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,446
(rifle fires)

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,695
You killed my pa!

46
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,687
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,101
I got to get this fire put out.

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,371
(Little Joe coughing)

49
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,864
(Willow gasps)

50
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,373
(theme song playing)

51
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,425
(coughing)

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,782
Still like to cut
my heart out, wouldn't you?

53
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,789
I just don't know
what I'm going to do with you.

54
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,992
Look, if you'd just
listen to reason.

55
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,795
Just give me a chance.
Let me try to explain.

56
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,164
Your father didn't
know what he was doing.

57
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,734
There's a lot of people
living up in these hills.

58
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,602
People with homes.
People with families.

59
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,204
These woods
are as dry as tinder.

60
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,006
Once the wind
got behind that fire

61
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,440
he wouldn't have
burned 1,000 acres

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,033
he'd have burned 20,000,
maybe more.

63
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,315
All right.
All right, I...

64
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,784
I know it's not a reason
to kill a man for.

65
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
I didn't want it to happen.

66
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,554
I didn't want it
to come to that.

67
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,490
Look, you have
to listen to me.

68
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,792
I... I warned him
not to shoot, didn't I?

69
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,591
Didn't I warn him
not to try it again?

70
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,424
It's not too good a time
to explain, I guess.

71
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,707
I can't leave you
out here alone.

72
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,871
I'll take you back to the house,
see if I can't help you.

73
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,748
Come on.
Let's go.

74
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,410
(groans)

75
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,753
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you dead!

76
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,915
I'll kill you!

77
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,829
Come on.
Come and get me.

78
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,092
Come on!

79
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,518
Just wait till
my kinfolks get here.

80
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,653
They're a-coming!

81
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,088
They'll get you!

82
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,556
They'll kill your family!

83
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,691
They'll burn
your place down, too.

84
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,493
Grandma Hoad can do it.

85
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,062
She'll make you
wish you never was born!

86
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,998
Wait and see!

87
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,934
WILLOW: Tarnation
yellow-back!

88
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,469
Let me off of here!

89
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,703
I'll kill you!

90
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,972
I'll kill you,
sure as you're born!

91
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,141
In heaven's name,
what have you got here?

92
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,176
Her name's Willow.

93
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,974
I killed her father.

94
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,548
You <i>what?</i>

95
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,917
WILLOW: Yellow-back!
Let me off of here!

96
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,753
Clearing the timber
off of Box Creek Canyon.

97
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,187
They were going to burn it off.

98
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,856
Burn it off?

99
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,257
That's right.

100
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,194
A fire in the canyon would...
would turn it into a chimney.

101
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,262
Half the Ponderosa
could have been...

102
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,897
I told him to put it out.
He wouldn't do it.

103
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,233
I tried to put
the fire out myself.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,002
He warned me if I went near it,
he'd kill me.

105
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,105
I didn't think
he meant it, but he did.

106
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,441
I had to kill him
to stay alive.

107
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,709
WILLOW:
You can't keep me here.

108
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,944
My kinfolks are coming.
They'll kill you all.

109
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,708
Grandma Hoad'll feed
you to the hogs.

110
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,446
What about her?

111
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,087
After I killed her father,
she came at me.

112
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,322
I... I had to tie her up.

113
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,382
There was nothing else
I could do.

114
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,930
Hoss...

115
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,600
have the body
decently laid out.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,338
Adam, you better go and report
this to the sheriff.

117
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,941
See if he can
get out here, if possible.

118
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,342
Ask Mrs. Shaughnessy
to drop up here.

119
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,744
We'll need some help.

120
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,113
Oh, and Adam,
you better have her

121
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,881
bring some things for the girl--

122
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,113
shoes, a dress,
maybe a skirt or two.

123
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,130
You better put the girl
in the east bedroom.

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,765
WILLOW:
They'll kill you all!

125
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,333
You can't keep me here!

126
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,569
My kinfolks are coming!
They'll kill you all!

127
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,538
Grandma Hoad'll
will feed you to the hogs!

128
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,344
(rustling)

129
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,091
You boys want to see
some first-class stock?

130
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,389
Look yonder.

131
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,492
Whoa.

132
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,226
What do you make
of it, Dodie?

133
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,670
Only see one gun.

134
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,299
Mind what I told you.

135
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,211
You hear?

136
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,180
I heard ya.

137
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,580
Git up.

138
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,830
Whoa.

139
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,017
Howdy, stranger.

140
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,019
Afternoon, ma'am.

141
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,689
We be the Hoads,
traveling west out of Kentucky.

142
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,624
We want no trouble
with man or beast.

143
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,326
I'm Bart Hastings.

144
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,527
This is the Lazy K.

145
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,262
These are my men.

146
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,464
Like you,
I don't want any trouble.

147
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,401
You're welcome to
travel across my land.

148
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,200
Now, that's real nice of you.

149
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,473
Know of a place
called Virginia City?

150
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,442
Know it well.

151
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,644
How far be it?

152
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,413
Oh, about a week's travel
with your rig.

153
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,872
WOMAN: Ever seen the likes
of us before?

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,922
Why do you ask?

155
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,191
A son of mine, Jeb Hoad,
and his young'un

156
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,061
likely passed through here
some time ago.

157
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,396
You'd know him for our kin
if'n you'd seen him.

158
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,266
Passed through here
about a week, ten days ago.

159
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,935
You didn't take to him?

160
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,503
I did not.

161
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,273
Don't take to folks like us?

162
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,109
He camped here without asking.

163
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,044
Killed one of my steers
for beef.

164
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,179
Didn't ask about that, either.

165
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,681
We'uns ain't liked much.

166
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,783
Hang tight together.

167
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,051
Got to, or get killed.

168
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,221
Nobody does a hurt to a Hoad
without'n he pays for it.

169
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,223
I didn't hurt him.

170
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,992
What's more,
I gave him the beef.

171
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,660
He and the youngster looked
half-starved.

172
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,428
Then I ordered him off my land.

173
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,197
That why you ain't asking
me and mine

174
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,632
to light here
and rest ourselves?

175
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,966
Account of that steer?

176
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,434
That's right.

177
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,703
We traveled a far piece today.

178
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,940
Near 20 mile.
We'uns are wore thin.

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,442
Stock needs feed, needs water.

180
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,211
You can't stay here,
and that's an order!

181
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,577
- You got to move on!
- (gunshot)

182
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,588
I wasn't...
I wasn't going to shoot.

183
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,217
I was just... I was only...

184
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,861
(whip cracking)

185
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,898
(whip cracking)

186
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,829
(whip cracking)

187
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,477
(whip cracking)

188
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,773
(whip cracking)

189
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,286
He's dead.

190
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,551
He's dead.
W-We killed another one.

191
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,098
Come on, bring him
out of there

192
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,466
before that horse tramples him.

193
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,634
He's dead.

194
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,035
Ever know Dodie to miss?

195
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,603
Come on, bring him
out of there!

196
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,764
Give him a hand.

197
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,378
You won't get away with this.

198
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,779
Nothing to get away from.

199
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,114
It was murder.

200
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,450
That man drawed his gun.

201
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,685
It don't do to draw on a Hoad.

202
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,220
Too many of us
have been killed.

203
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,255
You know it was murder.

204
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,990
I saw you beat the man for it.

205
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,126
'Twasn't murder
I whupped him about.

206
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,029
I whupped Dodie 'cause he shot
'thout I told him to.

207
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,530
I'd warned him when we got here.

208
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,300
Call it murder or not,
he'll hang for it!

209
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,568
I'll see to that!

210
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,537
Best think on that real hard.

211
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,838
You ain't never seen killin'
till you kill one of us.

212
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,479
(door opens and shuts)

213
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,555
(door shuts)

214
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,400
(door opens and shuts)

215
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,766
Is she that dirty?

216
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,877
Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna have
to soak her a good long while

217
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,612
to get her clean, Pa.

218
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,347
Well, how you gonna manage that?

219
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,883
Hoss has got this contraption
rigged up.

220
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,484
He thinks it's gonna work.

221
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,952
Sure hope it does.

222
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,921
Yeah, hope it does.

223
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,555
Yeah.

224
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,067
(Little Joe sighs)

225
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,508
There. I think this ought
to just about do it.

226
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,509
(glass breaking)

227
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,312
WILLOW:
Let me out of here! Let me out!

228
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,814
- Here, take this
out of here. -Yeah.

229
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,016
- Good mirrors are hard
to come by. -Right.

230
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,318
WILLOW:
Open this door!

231
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,616
- Let me out!
- (thudding)

232
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,525
I'll pound this room to pieces!
Let me out of here!

233
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,793
Oh! Hey, Shaughnessy,
maybe we better

234
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,161
just put it off for a while.

235
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,696
You know, maybe I could
talk to her.

236
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,932
- Calm her down a little bit.
- We've waited long enough.

237
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,000
Now there's no use in
putting it off any longer.

238
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,669
- Let me out of here!
- All right, but now look,

239
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,937
you promise me you're
not gonna hurt her?

240
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,338
And if she starts to fight
a little bit too much,

241
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,639
- we'll just let her go.
- (glass shatters)

242
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,175
I promised,
and I'll keep my promise.

243
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,511
And don't forget, she might
be afraid of water, you know.

244
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,613
Oh, nonsense. That's just
another excuse to fight.

245
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,548
She'd fight if you
fed her cherry pie.

246
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,983
Now, if I had my say,

247
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,652
I'd take that snap and bite out
of her with a razor strap.

248
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,687
(thumping)

249
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,156
Shaughnessy, please,
open this door!

250
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,157
Well, Shaughnessy,
take it from me,

251
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,725
it doesn't do any good
to fight with her.

252
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,026
- Let me out!
- If we use a little patience

253
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,561
and a little kindness,
we, we can...

254
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,730
Don't worry, Little Joe,
I'll do it your way.

255
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,756
- Now, here, take this.
- Okay.

256
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,768
WILLOW:
Let me out of here!

257
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,180
Well... there she is.

258
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,816
She's a good one, too. Stout.
I jumped up and down on it.

259
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,517
(Little Joe chuckles)

260
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,685
What is it?

261
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,686
Well...

262
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,188
It'll work fine, if I need it.

263
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,756
Now you two get out
of here. Go on.

264
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,757
Yes'm.

265
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,960
WILLOW: Let me out of here!
Let me out!

266
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,691
Ooh, I'll kill you!

267
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,204
(glass breaking)

268
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,339
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

269
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,441
I'll kill you!
Tarnation yellow-back!

270
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,610
- Let me off of here!
- I don't know, Hoss.

271
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,945
- I'll kill you!
- I don't think it's gonna work.

272
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,213
- Don't you fret yourself.
- (Willow shouting)

273
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,382
Shaughnessy has run more
critters through that sheep dip

274
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,650
than half the ranchers
in Nevada.

275
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,251
- (glass shatters)
- WILLOW: I'm not gonna!

276
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,953
You can't make me
get in that water!

277
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,690
I won't! I won't!
Get your hands off of me!

278
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,693
Give me back my britches!
I'll show you!

279
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,662
(splashing)

280
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,497
No! You tryin' to drown me?!

281
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,599
Joe, what do you
think you're doing?

282
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,934
You can't go in there.

283
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,236
WILLOW:
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

284
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,904
(gurgling)

285
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,739
- (thumping)
- No! No!

286
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,765
(splashing, gurgling)

287
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,147
Hey... you don't...
you don't reckon...?

288
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,648
I don't know.

289
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,016
May-Maybe she did drown her.

290
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,918
(gurgling)

291
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,853
- Can't you hear nothing?
- Shh.

292
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,088
(gurgling continues)

293
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,156
Miss Shaughnessy?

294
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,857
(gurgling continues)

295
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,452
Sh-Shaughnessy, are you all
right?! Answer me!

296
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,733
(wood thumping)

297
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,568
LITTLE JOE:
Shaughnessy, are you all right!

298
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,537
Answer me!

299
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,439
- (Willow gasps)
- We're all right!

300
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,276
Fact is, we're fine.
We're having a real nice soak.

301
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,074
(gasps)

302
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,855
Oh, I can't do this.
I'm all thumbs.

303
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,123
You're the one that says

304
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,925
it takes gentleness
and patience.

305
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,060
Well, stay there and be gentle
and patient.

306
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,363
Be careful she doesn't bite
a finger off ya.

307
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,592
Yeah.

308
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,599
Here it is, Shaughnessy.

309
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,401
I-I moved that buckle over about
a midge.

310
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,269
It ought to fit real fine now.

311
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,397
Try it and see.

312
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,008
Me?

313
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,603
We might need someone strong.

314
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,771
Yes'm.

315
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,220
Easy, gal.

316
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,889
Real easy, now.

317
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,357
Ain't you kick me.

318
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,628
Easy now. That's the way.

319
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,190
They won't hurt.

320
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,141
Hey, you know something, Joe?

321
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,609
Hmm?

322
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,444
She <i>is</i> a pretty little gal.

323
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,039
Pretty as a spotted pony.

324
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,284
LITTLE JOE:
Ooh!

325
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,720
What's the matter now?

326
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,188
She bit me, that's what's
the matter.

327
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,423
It can't hurt that bad.

328
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,925
She took the hide off me!
Took the hide right off me!

329
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,393
Well, you pulled her hair
or something.

330
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,529
Never was any good
at hair, no how.

331
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,164
Who does all the plaiting
of the tails

332
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,999
and manes around here? Me.

333
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,592
You better be careful.

334
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,269
Don't you bite me.
I-I'll swat you one.

335
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,951
Hey, Hoss, will you hurry
up with that thing?

336
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,587
(grunts)

337
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,189
Come on, hurry.
She's hard to hold.

338
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,190
I'm coming!

339
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,158
Here, what do you want me
to do with it?

340
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,526
Put it where she
can see herself,

341
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,694
and then I'll let her go.

342
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,963
Uh, over by the window, Hoss,
where the light's the best.

343
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,329
Yes'm.

344
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,934
Now, watch her.

345
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,569
You-you watch her, now.

346
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,901
I'm gonna let her go.

347
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,172
HOSS:
Easy, gal.

348
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,607
Easy. That's it.

349
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,551
HOSS:
Hey...

350
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,819
(chuckles)

351
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,123
Hey... hey, Joe,
you know something?

352
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,492
You know something, I...
I think you was right.

353
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,460
Yeah, she's a gal, ain't she?

354
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,362
Any gal would rather
look pretty than not.

355
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,698
I knew she'd quiet down
the minute she saw herself.

356
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,368
All females are vain.

357
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,098
(chuckles)

358
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,539
Can I show the mister?

359
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,908
Hey, you sure can. He's gonna be
real surprised, too.

360
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,844
He didn't know he had such a
good-looking gal in the house.

361
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,049
Hey, Pa?!

362
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,185
Hey, Pa, I got
a surprise for you!

363
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,219
Where are you?

364
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,621
I'll check the barn, Joe.

365
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,755
Yeah.

366
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,121
Hey, come on.

367
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,227
Let's sit...
Oh, right here.

368
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,962
Sit down.

369
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,624
Put your hands there.

370
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,959
No, I don't like it.
Come here.

371
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,941
Put your hand up here.
Put your hand...

372
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,142
There.

373
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,343
Yeah.

374
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,145
Hmm! That's good.

375
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,446
Ah, you stay like that.

376
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,177
I want Pa to see you
just like that, okay? Just...

377
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,852
Hey, Pa!

378
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,387
Pa?

379
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,955
Hey, Pa. Pa!

380
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,989
What's all the yelling about?

381
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,457
Pa, I got something to show you.

382
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,458
- It's a surprise.
- What?

383
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,993
You're not... you're not
gonna believe it.

384
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,825
Believe what?

385
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,138
(hoofbeats receding)

386
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,540
So help me, Pa,
I'm gonna bring her back

387
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,609
and tame her,
if it's the last thing I do.

388
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,811
Hey, Joe, did you tell her
she could take Pa's horse?

389
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,370
<i>My</i> horse?

390
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,456
(horse snorting)

391
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,490
(hammer cocks)

392
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,275
(horse neighs)

393
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,904
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

394
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,354
HOSS:
I'll be dad-burn.

395
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,424
A book of poetry.

396
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,626
Hard to believe, ain't it?

397
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,729
I never figured a book of poetry
was good for anything.

398
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,298
Yeah, that book of poetry

399
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,999
turned the bullet
and saved my life.

400
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,602
Yeah. Hey, there's some
pages here that ain't torn.

401
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,737
- Mind if I read it?
- No, go ahead.

402
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,968
(hoofbeats approaching)

403
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,381
Who is it?

404
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,516
It's the sheriff.

405
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,517
(horse whinnies)

406
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,218
Pa's down there
talking to him.

407
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:04,423
I wonder how he found out
I was bushwhacked so fast.

408
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,158
I don't know.

409
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,457
I'll go find out.

410
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,674
Well, Ben, this is
the first I heard

411
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,975
that Adam had been shot.

412
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,011
But in view of what I
was gonna talk to you about,

413
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,146
I think I know who shot him.

414
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,982
Who? Adam's never had
any enemies around here.

415
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,918
He has now. You all have.

416
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,686
You got
a whole durn nest of them.

417
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,821
What do you mean?

418
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,956
Well, that girl Adam said
you had here--

419
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,591
her kinfolk, the Hoads,

420
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,160
they come to town,
just like she said they would.

421
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,463
Now you... you don't
mean that, uh...

422
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,598
it was one of her family
that shot Adam?

423
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,836
Well, Ben, like you say,
Adam <i>didn't</i> have any enemies

424
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,137
that would do a thing like that.

425
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,872
But the Hoads did find out

426
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,007
it was a Cartwright
killed the girl's father.

427
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,276
No question about that.
The talk's all over town.

428
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,212
So somebody must have
pointed Adam out

429
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,047
when he went through
Virginia City.

430
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,050
You still got that girl here?

431
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,452
Yeah, yeah, she's-she's
still here, Roy.

432
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,020
She's out with
Little Joe somewhere,

433
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,188
but she's still here.

434
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,957
You mean she's roaming
around loose?

435
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,525
From what Adam said
you just about

436
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,128
had to keep her locked up
in a cage. (chuckles)

437
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,196
Oh, she's tamed down now, Roy.

438
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,699
She's, uh, wearing a dress
and washing

439
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,300
and eating
at the table with us,

440
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,735
even learning how to embroider.

441
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,072
We still have to keep
her locked up at night.

442
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,508
Yeah, and the guns locked up
and anything with an edge on it,

443
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,543
like a, like a knife
or an ax or something.

444
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,713
Even so, she sounds a lot tamer
than the rest of her family.

445
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,515
That's what I wanted
to tell you, Ben.

446
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,151
The Hoads killed one
of Bart Hastings' best men

447
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,052
on the Lazy K when they come
through there.

448
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,322
Killed him or murdered him?

449
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,291
Well, it all depends
on who you're listening to.

450
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,360
Bart claims it was
out-and-out murder,

451
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,729
and the Hoads, they say
it was just plain self-defense.

452
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,531
Anyway, there's got
to be a trial.

453
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,866
I'm on my way over now
to pick up Dodie Hoad,

454
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,501
the one that done the shooting.

455
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,003
Thought you and Hoss
should come along.

456
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,371
It's on your property.

457
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,574
Well... the Hoads camped
near here?

458
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,176
Just over the ridge.

459
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,277
We'll come along.

460
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,778
I'll saddle up the horses, Pa.

461
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,110
I'll be right out.

462
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,526
They'll come.

463
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,029
Don't you fret
yourself about that.

464
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,131
They killed my boy Jeb

465
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,800
because he wanted
to settle on a piece of land.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,770
They'll come to drive
we'uns off, too.

467
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,741
Have we got to kill them, Gram?

468
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:41,179
Got to kill the one that
killed my boy, Jeb, leastwise.

469
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,449
Got to show them we can kill
man for man.

470
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,085
It's the onliest way
we can stay alive.

471
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,782
I wish it wasn't so.

472
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,431
Has to be, Bud.

473
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,334
Folks like them
been hounding us

474
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,103
every foot of the way
from St. Joe.

475
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,738
Fighting us.

476
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,040
Denying us the simple
means of living.

477
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,209
Killing us.

478
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,978
'Twasn't for us showing them

479
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,480
we could kill quicker,
quicker than they could,

480
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,750
we'd be in our
graves before this.

481
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,254
That's true, Gram,
they do hound us.

482
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,755
I never could figure
out just why.

483
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,858
We'uns ain't like them.
That's why.

484
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,694
They don't take to
folks who are different.

485
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,030
They hate 'em, fear 'em.

486
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,896
Just feel they got
to be rid of them.

487
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,802
Well, I don't see that.

488
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,293
We're like they are.

489
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,808
No, we ain't.

490
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,845
Our folks settled in Kentucky
and Tennessee

491
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,916
more than a hundred year ago,
but we ain't like 'em.

492
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,853
We got two hands, two feet,
we got red blood in our bodies.

493
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:59,257
We got love in our hearts for
our young'uns and our old'uns.

494
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:03,428
And we pray to God Almighty,
but we ain't like 'em.

495
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:08,166
We'll be fighting 'em all the
rest of our lives, I expect.

496
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,503
Our lives may not be long.

497
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,872
They can kill us off near
anytime they take a notion.

498
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,609
Can't give in to 'em--
that's the worst.

499
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,647
Can't let 'em fence us out or
deny us our rights to the land

500
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,083
or kill us without punishment.

501
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,921
We'uns would be better dead many
times over if we done that.

502
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,991
Well, I'd rather be alive
and married to Willow,

503
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,659
like we was promised.

504
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,094
I'd rather have
a piece of land

505
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,563
and a place
to raise young'uns.

506
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:42,734
I'm a-feared they ain't never
gonna let you and Willow marry.

507
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,570
They're a-gathering
again' us right now.

508
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,038
You know that.

509
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,441
I reckon.

510
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,877
They'll come on hard, and I
reckon they won't stop

511
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,779
till we're all dead.

512
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,681
I know <i>we</i> won't.

513
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,216
If it comforts you

514
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,186
they'll bury twice as many
of theirs as they will ours.

515
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,449
I promise you that.

516
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,620
It don't comfort.

517
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,327
Not none at all.

518
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,696
(hoofbeats approaching)

519
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,631
I hear riders.

520
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,907
- (whip cracks)
- Far enough!

521
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,102
(horse neighs)

522
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,668
Roy.

523
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,887
Ma'am, I'm the law.

524
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,522
Not here, you ain't.

525
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,923
Here, I'm the law.

526
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,092
Don't be a fool, Mrs. Hoad.

527
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,228
I come out for the
one you call Dodie.

528
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,096
What do you want with him?

529
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,632
Stand trial for the killing
of Slim Carter

530
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,834
of the Lazy K Ranch.

531
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,037
That'un drawed his gun.

532
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,572
Dodie killed him 'fore
he could kill one of us.

533
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,675
That ain't nothing to stand
trial about.

534
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,011
It's up to the jury to decide
whether he's guilty or not.

535
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,114
My job is just to take him in as
the law requires.

536
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,584
Where was the law
when they killed Dodie's wife?

537
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,319
Dodie's wife?

538
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,622
I know nothing about
a woman being killed.

539
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,257
I'm telling you.

540
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,125
Near a month ago
out in the prairie

541
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,762
some wild bunch came and shot up
our wagon for no reason.

542
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,499
Dodie's wife didn't draw a gun,
but they killed her.

543
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,470
Dodie ain't been real right in
the head ever since.

544
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,972
Did you report that
killing to the law?

545
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,874
I told a lawman.

546
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,443
He done nothing.

547
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,777
Just drove us on.

548
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:36,047
There's a law for you'uns
and a law for we'uns.

549
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,483
But it ain't the same law.

550
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,118
- Now, look...
- Ma'am...

551
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,387
It is the same.

552
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,122
Least ways, around here, it is.

553
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,157
Who might you be?

554
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,892
Ben Cartwright.

555
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,561
I own this land.

556
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,330
Then you must know who I am,
I reckon.

557
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,365
You better know why I'm here.

558
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,101
Yeah, I know.

559
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,636
Your granddaughter,
Willow, told us all about you.

560
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,638
I want her.

561
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,875
But more than that I want
the man that killed Jeb Hoad.

562
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,377
I heard about that, too, ma'am.

563
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,246
I'm sorry about what happened.

564
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,582
Little Joe said
it was unavoidable.

565
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,051
I mean to see
he hangs for it.

566
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,986
Little Joe's my son.

567
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:18,389
And Jeb Hoad was mine.

568
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,958
The law determined

569
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,060
that Little Joe acted
in self-defense.

570
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,063
There's a law for you'uns
and a law for we'uns,

571
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,998
and it's not the same law.

572
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,467
I say it is the same law
for both of us.

573
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,735
And don't you defy it.

574
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,904
Now, I come out here to take in
Dodie Hoad,

575
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,205
and I'm going to take him.

576
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,609
You try it, and they'll
likely bury all of us.

577
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,645
- Is that right?!
- Roy. -(horse neighs)

578
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,949
Maybe, we, uh... maybe we better
think on this, huh?

579
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,509
Yeah, maybe so.
Come on, boys.

580
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,762
Roy?

581
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,889
Yeah?

582
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,404
You know, she meant what
she said, every word of it.

583
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,072
If we try
to bull our way in there

584
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,775
there'll be dead to bury--
most of theirs and most of us.

585
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,844
But I've got to go in.
She's defying the law.

586
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,746
Well, she's not defying it,
she's afraid of it.

587
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,880
What's the difference

588
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,315
whether she's afraid
of it or not?

589
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,051
The law's the law,
and I've sworn to uphold it.

590
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,287
Well, maybe you didn't swear it
when you took office,

591
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,656
but you're bound to uphold human
lives before the law.

592
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,624
Ben, you've got
to be realistic.

593
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,693
Them Hoads are like a pit
full of rattlesnakes,

594
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,161
and twice as dangerous.

595
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,564
You heard her say she wanted
to hang Little Joe, didn't you?

596
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,799
Well, she meant
every word of that.

597
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,402
She was upset.
And she had every right to be.

598
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,937
I know how I'd feel

599
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,839
if one of my sons
had just been killed.

600
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,708
Now, Roy, you got to let me
go back and reason with her.

601
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,207
All right, Ben.

602
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,719
Pa, what you going to do?

603
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,451
I'm going to hold out
my hand to her.

604
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,440
I got a bead on him, Ma.
Just say when.

605
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,879
(hammer cocks)

606
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,094
(whip cracking)

607
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,695
Far enough.

608
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,897
Stand there.

609
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,566
What tricks are you playing?

610
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,468
No tricks.

611
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,472
I'm a man with sons,
tired of killing.

612
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:52,543
I've come to talk to a woman
with sons who must hate killing.

613
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,346
Will you hear me?

614
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,215
I'll hear you.

615
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,952
We can fight each other
and kill each other

616
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,954
over a man already dead.

617
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:07,959
And that'd pile grief on grief
and settle nothing.

618
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:12,864
Or we can call
the dead man buried.

619
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:17,535
We can set aside grief and hate.

620
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,766
We could live as neighbors.

621
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,409
Will you look at what
I've come to show you?

622
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,344
I'll look.

623
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,093
Not more than
20 miles from here

624
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:46,087
a rich valley with sweet
water and good grass.

625
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,901
Sheltered land.

626
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,803
I'll give you 50 head of beef

627
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,771
and ten horses, two
broken to the plow.

628
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,041
Your neighbors--
and I'll be one of them--

629
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,510
will help you build
before the snow flies.

630
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,448
It has the look of
a lie, a trap.

631
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,150
Yeah, that it does.

632
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,286
But the truth would look
exactly the same.

633
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,457
No man gives away so much.

634
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,192
I'm not giving.

635
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,260
I'm trading.

636
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,030
In exchange,

637
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,934
you won't make me kill
some of yours to protect mine,

638
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,204
and I won't make you kill
some of mine to protect yours.

639
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,941
What about my boy Dodie?

640
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,343
Sheriff said he wanted him.

641
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,446
Yeah.
He'll have to stand trial.

642
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,677
A fair trial, I promise you.

643
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,651
Show me your face.

644
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,564
I ain't seen nothing
but lying, cheating men

645
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,300
for a long, long time.

646
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,826
I'm about decided
all the good'uns are dead.

647
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,283
What did you see?

648
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,656
I'll study on it.

649
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:23,861
Dodie will come in
at sundown tomorrow... or not.

650
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,796
That'll be your answer.

651
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,034
(stick clatters)

652
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,836
Sundown tomorrow.

653
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,905
If'n this be a trap--

654
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:38,109
a trick to blind me,
or some way to kill Dodie--

655
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,545
I'll come after you,
Ben Cartwright.

656
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:44,641
And I won't rest till you're in
your grave or I'm in mine.

657
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,387
And I mean to have my
granddaughter back with me.

658
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,413
You remember that.

659
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,262
(hammer uncocks)

660
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,841
Oh...

661
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,083
(horse whinnying)

662
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,419
You can't keep me, now.
My kin's here.

663
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,554
I can go if I want.
I got my rights.

664
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,790
Let go of me!

665
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,160
I don't want to keep
you here, Willow.

666
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,130
I just came out to say
good-bye to you, that's all.

667
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,001
This pony and your clothes--

668
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,137
all the clothes you got
back in your room--

669
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,765
they're yours to keep.

670
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,241
Make sure you come
back and get them.

671
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,540
Come back and visit us real
soon, too, now, you hear?

672
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,504
(sighs)

673
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,769
What happened?
She run off again?

674
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,875
Yeah, she left.

675
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,313
You, uh, really thought
you could tame her, huh?

676
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,615
No, it wasn't that.

677
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,017
She heard us talking.

678
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,687
Heard her family was nearby,
and she wanted to be with them,

679
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,590
so I let her go.

680
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,260
Well, now that's probably the
best thing, don't you think?

681
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,058
I suppose.

682
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,501
But you'll miss her, huh?

683
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,130
Yeah, I guess I will.

684
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:51,375
She was kind of cute when we got
her face washed, you know?

685
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,046
I guess I kind of
got used to having her around.

686
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,415
Something else on your mind?

687
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,906
Yeah.

688
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,354
Yeah, I promised Willow
I'd tell her kin

689
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,456
how I come to kill her father.

690
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,191
I still have that to do.

691
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,027
I think you ought to let Pa and
the sheriff take care of that.

692
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,862
I'm the one that killed him.

693
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,531
I'm the one
that should tell them.

694
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,500
Well, look, Joe, you can't take
a chance like that.

695
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,903
I wouldn't go near that place
without some help.

696
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,672
It wouldn't mean anything
if I went in there with an army.

697
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,008
Could mean you'd stay alive.

698
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,876
Ah...

699
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,980
Adam, I don't think the Hoads
are a tribe of killers.

700
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,581
Besides, we don't even know

701
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,450
it was one of them
that bushwhacked you.

702
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,648
And I promised Willow
I'd tell 'em face-to-face.

703
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,593
I killed her father, Adam.
I think it's the least I can do.

704
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,162
No, now Joe, you can't.
Now listen to me...

705
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,529
Joe, Joe, come back...!
(groans)

706
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,239
(water splashing)

707
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,375
(hoofbeats approaching)

708
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,809
It's Willow! She's come back!

709
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,142
You let me handle this, boy.

710
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,655
Well, I see you
got away from 'em, girl.

711
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,290
They didn't even try
and stop me.

712
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,424
They just let me go.

713
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,792
Like as not 'cause they knew

714
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,494
I'd come after
'em if they didn't.

715
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,628
You all right?

716
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,130
They didn't hurt you none,
did they?

717
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,499
Oh, they didn't hurt me none.
They give me these clothes,

718
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,167
though, and a lot
of pretty things.

719
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,136
Gram, it was nice there.

720
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,305
The house was big,
real splendid like.

721
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,640
And they got a looking glass
most tall as me.

722
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,942
I'd like to see
something like that.

723
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,036
Not for us. None of that stuff.

724
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,948
This shirt you got on--
a hussy shirt.

725
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,850
Get shed of it, hear?

726
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,852
Oh, I think it's real pretty,
Willow.

727
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,854
You look so different.

728
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,489
I ain't different, Bud.

729
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,757
Not inside, I ain't.

730
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,160
Gram, they was good to me.

731
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,163
Well, they even asked me to come
back and visit anytime at all.

732
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,066
Don't forget, they's the ones
that killed your pa.

733
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,468
And don't you fret, girl.

734
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,801
We're gonna kill the one
that done it.

735
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,188
♪♪

736
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,389
(hoofbeats approach)

737
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,561
Now, who do you reckon
this might be?

738
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,563
Ain't never seen him
before, Dodie.

739
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,032
(horse whinnies)

740
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,207
Little feller, kind of pretty.

741
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,577
Heard it was a pretty little
feller that killed Jeb.

742
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,480
Yeah, but you don't
know this one's him.

743
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,649
Yeah, I do.

744
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,785
Got a feeling in my bones.

745
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,053
Remember what Ma told ya.

746
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,289
Ma ain't here now.

747
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,724
She's back talking to Willow.

748
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,227
Feels like it's up to me
to figure out what to do.

749
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,762
What's that gonna be?

750
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,964
Y'all just wait here and
watch. You'll see.

751
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:38,102
Gonna have me some fun
killing a pretty little feller

752
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,003
that killed my brother.

753
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,082
Looking for somebody, stranger?

754
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,885
Yeah, looking for a
family named Hoad.

755
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,487
Reckon you found 'em.

756
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,290
Is there a woman here
named Grandma Hoad?

757
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,326
She's busy. I'm Dodie Hoad,
you can talk to me.

758
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,795
No, I think I'd
rather talk to her.

759
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,254
Can't. You got something to say,
say it to me.

760
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,371
Yeah, well,
I don't think I will.

761
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,308
It looks to me like you
want trouble and I don't.

762
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,010
Well, now you come this far, it
wouldn't be neighborly I let you

763
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,313
go away without you spoke
your piece, would it?

764
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,016
Well, I'll be back when I can
talk to the right person.

765
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,852
Oh, don't be in
a hurry, neighbor.

766
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,354
Maybe I can help you.

767
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,190
You come here looking for
the man that shot your brother,

768
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,558
ain't that right?

769
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,328
Well, you found him. I shot him.

770
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,065
Now you'd like to shoot me, huh?

771
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,000
You shot my brother Jeb.

772
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,836
Ain't you got a shooting
coming to you?

773
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,106
Your brother Jeb tried
to shoot me in the back.

774
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:52,343
He missed, and I warned him
not to try it again.

775
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,079
He did, and I had to kill him.

776
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,914
There was nothing else
I could have done.

777
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,416
Yeah, I figured it was you.

778
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,215
I felt it in my bones.

779
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:09,994
Now, I'm gonna get on my horse
and I'm gonna ride out of here.

780
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:14,295
And like I said,
I don't want any trouble.

781
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,170
Don't try it.

782
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,197
You raise that gun,
I'm gonna have to kill ya.

783
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:30,871
Now, hold it!

784
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,127
'Twas a trick.

785
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,362
'Twas a trick, after all.

786
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,933
A trick so's you could sneak in
and kill Dodie.

787
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,335
You a fast gun, a killer.

788
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,537
I didn't come here to kill him.

789
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,206
But he was bound he'd kill me.

790
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,836
I warned him,
but he had to try it.

791
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,615
All right,
now I'm warning all of you.

792
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,650
I'm going out of here now.

793
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,954
I don't want anybody
to make a move.

794
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,957
I'll come after you. Never fear.

795
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,459
You can't go far enough away!

796
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,127
You'll die for this!

797
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,188
And your pappy will die
for the trick he played me!

798
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,411
What kind of men are you?

799
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:39,183
That man killed your brother,
and yonder he goes riding free.

800
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,553
What are you standing there
staring for?

801
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,021
Have you water in your veins?

802
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,523
Have you rope for spines?

803
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:50,961
Take your rifles now
and go, do you hear?

804
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,565
I want him dead
and his father dead.

805
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,966
Go now.

806
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,060
Go now, do you hear?!

807
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,541
What do you mean by that?

808
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,110
We're done with killing!

809
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,878
Done with killing?

810
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,981
Dodie was bound
to murder that boy, Ma.

811
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,484
He'd have shot him
in the back if need be.

812
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,520
The boy could have done no less
than what he done and live.

813
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,722
You cowards.

814
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,557
You sniveling...!

815
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,692
(whip cracks)

816
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,994
That man killed
your brother Dodie!

817
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,896
He killed your brother Jeb!

818
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,632
- He murdered them.
- (whip cracks)

819
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,367
Don't that mean nothing to you?

820
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,202
It weren't neither murder, Gram!

821
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,838
They's right! Pa tried
to shoot him in the back!

822
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,006
He tried twice!

823
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,775
It's like John's telling you.

824
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:38,936
We killed enough!

825
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,981
I want that boy dead.

826
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,745
I want him dead now.

827
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,692
I never would have knowed you.

828
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,894
That's how much
you changed, Willow.

829
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,729
The only thing is,

830
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,062
I-I keep thinking you
changed toward me.

831
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,836
I've been living for the day
that we'd... we'd catch up

832
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,704
to you and we could be married,
like we's promised.

833
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,069
Now I'm afraid.

834
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,184
There never was
another man for me, Bud,

835
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,382
and there never will be,
not as long as we live.

836
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,694
I told Gram Hoad that

837
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:35,666
I didn't think we'd ever
live long enough to get married.

838
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,769
I guess I got no reason
to change that now.

839
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:43,173
We done all we could,
you and me and John and Pa.

840
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:46,143
We talked ourselves clear tired.

841
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,613
Maybe she heared us. Maybe not.

842
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:54,551
But if'n she says we got
to fight them, we got to.

843
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,553
We got to do what she says.

844
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,681
You know that.

845
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,500
Make yourselves ready.

846
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,102
We're a-goin' now.

847
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,732
We're a-gonna see the man
that killed my sons.

848
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,730
(whip cracks)

849
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,919
Reckon you know Dodie won't be

850
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,154
giving hisself up
sundown tomorrow.

851
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,989
Yes, I know.

852
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,825
Boy there killed him.

853
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,993
BEN:
I know.

854
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,363
Killed Jeb,
killed Dodie the same way.

855
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,533
He's real fast with a gun.

856
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,502
My son doesn't enjoy killing.

857
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,936
He had no choice.

858
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,473
Two of my sons

859
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,177
killed the same way
by the same man.

860
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,882
Willow saw the first killing,
John and Paul, the second.

861
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,317
They say it was done
the same way.

862
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,117
It ain't easy
seeing two sons killed.

863
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,735
Willow says her pa was gonna
shoot you in the back.

864
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:56,440
John and Paul say Dodie
tried to do the same thing.

865
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,708
I believe them.

866
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,577
They ain't never lied to me.

867
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,413
I believe you done what
any man would have done.

868
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,550
You had to kill 'em.

869
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,954
Reckon I can't
hold no anger again' you.

870
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:27,771
Willow says you'uns got all
kinds of fixings in your house.

871
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,832
Mind if'n I step in to see?

872
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,021
My house is your house.

873
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,013
You're welcome at all times.

874
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,319
