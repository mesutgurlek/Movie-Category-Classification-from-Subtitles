1786
01:30:58,692 --> 01:31:00,859
Isn't she just...

1787
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,194
fairy-tale hot?

1788
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:03,762
Yes, she is.

1789
01:31:06,299 --> 01:31:08,400
You've probably got
the old and the new

1790
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:09,468
and all of that stuff

1791
01:31:09,469 --> 01:31:11,537
but these were
our grandmother's.

1792
01:31:13,073 --> 01:31:16,308
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're--

1793
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:17,810
They're perfect.

1794
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:25,117
I figured she'd want you
to have them.

1795
01:31:25,118 --> 01:31:26,518
You look so pretty.

1796
01:31:28,288 --> 01:31:29,521
Thank you.

1797
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:34,393
I love you.

1798
01:31:37,464 --> 01:31:38,764
Can we have some champagne?

1799
01:31:42,902 --> 01:31:44,636
Uh,

1800
01:31:44,637 --> 01:31:47,239
to the ladies
of Mercy Ranch.

1801
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,376
Through rain, snow,

1802
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:52,911
hell and high water

1803
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:55,014
we made it a year.

1804
01:31:55,015 --> 01:31:57,716
Yeah, together.

1805
01:31:57,717 --> 01:31:58,917
Together.

1806
01:31:58,918 --> 01:32:01,353
You know,
Jack Mercy lived his life hard.

1807
01:32:02,288 --> 01:32:03,789
And he died the same.

1808
01:32:05,558 --> 01:32:06,959
But he gave us a gift.

1809
01:32:08,895 --> 01:32:11,663
And it wasn't this ranch.

1810
01:32:11,664 --> 01:32:13,098
It was family.

1811
01:32:15,135 --> 01:32:16,502
To the best year
of our lives.

1812

LILY:
Cheers.

1814
01:32:22,942 --> 01:32:24,309
I can only take a sip.

1815
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:25,744
Why?

1816
01:32:27,814 --> 01:32:29,048
It's not good for the baby.

1817
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:32,951
WILLA & TESS:
Baby?

1818
01:32:32,952 --> 01:32:34,019
Really?
I'm pregnant.

1819
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,921
Oh, my God.
Oh.

1822
01:32:41,995 --> 01:32:43,295
I can't believe it.

1823
01:32:43,296 --> 01:32:44,296
Thank you.

1824
01:32:46,266 --> 01:32:47,666
No wonder
she wanted a wedding.

1825
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:48,801
Willa.
What?

1826
01:32:50,236 --> 01:32:54,073
You are so damned incredible.

1827
01:32:54,074 --> 01:32:56,108
So are you.

1828
01:33:00,413 --> 01:33:02,514
Oh, my God,
I hope nobody saw that.

1829
01:33:02,515 --> 01:33:03,615
Me too.

[BAND PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC]

1831
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:23,502
Girl, you will never find a band
like this back home.

1832
01:33:25,038 --> 01:33:26,839
To hell with L.A.

1833
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,507
I stay where the story is.

1834
01:33:40,053 --> 01:33:42,021
I told you you were a natural
on the dance floor.

1835
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:45,991
You're pretty much
a natural everywhere.

1836
01:33:45,992 --> 01:33:48,193
I think you're gonna have
to marry me, Willa.

1837
01:33:48,194 --> 01:33:49,361
I don't see no way around it.

1838
01:33:49,362 --> 01:33:51,764
Is that your idea
of a proposal?

1839
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:54,066
You won't get a better one.

1840
01:33:54,067 --> 01:33:56,101
Well, where's the ring?

1841
01:33:56,102 --> 01:33:57,636
You don't wear rings.

01:33:58,805 --> 01:33:59,638
I'll tell you what.
