1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,342
- Hey, morning.
- Hey.

2
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,719
Hey... is that my jacket?

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,722
I left that at Heather's.

4
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,516
All right, Officer Sherlock.

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,117
Yeah, I slept at Mary's the other night.

6
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:19,461
Heather told me to give you this.

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,690
She also told me to give you this.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,234
What the hell you do that for?

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,653
Well, now it's
awkward 'cause I kissed you,

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,588
not 'cause I'm banging

11
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,160
your girlfriend's mom. [clicks tongue]

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,533
You know what, I ain't
gonna be super-interested

13
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,577
in joking about this for a while.

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,245
Look, Colt... [sighs] Sorry
if it's awkward for you,

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,247
but I'm really into Mary.

16
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,208
That being said, you are my brother,

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,085
and if you want me to stop datin' her...

18
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,419
just say it.

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,797
I want you to stop datin' her.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,423
All right, bluff called.

21
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,010
Seriously though, man,

22
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,778
if you want me to give up my chance

23
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,580
at a happy relationship and die alone

24
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,307
just 'cause it makes
you a little uncomfortable...

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,559
you just say so.

26
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,353
Thank you, I appreciate that.

27
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,189
Shit, bluff called again.

28
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,942
All right, look...

29
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,820
if you're serious about Mary,

30
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,477
and you promise not to screw things up

31
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:12,429
with me and Heather...

32
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,243
it's your life, I'm not
gonna be an asshole about it.

33
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,203
Cool.

34
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,580
And for the record,

35
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,539
I give you my
blessing to date her daughter.

36
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,209
Oh, hey, uh...

37
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,587
I heard old Kenny proposed to Abby.

38
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,965
Yeah. Why, you wanna date her, too?

39
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,718
Been there, done that.

40
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,389
So... them getting
engaged, that mess you up?

41
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,975
No... I'm fine with it.

42
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,394
You should've seen the
ring though, too big.

43
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,062
Yeah...

44
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,939
Women hate when things are too big.

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,609
Yeah, and he proposed to
her at the Cracker Barrel.

46
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,694
I mean, who does that?

47
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,697
Uh, lots of people.

48
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,424
Rich Weiner proposed to Allie there,

49
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,557
Jeff proposed to Leslie.

50
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,786
I proposed a
threesome to the Flet sisters.

51
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,539
They proposed I go fuck myself.

52
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,129
Later that night, I took
'em up on that proposal.

53
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,006
Let me ask you a question...

54
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,633
I texted Mary a couple
of times last night,

55
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,384
she never hit me back.

56
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,303
Check this out. Uh, 1:12...

57
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,721
"'Sup, girl? You up?"

58
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,349
Nothing. 1:27...

59
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,686
"You down to clown? I'm around."

60
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,648
Nothing.

61
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,650
1:45, I pull out the big guns, right?

62
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,592
I sent her this video of a cat

63
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:34,095
who's scared of a cucumber. [chuckles]

64
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,532
I mean, how is that not
worth at least one "LOL"?

65
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,349
Apparently, we got different ideas

66
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:40,810
about what the "big gun" is.

67
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,873
- Mornin', Dad.
- Mornin'.

68
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,250
Hey, what time is that buyer comin'?

69
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,170
He's not. I called him off.

70
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,881
- We're not sellin'.
- What?

71
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,259
Cattle prices are at rock bottom...

72
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,513
Anderson sold last week. They
didn't even turn a profit.

73
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,349
We're not gonna sell right now.

74
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,892
We're gonna hold out.

75
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,188
Are you serious? I... When
were you plannin' on tellin' us?

76
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,315
To be honest...

77
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:14,111
If I'm not looking right at
you, I try to forget you're here.

78
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,657
Dad, we don't have any electricity!

79
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,494
[stammers] We gotta
sell. You ever see The Shining?

80
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,599
Jack Nicholson killed his entire family

81
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:25,938
with an ax. You know why?

82
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,374
They didn't have a TV!

83
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,921
Look, we can't afford
to keep the calves.

84
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,798
We can't even afford
to keep the lights on.

85
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,425
What are we gonna do for
the winter, huh? I mean...

86
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,928
me and you, we can eat
Colt. What are the cows gonna eat?

87
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,932
I didn't work my ass off all year,

88
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,518
so I could go in the hole.

89
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,312
We can hold on a little
while, things will turn.

90
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,502
And what if they don't?

91
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,425
Maybe you two can get a second job.

92
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,098
[Colt] Ugh.

93
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,967
There aren't enough hours in the day

94
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,154
to take on more work.

95
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,133
We should take what we can get now

96
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,890
and keep our heads above water.

97
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,743
All right, look, I
don't normally say this,

98
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,244
but Rooster's right.

99
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,248
You know, I don't normally say this,

100
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,417
but I don't give a shit what you think.

101
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,422
You say that all the time!

102
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,178

104
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,835
Damn it.

105
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,423
We both saw that. Colt did it.

106
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,302
[Dale] Beau, you in there?

107
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,554
If I say no, will you go away?

108
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,516
I see you're as chipper as ever.

109
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,434
What are you doin' here, Dale?

110
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,396
I heard that you might be
thinkin' about not sellin'.

111
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
- How'd you hear that?
- Huh?

112
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,441
Said, "How'd you hear that?"

113
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,360
I hear everything.

114
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,989
I think you're makin' a big mistake.

115
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,117
Look, Dale, don't tell
me how to run my business.

116
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,785
I don't tell you how to run yours.

117
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,538
Well, that's all you do! The
last time I was out here,

118
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,873
you tried to tell me how
to castrate a bull.

119
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,044
I'm not gonna sell, Dale.

120
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,505
Look... we're getting
up in age, both of us.

121
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,817
Now I'm 73 years old,

122
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:24,241
and I don't know if you knew it or not,

123
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,344
but I'm beginning to lose my hearing.

124
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,057
Really? I had no idea.

125
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,351
Yeah, it's just a Timex, but thank you.

126
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,278
And look, at your age,

127
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:39,840
do you really want
to take on this fight?

128
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,735
You know, what they're
offering is criminal.

129
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,821
I'm not sayin' you're wrong.

130
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,746
Look, you deserve a lot more,

131
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,017
but a little is better than nothing.

132
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,121
For all you know, the
market might keep going down.

133
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,373
You don't think I know that?

134
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,125
What are you gonna tell me next?

135
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,502
Sky is blue? Water's wet?

136
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,671
Next thing out of your
mouth is gonna be "What?"

137
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,090
What?

138
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,385
Look, just make the sale.

139
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,723
Go inside, turn your power
on, enjoy your family.

140
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,852
If this is your last winter on Earth...

141
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,771
do you want to spend
it without television?

142
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,277
I'm not selling. Say
hi to Charlene for me.

143
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,529
Well, suit yourself.

144
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,992
You know, your gate's busted.

145
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,909
Colt did it.

146
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,123
Mmm-hmm. He also clipped
your mailbox on the way in.

147
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,381
Hey, Ab.

148
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,673
Hey.

149
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,301
[sighs]

150
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,346
You still got time to
take a look at my truck?

151
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,431
[grunting]

152
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,142
Yeah. [sighs]

153
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,893
What was that noise it's making, again?

154
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,395
[mimics engine growling]

155
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,398
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember.

156
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,555
I just wanted to hear you

157
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,383
do that bad impression again. [chuckles]

158
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,570
Why don't you do an impression
of a guy who's not a jackass

159
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,989
and just fixes my truck?

160
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,073
[laughing]

161
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,616
So, what's going on with you?

162
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,244
Well, Dad decided he didn't
want to sell the calves.

163
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,912
Why?

164
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,623
Said he wanted to hold
out for better prices.

165
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,348
Same thing he used to say when I used to

166
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,774
bring over the Girl Scout cookies.

167
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,876
[Colt chuckles]

168
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,213
Well, let's take a
look at that truck, huh?

169
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,339
Yeah.

170
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,175
[grunts]

171
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,553
Look at that rock. Whoo!

172
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,139
Guess that's what Kenny's Marriott
money gets you, huh?

173
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,933
Yeah, he went to Jared. [chuckles]

174
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,445
You know, about the other night,

175
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,253
that wasn't how I wanted it to happen.

176
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,439
What's that?

177
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,552
Me finding out or
you getting proposed to

178
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:45,591
at a Cracker Barrel?

179
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,944
[laughs
sarcastically] It was actually sweet.

180
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,113
And they gave us 20 bucks to
spend in the general store.

181
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,490
We got a big bag of those sour rolls.

182
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,826
- [exhales] So good.
- [chuckles]

183
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,164
Anyway, if it was awkward for you...

184
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,248
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,541
[grunts]

186
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,668
Why would it be awkward?

187
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,920
Well, it was weird for me.

188
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,702
I mean, I didn't expect to get engaged

189
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:08,989
in front of my ex-boyfriend.

190
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,176
- [laughs]
- Although I do have this dream

191
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,822
that I get married to Channing Tatum

192
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,620
in front of every
guy who ever dumped me.

193
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,226
Kenny's a good guy.

194
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,000
He's smart, he's got a great job.

195
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,380
I'm sure he's got one of them 400k's.

196
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,108
It's 401k.

197
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,277
[scoffs] Even better.

198
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,407
Look, you guys are great together.

199
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,691
I think you'll have a long,
happy life here in Garrison.

200
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,586
Unless Channing Tatum shows up

201
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:41,272
to shoot the Colt Bennett story.

202
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,833
- [chuckles]
- Peter Dinklage is gonna play Rooster.

203
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,794
[motorcycle approaching]

204
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,508
Oh, hey, Mary.

205
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,718
Nice hog.

206
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,805
Hey, Colt. You cheatin' on my daughter?

207
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,056
'Cause I will murder you.

208
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,435
No, no. No, no... No,
no. This is, uh, Abby.

209
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,896
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We hang out sometimes.

210
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,357
That does not sound better, does it?

211
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,983
Mmm-mmm.

212
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,985
Hi, I'm Mary. Nice to meet you.

213
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,489
Actually, we've met. I was
Heather's history teacher.

214
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh, yeah! How'd she do?

215
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,411
[smacks lips] Well, she
wasn't my worst student.

216
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,204
I'll take it.

217
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,500
[chuckles] Oh,
damn! Look at that Harley.

218
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,002
I did not think you could
get any more awesome.

219
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,047
Hey, if you can name three
Denver Broncos, I'll marry you.

220
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,836
Peyton Manning, CJ Anderson,

221
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,451
Emmanuel Sanders, Demaryius Thomas.

222
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,094
Whoo! I'm gonna pass out.

223
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,014
Rooster, can we, uh, go inside?

224
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,599
You know we can.

225
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,352
Oh, Abby, by the way... congrats
on that engagement.

226
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,439
Is it cool if I bring Colt's
girlfriend's mom to your wedding?

227
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,774
Uh, okay.

228
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,610
[Mary chuckles]

229
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,487
I have a name, you know?

230
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,072
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

231
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,075
It just pisses off Colt a shit-ton
more when I do it this way.

232
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,620
So what's up? Did you get my text?

233
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,164
My sexy pics come through?

234
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,585
Yes, Rooster, I got the
picture of your balls.

235
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,270
Thank God. I thought I sent it

236
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,822
to the other Mary in my phone.

237
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,801
Sister Mary from Immaculate Heart.

238
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,513
Okay, we need to set a
few ground rules here.

239
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,374
Number one being, don't send me

240
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,291
pictures of your fucking balls.

241
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,998
Yeah, everyone sends dick pics.

242
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:30,422
The Rooster sends ball pics.

243
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,237
'Cause it's funny and sexy.

244
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,990
No, uh-uh. It's stupid and disgusting.

245
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,702
Agree to disagree.

246
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,288
Listen, if you think
you're interested in

247
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,707
and capable of being in
an adult relationship...

248
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,542
- I do.
- Then... Okay.

249
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,254
You say that, but you texted
me a picture of your balls.

250
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,174
I did.

251
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,041
Yeah. Do you... do you see how those

252
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:00,701
two things might not go together?

253
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,180
I don't.

254
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,727
No, I'm kidding. I'm
kidding. But, you know, I mean...

255
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,130
You're asking me to change who
I am, you know? It's like...

256
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,524
you date the Rooster, you get the beak.

257
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,821
I'm fine with the beak. I
just don't want the balls.

258
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,118
You think about it.

259
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,703
If you decide you want to give this

260
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,103
a real shot, you give me a call.

261
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,624
- Wait, you're leaving?
- I got the dinner shift.

262
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,168
You just came over here to talk?

263
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,549
See, that's what...
that's what adults do.

264
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,636
All right, well, before
you leave, can you, uh...

265
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,346
name off a couple more Broncos?

266
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,058
Von Miller...

267
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,645
Brandon McManus.

268
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,564
[chuckling] Oh, my
God. You know the kicker!

269
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,106
[Mary chuckles]

270
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
[country music playing]

271
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,619
[Maggie singing along]

272
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,080
[gasps]

273
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,750
You scared me. Why are you
standing there like a creep?

274
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,294
I like listening to you sing.

275
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,796
That's sweet.

276
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,131
Still creepy, but sweet.

277
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,551
Did you bring the rolls?

278
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,394
Oh, didn't think I had to mention

279
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,079
that they needed to be baked.

280
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,518
But dinner will be in 12 to 15
minutes or until golden brown.

281
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,482
How're you doin'?

282
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,150
I called off the calf sale.

283
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,446
Whoa. You sure you wanna do that?

284
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm not sure about anything.

285
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,284
I'm dead tired.

286
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,080
Boys have been working
hard. They deserve a break.

287
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,125
Don't tell 'em I said that.

288
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,921
I won't, but you should.

289
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,173
They need to hear that you
think they did a good job.

290
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,925
I'll put it in my will.

291
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,514
They think I should sell.

292
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,474
Dale thinks I should sell.

293
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,445
Based on your reaction,

294
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,920
I guess you feel the same way.

295
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,817
Maybe I'm just being stubborn
in my old age.

296
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,819
In your old age?

297
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,810
Beau, you've written in Ronald Reagan

298
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,138
the last three elections.

299
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,911
My gut's telling me to hold out longer.

300
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,583
Then trust it. It's gotten you this far.

301
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,588
What about us, Mags?

302
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,049
You comin' home?

303
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,431
Okay.

304
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,435
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,478
Maybe it's time to give it a shot.

306
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,315
Even if you are a broke old man.

307
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,570
We said in our vows
for richer or poorer.

308
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,239
No, we actually didn't say vows.

309
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,201
I read a poem by Robert Frost,

310
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,620
and you said, "Yep."

311
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,624
I still feel the same way today.

312
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,376
Do you?

313
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,629
Yep.

314
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,471
Sorry I didn't answer your texts.

315
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,727
I had my phone on silent

316
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:32,413
'cause my sister was passed out.

317
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,725
I didn't wanna wake
up her baby. [chuckles]

318
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,102
If you add a pick-up
truck and an American flag,

319
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,187
you get yourself a
country song. [chuckles]

320
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,522
Can I ask you something?

321
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,982
Yeah, what's up?

322
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,068
Just... you were acting kind of weird

323
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:44,884
after Kenny and Abby got engaged.

324
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,681
Is there something going on there?

325
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,159
No. Me and Abby is just friends.

326
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,413
Yeah, but you kept saying they
don't belong together and...

327
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,376
I just don't think you were talking
about the chicken and waffles.

328
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,003
Look, there's nothing
going on with me and Abby.

329
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,212
I'm just saying,

330
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,131
if you saw me acting like
that with an old boyfriend of mine,

331
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,298
you'd have some questions.

332
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,780
No, I wouldn't. I'd believe you

333
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,743
when you said there
was nothing going on.

334
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,970
So just drop it.

335
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,848
All right, it was just a question.

336
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,643
- You don't have to be a dick.
- [scoffs] I'm not being a dick.

337
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,769
I'm in a great mood.

338
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,194
My ex-girlfriend got engaged.

339
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,837
The ranch's running out of money.

340
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,497
My brother's dating my girlfriend's mom.

341
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,983
Old Colt's doin' great!

342
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,986
All right. You know what?

343
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,113
I hope you are upset about
them gettin' engaged.

344
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,406
Otherwise, you're just an asshole.

345
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,617
I'm not upset.

346
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,619
I swear, I'm just an asshole.

347
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,085
- [Rooster pounding at door]
- Colt, wake up.

348
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,958
Dad, wake up. Get your ass out of bed.

349
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:45,945
This is not a drill.

350
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,676
This better be North
Koreans, or I'm shooting you.

351
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,220
What the hell? Is it fire or zombies?

352
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,056
If Rooster got bit, don't
wait for him to turn.

353
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,473
Just shoot him now!

354
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,269
What are you doing sleeping
out on the porch?

355
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,647
I don't like vomit in
my own bed, smart guy.

356
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,732
This better be good.

357
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,026
I was horseback
riding with Channing Tatum.

358
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,863
Why'd you wake us up?

359
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,120
Listen, "State of emergency declared

360
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,141
after EPA spill in Animas River."

361
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,828
- [Maggie sighs]
- Let me see that.

362
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,205
I can't read that.

363
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,624
Keep going.

364
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,862
Uh, says the EPA was trying to reinforce

365
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,777
the dam, and they screwed up and...

366
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,334
they spilled a couple million gallons

367
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:28,697
of poisonous sludge in the river.

368
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,133
God, thousands of ranchers draw water

369
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:32,659
from that Animas River.

370
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,220
Those poor people.

371
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,682
Damned disaster. Could be good for us.

372
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,726
- I know, right?
- [Colt] Yeah, it is.

373
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,853
Why?

374
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,320
Nobody's gonna buy their cattle

375
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:46,547
off contaminated grounds.

376
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,192
Yeah, of course.

377
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,070
So?

378
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,658
- So our calves are gonna be worth...
- A lot more money!

379
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,619
Yeah, way ahead of you, Dad.

380
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,788
That's a tough way to make
it but we need the money.

381
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,707
This looks like a real mess.

382
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,873
But, hey, we're
still gonna throw a party

383
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,484
when we sell the calves, right?

384
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,713
Oh, we'll do a little something.

385
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,047
[Colt laughing]

386
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,633
Man, we're gonna have money again.

387
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,342
Hear that, little buddy?

388
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,427
We're gonna fix you up real good.

389
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,179
I'm gonna buy separate shampoo

390
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:19,330
and conditioner. [chuckles]

391
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,392
Fuck you, Pert Plus. [laughing]

392
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,358
- [tapping]
- Excuse me.

393
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,445
- [tapping]
- Excuse me.

394
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,824
I know we're all
having a good time, but...

395
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,535
I'd like to take a minute and
acknowledge all the ranchers

396
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,621
that are affected by the spill.

397
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,749
Let's just be thankful we came down

398
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:46,566
on the side of grace on this thing.

399
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,005
Yeah, and hopefully, the EPA will
step up. But, in the meantime,

400
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,540
10% of every drink
you buy over at my bar

401
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,491
will go out to help these folks.

402
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,054
Finally, reason to feel
good about my drinking.

403
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
[Mary chuckles]

404
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,432
We don't pay.

405
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,850
Shut up, Colt.

406
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,395
Hey, Mom. This is Mary.

407
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,856
Hi, Mary, nice to meet you.

408
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,358
Hi, you, too. Your son is great.

409
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,535
The son I'm dating.

410
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,803
Not the son who's dating my daughter.

411
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,698
He's... he's great, too.

412
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,032
Small towns, huh?

413
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,326
[chuckling]

414
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,578
- Dad, you guys know each other.
- Hey, Mary.

415
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,206
Yeah, between the Cracker
Barrel and the bowling team,

416
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,412
first time I've ever seen you

417
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:27,730
without your name on your shirt.

418
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,878
- [Mary] Oh.
- Wow, look at that tie.

419
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,380
Yeah, just got it. Now I got three.

420
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,425
One for funerals, court... and other.

421
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,136
I might have mentioned

422
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,930
- it's time to grow up a little.
- [chuckles] Well...

423
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,265
Hey, then I'm already a fan of yours.

424
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,027
Now, can you tell him that crumbs

425
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:46,877
left in his beard are not leftovers?

426
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,145
Ah...

427
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,939
Don't you think he'd look
good without the beard?

428
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,316
[laughs] All right, you
guys are done talking.

429
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,403
There's Abby and that little guy.

430
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,033
His name is Kenny. You've
met him a dozen times.

431
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,994
Don't care and won't remember.

432
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,081
How you doin' there... Kenny?

433
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,250
- Hey.
- Hey, Abby.

434
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,210
- Sir.
- Congratulations, you two.

435
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,586
Aw, we're really excited.

436
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,339
Oh, come on, tell me the
story. How did he ask you?

437
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,300
Oh, well, it's not the
most, uh, romantic place.

438
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,635
We were at Cracker Barrel.

439
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,013
Oh, well, who the hell am I to judge?

440
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,590
Beau started his proposal to me with,

441
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:26,124
"Oh, before I forget."

442
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,772
Got the job done. Am I right... Kenny?

443
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,275
- Yeah, Beau.
- Mr. Bennett will do.

444
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,818
Yes, sir.

445
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,780
You all have fun.

446
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,907
Especially you... Kenny.

447
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,702
- [both chuckle]
- Your ex-boyfriend's family's so cool.

448
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,329
Yeah, they're great.

449
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,750
I didn't even know Mr.
Bennett knew my name.

450
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,294
It's awesome.

451
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,882
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh... hey, Mom.

452
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,550
You know what, it's weird.

453
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,053
I always thought you and
Abby would end up together.

454
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,972
Yeah, well...

455
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,391
shit happens.

456
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,145
I also thought I'd have
four Super Bowl rings by now.

457
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,897
Two MVPs.

458
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,191
A Nationwide commercial.

459
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,651
[in sing-song] "Colt Bennett's
so damn handsome."

460
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,907
It's okay to be upset about Abby.

461
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,571
It's hard to shut the door on someone

462
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:26,810
you've loved for a long time.

463
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,831
But, darling, you don't
wanna miss what's right here

464
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,333
because you can't let go of the past.

465
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,877
I'm glad I've only had a six-pack.

466
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,402
I'd like to remember some of that.

467
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,342
Well, look who's here, Heather.

468
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,574
You must not have screwed it up too bad.

469
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,292
How'd you know I screwed it up?

470
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,181
You, a girl... Just playin' the odds.

471
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,558
That's fair.

472
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,185
Got any motherly advice for me?

473
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,624
- Don't fuck it up again.
- [chuckles]

474
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,609
- Hey.
- Hey.

475
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,115
I'm... I'm really sorry.

476
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,076
Yeah, you should be.

477
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,371
I'm glad you came.

478
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,415
I wasn't gonna miss
this over a little fight.

479
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,420
Plus, my sister's kid was
having a tantrum and...

480
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,752
I figured if I have to
deal with a screaming child,

481
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,880
it might as well be you.

482
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,133
You've got yourself
another country song.

- Look...

I, uh...

485
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,114
The thing with Abby caught me off guard.

486
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,269
My feelings for her are all in the past.

487
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,983
If you were around 15 years ago,

488
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,964
maybe you'd have
been my first girlfriend.

489
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,691
Hmm.

490
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,860
Except, 15 years ago I was eight.

491
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,657
Hey, math is still not my friend.

[Heather chuckles]

493
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,787
- Look, neither one of us want drama so...
- Yes.

494
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,664
Why don't we just start being
honest with each other?

495
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,333
All right, agreed. Which reminds me...

496
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,253
the other night, when you
were storming out of that bar...

497
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,629
Mmm-hmm.

498
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,423
I checked out your ass.

499
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,841
- [laughs] You're such an idiot.
- Yeah?

500
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,677
- Yeah.
- [Colt exclaims]

501
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,054
He's at the ten!

502
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,682
He's at the five. Touchdown, Bennett!

503
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,809
Kenny and Abby go wild.

504
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,979
God, this family is cool.

505
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,315
Do you think I should grow
a mustache like Mr. Bennett?

506
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,566
No.

507
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,530
- Congratulations, Beau Bennett.

It's good you trusted your gut.

509
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,160
It just proves I should
never listen to anyone.

510
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,746
Everything proves that to you.

511
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,542
God, what a year, huh?

512
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,544
Colt comes home...

513
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,129
all of our rough spots...

514

the ranch.

515
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,468
Feels good to get a win.

516
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,595
Well, you deserve it.

517
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,806
We both deserve it.
It's your ranch, too.

518
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,309
Oh, thanks for saying that.

519
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,770
I love you, Mags.

520
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,689
I love you, too.

521

Hey, now that everything's
turned around, you know...

522
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,612
all we have to do is fix our kids.

523
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,989
What do you mean?

524
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,920
Well, somebody's gotta make them

525
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,849
into mature responsible adults.

526
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,744
One miracle at a time.

527
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,326
I think I'll go back to the Airstream

528
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,066
and I'll get my stuff together.

529
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,335
Need a hand?

530
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,124
No, I... You got Rooster, and Colt,

531
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:24,570
and a whole bunch of alcohol.

532
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,540
Somebody better stay here and make sure

533
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,949
the place doesn't burn down.

534
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,182
You're all right, Hank?

535
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,893
Been better.

536
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,605
I lost my job at the EPA today.

537
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,444
Man, that was a fun day.

538
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,782
Yeah... we deserve
it after such a shit year.

539
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,785
It wasn't that bad. You
know, I came home this year.

540
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,079
- I said what I said.
- [Colt chuckles]

541

I don't understand why we're
wastin' time talking to each other

542
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,586
when we can be inside making
quality time with the new TV.

543
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,550
You know, I ask an
awful lot of you boys.

544
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,262
[sighs] Fact is...

545
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,888
I couldn't have done it without you.

546
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,017
Thank you.

547
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,854

rancher in the state.

[Colt sighs]

- It tastes different.
- It's the good stuff, that's why.

552
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,703
Nah, it ain't the whiskey.

553
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,122
I mean drinking while happy.

554
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,500
I got something for you.

555
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,346
My championship ring?

556
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,306
Oh, that's cool.

557
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,891
Fifteen years of free
labor, I never abandoned you,

558

I don't need nothing.

Dad...

560
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,359
you didn't have to do this.

561
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,363
I know the calf sale went
well and all, but...

562
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,367
you shouldn't be throwing
around this much money.

563
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,202
All right, I wasn't
gonna say this but...

564
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,622
the guy at the pawn shop
threw that in with the TV.

565
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,960
I'm just kidding you. I paid for it.

566
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,256
But it was heavily discounted.

Well, if someone would
learn how to catch a ball.

582
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,659
