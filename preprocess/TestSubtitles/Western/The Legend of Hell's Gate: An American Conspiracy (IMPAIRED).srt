1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,721
[Man]
Run!

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,758
Hurry!

3
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,151
[grunts]

4
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,355
Come on. Up.

5
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,990
Come on!

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,836
[cocks]

7
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,004
[gunshot]

8
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,514
[horse whinnying]
They're still shooting
at us!

9
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,222
Go!

10
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,565
[Man]
There's a boat!

11
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,966
Hey, get on that boat!

12
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,279
- [grunts]
- Let's go! Let's go!

13
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,352
Grab that paddle,
Jimmy!

14
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,622
Grab it! Let's go!
They're following fast!
They're coming!

15
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,257
They're following close!

16
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,228
[cocks]

17
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,036
It's moving.

18
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,540
Go get me the Sharps
with the sight. Now!

19
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,912
I'm gonna do this right.

20
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,349
[panting]

21
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,619
I'm gonna get your gun.

22
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,071
Maybe it's an omen.

23
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,874
Just seems like bad luck
or something, you know?

24
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,677
There ain't never been
nothing like this.

25
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,779
[sighs]

26
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:38,151
If I don't claim it now,
some other asshole will
and take the fame.

27
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,954
And Snyder didn't pay
for nothing.

28
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,625
I'm telling you, Mooar,
it ain't right.

29
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,194
Frankly, I feel
I walk away right now,

30
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,763
you'll come back
and claim it yourself.

31
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,843
[cheering]

32
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,120
[cheering continues]

33
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,624
Thank you! Thank you!

34
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,959
We'll be right back.

35
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,295
You can have
some more pictures.

36
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,864
[Man] John Mooar!
Little business here.
We'll be right back.

37
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,433
I'll tell you what,
Mr. Mooar.

38
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,302
You put this place
on the map.

39
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,937
I want you
to meet a fella.

40
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,506
He's the one
who led me to the white.

41
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,608
He's a big old boy,
ain't he?
Isn't he?

42
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,477
[chuckling]
Come on inside.

43
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,112
I got plans.

44
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,191
This is a lot of money
for tracking an animal.

45
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,994
So how about a drink?

46
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,797
Snyder, Texas.

47
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,600
That's got
a good ring to it.

48
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,570
He can run your whiskey
up to Granbury.

49
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm not sure I trust Barkley
to do it.

50
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,176
No. I got 12 jugs
of moonshine, homemade.

51
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,811
The best there is.

52
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,081
Can you get it
all in your boat?

53
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,949
Yes.
Good.

54
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,752
Then I'll send Barkley
to tell Gordon...

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,854
to meet on the river
in three days.

56
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,190
- You come back
with the payment.
- I agree.

57
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,095
This ought cover
the shipping costs.

58
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,664
That's a lot of money too.

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,701
Boys, come on.

60
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,970
If you don't mind,

61
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,306
I'd like folks to think...

62
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,875
it was shot
with my father's rifle.

63
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,422
I'll have Barkley
load up the whiskey.

64
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,626
Barkley!

65
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,495
Come on!
We'll load up some whiskey.

66
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,597
[Man]
If I could trouble you
for a few more photographs.

67
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,232
Sure.

68
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,334
[ Man ]
John!

69
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,137
[cheering]
Oh!

70
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,173
[Mooar]
Excuse me. We're gonna
take some more photographs.

71
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,144
Picture, please?
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,713
Please step back.
Make room for
the camera, please.

73
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,348
Thank you.
Step back, please.

74
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,917
A little more.
A little more.

75
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,654
Excellent. Hold that.

76
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,924
[cheering]

77
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,380
Hey.

78
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,219
[sighs]
Good God.

79
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,723
Mm-mmm.

80
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,292
I got some confessing
to do anyway.

81
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,029
I can think of a few things
gone awry.

82
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,401
I don't think I've seen
such a pretty girl...

83
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,905
since last time I saw
your sister in Spokane.

84
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,642
[Man]
...my whole life.

85
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,211
Charlie Austin,
him and his colored companion--

86
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,714
I want him found,
and I want you
to punish him.

87
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,919
You get revenge
for me and my daughter.

88
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,721
[Man #2]
If you want us to do it,
it's gonna cost you.

89
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,692
If we can do it without force,
won't be much.

90
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,561
All it takes
is one little bullet,

91
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,130
and, bang, double the price.

92
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,071
[Man #1]
Now where did she go?

93
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,173
I can assure you,
we will try to avoid that.

94
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,611
Like I said,

95
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,947
we fire our guns in town,
it's twice the pay.

96
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,582
That's the deal.

97
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,056
We're going to Dallas, boys.

98
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,092
[Men laughing]
I'm real sorry
about your daughter.

99
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,902
Two thousand dollars
for "Champagne" Charlie Austin!

100
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,873
- [Men whooping]
- [gunshots]

101
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,508
Hyah!
Hyah!

102
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,061
[bell tolling]

103
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,908
[footsteps approaching]

104
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,082
[sighs]

105
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,520
[Irish accent]
Can I get a bottle
of whiskey down here?

106
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,491
My own mouth
is trying to kill me.

107
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,695
Pardon me.
Bottle of whiskey.

108
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,965
Anything brown water
whiskey'd be nice.

109
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,468
Ya Irish prick.

110
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,373
Oh, Lordy.
Bless you, darling.

111
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,176
Mmm. Mmm!

112
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,045
[coughing]
Hey!

113
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,847
What the hell is that?
Turpentine.

114
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,950
What are you doing?

115
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,986
Don't drink any more of that.
It was supposed to be a joke.

116
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,621
Yeah, well, I was hoping
it'd kill me.

117
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,358
[chuckles]
You know, there is
a dentist in town.

118
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,694
Yeah, well,
I think doctoring...

119
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,197
is no better
than petty sheep thieving,

120
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,832
which I used to be
really good at.

121
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,803
Isn't the dying man
gonna ask my name?

122
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,941
Pardon me. You are?

123
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,043
Katherine.

124
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,780
Well, Nurse Katherine,

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,583
can I offer you a taste?
[chuckles]

126
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,685
Ladies don't drink whiskey.

127
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,087
I like that.

128
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,422
But I bet you're lying.

129
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,028
[exhales]

130
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,831
Well, Jim,
[chuckles]

131
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,933
Doc Seegars is not
too far away from here.

132
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,502
I'm sure he could fix
that dreadful tooth.

133
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,071
I could walk you over there
if you like.

134
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,443
You're kindly persuasive.

135
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,750
Let me pay the man.
[coins clinking]

136
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,917
Shit.

137
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,362
Shall we?
Lead the way.

138
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,698
Thanks for nothing.

139
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,238
[James] You know,
what say we just go back
to my place at the Cherry?

140
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,106
I don't want you
to have a toothache...

141
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,975
when you escort me to dinner
this evening.

142
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,610
Oh, we got dinner plans
this evening?

143
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,478
Unless you have someone else
to take.

144
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,449
I'll see you
at the St. Charles
in a couple hours, Jim.

145
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,850
See you then, Nurse.

146
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,222
Oh, sweet God in heaven,
Lord God help us.

147
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,534
Hello?

148
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,971
Mister-- Or, uh, Dr. Seegars?

149
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,606
[Man, slurring]
He's not here!

150
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,278
He's away for the month to, uh,

151
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,146
wherever the hell.

152
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,650
You need some teeth made?
We don't do that anymore.

153
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,285
No, I'll just keep
my teeth, thanks.

154
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,920
He's gone for a month?

155
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,788
I'm afraid so.

156
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,759
- You're a dentist, then?
- Aye. Dr. Holliday.

157
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,095
That's what they put
on the sign.

158
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,430
I got a tooth that's trying
to put me under.

159
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,065
Well, have a seat.

160
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,269
Let me just grab
some equipment.

161
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,714

00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,623
Good boy.

323
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,594
Will, go around
the other side.

324
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,163
You see Austin come back
in here, you kill him.
You got that?

325
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,666
No. Nobody killing
the boss man.

326
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,104
Tower!

327
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,608
[Woman screams]
[Man shouts]

328
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,644
Greg! Greg, help me, Greg!

329
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,213
[Austin shouting]

330
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,016
Get up!
Katherine, what the hell
are you doing?

331
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,885
I'll talk with you later.

332
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,687
- Tower!
- He's dead!

333
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,957
[gunshots]
Y'all need to put down
your guns!

334
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,293
Tower!
[gunshot]

335
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,432
You gonna be next,
bastard, unless you drop
your gun!

336
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,767
What the hell you doing?
Put a bullet in him!

337
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,935
I ain't killing anybody!

338
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,606
Katherine, come on!
We gotta get you outta here!
Come on now.

339
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,343
I've gotta get him
off the street!
Damn it! Leave us be!

340
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,446
- [Charlie]
Let me go!
- No, no, baby.

341
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,482
We gotta get you
out of here.
Come on! Get up!

342
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,518
[Holliday]
Greg, help! Greg!

343
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,555
You've been lying to me
since the moment I met you.

344
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,124
I'm sorry. Help!

345
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,927
Over here!
He's trying to kill us!

346
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,262
Get your hands up!

347
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,065
You two grab him.
Get your hands up!

348
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,167
So y'all looking
for Austin, huh?

349
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,569
Well, you found him.

350
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,437
You ain't even Austin.

351
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,707
I am now.

352
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,809
[gunfire stops]
He's out.

353
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,882
- Get your hands up!
- [gunshot]

354
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,685
[gunshots]

355
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,889
[cocks]

356
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,523
- Where's Tower?
- Dead!

357
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:31,062
[crying out]

358
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,237
[groans]

359
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,106
Come on.

360
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,857
[gunfire continues]

361
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,483
Gonna have to head up
into that brush soon.

362
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,586
We can't outrun them
in this wagon.

363
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,987
But I didn't
do nothing wrong.

364
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,388
I shouldn't be
turning off nowhere.

365
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,023
Listen here, friend.

366
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,359
I ain't stopping,
so you can get off
any time you like.

367
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,695
Yeah, but I was
on here first.

368
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,096
Come on!

369
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,600
Look. This ride
came equipped with a sh--

370
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,534
Shit!

371
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,972
Damn it! Hold on!

372
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,278
Hey.

373
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,614
That wheel ain't
gonna last much longer.

374
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,183
What are you doing?
They're right behind us.

375
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,489
Quite a distance,
but it's that stage.

376
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,825
Let's go.
Hyah!

377
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,927
You wanna come with me,
you can.

378
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,262
If you are, get your ass
out of that seat.

379
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,897
Shit!

380
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,337
[two gunshots]
[horses whinny]

381
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,577
Come on out, you cowards!
I got no gun!

382
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,446
Show yourself!

383
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,015
You wanna be quiet?

384
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,117
I had to shoot the horses.

385
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:10,088
Shot the horses?
Are you out of your mind?

386
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,424
It'll draw too much attention
to ourselves...

387
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,694
if we ride into town
on somebody else's
branded horses.

388
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:20,131
Well, we're not exactly
in town, are we, Will?

389
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,233
That there
is the Brazos River,

390
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,737
and on the other side of it
is Granbury.

391
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:29,007
I tell you, your fella
in this Granbury...

392
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,342
better put some money
in my pocket real quick,

393
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,912
'cause I don't kill people
for it.

394
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,547
I don't kill people
for it.

395
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,583
Your gang shot up
the whole place.

396
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,787
That ain't me.
Do you understand?

397
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,692
When we get to town,
my friend can help us out.

398
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,794
But if you go back
to Dallas,

399
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,597
you're gonna have
a real hard time talking
your way out of a noose.

400
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm just still trying...

401
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,903
to grasp just exactly
what the hell happened there.

402
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,407
All I know is
I gotta get my money back.

403
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,677
I have to get my money back.

404
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,545
Who am I to say you can't?

405
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,684
But we both know you ain't
never gonna see it again.

406
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,786
Come on. Let's get moving.

407
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,187
Just gotta swim across.

408
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,494
Can't do it.

409
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,596
What do you mean,
you can't do it?

410
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,398
Can't do it.
Not gonna do it.

411
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,201
Well, if you don't swim
across it, you're gonna
have to go around.

412
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,836
You know how long
you'll be walking for?

413
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,471
Two minutes ago,
I had a horse.

414
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,573
I told you, when we get to town,
my friend Benson...

415
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,675
can get us horses, ammo,
whatever we need.

416
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:41,646
Can't do it. Can't do it.

417
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,682
[chuckles]

418
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,952
You can't swim.

419
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,390
You job-stealing
son of a bitch,
you can't swim.

420
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,492
I can't swim?

421
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,397
I'll see you in town, Will,

422
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:03,368
but I better get
some real money, real quick.

423
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,937
Here I go.

424
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,105
Mm-hmm.

425
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,440
I'm gonna get in there.

426
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,842
[grunts]

427
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,579
[water splashing]
Oh, it's freezing.
All right.

428
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,915
All right.
I can't swim.

429
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,352
[chuckles]

430
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,958
[James, indistinct]

431
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,461
[Will]
Will you just try to swim?

432
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,031
Come on. Help me.
Come on.

433
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,666
Come on. Here we go.

434
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,702
Come on.
Move it on there.

435
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,206
[men whooping]

436
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,074
Let's go.

437
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,278
Shut up.
Watch your line.

438
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,986
[pins clacking]
[Man]
Past the line!

439
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,088
[Men shouting]

440
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,161
[Man]
Come on, come on.

441
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,599
Knock 'em down!
Right now. Let's go.

442
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,467
Knock 'em down.

443
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:15,306
I never interfere with a man
while he's bowling.

444
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,343
[Man] Come on, brother.
Knock them down.
Knock them down.

445
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,912
[Men shouting]

446
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,350
Come on!

447
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,722
[grunts]

448
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,057
- [clack]
- [Men groaning]

449
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,663
You're losing us money!
Get back! Damn it!

450
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,298
Come on!

451
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,502
I might just place myself down
for a game today.

452
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,071
Take on you and Spears.

453
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,341
I'm not gonna stand here
and let you lose it for me,
you bastard!

454
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,677
Ah. Here's one.
If you would
stop screaming--

455
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,246
"As he was valiant, I honor him.

456
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,217
But as he was ambitious,
I slew him."

457
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,487
Caesar. Easy.

458
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,589
Well, well done.
I'm gonna
slap your face,

459
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,691
my brother, Lord help me.

460
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,260
I would love the challenge,
but I'm enlisted to the bar.

461
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,662
I could use some help.
[men shouting]

462
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,530
[cocking]

463
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,464
Kid?

464
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,333
Whoa.
[cocks]

465
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,340
Damn it!

466
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,077
Ten-Pin Alley will be closed
the rest of the day!

467
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,347
I do not condone killing...

468
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,383
over wagers on my property.

469
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,420
Take it outta town!

470
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,463
Will you have Stillworth
clean this mess up?

471
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,565
Of course.

472
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,368
I'll be at the saloon
this evening.

473
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,171
[Man]
What about my $16?

474
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,974
[Man #2]
What aboutmy$16?

475
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,411
Funny thing, those two
were on the same team.

476
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,214
I'll see you
in the bar, kid.

477
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,402
Hyah!

478
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,905
I told you, Charlie,
if you want my carrots,
get them at the store.

479
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,343
Throw your legs over.
Throw your legs over.

00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,445
Come on.
Put your weight on me.
[groaning]

481
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,080
I got you. I got you.

482
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,416
Grab his hat, Maggie.

483
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,219
My whole right side...

484
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,087
feels pretty numb.
Right here.

485
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,189
What can I do?
What should I do?

486
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,226
Nothing.
I'm just gonna hold his head.
He's fine.

487
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,029
Hey, hey, hey!
I got his head.
He's all right.

488
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:55,233
Dad! Messed all over
the storefront, Moon!

489
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,802
Just step aside, Tompson.
Step aside.

490
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,437
Someone's gonna
clean this up.
I'll clean it up.

491
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,838
I got it.
No. No, Maggie.

492
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,473
You get yourself something
nice for your birthday.

493
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,276
Go ahead. Please.
Go on now.

494
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,612
It's gonna be all right, Johnny.
They're gonna fix you up, okay?

495
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,181
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,582
I'm sorry about
your birthday, Maggie.

497
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,918
It's okay.
Come on. Let's go.

498
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,553
Can you walk?
Yeah.

499
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,655
Watch your head.

500
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,757
You'll be all right.

501
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,326
[birds twittering]

502
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,728
Hey, Maggie.

503
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,465
Got these birds in
from Tennessee.

504
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,801
You wanna take a look?

505
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,610
Dad!

506
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,647
Got a mess out here!

507
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,085
Just have to put
a little pressure on it now.
[groans]

508
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,354
Moon,

509
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,624
I don't see you in town much.

510
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,493
How's your family?

511
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,062
My son had a fall.
Broke his arm pretty good.

512
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,566
Well, you know Doc Bates
isn't a medicine man.

513
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,201
He's a doctor of the Lord.

514
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,536
I didn't ask you
to come in here, Gordon.

515
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,806
[Gordon]
The building is mine.

516
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,609
I just came by to collect
from the good doctor here.

517
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,346
It's gonna take
a good long while
to heal.

518
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,981
I don't have anything
for pain right now,

519
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,017
but I might have
a little laudanum.

520
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,652
Yes, sir.

521
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,791
Can you sit up?

522
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,659
Gotta sit up.

523
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,462
How those horses
working out for you, Moon?

524
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,199
I got your payment for you,
but I need to get them oats
you promised me.

525
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,834
I need them today.

526
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,936
I tell you what,
why don't you take Kelly here?

527
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,739
And he'll lend a hand for you,

528
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,943
seeing as how your son
is in-- incapacitated.

529
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,578
I'm obliged to you.

530
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,148
I'll be back in town
day after tomorrow.

531
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,250
I'll have some trade
with me.

532
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,819
Mr. Gordon,
I'm supposed to be working
at the saloon tonight.

533
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,556
Well, now you
are helping him.

534
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,359
[Gordon]
Come by later in the evening.

535
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,694
Oh, and, Moon,

536
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,329
never a day goes by...

537
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,599
where my heart doesn't mourn
for the loss of your wife.

538
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,037
Don't you ever mention my wife.

539
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,475
Johnny, you're gonna
need to keep that arm
elevated, okay?

540
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,278
You know what that means?
All right?

541
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,015
The break was really clean,
but it's gonna take a long time
for that bone to heal.

542
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,650
You understand?

543
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,752
Yes, sir.
Okay.

544
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,788
All right.
Thank you, Doc.

545
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,657
I haven't forgotten
what you done
for me, Jones.

546
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,058
Go ahead. Get that door.

547
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,115
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

548
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,254
- It's pretty, right?
- That dress is expensive.

549
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,122
It comes from New York City.

550
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,859
I was just admiring it.

551
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:18,436
That man was killed by Indians
just outside this town.

552
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,472
So you're gonna
have to forgive
my store policy...

553
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:25,209
when I don't do business
with savages.

554
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,611
Even half-breeds.

555
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,647
Miss Abigail Peterson,
you come right on in.

556
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,983
You know, I got
that lace in you ordered.

557
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,085
You are just gonna die.

00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,688
You good to walk
back to town?

563
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,359
Make sure you put those bags
in the barn, too.

[door opens]

565
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,629
Well, it's not raining outside.

566
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,731
You two look smarter
than to bathe
with your clothes on.

567
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,768
But I'll leave explanation
to imagination.

568
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,804
Consider the first one
on the house.

569
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,439
That's very kind of you.

570
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,410
Not at all. I'm obliged.

Uh,

00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,621
as Shakespeare said,

"So wise so young,
they say do never live long."

576

Well, I'll pretend
I know what that means.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Mmm! All the way down.

00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,839
Again, I suppose.
For us.

580
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,642
Sorry, friend.
We can't afford to be buying
bartenders drinks.

Tsk, tsk, friend.
On me.

The last bottle
of Gordon's favorite.

God knows
where it comes from.

Can't say I ever drank
with a barkeep before.

Well, gentlemen,
we're not exactly
overrun here.

[clears throat]
I'm feeling a bit under myself.

I could use the medicine.

We're looking
for a friend of mine.

597
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,450
He's dead.

Buried at our cemetery.

I find that hard
to believe.

But I appreciate
the offer.

603

some horses while
we're here in town.

Well, see,
that there would be me.

Another round.
It's been quite a morning.

614
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,397
So you say you got horses,
is that right?

615
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:21,572
Yeah, I-- I--
I got some horses, sure.

616

I just, um--

00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:27,878
Look, I don't
have them personally.

618
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,652
Now, y'all men up
for details?

619
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,754
Cancel them drinks.

for your bullshit, kid.

Get Dr. Bates!

I'm not gonna lie
to you, John.

628

tastes terrible.

I'll be a moment.

You heard him. Move.

and out of consciousness

that what I'm saying
to you is truth.

680

And I'm telling you this,

my friend,

682
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,466
because when I go,

I want a clean slate.

I need to go now.
No. Wait.

was found
at the theater, John.

My secondary shot...

01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:52,374
My eyes see three white men.
Why does one hide?

1119
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,345
- He is not hiding.
- No, he was just tired.

I'll bring him.

Thank you.

[panting]

1134
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,150
It's a-- It's a snake.

1135
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,420
I killed it.

1136
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,690
Yeah. He came over here,

1137
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:45,193
and I killed him
with my knife.

1138
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,398
- I hate snakes.
- Hate snakes.

How's that fish?

[Kelly]
Oh, it's--
It's real good, actually.

1143
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,791
So that right there
is a really fine animal
you got.

1144
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:20,929
Where are your horses?

1145
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,965
The horses, they died,

because--
because we ate them.

[Will]
What, uh--
[snorts]

1149
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,009
What my friend meant to say
was that, uh,

1150
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,447
we had some horses
grow sickly,

1151
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,016
and we had to put them down.

1152
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,986
We would like
to trade you for your mule.

1153

These are beautiful beads.

Very fine beads.

01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,276
Yeah. Very beautiful.

1169
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,947
Okay. Why don't you
have a look at those?

Ooh.

That's okay, Kelly.

Why don't you stay here...

and explain
to these fine gentlemen...

You know,
you would never believe it.

We were at the ridge.

You know, back up a ways,
only about a mile out.

1182

You'd never im-imagine...

1183
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,683
what we--
[sighs]
ran into.

1184
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,953
But it was a herd of cougars.

1185
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,522
I never seen anything
like it in my life.

I mean,
I really liked that horse.

01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,164
And we had to
be carrying these furs.

And it was a good horse.
That's enough.

as the sun beats down
on our faces,

1201

[quietly]
Yes. We're trading
the whiskey.

1202
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:10,732

out of your share.

That's fine. It is.

are the fires from hell...

from the heavens.

you will become
a fierce warrior.

it tastes like you're dying,

it's Christmas morning...

They wouldn't just leave me!
They wouldn't just--

will take us to them!

How much further
are you leading us up here?

1274
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:12,680
It'll be faster
if we cut through
those canyon walls.

1275
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,921
It's not as easy
as it looks, Will.

1276
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:23,658
It's too much to get down there.
We'll have to go
all the way back around.

[blusters]

If we go around,
we'll have no cover.

1279
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,402
Them Indians
are gonna find us.
We're too overloaded.

1280
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:37,438
We're sitting too heavy.
We'd have to leave
some of the load here.

1281
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:42,810
We leave nothing.
We hit that break in the canyon.

1282
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,146
We're sitting ducks out here.

Shit!

1286
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:03,831
You were being
too damn careless!

[sniffles]

1288

just up ahead here.

[twigs snap]

Wait.

1291
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,216
Banshee?

1292
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,157
No.

1293
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,194
Move.

1294
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,511
Hey-- Hey--
Stupid! Stupid!

1295
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,679
Damn it.

1296
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,350
You're a madman, Will.
Here!

1297
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,452
You're a madman if you think...

1298
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:34,489
that we can carry all of this
through that opening...

1299
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,890
before those Indians
catch up to us.

1300
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,693
We'll be dead in an hour's time.

1301
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,496
Are you hearing me?
We gotta move, Will!

1302
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,831
Those Indians
will scalp us dead,

1303
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:46,167
and you're trying to lead us
into the gates of hell!

1304
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,269
We can carry it!

1305
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:53,174
That money--
That money that was stolen
from me in Dallas...

1306
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:55,276
had been in my pocket
for four days, Will.

1307
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,779
For four days.
I stole it from a man
sleeping on a train.

1308
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:02,750
I don't work on the railroads.
I work the railroads.

1309
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:06,254
The money's gone.
The money's gone,
but you know what?

1310
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,356
- I'm still here.
- I don't care!

1311
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,626
Don't you understand?

1312
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,728
Everything that we leave here...

1313
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:15,129
is like leaving gold
in the grave,

1314
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,932
and I will go
through the gates of hell...

1315
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,735
before I let them Indians
take me down,

1316
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:21,903
and so will you.

1317
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,442
Now, pick it up,
and let's move on.

1318
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:41,522
You got three bullets
in that gun, Will.

1319
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:44,091
I don't think you're going
to use any of them on me.
