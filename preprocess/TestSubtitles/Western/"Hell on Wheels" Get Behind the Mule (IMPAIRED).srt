00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:41,421
Yes, if you and Bohannon
would dispense with the mutual

169
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:44,308
pettiness, you might be favored
with greatness.

170
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:46,009
Where is Mr. Bohannon?

171
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:47,594
It's a few hours early
for his deadline,

172
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,846
but I have a bottle of bourbon

173
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,982
and a box of cigars
I'd like to open.

174
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:53,536
Well, I'm afraid
we will have to mark

175
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:56,486
this milestone
without Mr. Bohannon.

176
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,155
You all missed quite
an adventure.

177
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:02,159
Masked bandits turned our town
into a shooting gallery,

178
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,362
before snatching Mr. Bohannon
and dragging him away.

179
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:06,676
With your permission, General,

180
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,198
I'll telegraph the fort
and order

181
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,000
more troops for your escort.

182
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:13,537
I killed one of his abductors
at close range,

183
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,372
and I also managed
to save a child.

184
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:17,758
We were outgunned,
plain and simple.

185
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,293
We did everything we could
for Mr. Bohannon,

186
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,046
even at great danger
to ourselves,

187
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,081
especially Mr. Durant.

188
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,803
Now let me show you
to your room, General.

189
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:31,521
And what can I get you
to drink?

190
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,590
Bourbon, madame.
A double.

191
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,400
He has until 6:00.

192
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:44,434
There's still time.

193
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:54,327
You got any last words,
you be a man.

194
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,046
Say 'em to me, not my daughter.

195
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,664
You done enough to Naomi.

196
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,917
Been doing some hard thinking.

197
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,419
I wanna make things right.

198
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,888
You were my guest.

199
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,174
I gave you shelter.

200
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,142
And you repaid the kindness

201
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,261
by stripping
my most beloved daughter

202
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:13,647
of her chastity and virtue.

203
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,016
Now she'll live this life
in shame

204
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,702
and spend eternity
in outer darkness.

205
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,238
No God-fearing man
will have her.

206
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:24,207
I'll have her.
I'll marry her.

207
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,609
If she'll have me.

208
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:28,445
No. I will not
let her be a party

209
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,281
to your coward's attempt
to escape justice.

210
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:33,667
I ain't a coward, sir.

211
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:37,454
I'm that child's father.

212
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,339
I'll stay here at Fort Smith

213
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:40,340
till the child's born
and our first crops

214
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:41,875
are in the ground.

215
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,094
Now, you have my word:

216
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:46,763
I'll give them a good
and honest life.

217
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,466
I ain't never broke my word
to you for ill or naught,

218
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,551
and you know that.

219
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:55,439
She was my joy.

220
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,357
She could have married a bishop

221
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,726
or an apostle.

222
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:02,729

would have been proud

223

to call her his wife.

224
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,735
But now...

225
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:13,573
her only suitor is a gentile.

226
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,575
And a killer.

I will seek counsel.

228
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,974
But the bishop's word is final.
