00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,713
Does this, uh, George
Linder guy live here alone?

169
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,980
No. Apparently, he has
a wife and a daughter.

170
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:46,512
And where are they?

171
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,080
I don't know yet.

172
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:51,980
It's not clear if the
family's still together.

173
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,179
Ferg.

174
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,579
Why don't you go ahead
and call the hospital?

175
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,312
Make arrangements for an autopsy.

176
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:59,279
[Sighs]

177
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,412
Do you need the number?

178
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,713
No. I got it.

179
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,380
Still.

180
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,646
Cady: Can we talk?

181
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:16,279
Why am I guessing this
isn't a personal visit?

182
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,346
Yeah. [Chuckles]

183
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:18,813
So, um... Here's the deal.

184
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:20,913
My dad was gonna go to Denver with me

185
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,646
to help with Henry's case,

186
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,646
but, um, he got called away on this murder,

187
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,647
so I have a backup plan.

188
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:32,446
Most professional private investigators

189
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,080
cost about $75 an hour.

190
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,546
I'm looking to hire one

191
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:38,446
to do 24 hours of investigation in Denver.

192
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:44,112
Covering expenses and travel,
that will come to about $2,500.

193
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:49,279
So you want me to loan you
more money to help Henry's case?

194
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,579
And hopefully, um, give
a P.I. recommendation.

195
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,646
The trial's in six weeks, and I really need

196
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,279
to track down this Darius guy.

197
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,914
He's my only alternate suspect.

198
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:03,579
[Sighs]

199
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,579
What do you think?

200
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,479
I think I'm a little offended.

201
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,112
I'm sorry. I...

202
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,245
Why are you asking me for money?

203
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,880
Why not just ask me to help?

204
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,512
You feeling okay?

205
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,479
Yeah.

206
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,312
It's just a little frustrating

207
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:30,212
looking for a bullet
casing in an alfalfa stack.

208
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,379
Sheriff!

209
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,913
That's close enough! Why were there
convicts crawling all over my land today?

210
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,779
'Cause I asked them to give me a hand.

211
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,479
Isn't this George Linder's farm?

212
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,046
George farms here. The land's mine.

213
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,379
And you are?

214
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,813
Nick Holman. Is there something wrong?

215
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,814
I wouldn't be here if there wasn't.

216
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,813
Is that George?

217
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:52,713
Yeah.

218
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:54,312
Someone shot him.

219
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:57,080
Well, I suppose that could've been anybody.

220
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:00,237
George was always sparring
with suppliers and creditors

221
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:02,004
just about every other day.

222
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:02,970
Money problems?

223
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:04,271
George was pretty handy.

224
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,061
But he didn't have the business sense

225
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,271
that God gave a 2x4.

226
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,363
He ever spar with you?

227
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,403
No.

228
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,370
George paid his rent... barely.

229
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,869
But he paid it.

230
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,403
What about his wife and his daughter?

231
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,804
They live around here?

232
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:18,103
Oh, yeah.

233
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:21,070
Dawn and Cassie, they
live here with George.

234
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:24,204
Well, give them my condolences.

235
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:35,574
Well, either George's wife and daughter

236
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:38,673
are out of town and don't know he's dead

237
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:41,207
or they do know he's dead
and they've already left.

238
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,322
Or maybe a psychopath
is holding them hostage

239
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:44,991
and blown their heads off.

240
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:48,840
You think you should take a break?

241
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,673
After what you just went through?

242
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,340
No. But I do think

243
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:55,240
people should stop acting like
they can tell me what to do.

244
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,873
I'm not telling you what to do.

245
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,973
I'm offering you a break, if you want it.

246
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:02,973
The last thing I need is another Deputy

247
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:05,973
whose mind is only halfway on the job.

248
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,873
[Vehicle approaching]

249
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,007
Vic: Who's that?

250
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,615
What do they want?

251
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,575
Are you George Linder's wife?

252
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,608
Yes, I'm Dawn.

253
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,641
Are you here to evict us?

254
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:27,007
No, ma'am.

255
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,441
No, I'm here because someone's been shot.

256
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:30,808
Who?

257
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,942
Well, I'm afraid it was your husband.

258

Hey! Hey!

[Tires screech]

261
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:47,441
Lock the doors and windows, Cassie,

262
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:48,741
and get the rifle!

263
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:51,782
Do you want me to get the Colt, too?

264
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,556
- Here.
- Ma'am, what are you doing?

265
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:54,923
- Getting ready!
- For what?

266
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,339
Nick Holman!

267
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,739
We just talked to him. He
said to send his condolences.

268
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,005
Well, you give him a message from us!

269
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,206
He may have gotten George,

270
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:04,539
but there are still two more of us left,

271
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,912
and he is not getting us off
this land without a fight.

272
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,739
George and I met while working
for Nelson Holman, Nick's dad.

273
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,654
Mr. Holman leased us this
house and all of this land

274
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:22,292
so that we could start our own farm.

275
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,877
Mr. Holman sounds like a good man.

276
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,676
He was.

277
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:30,877
And we thought Nick was,
too, until Mr. Holman died.

278
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,277
Cassie?!

279
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,676
Where are you?!

280
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:35,144
You know what? I'll go find her.

281
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,676
[Sighs]

282
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:41,010
So, what happened when
Nick took over from his dad?

283
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:44,044
He decided that his
dad's farm wasn't enough.

284
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,843
He wanted ours, too,

285
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:49,177
but the will said that he had
to honor the terms of our lease.

286
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,077
Of course, Nick found a loophole.

287
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:54,439
Our contract didn't say anything
about guaranteed water rights,

288
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,506
so he started charging us as
much as he could for water.

289
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:00,606
We're paying double our
rent just to water our crops.

290
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,973
That has to be tough.

291
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,188
Me and Cassie drive out twice a month

292
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:06,040
to clean rich folks' homes

293
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,873
from Teton Village down to Aspen.

294
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:11,572
We make ends meet.

295
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,339
Well...

296
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,339
I'm sorry for your loss.

297
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,239
We're farmers.

298
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,907

way of life after a while.

Hey, Ruby?

- Hmm?
- Where's Branch?

302
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:33,506
Oh, he went off to
Denver with your daughter.

303
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,773
Said he was gonna help
her out with Henry's case.

304
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,539
Oh. That's surprising.

305
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Oh, you got visitors.

306
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,906
Glad you finally showed up, Sheriff.

307
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,406
Hello again, Nick.

308
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,339
Hey, Ty. What are you doing here?

309
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,973
I'm George Linder's insurance agent,

310
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,439
and Nick was insistent
that I come by and make sure

311
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,839
that George's life-insurance
policy was being expedited.

312
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,472
George also just died, so
maybe show some respect.

313
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:04,789
How about this... you show some respect,

314
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,482
and I'll conduct business
over here in the real world.

315
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,215
What sort of business?

316
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,382
The deadline for George's
rent is midnight tonight.

317
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,482
Now, I'd like to direct
the life-insurance payout

318
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:18,215
to the rent rather than evict the family.

319
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,450
So, if you could inform me now

320
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,172
what recommendation you'll be making

321
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:22,374
on George's death certificate,

322
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,174
I can start the paperwork on the payout.

323
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:28,232
I haven't got any autopsy results yet.

324
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:31,833
Until then, I won't be
recommending anything.

325
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,166
Vic, could you show Ty out?

326
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,634
Nick and I need to talk.

00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,621
your water bill is due in 10 days.

498
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,122
This is not the time.

499
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:26,456
Oh, yeah, that's right, Sheriff.

500
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:28,923
Yeah, we must be decent. Right?

501
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:30,556
Okay, how about this?

502
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:34,389
I won't press charges
for the threat on my life!

503
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,022
Hell, I won't bill Dawn for
the hole in my windshield!

504
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:41,490
Maybe I'm a decent guy after all! Huh?

505
00:24:41,491 --> 00:24:43,223
How about that?

506
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:45,357

508
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:10,957
Did you find David Ridges?

509
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,523
No.

510
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:15,823
I couldn't find the girl either.

511
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:18,824
The girl who sent you
the disappearing picture?

512
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:23,413
Yeah, it must've been one of
those apps that lets you send

513
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:26,379
texts and photos that erase themselves.

514
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:28,813
Like Snapchat or something.

[Chuckles]

516
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:32,623
You don't believe me.

517
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:34,523
I hope that you can see why it might be

518
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:36,456
a little difficult for me to believe

519
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:39,523
that a dead man photo-bombed
you in a self-erasing picture.

520
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:41,528
So, then, I'm hallucinating?

521
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:43,890
Wouldn't be the first time.

522
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:47,256
Branch, you see David Ridges everywhere.

523
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:49,989
This is the bar where the
guy who murdered my mother

524
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,923
used to hang out..

525
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,442
We're supposed to be figuring out
who else could've been involved.

526
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:56,290
Your mother's dead, Cady.

527
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,590
I'm still alive.

528
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:05,556
Okay.

529
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:09,991

You heard Nick.

532
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:21,623
The water bill's due in 10 days,

533
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:23,690
and our checking account's empty.

534
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,323
That means I have to
harvest as much as I can.

535
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:29,289
It's gonna be pretty hard
to keep this farm running

536
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,189
if Nick keeps taking your best equipment.

The starter's not kicking in.

541

[Sighs]

543
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:46,957
All we have to do

544
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:49,490
is sell enough of the crop
to pay this month's bills.

545
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,909
And then once dad's life
insurance kicks in,

546
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,656
we should be okay.

547
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:55,490
So you know about the
life-insurance policy.

548
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:59,690
Yeah. Everybody's got life insurance, right?

549
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:00,890
Right.

550
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:02,389
When you and your mother

551
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,428
first heard about your father getting shot,

552
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:07,500
you went for a rifle and a Colt.

553
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,199
Now, this is the rifle.

554
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,134
I was hoping I could also
take a look at that Colt.

Um, no.

Uh, a .38.

559
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:21,861
Your father was shot with a .38.

560
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,128
Did you ever find that Colt?

Hey, Vic.

you weren't sure if he and
Dawn were still married.

Old George, he was a gentle soul.

600
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,593
Dawn's a bit on the harsh side.

601
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,759
Sort of a natural-born judge.

602
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,492
How about executioner?

603
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,126
What do you mean?

604
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:11,860
Could Dawn kill someone?

605
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:13,392
Yeah. Sure.

606
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:16,659
If they were coming
after George and Cassie,

607
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,293
she might get angry enough to do it.

608
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,826
You ever see this anger?

609
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:25,659
When George, um... George...

610
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,693
When George what?

611
00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:33,160
Old George tried to kill
himself a few years back.

612
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:35,327
Dawn was pissed off.

613
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:39,459
At him, at the doctors... everything.

614
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,227
George was suicidal.

615
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:46,526
That damn Nick Holman was
squeezing him for more money.

616
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:49,293
George came to me and
the other boys and said,

617
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:52,426
"I can't afford to keep you on any longer."

618
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:55,693
Then he swallowed a
bunch of sleeping pills.

619
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:58,327
Dawn found him, called the ambulance.

620

She just couldn't imagine
what George was thinking,

But what do I have to look forward to?

629
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:34,759
It's not the worst idea, you know?

630
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,026
Cutting your losses and...

631
00:32:37,027 --> 00:32:40,359

Now you listen to me, Bob.

633
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,726
You're not the first man
that's thought that way.

634
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,759
Plenty others have stared over the edge

635
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,394
of that particular cliff.

I promise you, I will dig you up myself

638
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:00,227
and kick your ass up
and down Durant square.

Cady: Thanks for picking
me up at the train station.

642
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,601
So, you left your car in Denver?

643
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,960
Yeah, I was kind of in a rush.

644
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:22,926
Did you find out anything
about this Darius guy?

645
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,960
Nope. But Branch thinks
he found someone else.

646
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,659
Let me guess... David Ridges?

647
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,659
Ding, ding, ding.

648
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,093
We were at a bar,

649
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,759
and... and he starts suddenly going on

650
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,492
about how some person texted
him a picture of himself

651
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,860
with David Ridges in the
background at the bar.

652
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:39,325
Was there a picture?

653
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:41,327
No. [Scoffs]

654
00:33:41,328 --> 00:33:44,827
Has he hallucinated before?

655
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,693
When I went to visit him in the hospital

656
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,060
after he was shot,

657
00:33:51,061 --> 00:33:53,492
he thought that I was David Ridges.

658
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:55,526
Okay, and what'd he do?

659
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:57,960
He attacked me.

660
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:59,426
Did you tell Walt?

661
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:00,593
No.

662
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:02,793
I was hoping that it
was just the medication,

663
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:03,893
but then this happened.

664
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:05,860
I don't know. I...

665
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,392
when I look him in the eyes,

666
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:12,627
all I see is this dark, mean, unstable man.

667
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,693
Okay.

668
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:20,359
Please just have him
call the Sheriff's office.

669
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,027
- [Door closes]
- Thanks.

670
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,626
Where's Vic?

671
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:28,426
Not here.

672
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:30,185
How'd those alibis check out?

673
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:32,452
Well [Clears throat] Dawn
Linder refused to give us

674
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,018
the numbers to any of her clients.

675
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,552
She was afraid that she'd get fired

676
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:38,185
if a Sheriff's Deputy called,
asking about a murder alibi.

677
00:34:38,186 --> 00:34:39,885
And Nick Holman?

678
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:42,152
He said he was too busy to talk nonsense.

679
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:44,885
So we've got three murder
suspects without alibis.

680
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:46,851
Actually, there's a fourth suspect

681
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,951
- we haven't been talking about.
- Who?

682
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:50,118
George Linder.

683
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,851
The dead guy?

684
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:55,018
Turns out, he tried to kill
himself a few years ago.

685
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,218
Maybe he tried again and succeeded.

686
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:58,752
Someone found him.

687
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,818
Shot him in the back to
make it look like murder.

688
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:04,652
I get why someone would
try and make a murder

689
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:07,552
look like a suicide,
but the other way around?

690
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:11,385
Well, suicide would cancel
George's life-insurance payout.

691
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,485
An unsolved murder wouldn't.

692
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,218
So, which one of them do
you think found and shot him?

693
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,752
I don't know.

694
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:21,229
But both the victim's
family and Nick Holman

695
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,053
had their eyes on that insurance money.

696
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,786
We need to get a warrant

697
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:28,496
and search both of their
properties for a Colt .38.

698
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:29,326
Yep.

699
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:43,281
Thanks for coming out on such short notice.

700
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:46,148
I'll take any excuse to
get out of the office.

701
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:48,810
Have you determined the
nature of George's death yet?

702
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,615
Not yet.

703
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,715
But there's bound to be
good news for you either way.

704
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:56,114
Appears George was shot with his own gun.

705
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:59,381
Suicide would invalidate his policy,

706
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:02,482
so your company wouldn't
have to pay out the $220,000.

707
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:03,849
It can't be suicide.

708
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,281
How could George shoot himself in the back?

709
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:09,014
So you read the
confidential autopsy report.

710
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:11,548
It's a small town. People talk.

711
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:13,215
Uh-huh. Well, um...

712
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:16,482
That must mean that
George was actually killed

713
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:17,748
by a family member.

714
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:21,482
Now, Dawn is the main
beneficiary of the policy.

715
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,749
When she's arrested,

716
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,649
that should save you a lot of money.

717
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,849
Dawn didn't kill George.

718
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:28,516
How do you know that?

719
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:30,883
Dawn and Cassie were out of town.

720
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:34,317
That means it must've been your friend...

721
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:35,849
Nick Holman.

722
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,683
He's always had his eye
on taking over this farm.

723
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:41,783
He seems pretty comfortable
taking George's property.

724
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:46,250
Maybe he took George's Colt, as well...

725
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:48,950
And shot him with it.

726
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:51,649
Maybe George had an accident?

727
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,683
Maybe he dropped the gun.

728
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:56,616
See, if it was an accident,
the Colt would be here.

729
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:57,683
It wasn't.

730
00:36:57,684 --> 00:37:00,783
It's not at his house either.

731
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:04,816
I'll tell you what I did find at his house.

732
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:06,616
George's cellphone.

733
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:09,916
You were the last person he called.

734
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:13,216
Phone records say the
call lasted for 12 minutes.

735
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:17,216
Were you trying to talk him
out of another suicide attempt?

736
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:19,749
He swallowed sleeping pills the first time.

737
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,749
We haven't run a tox screen yet
to see what it was this time,

738
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,116
but I could call the hospital
right away and ask for one,

739
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,849
- and...
- No.

740
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,050
Don't.

741
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:34,050
It was the sleeping pills again.

742
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,783
George, wake up!

743
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,849
I'm calling the ambulance!

744
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,683
Too late.

745
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:42,950
I took all of them.

746
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:46,050
You're a good friend, Ty.

747
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:47,683
You were right.

748
00:37:48,824 --> 00:37:51,136
I did it all wrong the last time.

749
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:53,050
Walt: What did he mean?

750
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:55,317
When he first tried to kill himself,

751
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:57,683
I tried to talk some sense into him.

752
00:37:57,684 --> 00:37:58,950
What'd you tell him?

753
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,231
That if he killed himself,

754
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:03,950
Dawn and Cassie would never
collect on the insurance policy.

755
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,250
What I meant was that suicide
wouldn't solve anything.

756
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,050
But he heard something different.

757
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:12,209
- I want you to shoot me.
- What?!

758
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,449
After I'm dead, so it looks like a murder

759
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,350
and my girls can get that money...

760
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:20,083
just like you said.

761
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:27,250
Get rid of the pills and
the gun when you're done.

762
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:30,950
I'm asking you as my friend.

763
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:34,216
This is the only way I...

764
00:38:34,217 --> 00:38:37,351
This is the only way I can save the farm.
