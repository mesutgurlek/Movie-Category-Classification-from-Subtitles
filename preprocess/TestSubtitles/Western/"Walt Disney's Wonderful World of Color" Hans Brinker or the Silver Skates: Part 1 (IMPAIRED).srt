1
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,238
[narrator] Hans Brinker
was a Dutch boy

2
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:09,180
who lived in a small village
by the Zuider Zee.

3
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:12,616
His story takes place
about 100 years ago.

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,917
In those days, Holland had
all the quaint characteristics

5
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,255
we have come to think of
as typically Dutch.

6
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,353
All the charm and the beauty
captured and passed on to us

7
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,864
in the paintings
of the great Dutch masters,

8
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:29,561
such as Vermeer, Ruisdael,
and Rembrandt.

9
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,107
Here, in the fishing village
of our story,

10
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:38,542
the men pursued
their livelihood on the sea

11
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:42,048
for six hardworking days
each week.

12
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:46,211
But on the seventh,
they took their folks to church.

13
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:49,722
And that is where they'd been
on the particular Sunday in spring

14
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,724
when our story begins.

15
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,319
Among the good burghers
on their way home from Sunday Mass,

16
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:59,331
was a humble family
of fisherfolk called Brinker.

17
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,731
What a wonderful day for a sail.

18
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,168
- On Sunday?
- Why not? We've been to church.

19
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:07,206
- We can go to the coast for a picnic.
- Please, Mother.

20
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,765
All right.
l'll pack a basket lunch.

21
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:13,404
- May l invite Hilda van Gleck?
- [Raff] Of course.

22
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:18,115
Do you think the burgomaster
will approve?

23
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,050
Why shouldn't he?

24
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,053
Good day, Mevrouw.
Burgomaster.

25
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,787
We wondered if Hilda
would like to come sailing.

26
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:30,625
- May l, please?
- No, it's out of the question.

27
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:33,894
Besides, we're taking coffee
with the Schimmels.

28
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,959
- l'm sorry, Hans.
- So am l.

29
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:40,495
- Come in, Hilda.
- Another time, perhaps.

30
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,381
l would have liked to have
gone sailing with Hans.

31
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:57,548
lt's right that you're polite
to persons like the Brinkers,

32
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,649
but you must not
associate with them.

33
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,685
Why not? They're decent, honest folk
and it's fun to be with them.

34
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:07,164
Father means you should choose
companions from your own class.

35
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,965
Oh, Mother. l suppose he means
someone like Ludwig Schimmel.

36
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,868
He bores me.

37
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,874
l much prefer the company
of Hans Brinker.

38
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,311
[man] Ahoy! Ahoy there!

39
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:37,288
* [accordion playing]

40
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,786
Have you ever heard people say
that the Lord created the earth,

41
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,833
- but the Dutch made Holland?
- No.

42
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,698
Well, once upon a time,
all the land where we now live

43
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,135
was covered by water.

44
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,468
Then our
great-great-grandfathers came

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,440
and decided to take it from the sea.

46
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,136
- Take it from the sea?
- Yes.

47
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,579
First, they built a big dike, like this,
to keep the ocean back.

48
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,640
Then they used windmills
to pump the water out,

49
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,948
so they could raise crops
and build towns

50
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,784
- where the sea used to be.
- lt's called the watcher.

51
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,348
Because it always keeps
both eyes open, watching the sea.

52
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:44,363
But sometimes a storm drives
the waves over the watcher,

53
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:48,424
- so they built a second dike.
- lt's called the dreamer.

54
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,799
lt's only half awake,
until it's needed.

55
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,600
But then it stands there,
holding the water back.

56
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,641
And that one?

57
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,802
That last one
is called the sleeper.

58
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:02,712
lt just lies there, snoozing
like our old cat in front of the fire.

59
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,683
But if the sea ever broke
through the two other dikes,

60
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:09,813
the sleeper would wake up
and save us from being drowned.

61
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,619
Now you understand what
people mean when they say,

62
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,389
''The Lord created the earth,
but the Dutch made Holland.''

63
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:21,232
- Let me see.
- lt's not very good.

64
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,637
Well, l don't know much about it,
but l think you have talent.

65
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,972
l want to learn.
l want to be a good artist.

66
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:35,140
Then you shall be. They say a man can
do anything if he puts his mind to it.

67
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,082
- Now, what about a race?
- Good. Where?

68
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,552
Over the dike, around the windmill
over there, and then back.

69
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,885
- l'll get back first.
- You mean you'll try.

70
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,857
Get ready. Go!

71
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,998
[bleating]

72
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,303
[cows mooing]

73
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,322
[clucking]

74
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,383
Beat him, Father!

75
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:52,152
That wasn't fair.
You pulled me back.

76
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,386
l can't let you beat me yet.

77
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:57,225
- [boy crying]
- [girl] Father, come quickly!

78
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,563
Yes, you see what can happen
if you don't keep a close watch.

79
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,707
The sea is our friend
because we live by it.

80
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,937
But it could also be our enemy,

81
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,105
and if we are not careful,
we might die by it.

82
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,813
We better be starting for home.

83
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,480
Even on Sunday,
the devil can brew a storm.

84
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,288
lt's time you two went to bed.

85
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,904
Otherwise, you'll be sleepy
for school tomorrow.

86
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,304
Just a little while longer, Mother.

87
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,899
- [thunder]
- [Raff] Gretel...

88
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:47,003
[mother] To the loft, both of you.

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,514
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.

90
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:00,659
- [Gretel] Good night, Father.
- Good night.

91
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,464
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.

92
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,470
Good night, Father.

93
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,063
Don't forget your prayers.

94
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,442
[thunder]

95
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:29,588
Metje, have you seen
all these drawings Hans has made?

96
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,489
- l've seen them.
- Don't you think they're good?

97
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,960
Perhaps, but he should be
learning a useful trade,

98
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,088
not wasting his time
making pictures.

99
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,496
Wasting his time?
He wants to be an artist.

100
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,798
Holland has too many artists,
all poor.

101
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,670
lsn't that better than being
a poor fisherman, like his father?

102
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,971
l'm serious, Raff.
l'm worried about Hans.

103
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,604
Gretel will be all right.
She can cook and sew.

104
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,740
She'll find a husband.
But what will be the future for Hans?

105
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,011
l think a man should work
at what he enjoys.

106
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:02,282
l want our children to have
a better life than we've had.

107
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,084
But we are getting along fine.

108
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:07,251
Now, perhaps. But when
winter comes and fishing is poor,

109
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,693
there will be hardly
enough to eat again.

110
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:14,165
Metje, you don't have
to worry anymore.

111
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:17,226
l've been keeping
a surprise for you.

112
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,665
- [thunder]
- [Tiel] Mother.

113
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,736
- Mother, what is it?
- Oh, darling. Did it frighten you?

114
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:30,146
Oh, it's such an awful weather.

115
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,740
Come, darling.

116
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,685
See? See how it rains.

117
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,154
lt was so loud.

118
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:41,855
Look.

119
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,657
[coins jingling]

120
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,664
Where did you get
all that money?

121
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,927
For years, ever since
Gretel was born,

122
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,799
whenever l made an extra guilder,
l put it aside.

123
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,304
First, l filled my tobacco pouch.
Then a sock.

124
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,604
And now, do you know
how much we have?

125
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:57,768
No.

126
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:00,836
- Exactly one thousand guilder.
- Oh, Raff.

127
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:04,111
Now you don't have to
work so hard in your old age.

128
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:07,448
l like to work. Who would want
to sit and just do nothing?

129
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,215
This is for you and the children.

130
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:14,989
lf Hans wants to be an artist,
all l ask is that he's a good one.

131
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,723
- Where are you going?
- To hide this where it's safe.

132
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,861
Now you're going to bed, darling.

133
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,200
Like...

134
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,167
that.

135
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,832
- Now, you go to sleep.
- [knocking]

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,311
[Kaps] Raff! Open up!

137
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:43,445
Kaps, come in.
You, too, Peter.

138
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,984
What brings you out
on a night like this?

139
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,392
The dike at Sloterdam has broken.

140
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:53,091
- They need men to repair it.
- Let's get started then.

141
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,135
- May l go, too, Father?
- Why not? Get dressed.

142
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,205
They say it's the worst storm
in 40 years.

143
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,744
The waves are breaking
over the seawall.

144
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,911
[Raff] Hurry up, Hans.

145
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,118
[thunder]

146
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,661
[man] Put your backs into it, men!

147
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,289
[wind howling, waves crashing]

148
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,203
[man] Keep them coming!

149
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,880
More bags.

150
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,489
Ah!

151
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,529
- [Hans] Father!
- [thud]

152
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:05,094
[Hans] Help!

153
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,739
After him!

154
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,696
[man] He's hurt bad.

155
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,472
Fortunately, the skull wasn't broken.

156
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,916
l think he will be all right in time.

157
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:56,614
When they brought him home,
he didn't even recognize us.

158
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,156
That should pass soon.

159
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,853
Of course, he has to be
in bed for a while.

160
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:05,389
l'll look in again this evening.

161
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,764
Peter and l will be glad
to share our catch with you

162
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,928
till Raff is on his feet again.

163
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,198
Thank you, Kaps.
You are a good friend.

164
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:16,571
But we'll get along.
Raff managed to put something aside.

165
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:19,702
That's good. We fishermen
live from hand to mouth.

166
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,406
Come on, Peter.

167
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:27,483
You mustn't worry. l'll take
the Sea Beggar out tomorrow.

168
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:34,654
We must ask the good Lord
to make your father well again soon.

169
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:38,026
[narrator] But as the weeks
went by, Raff didn't improve.

170
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:42,329
He could sit by the window now,
but he was listless and vacant.

171
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,164
His memory was gone,

172
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:48,037
and with it any recollection of his
savings and their secret hiding place.

173
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,507
lf we could only find
the money your father hid,

174
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,510
we'd have more than enough
to live on.

175
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,637
Why don't you ask him again?

176
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,944
Perhaps he'll remember this time.

177
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,287
Raff, it's me, your wife.

178
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,297
Darling, do you remember
the money you saved?

179
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,968
- Money?
- Yes. A thousand guilders.

180
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:21,132
You hid them in a leather bag
the night of the big storm.

181
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,606
Storm?

182
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,702
You took it into the storeroom,
but we can't find it.

183
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,179
We searched everywhere.

184
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:32,274
You must have hidden it well.
Where is it?

185
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,779
Love, do you understand?

186
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:41,384
Where is the money
in the leather bag?

187
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:46,758
You must remember.
We need the money desperately!

188
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,766
[sobbing]

189
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:59,167
Don't cry, Mother.
Please don't cry.

190
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,703
l'm sorry.

191
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,147
You eat your soup.
You must be hungry.

192
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,546
[narrator] Summer and fall went by,

193
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,952
and somehow
the Brinkers survived.

194
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:11,421
But then...

195
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,117
[wind blowing]

196
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,922
to make matters worse,
winter, bitter and severe,

197
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,361
came very early that year.

198
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,271
Hans quit school,

199
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,807
for though he was
too young for a steady job,

200
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:33,402
the responsibility for his family's
support now rested on him.

201
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,573
No job was too lowly
nor too hard.

202
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,810
There were five mouths to feed,

203
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:42,217
and the medicines for his
sick father were costly.

204
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,017
[shouting, laughing]

205
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:01,029
Hans, wait!

206
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,843
l haven't seen you for a long time.
Where are you going?

207
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:07,845
l'm taking wood to the tavern.

208
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,437
How's your father?

209
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,575
Much better, thank you.
He's able to sit up now.

210
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,483
That's good.
l missed seeing you.

211
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:17,078
When are you and Gretel
coming back to school?

212
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,990
Not for a while. We have to
help out till Father's on his feet.

213
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,255
l hope you're keeping up
with your drawing.

214
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,389
l've been too busy fishing all summer
and now doing odd jobs.

215
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,194
You mustn't give up your drawing.

216
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:31,293
There are so many artists
much better than l'll ever be.

217
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,703
You're too modest.
My father's bought a lot of pictures,

218
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,402
and l don't like them
as well as yours.

219
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,445
Promise me that no matter
how difficult it is,

220
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:43,107
you won't give it up.

221
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,150
l'll keep on with it then.

222
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:49,312
Hilda, l thought you
were coming with us.

223
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:50,548
Just a minute, Ludwig.

224
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,921
lt was good to see you again.

225
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,584
Yes.

226
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,595
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

227
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,667
Too bad about
Hans's father, isn't it?

228
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,672
- But he is getting better.
- Better?

229
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,173
He's a helpless idiot.

230
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,266
Ludwig, what a terrible thing to say.

231
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:15,178
lt's true. l've seen him
sitting in his window, just staring.

232
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,216
They say he doesn't even know
his own wife and children.

233
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:19,717
Dr. Krupp will cure him.

234
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:22,310
How can anyone cure a man
who's lost his mind?

235
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:23,821
We can hope, can't we?

236
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,255
- Good-bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hilda.

237
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,793
Bye.

238
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,853
l can carry my own
books home, thank you.

Dr. Krupp says it'll take time.

260
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,019
He ought to see a brain doctor.

- A brain doctor?
- Dr. Boekman.

Good evening, Father.

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,670
- [Metje] You are late.

00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,175
Didn't you find anything?

00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:29,146
l made a little delivering wood,
but it won't pay for Father's medicine.

We saved some soup for you.

You mustn't feel badly, son.
We'll manage somehow.

we would have more
than enough to live on.

- l'm going to Amsterdam in the morning.
- Why would you go there?

280

l've heard about a famous brain doctor.
A Dr. Boekman.

00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,597
We can't even pay old Dr. Krupp.

282
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:56,140
How can we afford
a famous city doctor?

283
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,733
l'm hoping someone
might buy my drawings.

284

l'll take our lace and sell it.

285
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:03,380
We should get a better price

[narrator] So early next morning,
Hans and Gretel went to Amsterdam.

287
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,421
The Dutch metropolis
is not only Holland's capital,

288
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:18,156
it's also one of the world's
most exciting places,

289
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,529
proudly called
''the Venice of the north, ''

290
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,128
for it, too, is a city
of islands, bridges and canals.

291
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,538
It, too, is a seat
of learning and the arts,

292
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,875
of soaring buildings
and mighty churches,

293
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:38,940
dynamic with the bustle of business
and world commerce.

294
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,286
[organ playing]

295
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:53,231
Under any other circumstances,
this first glimpse of the big city

296
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,496
would have been sheer magic
for Hans and Gretel.

297
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,094
But even so, it held out hope.

298
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,504
Hope to turn their handiwork
into cash.

299
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,770
Hope to find the celebrated doctor.

300
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:08,438
Excuse me. Can you tell us
how to find the marketplace?

301
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:10,277
Just cross that bridge there.

302
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:12,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

303

[indistinct chatter]

304
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,592
There's a place over there.

305

Oh, look, Henry!
What exquisite lace!

306
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,846
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a drawing, sir.

307
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,179
This is hardly the place
to show pictures.

Where should l go?

00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,053
- To the street of the art dealers.
- Thank you.

310
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,589
lf l have any luck,
l'll call on Dr. Boekman.

311
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:52,885
l'll be waiting for you.

312
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,392
Look, l want this, and perhaps this.

313
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:57,759
Oh, don't be so bored, Henry.

314
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,926
Excuse me. Do you know the way
to the street of the art dealers?

315
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,332
- Over there.
- Thank you.

316
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,596
Not at all.

317
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,680
Well, what do you think of it?

318
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,088
lt's wonderful, sir.

319
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:29,184
l've never seen anyone use oils before.
ls it difficult?

320
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,254
Yes, at first.

321
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:35,027
Can you tell me where to find
the art dealers?

322
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:38,066
- Are you an artist, too?
- l hope to be.

323
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,105
Now l only draw with a pencil.

324
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,504
May l see one?

325
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,637
Hmm. They're not bad.

326
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:48,077
There's a strong feeling
for the land here.

327
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,047
- ls this your village?
- Yes, sir.

328
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,777
l suppose you have come
to Amsterdam to sell them.

329
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,445
lf anyone would want
such plain sketches.

330
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:58,513
The old masters often
worked in black and white.

331
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,720
Even the greatest, who once
lived in that house l'm painting.

332
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,786
- Who's that, sir?
- Who was...

333
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,766
Why, Rembrandt van Rijn, of course.

334
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,097
Did Rembrandt really live there?

335
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,659
[Ruisdael] For 20 years.

336
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:15,764
That was his happy period,
when he was married to Saskia.

337
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,604
Didn't he die in poverty?

338
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:21,373
Yes. But l think
he was happy even then,

339
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,109
for he had fulfilled
his ambitions.

340
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:27,050
- Do you understand that?
- l think l do, sir.

341
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,849
Come. l'll introduce you
to a friend of mine

342
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:33,858
who has helped a lot of artists
to get started, including me.

343
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,258
Will you take this?

344
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,959
No. No.

345
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,365
Think you might take a few
on consignment, Mynheer Dionne?

346
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,801
Well, maybe one.

347
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,339
lf he sells it, you can
give him a commission.

348
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,396
Thank you, sir.

349
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,239
Do you know where
l can find a Dr. Boekman?

350
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,109
He's living in the big house
on Princengracht.

351
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,444
Why do you want to see him?

352
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:00,952
My father was in an accident
last spring and lost his memory.

353
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,683
Hmm. So, maybe l can take two more.

354
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,316
Thank you, sir.

355
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,553
Thank you.

356
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:13,359
l'm very grateful to you, sir,
but l don't even know your name.

357
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,865
Frans Ruisdael.

358
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:18,596
Here's a little present so you can
begin to experiment with colors.

359
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,299
Colors! lt's a wonderful gift.

360
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,366
- But you are too generous.
- Oh, no, no, no.

361
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:27,810
Thank you again, sir.

362
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,839
l'll come back as soon as my paintings
are worthy enough.

363
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,589
- What's his name?
- Hans. Hans Brinker.

364
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:49,532
Who knows. He might
turn out to be good someday.

365
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:53,230
- Oh, yes. l want to pay for this.
- Put your money away.

366
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:57,366
You think you are the only one
who wants to encourage young talents?

367
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,746
[bell ringing]

368
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:11,381
- What is it?
- l'd like to see Dr. Boekman.

369
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,048
The doctor sailed for London.

370
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,559
London?
When will he be back?

371
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:19,427
- He'll be away at least two weeks.
- l'll come back then.

372
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:38,949
- What happened?
- The doctor won't be back for weeks.

373
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,678
Too bad. l sold everything.

374
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:44,552
The rich lady bought the lace.
The rest went for a good price.

375
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,022
- Look.
- You did well.

376
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:51,692
- You'd better carry the money home.
- All right.

377
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,566
- l saw where Rembrandt lived.
- You did?

378
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:58,728
And l met a real artist.
Frans Ruisdael.

379
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,932
He liked my drawings enough
to introduce me to an art dealer

380
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,135
- who will try to sell some for me.
- That's wonderful.

381
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,044
And the artist gave me these paints.
Good ones, too. Now l can try colors.

382
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:12,606
People are kind here.
The rich lady asked about me,

383
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:15,346
and when l told her
how hard it had been for Mother,

384
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,183
she said she'd call on us.

385
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:19,019
That's nice of her, but why?

386
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,753
l don't know, but l think
she means to help us.

387
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,317
We must celebrate tonight.

388
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:27,491
Let's ask Kaps and Peter
to have dinner with us for a change.

389
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,600
[belches] Ahhh!

390
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,645
[laughs]

391
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:43,510
What a good meal, Metje!

392
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,847
Like old times, eh, Raff?

393
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,184
Want to play your accordion? Hmm?

394
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,295
[chuckles]

395
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:06,201
Oh, you want me to play it, huh?

396
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:11,572
[accordion playing]

397
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:15,579
* There's an old sailor song
That we sing all day long

398
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,673
* And we call it
''The wooden shoe waltz''

399
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,244
* When we're far out at sea
This gay melody

400
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:25,347
* Makes us dream
Of our sweethearts

401
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:28,086
* By the old Zuider Zee

402
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,290
* Oh, my darling, my darling,
My Hollander miss

403
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:36,266
* I'm longing to hug you
And give you a kiss

404
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:40,704
* Then whirl you around while
The band plays with schmaltz

405
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:44,208
* As we dance to the tune of
''The wooden shoe waltz''

406
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,039
- * Like this
- [taps shoes]

407
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,204
- * Like this
- [taps shoes]

408
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,478
* Then whirl you around
And give you a big kiss

409
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,849
- * Like this
- [kisses]

410
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,047
- * Like this
- [kisses]

411
00:27:57,122 --> 00:28:00,353
* The tune of
''The wooden shoe waltz'' *

412
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:03,087
[laughs]

413
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:09,166
[narrator] But Raff's smile
was only fleeting.

414
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:12,328
The harsh gray winter months
marched by.

415
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,703
In those days, when the ice
locked up canals and waterways,

416
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:18,004
the pulse in those
busy arteries of Holland

417
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,067
came almost to a standstill.

418
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:23,876
No wonder it became ever more
difficult for Hans to find work,

419
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:27,248
though he tried everything
in his power to help out.

420
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,582
But the urge to be an artist
was equally strong in him.

421
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:35,353
He devoted each leisure hour
to canvas and brush.

422
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,759
Hadn't it been the lot
of many a Dutch artist

423
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:40,821
to suffer privations
before attaining fame?

424
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,493
And anyway,
he'd promised Hilda

425
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:46,867
that he would not
neglect his talent.

426
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:59,316
[laughing, chattering]

427
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,686
l suppose you want to see
what Hans is painting.

428
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,093
l'll join you later.

429
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,898
[boy] Come on.
The ice is better over there.

430
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,430
Hello, Hans.

431
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:23,440
- Hello, Hilda.
- May l see?

432
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,408
Oh, it's wonderful!

433
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,775
lt's so exciting to work in colors.

434
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:31,714
Things used to seem dull and gray,
but now l see everything differently.

435
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:34,149
- Do you, Hans?
- lt's all because of you.

436
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:37,518
Now l feel confident.
l believe in myself.

437
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,682
l'm glad.

438
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,817
l am anxious
to try a portrait next.

439
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,293
How would you like to paint me?

440
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:47,263
l'd like to very much.
When?

441
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,096
ls tomorrow all right,
after school?

442
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,398
Fine. l'd ask you
to come to our house,

443
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,962
but Father isn't feeling
too well these days.

444
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,338
l know where we can go.
lnside the mill.

445
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:00,207
- lt's warm, and boss won't mind.
- l'll be waiting.

446
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,112
l'd like to surprise Father
with it on St. Nicholas Day.

447
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:06,116
Maybe he'll want to buy it.

448
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:09,517
Oh, l wouldn't feel right
about selling it to you.

449
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:23,995
Good evening, sir.

450
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,730
Good evening.

451
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,107
- Very good coffee. Thank you.
- [knock on door]

452
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,144
Come in, young man.

453
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:36,237
As l was saying, my husband
and l have no children.

454
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,906
We are quite well-to-do.

455
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:41,248
We live in a house with
more rooms than we can use.

456
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,722
Mynheer Korbes has consented
to let me investigate conditions here.

457
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,886
l admit, l expected to find
a sordid atmosphere.

458
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,260
Even drunkenness, perhaps.

459
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,031
[Mrs. Korbes] But l must say,
l'm relieved.

460
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:00,162
Everything is quite clean
and tidy, despite your poverty.

461
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,264
Gretel, you would like
to live in a big nice house

462
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,832
with servants and good food,
wouldn't you?

463
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:08,311
l hardly need to remind you
of the advantages

464
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,974
that Gretel would have
that's she's missing now.

465
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:15,110
But, Mevrouw Korbes,
l couldn't leave my family.

466
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,745
Do you mean...

467
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,449
You mean that you would
prefer to live here?

468
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:22,459
We're very happy together.

469
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,792
Of course, you could visit Gretel
whenever you wish.

470
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:29,163
My husband is prepared
to send you a sum from time to time,

471
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,202
until your husband is able to work.

472
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,568
Thank you for your good intentions,
Mevrouw Korbes,

473
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,971
but l could never give up
one of my children.

474
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:39,306
But...

475
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:42,904
l hope you understand.
We are all so close...

476
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:46,542
Perhaps if you raised children
of your own, you'd know what l mean.

477
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,848
A family is something
you never separate,

478
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,581
no matter how poor you are.

479
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:55,957
Well, it's your decision.
l only wanted to help you.

480
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:01,727
l think you'll come to realize
you're not being fair to Gretel.

481
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,493
Here's my husband's card
if you change your mind.

482
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:09,301
- Gretel.
- Good evening.

483
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:15,004
And l thought
she came to help us.

484
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,945
Oh, she meant well, Hans.

485
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:22,112
You can't blame one who can't understand
what a family means to each other.

486
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,602
- Hello, boss.
- Hello.

487
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:42,662
Hello, boss.

488
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,642
Hans is going to do my portrait
as a surprise for Father.

489
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,337
Ah, it should be interesting.

490
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:49,277
lt may not turn out
like Rembrandt,

491
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,542
but the light and shadows
are the same.

492
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:56,718
Well, well.
What's the matter, Ludwig?

493
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:59,416
You haven't carried
Hilda's books home lately.

494
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,482
- No, sir.
- Have you had a falling out?

495
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,027
l don't think l should tell you, sir.

496
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,859
Tell me what? lf it concerns
my daughter, speak up.

497
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:10,059
Well, l don't believe
in carrying tales, sir.

498
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,103
Tales? Tales?
What do you mean?

499
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,467
Well...

500
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,302
Hilda's been meeting secretly
with Hans Brinker.

501
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,363
What?

502
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:20,900
l just saw them
go into Boss' windmill alone.

503
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:24,142
Boss' windmill alone?

504
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,050
Ja, it's coming pretty good.
lt even looks like her.

505
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:38,425
[laughs]

506
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:40,896
l'll get some more firewood.

507
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,742
Mind if l rest a moment?

508
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,338
No, of course not.

509
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,187
Oh, it's going to be good.
Father will be very pleased.

510
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,760
So, this is how you abuse
my confidence, Hilda?

511
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,064
- l'm ashamed of you.
- But, Father!

512
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,730
Go home at once.
You'll be punished later.

513
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,273
[sobs]

514
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:29,745
Hans Brinker, l forbid you
to ever see my daughter again.

515
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,406
But you don't understand, sir.

516
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:32,814
Silence!

517
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,149
You're an insolent peasant.

518
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:39,554
lf l ever hear you're meeting
secretly with Hilda again,

519
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,615
l'll have you horsewhipped!

520
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:43,716
[growls]

521
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:55,335
Oh, what's the good burgomaster
so upset about?

522
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,398
Didn't he like your painting?

523
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,787
Hans, have you seen your father?

524
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:20,330
- No.
- He's wandered off somewhere.

525
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:22,696
l'm afraid something terrible happened.

526
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,032
- l'll find him. Take this and go home.
- All right.

527
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,886
lt's the idiot!

528
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:26,689
Where is he?

529
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:28,095
Down by the canal.

530
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,532
You stay here.
l'll get the watchman.

531
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:32,900
[dog barks]

532
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,834
[barking continues]

533
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:49,185
Father!

534
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:52,018
lt's me, Father.
Come back home, won't you, please?

535
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:58,857
There he is.

536
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,693
Arrest him.

537
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,208
lt's Raff!
Come on and help!

538
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:26,048
lt's me, Raff.
Your old friend.

539
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,921
Come on. Let's go home.

540
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,462
[woman] They shouldn't
let him run around like this.

541
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,435
[man] He should be put away.

542
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:43,440
- [woman #2] Oh, it's terrible.
- Poor Metje.

543
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,241
Well, he's quiet now.
You should all take some rest.

544
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,781
How can we rest?

545
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:54,249
l'm afraid, Kaps. Poor Raff
doesn't know what he's done.

546
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,310
[knock on door]

547
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,818
You know what
they're saying in the tavern?

548
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:07,763
That they're going to send
your father to an asylum.

549
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,399
l'm sorry.
l wish we could help.

550
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:14,029
You've done everything you could.
Thank you.

551
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:16,039
We better be going, Peter.

552
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,744
You mustn't worry.
Dr. Boekman is due back soon.

553
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,610
l am going to see him.

554
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,445
How are we going to pay
such an expensive doctor?

555
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:30,817
- l hope the dealer sold my drawings.
- You mustn't count on that.

556
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:35,518
lf worst comes to worst,
l can let the rich lady adopt me.

557
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:38,255
- Oh, no.
- No, Gretel, you won't have to do that.

558
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,921
l'll find something.

559
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:43,058
[narrator] Hans and Gretel
redoubled their efforts,

560
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:45,659
but the promise of a solution
for their troubles

561
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,001
came from an entirely
unexpected source.

562
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,562
Hans! Gretel!

563
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,633
Have you heard about the competition
on St. Nicholas Day?

564
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,372
That's the one with the prize
of the silver skates.

565
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:58,813
There's 300 guilders, too,
for the boy and girl who wins it.

566
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,909
This is the miracle
we've been waiting for.

567
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:03,510
Even if we get in the finals,

568
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:07,080
we'll be up against the best skaters
on the whole Zuider Zee.

569
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,285
Who cares?
We all have the same chance.

570
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,022
lf one of us wins,
our problems will be solved.

571
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,688
We better go sign up now.

572
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:16,495
Come on.
l'll race you to the town hall.

573
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,398
Go!

574
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:22,269
[narrator] And so the possibility of
winning the prize in the great race

575
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,274
kindled new hope
in Hans and Gretel.

576
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:27,743
Here, indeed, was a possible solution
to their many problems.

577
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:29,507
This coming event added, also,

578
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,845
more excitement to one of the
most delightful Dutch holidays,

579
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:39,618
St. Nicholas Day, the time when St. Nick
appears on his handsome white steed.

580
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,920
It is a time for parties
and the giving of gifts,

581
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,898
much like our Christmas.

582
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:52,800
At the mayor's house,
as in most homes along the Zuider Zee,

583
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,998
there was only one topic
of conversation that evening:

584
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:59,475
tomorrow's qualifying races
to pick the contestants

585
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:02,843
for the big silver skate event
just two weeks away.

586
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:08,111
Hilda and l are going to win first
places in the competition tomorrow.

587
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:11,121
Don't be so sure.
Our town is famous for good skaters.

588
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:15,455
- Like Hans Brinker?
- Yes, like Hans and his sister.

589
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:20,426
- Cakes?
- [Ludwig] They shouldn't be allowed.

590
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:22,659
- Why not?
- They only have wooden skates.

591
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:26,727
- l don't see why it makes a difference.
- Wooden skates are dangerous.

592
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,704
They can cause an accident.

593
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:31,298
Hans and Gretel
seem to do all right on theirs.

594
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:55,765
lt's almost time for St. Nicholas
to be arriving on his white steed.

595
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,825
So let's sing a welcome song
for him. All together.

596
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,770
* Hear the hoof beats on the roof

597
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,330
* We don't need more further proof

598
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:07,138
* Good St. Nick is coming

599
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,873
* He will fill each little wooden shoe

600
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:12,609
* If you're good you'll be
Getting something too

601
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:15,709
* Good St. Nick is coming

602
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,415
* Welcome, St. Nicholas

603
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:21,424
* Bring us cheer

604
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:27,488
* For we only see you but once a year

605
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:30,591
* Hear the hoof beats on the roof

606
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,364
* We don't need more further proof

607
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:36,406
* Good St. Nick is coming

608
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:37,998
* He will fill...

609
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,912
- [children shouting]
- Come, children.

610
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,344
Well, hello, little boys and girls.

611
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:53,413
l hope you've all been
good children during the year.

612
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,288
- Oh, yes.
- We've been good.

613
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,348
So have l.

614
00:41:56,427 --> 00:42:00,386
[laughing] l'm glad to hear it,
for tonight, when you're asleep,

615
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,489
l'll bring presents down the chimney

616
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,331
into the shoes
of all the good boys and girls.

617
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:09,464
But l will bring switches
to those who have been bad.

618
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,168
You see, l know everything
that's gone on,

619
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:16,771
like not studying your lessons,
or squirming in church,

620
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,782
or not obeying your parents.

621
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,183
Some of you could even be guilty
of throwing snowballs

622
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:25,347
at gentlemen in high hats.

623
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,915
But next year, l'm sure
you will all be little angels again.

624
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:32,952
Now l must be off to visit other
children all over the country.

625
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,657
So help yourself to the sweets,

626
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:38,099
and l wish you all a happy
and merry St. Nicholas Day.

627
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,506
Hurry up, children.
You mustn't catch cold.

628
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:09,757
What are you doing?

629
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:15,295
What are you doing sneaking
around in the dark like a thief?

630
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:18,137
l was just passing, Your Honor.
l mean, Your Holiness.

631
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:20,541
l have this present for the burgomaster.

632
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,340
Present?

633
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:26,315
l am the one who gives presents, my boy.

634
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:32,580
When did you do this?

635
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:35,091
The last few nights.
l painted it from memory.

636
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,795
Well, l'm sure the burgomaster
will like it.

637
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:42,264
But now you better be off home.

638
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,597
Yes, Your Holiness...
Uh, Your Grace.

639
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,838
l thought everyone had a good time.

640
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:01,715
- Oh, yes, especially Father.
- How he loves to play St. Nicholas.

641
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:05,712
Hilda, have you been seeing
the Brinker boy lately?

642
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,020
No, not since you forbade me to.

643
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,925
Hmm. Why don't you
let those go and get some sleep.

644
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,623
- You want to be fresh for the contest.
- All right.

645
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:16,132
Good night. Thanks for the party.

646
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,600
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, dear.

647
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:27,870
l saw that Brinker boy outside
looking in on the party.

648
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:31,244
- What did you do?
- Sent him away, of course.

649
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:34,045
We really should've
invited the Brinkers this year.

650
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:36,882
lt's been a trying time for them.

651
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,620
Hilda says Hans and Gretel
are entered in the competition.

652
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,127
But they only have
their wooden skates.

653
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:47,790
Why don't you send
Hilda's old ones to the girl?

654
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:51,164
That's what l hoped you'd say.

655
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:12,017
Wasn't it nice of Kaps
and Peter to remember Tiel?

656
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,023
They've had a hard winter, too.

657
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,616
- l carved these for him.
- He'll love them.

658
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,924
lt isn't much.

659
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:22,261
We have a lot to be grateful for.

660
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:30,239
Raff used to look forward to
St. Nicholas Day as much as you did.

661
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:36,474
l remember how excited you used
to be to wake up in the morning

662
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:38,481
and find your shoes overflowing.

663
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:41,211
Sometimes he'd go
without tobacco for a month

664
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:44,049
so he could bring you apples
and gingerbread men.

665
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,112
[knocking]

666
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:10,770
- Who brought it?
- l don't know.

667
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:13,112
Perhaps there's a card inside.

668
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,153
- Oh.
- Look.

669
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,619
What it this?

670
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:23,154
Oh, it must be for you, Gretel.

671
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:25,491
Now l have a chance to win tomorrow.

672
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:29,090
- lsn't it wonder...
- l can skate fine on wooden ones.

673
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,031
Let's show your father.

674
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:37,339
Look, Raff. We have good friends
who remembered us.

675
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:40,036
All this wonderful food
you need to make you strong.

676
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:44,207
Tomorrow Hans and Gretel are going to
enter the competition, and they may win.

677
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,341
Look. Gretel has real skates.

678
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:55,585
The competition has narrowed
down to six boys and six girls.

679
00:46:55,659 --> 00:47:00,119
We shall now select
the finalists for the big race.

680
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:02,722
The girls will take
their starting positions.

681
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,665
Good luck.

682
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,598
You'll race out to the barrel,
circle it, and return.

683
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:13,268
The first three to finish
will have the honor

684
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:17,041
of representing our village
in the big race, the 20th.

685
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:18,843
On your marks.

686
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,282
Get ready. Go!

687
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,611
[all cheering]

688
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,338
Come on, Gretel.
Come on.

689
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:23,906
[all cheering]

690
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:29,819
Wonderful, Gretel.
You did it.

691
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:32,754
Congratulations, Hilda.
lt was a good race.

692
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:33,949
The winners are:

693
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:37,687
Hilda van Gleck, Gretel Brinker,
and Katrinka Flack.

694
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:42,522
And now, the boys will take
their starting positions.

695
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,295
Good luck, Hans.

696
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,166
At least get in the finals like l did.

697
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:56,272
You'll race across the bay, up the canal
as far as the marker, then return.

698
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,076
Don't get behind Brinker.

699
00:48:58,148 --> 00:49:01,709
lf he hits rough ice with those
snowplows, he'll break his neck.

700
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,710
On your marks.

701
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:06,517
Get ready.

702
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,718
Hey! Come back
and wait for my signal!

703
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,797
On your marks.

704
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:16,264
Get ready.

705
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,493
Go!

706
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,639
Hans is keeping up.

707
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,041
But it's a long way to go.
Come on, Hans.

708
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:09,715
Beat him, Hans!

709
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:23,289
Never mind, Hans!
You can catch up!

710
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:17,079
That's my boy in the lead.

711
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:23,690
Beat him!
Beat him!

712
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:37,907
Ludwig, what happened?

713
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:42,071
You were first. You were in the lead.
Why did you let him beat you?

714
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:48,951
And the winners are:
Hans Brink...

715
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:57,220
Hans Brinker, Ludwig Schimmel,
and Peter Bouman.

716
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:09,197
lf my son had tried, he could
easily have come in first.

717
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:13,937
But he didn't. Hans Brinker
beat him, and on wooden skates.

718
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:16,707
ln the big race,
Brinker won't have a chance.

719
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,010
Who do you think'll win,
Mynheer Schimmel?

720
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:24,543
My Ludwig, of course.
l've been giving him some pointers.

721
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,852
l'd put my money on Peter,
not because he is my son,

722
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:30,325
but it takes endurance
to skate 26 miles.

723
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:33,090
And Peter is a strong lad,
big for his age.

724
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:37,395
l'll wager 20 guilders
that Ludwig comes in ahead.

725
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:39,527
l'll take that bet.

726
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:44,505
Make a note of that.

727
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:50,704
Forgive me, but l hope that spoiled brat
of his falls and breaks...

728
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:53,045
Ah, ah, ah, Kaps.

729
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:57,883
At least we all agree that someone
from our village will win.

730
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:00,389
l think you're all crowing
a little too soon.

731
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:04,154
Have you heard of a boy at Hoorn
they call ''Charles the Champion''?

732
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,287
He won the last two years.

733
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:09,764
That's right.
And he won't be 1 9 until next month.

734
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,926
So, he's entered again.

735
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,027
[bargemen laughing]

736
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,611
[narrator] On the day
the famous surgeon was due back,

737
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:24,442
Hans went to Amsterdam.

738
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:36,183
With skates like those,
how much better would be his chances

739
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,354
to win the race and pay
for the doctor's services.

740
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:43,627
Perhaps the art dealer
had sold one of his drawings.

741
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:51,102
You won't find anyone in there.
The shopkeeper is ill.

742
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:52,505
He went home.

743
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:07,317
[bell ringing]

744
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,254
- lt's you.
- Has the doctor returned?

745
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:18,324
This morning, but l'd advise
to come back tomorrow.

746
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:20,336
But l must see him today.

747
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:23,965
l'm sorry. He has given
strict orders to admit no one.

748
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,908
He is not feeling well.
He had a rough crossing.

749
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,946
l can't leave without talking to him.
Please.

750
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,913
My father needs help badly.

751
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:37,443
Very well, but l warn you,
he'll be furious with both of us.

752
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:42,181
Excuse me, Dr. Boekman.

753
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:44,693
Didn't l tell you
l was not to be disturbed?

754
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:47,696
Whatever you're selling,
l don't want it.

755
00:54:47,764 --> 00:54:50,665
- l'm not selling anything, sir.
- What's that you carry?

756
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:54,397
- Paintings to show an art dealer.
- l'm much too busy to see anyone.

757
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,269
But this can't wait, sir.
lt's about my father.

758
00:54:57,341 --> 00:55:00,071
He had a head injury last spring
and lost his memory.

759
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:03,442
l'm sorry. l can't take on
any new patients at this time.

760
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,913
Couldn't you just
come and look at him?

761
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,884
Frankly, no. My work has piled up
since l've been away.

762
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:11,944
Captain Jansen said if anyone
could cure him, you could.

763
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:15,321
- Who's Captain Jansen?
- Commander of a barge over at Hoorn.

764
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:17,883
You cured his brother
when everyone gave up.

765
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:20,293
Oh, yes. lnteresting case.
Amnesia.

766
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:23,231
Won't you see
if there's any hope?

767
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,791
- You're very persistent.
- l have to be.

768
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:28,303
People in our village
think he's dangerous.

769
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,670
They want him locked up
in an institution.

770
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:38,072
- Order my sleigh at once.
- Yes, doctor.

771
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:41,015
Well, come on.
You've got to show me where you live.

772
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:16,443
[indistinct murmuring]

773
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,352
Well, l think the children
should be consulted.

774
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:23,825
What is it, Mother?

775
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:27,295
The doctor says an operation
may restore his memory,

776
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:28,831
but it's very dangerous.

777
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,958
You mean Father might die?

778
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:35,130
Any operation where pressure on the
brain is concerned is highly delicate.

779
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:38,436
Fortunately, the patient
appears to be strong physically.

780
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:42,342
l think he has a good chance
of getting through it.

781
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:46,280
But we know that no matter
how dangerous, it's necessary.

782
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:48,340
Don't we?

783
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,045
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes.

784
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:53,817
When will you do it, doctor?

785
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,450
l have a very full schedule
since l've been away.

786
00:56:56,526 --> 00:57:00,462
Let me see.
Two amputations and, uh...

787
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,760
Well, there's no opening
until the 20th.

788
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,666
Bring him to the Amsterdam
hospital the day before.

789
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,204
Yes, l will.

790
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:11,672
l'm prescribing some medicine
to quiet his nerves

791
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:14,540
if he should be restless again.

792
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:19,177
See he has plenty
of good nourishing food.

793
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,945
Meat, preferably red wine.

794
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:25,476
- Thank you for coming, Doctor.
- Oh, not at all.

795
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:28,718
Well, this will be all for today.

796
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,760
- Doctor...
- Huh?

797
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:34,160
l know you're expensive,
so it's only fair to tell you,

798
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,426
we can't pay for a while.

799
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,766
lt's not my custom to send a bill
until after l have rendered my services.

800
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:42,600
Good day.

801
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,334
[narrator] As the day
of the great race drew near,

802
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:48,809
the contestants in the participating
villages by the Zuider Zee

803
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:53,111
spent every spare moment
practicing for the event.

804
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:02,288
- Have you seen Hans anywhere?
- He's embarrassed on his wooden skates,

805
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:05,021
so he's practicing at the point
where no one can see him.

806
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:06,960
Thanks.

807
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:19,369
Did you hurt yourself?

808
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:22,377
lt's these old wooden skates,
but l'm getting better.

809
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:26,006
lt's just a question
of jumping over the rough spots.

810
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:33,883
Still meeting secretly, huh?

811
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:35,322
What do you mean?

812
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:39,294
A pretty little scene.
Not as comfortable as the mill, is it?

813
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,421
How did you know about that?

814
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:46,231
Everyone knows that Hilda's father
forbade her to see you again.

815
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:48,567
But he didn't know
about the mill.

816
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:50,833
You're the one
who told the burgomaster.

817
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:52,602
What if l did?

818
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,469
You are contemptible.

819
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:58,413
Get your skates off.

820
00:59:56,706 --> 01:00:00,403
My Ludwig was attacked today
by the son of that madman Brinker.

821
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:03,071
Without provocation, mind you.

822
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:06,274
As a member of the town council,
l strongly feel

823
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:09,011
that a boy like Hans Brinker
should not be allowed

824
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:10,882
to represent our town in the race.

825
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:14,651
- You sure it was without provocation?
- l have Ludwig's word for it.

826
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:17,750
l heard from my daughter,
who happened to be present,

827
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:21,558
and she feels that young Brinker
was entirely justified.

828
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:25,496
And, frankly, so do l.
Good evening.

829
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:35,635
[narrator] On the eve of Raff's
removal to the hospital,

830
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:39,375
the Brinkers faced two of the most
critical situations of their lives:

831
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:43,283
Raff's operation
and the race for the big prize.

832
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:46,686
No wonder the immediate future
held for the little family

833
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:49,224
a mixture of fear and of hope.

834
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,452
You are going to shave before
we take you to the hospital.

835
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,964
l can't let you
frighten the nurses.

836
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:59,729
Dr. Boekman is going to
make you well again. l know.

837
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,637
Who's going to take care of Tiel
when we go?

838
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:08,907
Old Maria's going to take care of him.

839
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:23,387
Amsterdam hospital,
at your service.

840
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,189
Thank you very much
for the ride.

841
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:28,662
Will you pick up Hans and be
at the marketplace this afternoon?

842
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,927
But not later than 4:00.

843
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:34,232
l hope everything goes well.

844
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:44,913
l think it's best you say
good-bye to your father now.

845
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:50,920
Good-bye, Father.

846
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:58,086
[Gretel] Mother, we hate to leave you.

847
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,789
lf it wasn't for the money
we may win, we'd give it up.

848
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:04,493
Of course you won't.
There's nothing you can do now.

849
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,501
What time are the races tomorrow?

850
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:09,436
Girls start at 1 0:00
and the boys go right after us.

851
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:12,475
Hans, when do you think you
will be reaching Amsterdam?

852
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:15,670
Early afternoon.
We turn back when at King's Bridge.

853
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:19,237
lf the operation is over
and if your father is out of danger,

854
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:21,374
l'll wave to you from the bridge.

855
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:25,416
God be with you.

856
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:27,548
God be with you.

857
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:34,386
Come on, darling.

858
01:02:41,604 --> 01:02:44,232
l'll come to the marketplace
as soon as l can.

859
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:46,241
All right.

860
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:04,624
Can you help a poor cripple?

861
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:20,571
Can you help
a poor cripple?

862
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:23,203
No, l am sorry.

863
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:27,946
Beggars are not allowed in here.

864
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:29,985
l am not a beggar, sir.
l am an artist.

865
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,078
- [laughing]
- Aren't they the same?

866
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,622
You made a good purchase.

867
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,681
Ruisdael is becoming quite popular.

868
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:38,659
- Yes, so l understand. Good day.
- Good day, sir.

869
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:41,663
- ls Mynheer Dionne around?
- Oh, he died two weeks ago.

870
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:44,325
Went home ill and never recovered.

871
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,494
- l'm sorry.
- Everything's in quite a mess.

872
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,629
l'm his nephew.
l'm here to take over.

873
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,198
Do you know if he sold my drawings?
l left some pencil sketches.

874
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:55,107
Oh, those. Yes.

875
01:03:55,178 --> 01:03:58,306
l'm glad to get rid of them.
They take up space.

876
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:59,848
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

877
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,941
Now l have better ones.
ln oils. See?

878
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:06,284
- Perhaps you'd be interested in these?
- l'm selling out. Not buying.

879
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,357
Thank you, sir.

880
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:39,613
- Are you badly hurt?
- A thief! He stole all my money!

881
01:06:46,182 --> 01:06:48,514
Open the door!
Open up!

882
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:50,711
Help!

883
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:05,692
Help! Police! l'm in here!
Help me get out!

884
01:07:18,781 --> 01:07:21,579
What did the boy
who ran after him look like?

885
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:22,640
Like any beggar.

886
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,155
l wouldn't be surprised if he
wasn't in league with that cutthroat.

887
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:28,349
They often work in pairs.

888
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:32,554
- Did the boy leave these paintings?
- And those dreadful drawings, too.

889
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,119
He's no thief. l know him.
He's a friend of mine.

890
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:37,359
Try and find him.
He might be in trouble.

891
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,526
Yes. Come on.

892
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:06,221
l am sorry,
but l can't wait any longer.

893
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:08,559
l can't understand
what's happened to Hans.

894
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:11,259
He knows we have to be back
for the races tomorrow.

895
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:16,499
lf he doesn't come soon,
l think you'd better go to the police.

896
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:25,004
[narrator] Exhausted by
his vain efforts to get free,

897
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:28,448
his troubled mind filled with
concern for tomorrow's events,

898
01:08:28,518 --> 01:08:32,648
Hans spent a night
of frustration and anxiety.

899
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:44,384
[Hans] Help me! Help me!

900
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:51,689
[man] Who called for help?
Where are you?

901
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,658
Here! l'm locked in,
and can't get out!

902
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:02,500
Oh, ho! You must be the boy
the police are looking for.

903
01:11:02,572 --> 01:11:06,633
Wait till l call them,
and we'll have you out in a jiffy.

904
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,041
We've been looking
all night for you.

905
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:11,773
Can you show us the ship
where you saw this cripple?

906
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:14,680
- First l must find my sister.
- Don't worry about her.

907
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,877
She's sleeping in a warm police station.

908
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,513
Well, come on then.
lt's nearby.

909
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:34,569
What do you want?

910
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:38,232
May l speak to the man
with the crutch, please?

911
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:40,502
Someone wants to see you.

912
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:43,872
How did you...

913
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,725
l can't thank you enough, Brinker.

914
01:11:57,793 --> 01:12:00,785
l'll even take your paintings.
On consignment, of course.

915
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:04,856
Doesn't he get a reward
for recovering the money?

916
01:12:04,934 --> 01:12:08,529
- Certainly. Here you are.
- [coins jingling]

917
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:10,401
Five guilders.

918
01:12:10,473 --> 01:12:13,704
Gretel, it's almost enough
to buy some new skates l saw.

919
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:17,177
- How much more do you need?
- Two more guilders.

920
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:22,715
Two more guilders.

921
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:24,878

- Why wouldn't they?

926
01:12:53,816 --> 01:12:56,683
Maybe they realized
Hans doesn't have a chance.

927
01:12:56,752 --> 01:13:00,119
They had to take their father
to Amsterdam, but they'll be here.

As soon as the dance is over,
l shall call the girls' race.

But, Your Lordship,
two of our contestants are missing.

to Amsterdam and return.

The one we have to worry about
is that fellow from Hoorn.

970
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:10,393
- Which is he?
- The tall one with the fur cap.

971
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:13,833
They don't call him
Charles the Champion for nothing.

l expect every one of you to finish,

01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,631
You will start on the horn.

975
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,472
After that,
it's every one for himself.

976
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:24,978
May the best Hollander win.

to my attention that there is

a dangerous patch of thin ice
in the south basin.

980
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:36,991
So heed the warning and be certain
that you all go around it.

they won't be back for a long time.

- What happened to Hans Brinker?

They were both behind me
when we left the canal.

1002

Peter Bouman of Volendam.

Will you please come forward
and receive your prize?

There must be foul play here somewhere.

1012
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,445
Yeah. But what happened to you?

1013
01:26:17,519 --> 01:26:19,714
- Well, tell us now.
- Out with it.

1014
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:26,353
lt was all my fault.

1015
01:26:26,428 --> 01:26:29,864
l tried to take a shortcut
across the thin ice,

1016
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:33,094
and it wouldn't hold me.
Hans pulled me out.

1017
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:36,367
And what do you have
to say to that?

1018
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:38,406
l say...

1019
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:42,637
l say we should both be glad
that our town won.

1020
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:45,077
Come on, Ludwig.

1021

l am sorry.

Thanks for everything
you've done.

1023

You're recovering quickly,
l don't l have to call on you again.

- We can't thank you enough, Doctor.
- No.

1026
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:27,114
Peter Bouman has offered
to lend us his prize money.

1027
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:31,056
- So we can pay your fee.
- l warn you. lt's pretty high.

1028
01:27:34,396 --> 01:27:36,091
This is my fee.

1029

And l won't take anything less.

1030
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:48,966
A genuine Hans Brinker is going to be
worth a lot of money one of these days.

1031
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:52,172
By the way, someone has
taken care of your hospital bill.

- Who was that?
- Mynheer Schimmel

1033
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:57,885
said it had something to do
with Hans and his son.

1034
01:27:57,953 --> 01:28:00,387
- Well, good day.
- [laughs]

1035
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,218
What's all of this
about money?

1036
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:05,748
Why didn't you use
the thousand guilders l saved?

1037
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:09,359
Oh, Raff.

1038
01:28:09,431 --> 01:28:12,662
We ransacked the storeroom.
We looked everywhere.

1039
01:28:12,734 --> 01:28:14,395
Somebody must have
stolen it.

1040
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:18,667
But you didn't look under
the loose board, did you? Huh?

1041
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,081
Oh, Raff.

1042
01:28:33,154 --> 01:28:35,987
Do you call that a safe place
to hide so much money?

1043
01:28:36,057 --> 01:28:38,821
- Anyone could have found it.
- But you didn't, did you?

1044
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,986
No, because it was too easy.

1045
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:43,553
