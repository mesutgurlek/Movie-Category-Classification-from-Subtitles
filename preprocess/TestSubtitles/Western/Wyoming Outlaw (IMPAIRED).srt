157
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,067
Well, that's too bad.

158
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,333
Oh, as long as we've got
part of a roof over our heads,
we're thankful.

159
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:41,067
These gentlemen
are here to see Will
about a job, Father.

160
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,967
Well, that's fine.

161
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,667
Won't you stay for dinner?

162
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,567
Well, we trifled
with some hamburgers.

163
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:51,467
But that meat smells
mighty interesting,
Mr. Parker.

164
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:55,667
It isn't often
we have good beef to offer
strangers these days.

165
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,267
I reckon jobs
are pretty scarce
around here.

166
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,200
Yes. In fact the only jobs
there is...

167
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,933
Is cleaning off the highway
after a dust storm.

168
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,233
You see, I used to be foreman
of the road gang.

169
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
TUCSON: Used to be?

170
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,867
Yes. Since my accident,
they...

171
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,433
They've laid me off
on account of disability.

172
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,067
Why don't you tell
them the truth?

173
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,067
He was fired because
he wouldn't collect graft

174
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,833
From the men that were
working under him.

175
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,767
Now, uh, we can't
prove that, Irene.

176
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,367
And, uh, besides,
these gentlemen
aren't interested.

177
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,367
Oh, yes we are.

178
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,267
Well, there's
an election coming up,

179
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,533
And we were notified
that we would
have to contribute

180
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,367
A week's pay to
the campaign fund.

181
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,067
Campaign fund.

182
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,567
Every dollar of that money
went into Balsinger's pocket.

183
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,167
LUKE: Well, anyway,

184
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:47,067
I refused to give it
and refuse to collect it
from the poor devils

185
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:50,700
Working under me
because they are
worse off than we are.

186
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:54,067
So Joe Balsinger said,
he'd make an example
of us Parkers.

187
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,300
That's what you get round here
when you stand up
for your rights.

188
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:00,400
Well, you're not
supposed to starve.

189
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,133
You could go on relief.

190
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,067
MR. PARKER:
No, no, we couldn't.

191
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,067
They turned me down flat.

192
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,833
That's controlled
by the same gang.

193
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,767
Besides, there's no relief
for a man that owns property.

194
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,933
Did, uh, you ever try
to borrow money

195
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,633
On a 1,000 acres
of dust and sand?

196
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,367
No.

197
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,133
Looks like you folks
have a real problem here.

198
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,433
(DOOR OPENS)

199
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:32,667
That must be Will now.

200
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,100
I reckon we'd better go on out

201
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35.400
- And help him
with the kindling.
- Mmm.

202
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,567
Be back in a minute, Stony.

203
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,233
Oh, uh,

204
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Irene was so busy hating
Joe Balsinger,

205
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,567
She forgot to tell
you about the money.

206
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,067
- Money?
- STONY: Yes.

207
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,100
They had a dancing contest.
We won first prize, didn't we?

208
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,333
Go on, show 'em.

209
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:01,767
Oh, yes.

210
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,200
Here it is.

211
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,500
Twenty-dollars.

212
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,500
She's a darn good dancer.

213
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, I wouldn't have
gotten anything if
you hadn't danced with me.

214
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,133
Thank you.

215
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,167
Well, where is he?

216
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,567
He must have seen us coming.

217
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,633
WILL: Reach.
You're covered.

218
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,333
Go on, reach.

219
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,633
Now turn around.

220
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,433
Well, this is a fine way
to treat a couple
of friendly strangers.

221
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,300
Friendly? How do I know
you're friendly?

222
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,167
You'll have to take
our word for it.

223
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,800
Don't give me that.

224
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,333
I'll take the wind's word
that it's gonna rain.

225
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,067
And I'll take the sun's word
that it's gonna be clear.

226
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,067
But I've learned never to take
a man's word for anything.

227
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,533
But you don't mind
taking a man's steer
without asking him, do you?

228
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,567
When you're hungry,
you ain't thinking.

229
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:05,967
But you're not gonna
lock me up.

230
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,133
I'll kill anybody that
tries to lock me up.

231
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,967
You better soft pedal
on that killing stuff, bub.

232
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,167
If you make good on it,
they'll hang you.

to set folks down to table.

245
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,567
Yeah, it makes me feel
like a new man again.

Come, sit right down,
gentlemen.

247

All we've got is roast beef
and corn bread,

But that's a feast
in this country.

oh, Lord,

we are about to receive.
Amen.

had a talk with our boy?

They sure did,
didn't you, Tucson?

253
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,233
Oh, about that job?

254
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Sure, we're gonna
give it to him.

255

We're gonna start him out
as a top hand.

he's a mighty good man.

how to thank you.
- Don't try.

some of that beef, fella?

Good morning, Mr. Balsinger.

Why, Mrs. Parker,
I never expected
to see you here.

I've come to contribute
to the campaign fund.

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,667
Oh, that's fine.

269
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,400
There will be a job
for Mr. Parker, won't there?

270
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,900
Sure. Sure, have him
come around tomorrow.

271
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,467
He'd go on the labor gang.

272
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,067
Labor gang?
But he's a foreman.

273
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,333
Ah, I'm sorry,
that job's filled.

274
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,500
But he's not strong enough
for day labor.

275
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,733
You know, have him come
and see me when he is.

276
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,967
Oh, but he needs the job now,
he can't go on like this.

I'm sorry.
It's the labor gang
or nothing.

He should have known
when he had a good thing.

for the contribution.

I'm sorry, but I can't admit
him to the Park.

to tell before,

at town.

Well, according to

We're guilty of assault
and battery
and disturbing the peace.

have you arrested?

He did, huh?

420

started by now.

are we supposed to wait?

I can't understand this.

convinced by now that
you were misinformed.

won this hand.

not showing up.

that he didn't.

Balsinger dropped the charges.

Mighty nice of him,
now that the hearing's over.

432

Yeah.

We don't know yet.

Anybody see who did it?

440
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,800
He went out to hitch up
the horse to take us
to the hearing

441
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,967
And we found him like this.

Please, don't do
anything more.

443

We can't let Balsinger
get away with this.

Don't you see that
there's no use fighting.

you're trying to do for us,
but it's hopeless.

all we've done
is make things worse.

How's that?

Well, you're getting
better all the time.

452

It only used to take
you about a week or so
to get us into trouble.

453

This time, you done
it in nothing flat.

All right.
We gummed things up,

But I'd still like to get
a crack at that guy.
