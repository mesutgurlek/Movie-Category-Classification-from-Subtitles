00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,474
Well, the thing is, he doesn't want to.

492
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,942
Isn't that right, Mr. Shackleford?

493
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:11,315
Now, if I could have a
moment alone with my client...

494
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,717
Talk fast.

495
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:17,888
He has a lineup appointment in 10 minutes.

496
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,762
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Tucker.

497
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,165
Oh, it's no problem, not for Tara.

498
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,933
No, she deserves justice.

499
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,269
Well, it's always best
to see a suspect in person

500
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:30,403
rather than a picture.

501
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:31,871
Of course.

502
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,906
Think back as best you can.

503
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:35,875
Was any of these men
the one you saw with Tara

504
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:36,909
the night she disappeared?

505
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,949
I'm sorry. I just...

506
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,651
I... I... I don't recognize any of them.

507
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,853
Take your time. There's no need to rush.

508
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,089
She said she didn't recognize anyone.

509
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:52,791
I don't need a hearing
aid. I heard what she said.

510
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:55,459
I'm not sure you did.

511
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,461
Sue Ellen, take as long as you want.

512
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,533
I'm sorry.

513
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:23,419
[Sighs] I gather you heard.

514
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:26,689
What that man did...

515
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:28,157
Holster that thought.

516
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,559
Don't go looking for trouble with Jake.

517
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:34,563
[Scoffs]

518
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:40,536
I'm here.

519
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:44,006
I don't want to be treated
like some fragile little thing.

520
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:45,808
You don't need to be here.

521
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:47,843
I'll come find you if I need a hand.

522
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:53,382
But right now, I just need to move on.

523
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,360
[Door opens, closes]

524
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:08,096
[Door creaks]

525
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,073
You do not have this situation contained.

526
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,109
I got people snooping all
around the edges of my ranch.

527
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:19,443
Our people.

528
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:22,947
We're keeping an eye on
your place, just in case.

529
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:25,282
Just in case what?

530
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,052
The leader of the Laredo cartel,
El Diablo, is on the move.

531
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,222
The devil? Are you serious?

532
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:33,224
- It's what they call him.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,558
When you were talking about me

534
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,093
getting to higher-ups in the cartel,

535
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:37,694
you were talking about this guy?

536
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,696
Correct.

537
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:42,265
You're a son of a bitch. You know that?

538
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,934
Look, one of his middlemen
was ripping him off,

539
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,535
skimming profits.

540
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:47,638
It was just a matter of time
before El Diablo dealt with it.

541
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,973
We dealt with it for him.

542
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,608
<i>No, you mean I dealt with it.</i>

543
00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:53,076
You dropped me in with that middleman,

544
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,477
knowing that he would come after me,

545
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:56,379
and then you killed him and
his buddies because it...

546
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:59,282
Because it what?

547
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,984
It makes you valuable to El Diablo.

548
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:03,520
He thinks I took out one of his rats.

549
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:05,855
- Bingo.
- Which makes him inclined

550
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,193
to want to do business with me.

551
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,611
Look, from his point of view,

552
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,147
you're the guy that had the
guts to clean up a mess for him.

553
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:13,383
Plus, you know how to get
shipments in from Mexico.

554
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,854
You've been doing it already.

555
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:16,105
He's gonna personally want to meet you

556
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:17,673
and whoever your team is.

557
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:20,242
And when he calls to set a
meeting, we're taking him down.

558
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,946
This is unbelievable,
man. This is unbelievable!

559
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:26,248
Here's the bottom line, Billy.

560
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,584
There's risk. You can say no.

561
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:30,052
And if I say yes?

562
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,520
All charges will be dropped.

563
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:33,255
What you did never happened.

564
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,328
Yeah, set it up.

565
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,437
You're doing it wrong.

566
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,572
- I always eat with a fork.
- Not that.

567
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:10,081
They turn into plates.

568
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:13,584
- Since when?
- Since forever.

569
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:15,319
I want to take another run at Mims.

570
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,487
I think I can play him.

571
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:17,621
Too late.

572
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:19,022
His lawyer bailed him out this morning.

573
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,424
We had him on a parole violation.

574
00:25:20,492 --> 00:25:23,393
Well, his lawyer made a stink
about police brutality...

575
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:25,930
something about him
running into Colt's gun.

576
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:27,465
Lieutenant, working with that man

577
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:29,699
is like walking around with a
hornet's nest tied to my hip.

578
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,235
<i>Howdy, Lieutenant, Ms. Parker.</i>

579

00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:38,575
Smells good.

581
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:41,311
I've been thinking about Mims all night.

582
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,580
Did you all notice the size of his feet?

583
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:48,751
Boy sports a size 12, at
least, same as Clem Pickett,

584
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,854
the transient I suspected of the killing.

585
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,288
You mean you had actual
evidence against Pickett,

586
00:25:52,356 --> 00:25:53,690
not just his color?

587
00:25:53,757 --> 00:25:55,758
I'm fair-minded. Ask anyone.

588
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:57,360
Go track down Mims.

589
00:25:57,427 --> 00:26:01,297
If his lawyer makes a
fuss, I'll handle him.

590
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:02,431
Shouldn't you offer grace?

591
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:03,866
It's an egg roll.

592
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,301

Good.

597

Uh, you happen to have a
warrant for that screwdriver?

Maybe you want to write
that down in case you forget.

602
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:34,595
I'll make a mental note.

Or paying for that lawyer.

611

Or to get out of town.

612
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:05,159
I say we visit his known associates,

613
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:08,529
bang a few more heads, and
see who knows where he is.

614
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:10,497
Or we reach out to the wireless companies

615
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:12,699
and see which cell towers
he's pinging off of.

You correlate with other
towers and then triangulate.

Uh-huh.

622
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:42,980

of these rooms he's hiding in?

His lawyer hasn't seen him

since he walked him out
of here this morning.

The national ballistics database

got a hit on the bullet from Mims' body.

00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:42,286
It came from a gun used in an armed
robbery in Florida 11 years ago.

641
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,587
Two perps tried to rob a liquor store

642

and got into a shootout with the clerk.

643

The perps got away, man and a woman.

644

There's a sketch of the man.

00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:29,142
Very well.

818
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,410
Jake: Thank you, Your Honor.

819
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:32,379
Good afternoon, Molly.

820
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:34,614
Senator Colton will
please address my client

821
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:35,882
as "Ranger Parker."

822
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:37,449
I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.

823
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:39,251
It's force of habit.

824
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,320
Ranger Parker...

825
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:44,924
You filed for divorce a long time ago.

826
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:46,525
How come you never mentioned

827
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,227
this so-called cruelty back then?

828
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,361
Fear.

829
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:51,831
Oh, come on. A Texas Ranger afraid of me?

830
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:54,766
Not afraid of you. Afraid of embarrassment.

831
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,001
Oh.

832
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:57,336
As an officer of the law,

833
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:59,771
you're familiar with police reports?

834
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,972
Yes.

835
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,441
I mean, when someone
is a victim of a crime,

836
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,310
- they report it, right?
- Generally.

837
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:06,845
So now you're saying that you're a victim.

838
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:09,915
So, can we get a look at
these reports that you filed?

839
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,116
I never did.

840
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:12,450
Oh.

841
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:15,386
Well, maybe you got some
friends you confided in

842
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:16,888
that can tell us what you said

843
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:19,057
about these so-called
incidents back at the time.

844
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,928
I never told anyone.

845
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:25,896
Any photos of your injuries?

846
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:27,265
No.

847
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:33,504
So... no proof, no records,

848
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:36,774
just unsupported allegations.

849
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:38,243
As a law officer,

850
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,379
would you arrest somebody based on that?

851
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:43,781
I'd evaluate the
credibility of the witnesses.

852
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:46,683
You are a public figure

853
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:48,953
with every reason to conceal what you did.

854
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,122
I have nothing to gain by coming forth

855
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:54,959
except public humiliation
and my freedom from you.

856
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,062
You can't hide from the truth.

857
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,031
And, Your Honor, I am telling the truth.

858
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,968
Judge... there's nothing here.

859
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,104
Judge Garrity: Well, it
seems like he said/she said.

860
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:11,941
So, in the absence of
any actual evidence...

861
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:15,544
Mr. Orba, have you lost
interest in these proceedings?

862
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:16,746
No, Your Honor.

863
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,447
We may be able to break this impasse

864
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:20,283
by calling on two additional witnesses...

865
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,118
Ms. Diane Simmons and Maria de La Vega.

866
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:23,953
Mr. Franks: Can't see what good it'll do.

867
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:26,189
Ms. Parker just conceded
there are no witnesses.

868
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:27,723
Well, she wasn't aware of these.

869
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:28,825
But I can assure the court

870
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:30,393
that they can shed light on this case.

871
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:33,462
Very well.

872
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,265
- We'll hear that testimony.
- That won't be necessary.

873
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:39,835
You know, to spare my wife
any further embarrassments,

874
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,406
I'm withdrawing my objection
to her divorce petition.

875
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:48,977
I'm willing to sign the
final documents right now.

876
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,291
What was in that file?

877
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:05,694
Your now-ex-husband's past.

878
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:08,396
He's an abuser.

879
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,665
If he hit you, he hit other women, too.

880
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,133
I did some digging.

881
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:15,102
Found a couple of old
girlfriends he batted around.

882
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,671
And they're willing to testify?

883
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,673
I don't know. Never talked to them.

884
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,809

885
