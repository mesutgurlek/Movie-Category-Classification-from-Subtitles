Nah, man. We used to sell it

real clear to us

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,182
she didn't want us selling
no magazine subscriptions

But then Lorna got all up
in our grill about it.

No. She wanted me to.

Lizzie seems nice.

805
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:13,815
She, uh... She is, um...

806
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:16,151
We're not really dating.

807
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:20,021
Um, not quite. Uh...

808
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:21,523
I'm not sure what
you'd call it, but, uh...

809
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:25,060
dad. [ Chuckles ]
Relax. It's okay.

810
00:41:25,128 --> 00:41:28,230
I'm, uh... I'm sure
you would have told me...

811
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:30,398
You know, eventually.

812
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:41,042
[ Sighs ]

813
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,213
You know, you were right...

814
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:49,484
about how I'd feel once I knew
the truth about mom.

815
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:56,124
[ Whimpers ]

816
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,560
You want to talk about it?

817
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,432
Eventually.

818
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:11,072
Where you been, punk?

819
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,242
Portland. San Francisco.

820
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:16,144
Denver.

821
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,353
Dad, I need you
to tell me something.

822
00:42:28,224 --> 00:42:32,160
Are you ever gonna
finish this cabin?

823
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,230
[ Chuckles ]

824
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,635
Only if you come around more.

825
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,107
Promise me.

826
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:49,244
I promise.

827
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:51,980
Good.
