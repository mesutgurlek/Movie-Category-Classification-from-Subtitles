He needs to be opened up, Cullen.

it's lodged against his spine.

I don't have the tools

Can we take him to Chicago?

00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,993
Come to drink with y'all.

505
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,021
Hmm?

506
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,887
All right.

507
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:27,894
See what you got here.

508
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,539
Hmm. Tennessee.

509
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:36,807
That there the good stuff.

510
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,321
Not that rot gut y'all drink.

511
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:45,315
Hmm. Well, y'all, go on
and break that open. Hmm?

512
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,222
Enjoy yourself.

513
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,017
Guess me and you
down to the rot gut. Hmm.

514
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,191
Good stuff.

515
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:14,553
[Coughing]

516
00:40:31,787 --> 00:40:34,140
Shit'll make you blind.

517
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,202
Mm-hmm.

518
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:38,644
Make you see
the good lord first though.

519
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,459
You ever wonder what'll happen
to y'all if old man Durant die?

520
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:10,635
Reckon we be on the first
train smokin' back to Georgia.

521
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,764
How about you?

522
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:18,351
What about me?

523
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,581
How long you think you
gonna last in this town...

524
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:23,439
Without him to protect you?

525
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:25,900
Hmm?

526
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,237
Just be another nigger
in the white man world.

527
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,661
Mm-hmm.

528
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,884
[Laughing]

529
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,258
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

530
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,019
Is he dead?

531
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:04,684
No.

532
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,298
No. I already buried Hawkins.

533
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,743
It says "all those
aiding and abetting."

534
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:32,341
But doc... doc just held the horses.

535
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:36,804
