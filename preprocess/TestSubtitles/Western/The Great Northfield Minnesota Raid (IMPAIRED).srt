they were the greatest outlaws.

{Y:i}They were the greatest revolver fighters.

3
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:20,932
{Y:i}The greatest train, stagecoach
and bank robbers that ever lived.

4
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:25,292
{Y:i}Frank James was there,
armed with his Navy Colt and Bible,

5
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:28,572
{Y:i}and there was "Fancy Kid" Chadwell,
wearing his ten guns easy.

6
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:33,412
{Y:i}And Charley Pitts, the Ozarks Medicine Man.
And the wild Younger brothers.

7
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:37,331
{Y:i}Bob Younger, the youngest Younger, and
his brother, "Silent Jim," who had been

8
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,652
{Y:i}shot in the mouth by a bushwhacker.
Silent Jim only spoke with his guns.

9
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:46,172
{Y:i}Then there was big Clell Miller, the
mountain man, and of course, Jesse James.

10
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:50,572
{Y:i}Jesse James, riding side by side
with the great Cole Younger.

11
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,772
{Y:i}And they rode like the wind.

12

{Y:i}Even before the wounds
of the Civil War

13
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:15,492
{Y:i}had healed in Missouri, the railroads
came swarming in to steal the land.

14
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:21,371
{Y:i}Everywhere, men from
the railroads were driving

15
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:24,292
{Y:i}poor, defenseless families
from their homes.

(WIND HOWLING)

17
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:31,651
{Y:i}And that's when a fresh wind
suddenly began to blow.

18
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:38,172
{Y:i}It was other Clay County farmers,

19

{Y:i}the James and Younger boys,
coming to the rescue.

20
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:49,372
{Y:i}They tarred and feathered the
railroad men and drove them from the land.

21
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:52,292
{Y:i}From that moment onward,
they were outlaws.

22
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:56,812
{Y:i}But the people of Missouri would never
forget what the boys had done for them.

23
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,972
{Y:i}And that's why in 1876

24
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:04,732
{Y:i}the Missouri State Legislature
met in an extraordinary session.

25
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:10,452
These James and Younger boys
are called outlaws by some.

26
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,611
But to many more
they are heroes.

27
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:20,452
Now. I propose that a full and
complete pardon and amnesty

28
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:21,732
be granted to them.

And let these James and Younger

00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:40,332
and their families
to lead fruitful lives,

35
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:44,412
so that we may have
peace once again

greatest detective of them all, Allan Pinkerton.

39

{Y:i}And here's where the true story
of the Northfield raid began.

Legislators are here to make laws.

41
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:04,892
We are here to make examples.
They're foolish to think that

42
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,892
fifteen years of criminal behavior
can be legislated away.

43
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:11,091
But in the event this amnesty
does come into being,

44
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,212
we'll already have done our duty.

45
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,692

can you?

I've searched back through the
crannies of my mind and I cannot

think of one single honest man
we ever robbed.

53

Because we rob the robbers,
is why.

Hell!

00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,852
It's up to us to give
amnesty to them.

Could you hand me
some of that there, Jesse?

and a good shooter.

he wasn't good at.

he good at, Cole?

always try to help a body.

got to do is lend a helping hand.

'73, getting the public to trust in banks

448
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:15,771
has been the problem.
People see that banks close,

449
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:17,492
then they see depression
and inflation.

450

because they don't trust in banks.

Does he trust in banks?

Mr. Wilcox has stopped at nothing

454
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,331
to get depositors for his bank.
And do you know why?

455
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,932
So that he can get the money, so that he can
enter into every wildcat scheme in this area.

456
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:42,012
First, he brings in a new
vault, with a time clock.

457
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:46,972
A time clock! Then he starts giving
away gifts, throwing lavish parties.

458
00:28:47,052 --> 00:28:51,011
That didn't do any good.
And now this. Calliope.

459
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,651
That's the latest scheme.

I just don't like to see
people taken advantage of.

461
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:59,292

to see him skip town.

This man will stoop to anything
to get money in his bank.

464
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,692
And I have to stand there
and watch it all...

465
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:09,332
It's an interesting scheme,
Mr. King.

466
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:17,372
But where do you
take your profits?

more than 400 miles,

"Lottie,
don't sell the children."

503

sell them, not even for the mortgage.

you owe him how much?

Eighty dollars. But I
ain't selling the children.

and Chadwell, Mr. James.

out of them, hoss.

Besides, you got to expect to lose
a few, you go on a guerrilla raid.

The purpose is to show them
Yankees the war's still going on.

This raid will be talked about
forever and ever.

Bob can't go, then
we gotta leave him behind.

This here's the safest place for him.

Cole, buddy, we run out on
Chadwell back there in the bank,

1107
01:17:52,092 --> 01:17:55,052
and we run out on Clell Miller
back there, too.

Now, Bob's your brother. My
brother, Frank, he'd understand.

what the Lord said, Cole.

was in need, and tended to him.
