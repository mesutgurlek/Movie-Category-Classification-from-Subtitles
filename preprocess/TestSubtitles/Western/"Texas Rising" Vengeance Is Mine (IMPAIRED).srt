to pursue and destroy what's
left of the rebel army.

Come to relieve me, Tom?

Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

I can't think of one.

No.

105
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,750
Houston wants us to attack

106
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,555
so he can cut us down

from the cover of those trees.

108

Filisola and Urrea arrive?

Yes, with overwhelming number,

Santa Anna's reinforcements no more.

121
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:58,124
You'll be all by your lonesome.

122
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,667
You know I can't afford

123
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,461
to spare you even one extra man.

124
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:05,089
Forgive me, but destroying that bridge

125
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:06,799
will cut off our retreat as well.

126
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,176
(Baker): That's a good point.

127
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,974
Then we'd better not lose.

128
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:27,654
Position a crack squadron of dragoons

129

It's our lifeline.

131

better to abandon this position

until we can rejoin all our armies

133

but whatever it is,

153
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,290

160
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,893
(Sherman): He's awake for 56 days straight;

161

Now he sleeps?

162
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:50,146
(Lamar): If he truly wanted to attack,

163
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,564
it should've been at first light.

164
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:52,899
The weather has been fickle.

165

00:32:58,692 --> 00:32:59,583
At least that many prisoners.

518
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:00,985
700?

519
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,143
What about our men?

520
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:04,502
Only 9 dead and 33 wounded, sir.

521
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:05,823
(Rusk): 34...

522
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:07,405
counting you.

523
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,872
And Deaf is unaccounted for.

524
00:33:09,902 --> 00:33:11,187
(Houston): Deaf?

525
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:13,565
Well, rally the Rangers.

526
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:14,999
Find him.

527
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,668
Yes, sir.

528
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,432
(Houston): Has Santa Anna been captured?

529
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:20,484
We are hunting him, sir.

530
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:22,814
He must be taken alive. You hear me?

531
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:26,844
Without him, there's no victory.

532
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:29,472
We've won nothing.

533
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:30,890
(Groans)

534
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,315
(Lamar): Keep searching, men!

535
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:50,352
(Man): Down here!

536
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:53,996
Over here!

537
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:57,125
This way!

538
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:21,899
(Water rushing)

539
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:28,820
(Rustling)

540
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,267
Mexicano!

541
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,977
Mexicano. Mexicano!

542
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,478
Benito?

543
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:35,396
Benito,

544
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:38,316
you are one of the keepers
of my champion birds.

545
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,543
Presidente?

546
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:41,953
- Si.
- Presidente.

547
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:46,707
My friends are all dead.

548
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:52,685
We lost.

549
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,025
We lost a lot of friends today.

550
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:03,283
(Man): Put him down over there.

551
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:08,621
I thought you'd be hanging curtains

552
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:12,750
and darning your fiancé's socks by now.

553
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:14,511
I'm not going anywhere yet.

554
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,643
Drink this.

555
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:18,923
(Man): I need to clean this.

556
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:20,967
Get me some more water.

557
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:22,951
Do you love him?

558
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,329
Gavin's a goodhearted man.

559
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,831
He's decent.

560
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,166
Daddy loved him, promised
me to him years ago.

561
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:32,086
Answer my damn question.

562
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,050
(Groaning)

563
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:39,677
(Man): Just get him some laudanum.

564
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,021
(Panting)

565
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:46,480
You don't want what I got to give, no way.

566
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,382
The next bullet that comes
my way might be my last.

567
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,242
Don't say such things.

568
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:51,539
You know, my whole life,

569
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,084
people have been telling
me what's good for me.

570
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:56,962
(Man): Back over when you've got a minute.

571
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:00,253
You'd be a damn fool not to go with him.

572
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,178
No, you're the fool, Kit Acklin.

573
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:12,085
(Crunching, man screaming)

574
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:14,462
(Houston): Where am I?

575
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,844
Did they cut my leg off?

576
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,417
(Doc Ewing): No, but
your ankle was shattered.

577
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:20,981
If sepsis sets in,

578
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:24,305
you will die a slow, miserable death.

579
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,640
Any word from Emily?

580
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,606
(Doc Ewing): No.

581
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,976
We got to get you to New Orleans.

582
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,479
If not, should you fall unconscious,

583
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,815
I will have that leg off.

584
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:37,527
I'll take my chances in New Orleans.

585
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,360
Emily.

586
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,392
(Distant gunfire)

587
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,784
(Coughing)

588
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:09,334
(Indistinct shouting)

589
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,378
(Shushing)

590
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,510
(Distant shouting)

591
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,596
(Distant cannonfire)

592
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:28,353
(Whimpering)

593
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,320
Am I dying, padre?

594
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:43,952
Si.

595
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:56,215
(Sobbing)

596
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,140
(Karnes): Deaf.

597
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,456
Deaf!

598
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:10,061
(Flames crackling)

599
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:15,680
(Distant banging)

600
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:33,042
(Loud banging)

601
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,255
(Knowles): Oh-ho!

602
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:41,342
Well, chop my legs and call me Shorty.

603
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,095
Vern! Vern, ain't this swank?

604
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:45,876
Ain't this swank?

605
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,998
Close this thing.

606
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,396
Hey, take a look at this.

607
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,592
Take a look at this.

608
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:51,344
(Breathes noisily): One second.

609
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:54,153
General Santa Annabella herself.

610
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:56,199
Ooh, well, hello there.

611
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,447
Hello. Hello, there.

612
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,311
The spoils of war, son.

613
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,842
We grab what we can hold,

614
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,564
and we cut out of here tonight.

615
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,066
Yes, sir. Whoa, whoa, no.

616
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:06,359
I don't know.

617
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:07,610
Vern, Vern, hey, Vern.

618
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:09,491
You got to understand.

619
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,147
I'm a hero now.

620
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,288
I saved the war secretary's life.

621
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:18,529
I heard you tripped
over a bunch of Mexicans.

622
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:19,530
It...

623
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:20,508
(Thudding and grunting)

624
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:21,999
Ha!

625
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,664
Eureka.

626
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,193
Holy shit.

627
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,206
(Gun cocks)

628
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,710
(Colby Pitt): Surrender, Mexican,

629
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:51,754
or I'll kill you deader than last Tuesday.

630
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:55,550
On your knees. On your knees.

631
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,927
Are you alone?

632
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,887
Maybe.

633
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,608
Hands up.

634
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,097
Hands up!

635
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,566
God damn. We can't get it all now.

636
00:40:19,608 --> 00:40:22,193
Got to come back before we head out.

637
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:24,362
- (Metallic clattering)
- (Gasps)

638
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,548
Well, goodness gracious.

639
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,472
What is this?

640
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:34,472
It's the mother lode...
Santa Anna's treasure.

641
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,474
You snakes weren't gonna tell me about it?

642
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,684
Well, why should we?

643
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,548
We found it.

644
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:42,163
Lucky for me,

645
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:43,848
so did I.

646
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:47,323
(Karnes): That there must
be El Presidente's tent.

647
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,583
(Elwood): Cover this shit up. That's right.

648
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,739
- All right.
- Cover it up.

649
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,855
- All right.
- That's right.

650
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,896
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-whee!

651
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:05,303
Awful highfalutin.

652
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:07,555
(Laughs)

653
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,187
Looks like this place done been looted.

654
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,052
We was just picking up
a few souvenirs, man.

655
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,825
Spoils of war and such.

656
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:17,277
Well, you know that looting

657
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:21,611
could get you court-martialed and shot.

658
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,897
- (Laughs nervously)
- What, you mean...

659
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,861
even for a token or two
for our loyalty to Texas?

660
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:31,785
Listen up.

661
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:34,171
All this belongs to the Texas government.

662
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:36,588
So if you don't mind, I'll take...

663
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:39,537
- Captain, you all right?
- Son of a bitch.

664
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:42,707
(Quietly): Damn.

665
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,807
Oh, lookee here.

666
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:49,303
Would you look at that?

667
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,592
Santa Anna must've buried that, right?

668
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,594
Must have.

669
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:55,970
All of it.

670
00:42:01,656 --> 00:42:05,980
(Loud thud)

671
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,900
(Metallic clinking and thud)

672
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,902
(Quietly): Damn.

673
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,738
(Indistinct chatter)

674
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,783
(Scattered cheering)

675
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,877
(Man): Yeah!

676
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,922
(All cheering)

677
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,593
How about that?

678
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,721
(Man): Vive, El Presidente!

679
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,681
(Man): Yeah!

680
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,356
(Doc Ewing): It's a tincture of opium, Sam,

681
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:46,103
for the pain.

682
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,023
Quart of warm whiskey
would work just as well.

683
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:55,413
General, you've got to see this.

684
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:56,619
He needs to rest.

685
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:58,149
I need fresh air.

686
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,527
Fetch my clothes.

687
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:03,279
Haul me up, Tom.

688
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:06,324
(Hockley): By my count,
we have over 20,000 pieces

689
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,825
of silver and gold...

690
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,495
all of Santa Anna's
personal valuables, sir.

691
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:13,206
(Seguin): General, we must give
these to the people of Tejas.

692
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:15,500
(Rusk): Gentlemen, there is
no discussion on this matter.

693
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:17,168
Funds seized from the enemy

694
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:20,672
belong to the newly liberated Republic.

695
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:22,173
(Man): Another group going in.

696
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:24,676
(Rusk): It all goes to Texas.

697
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:31,849
Karnes, that soldier there.

698
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:33,101
Bring him to me.

699
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,519
(Karnes): Sir.

700
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:36,521
Flores, fetch Colonel Almonte.

701
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:38,898
Yes, sir.

702
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:40,191
(Man): Move!

703
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:41,979
(Indistinct chatter)

704
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:45,109
- (Flores): Colonel Almonte...
- (Karnes): Come on.

705
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,695
So you're a private.

706
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:04,537
Si, señor.

707
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:07,598
Colonel Almonte,

708
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:10,588
why do your men salute him?

709
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:11,835
Regretfully,

710
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,987
I do not know all my soldiers, sir.

711
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,889
That's too bad.

712
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,169
Private Pitt,

713
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:20,151
execute your prisoner.

714
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:23,835
(Colby Pitt): Yes, sir.

715
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:27,505
(Houston): No, private.

716
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:30,341
Put him up against a tree

717
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,923
so his brains don't splatter.

718
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:39,642
I am Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

719
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:40,651
Wait. He's Santa Anna?

720
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,268
And I am Sam Houston.

721
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:46,466
El Presidente, General,

722
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:48,757
I cannot express

723
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:52,555
how glad I am to meet you.

724
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:54,604
I ask to be treated as a general should be

725
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,168
when made a prisoner of war.

726
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,461
Men!

727
00:44:58,504 --> 00:45:00,547
We captured Santa Anna!

728
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,508
We must convene a tribunal and execute him.

729
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:06,177
(Baker): Death by firing squad!

730
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,180
(All): yeah!

731
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:10,515
(All talking at once)

732
00:45:10,558 --> 00:45:12,058
Yeah!

733
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:15,103
(All shouting)

734
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:19,991
The conqueror of the Napoleon of the West

735
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:23,870
can afford to be generous
to the vanquished, no?

736
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:25,788
You should have remembered that, sir,

737
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,498
at the Alamo.

738
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,376
At the Alamo, your defenders chose to die.

739
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:32,416
You offered them no alternative.

740
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,568
- (Spits)
- Bastardo.

741
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,307
Juan...

742
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:39,819
This is war, sir,

743
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:43,168
and no one here is good or bad,

744
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:45,863
just winners

745
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:49,473
and losers.

746
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:51,898
I acted under the orders
from my government.

747
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,191
You are yourself the government.

748
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:55,776
That's damn right.

749
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,029
(Rusk): Texas formed a
recognized government.

750
00:45:58,071 --> 00:45:59,697
We are not pirates.

751
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,699
The rules of war applied.

752
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:04,201
General, why are we even
talking to this murderer?

753
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:05,849
He needs to swing.

754
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:08,673
Firing squad, here and now!

755
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:12,343
(All): Yeah!

756
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:15,471
(All talking at once): Do it!

757
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:16,973
- Yeah!
- (Men shouting)

758
00:46:30,994 --> 00:46:34,866
(Men shouting)

759
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:37,156
(Houston): There'll be no firing squad.

760
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:39,178
(Man): We want blood!

761
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:41,868
(Houston): That cannot happen.

762
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:45,309
Alive, Santa Anna is of great value to us.

763
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,962
If we execute him,

764
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,298
he'll just be another dead soldier.

765
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,155
Let us take our reparations.

766
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,194
Open his war chest.

767
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:57,154
Gold to every man in my command.

768
00:46:57,197 --> 00:47:01,367
Equal shares for all those
who risked their lives.

769
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:03,786
General Seguin, General Sherman,

770
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,621
show the men.

771
00:47:05,664 --> 00:47:06,914
Divvy it up.

772
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,834
(Sherman): Yes, sir.

773
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:12,878
(All cheering)

774
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,530
General, we're taking him.

775
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,858
Retribution goes hand in hand

776
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,346
with victory.

777
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,182
Present your prisoner.

778
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:43,517
I will not.

779
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:48,355
All right, fine by me.

780
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,977
We end it all now.

781
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,980
My only reason for living

782
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:57,940
is to slay him.

783
00:47:59,347 --> 00:48:01,736
Ride on out of here while you can.

784
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,131
Shut your mouth, boy.

785
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:05,856
Shoot me first.

786
00:48:06,575 --> 00:48:08,489
You don't think I will?

787
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,599
Soldiers, ready arms!

788
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,289
Don't fool yourself.

789
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,471
Santa Anna will die!

790
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,835
It's just a matter

791
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:46,046
of how many of us he takes with him.

792
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,136
You understand me?

793
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,535
(Coughs)

794
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,591
Charmaine.

795
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,783
(Horse neighs)

796
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:15,678
(Groans)

797
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,876
Come here, girl.

798
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:19,223
Come here.

799
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,387
You saved me today.

800
00:50:33,672 --> 00:50:35,563
Oh, sweet girl.

801
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:39,105
(Groans)

802
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:42,976
(Horse whinnies)

803
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:46,141
No.

804
00:50:50,288 --> 00:50:54,458
Why'd you have to go do that for?

805
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:56,001
Why'd you do that?

806
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:20,234
I'm so sorry.

807
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,038
(Crying): I'm so sorry.

808
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,337
Come on. Let's get you off that leg.

809
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,547
Let's get you off that leg, okay?

810
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:52,558
You do me a favor.

811
00:52:00,205 --> 00:52:02,743
You do me a favor.

812
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,788
You wait for me. You hear?

813
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,754
You wait for me.

814
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:11,535
You'll be seeing me real soon.

815
00:52:13,622 --> 00:52:14,872
(Gun cocks)

816
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,541
(Exhales)

817
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:18,959
(Gunshot)

818
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,669
(Gunshot echoing)

819
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:23,380
(Crying)

820
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,602
(Snickers)

821
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:39,647
(Indistinct chatter in Spanish)

822
00:52:54,788 --> 00:52:57,039
(Distant galloping)

823
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:58,290
(Man screaming)

824
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:02,044
(All speaking Spanish)

825
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,254
(Lorca): Get every one of them!

826
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:04,588
Every one of them!

827
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:05,798
Hey, come on!

828
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:07,133
(Gunshot, woman screams)

829
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:08,467
Come on!

830
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,053
(People shouting indistinctly)

831
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,516
(Panting)

832
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,271
(Gunshot)

833
00:53:20,313 --> 00:53:23,315
(Laughter)

834
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,402
(Gasps)

835
00:53:29,863 --> 00:53:31,365
No! He's just a child.

836
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,783
Nits make lice.

837
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:35,202
We're done killing women and children!

838
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,787
Then get out of here!

839
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,964
I aim to kill Mexicans,
and I ain't done yet.

840
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,292
- Go.
- All right.

841
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:43,168
Just go, man. Go.

842
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,254
Go!

843
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:46,839
Come on, man.

844
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:54,138
Give me the boy.

845
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:02,980
(Gunshot)

846
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,584
(Thunder rumbles)

847
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,073
(Houston): Any word from Deaf?

848
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,449
(Flores): No, General.

849
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:15,100
And Miss West?

850
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:16,727
Nothing, sir.

851
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,268
Very well.

852
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:29,281
You wanted to keep me alive, no?

853
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:32,409
Once you are gone, these men will hang me.

854
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,121
Tell me something.

855
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:39,306
Your generals... will they retreat

856
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:42,177
once they're informed
you've been taken hostage?

857
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,216
No.

858
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:45,781
Their orders are to engage.

859
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:53,755
Then I recommend you rescind those orders.

860
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:58,610
So you want Texas

861
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:01,572
in exchange for my life, huh?

862
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:03,073
Sounds like a trade.

863
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:04,283
(Rusk): Only President Burnett

864
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:06,368
can negotiate a treaty.

865
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:08,245
(Houston): Well, he
can't very well negotiate

866
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:10,080
if El Presidente here is dead.

867
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:11,582
Now, can he?

868
00:55:16,463 --> 00:55:18,088
(Woman): I'll need them vials.

869
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:21,091
(Indistinct chatter)

870
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,618
Kit,

871
00:55:26,648 --> 00:55:28,751
are you sure you're fit to ride?

872
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,943
Hey, now, don't fuss.

873
00:55:30,985 --> 00:55:32,319
In case I need tending to,

874
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,557
Doc Ewing's coming with the General.

875
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:38,367
I'll see you when I get back.

876
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,910
I certainly hope so...

877
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:42,788
if you don't get yourself killed.

878
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:19,871
(Elwood whistling)

879
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:29,501
(Doc Ewing): Sarah, you got
my medical bag packed up yet?

880
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,828
I'll be seeing you.

881
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:37,234
(Doc Ewing): Sarah!

882
00:56:46,327 --> 00:56:48,203
Where you heading to, Vern?

883
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:53,083
War is over for me, Knowles.

884
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:54,293
I done my duty.

885
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:56,587
Had my fill of taking orders.

886
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:59,047
Might head on down to Victoria.

887
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,879
Mm.

888
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:02,493
You want to know my guess?

889
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:06,413
You and Gator are going after that bank.

890
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,500
Gator's so full of bunkum,
if he told me water was wet,

891
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,503
I'd have to poke my finger
in and feel for myself.

892
00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:15,781
Kit didn't trust him.

893
00:57:16,123 --> 00:57:17,245
You ought not to neither.

894
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:18,921
Well, I ain't robbing no bank.

895
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:20,457
I'm a hero now.

896
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:23,155
Got a reputation to uphold.

897
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:31,705
Well, if you want to ride
your hero ass along with me,

898
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,123
you're welcome.

899
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:36,788
Well...

900
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:40,631
no, thank you, my friend.

901
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:44,259
I reckon I'll just stay put.

902
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,797
Good luck with that shit.

903
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:55,124
Tell them boys I say adios.

904
00:57:55,154 --> 00:57:57,071
All right.

905
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,429
You lily-livered weasel.

906
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:05,722
How in the hell am I supposed

907
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:07,504
to take this bank by myself?

908
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:11,036
Well, why don't you
recruit Karnes and Anderson?

909
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,723
(Houston): Tom, I want you
to ride on ahead to Burnett.

910
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,546
Formalize our agreement with Santa Anna.

911
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,153
Buckley and Seguin will
take charge of the army

912
00:58:32,183 --> 00:58:33,340
while I'm away.

913
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,268
(Rusk): You get that leg healed up, Sam.

914
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,561
Texas needs you.

915
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:37,562
(Grunts)

916
00:58:37,592 --> 00:58:41,444
You just gonna leave me behind, is that it?

917
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:44,770
Well, I'll be damned.

918
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,438
I'd about given up on you.

919
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:50,534
I had to lay Charmaine to rest.

920
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,113
(Karnes): Partner, damn.

921
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,073
You look like something the cat dragged in

922
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,594
that the goat wouldn't eat.

923
00:58:58,624 --> 00:58:59,878
Right here.

924
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:00,744
(Coughs)

925
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,080
Let it out.

926
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:05,207
Let it on out.

927
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:09,551
(Houston): Private Pitt.

928
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:12,214
The man that captured Santa Anna

929
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,680
ought to make a damn good Ranger.

930
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,456
Your first assignment:

931
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,762
Take Captain Smith home to his wife.

932
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,417
Yes, sir.

933
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,309
Sorry to hear about Charmaine.

934
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,787
(Smith): Anybody fetch me a new mount yet?

935
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,824
(Doc Ewing): Get a wagon
and lay him down in back.

936
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,066
You're in no condition to go, Deaf.

937
00:59:35,525 --> 00:59:37,948
What'd you say, Sam?

938
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:40,463
You need to look me in the eye.

939
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:48,042
I said you're not going.

940
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,919
And who's gonna look after
your old crippled ass?

941
00:59:52,783 --> 00:59:55,495
Karnes will take command of the Rangers.

942
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,469
Just gonna throw me away.

943
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,165
Is that it?

944
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:06,310
Go home, old friend.

945
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:11,361
The Republic of Texas
is grateful for your service.

946
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,911
Go on.

947
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:14,017
(Doc Ewing): All right.

948
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,354
Colby, get him in the medical tent.

949
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:19,398
Got to get Houston to New Orleans

950
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,068
and Santa Anna to his peace talks.

951
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:24,736
You take care of yourself, Deaf.

952
01:00:25,813 --> 01:00:27,489
(Houston): Let's move out.

953
01:00:27,532 --> 01:00:29,491
(Smith): Sam.

954
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:30,867
Sam.

955
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,453
I'll tell you when I'm done.

956
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,801
Yah.

957
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:06,995
(Groaning)

958
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:13,544
(Fly buzzing)

959
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,317
(Doc Ewing): You just had one, Sam.

960
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,526
That's quite enough.

961
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,861
Mmm!

962
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,221
You think you are a man of destiny,

963
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:52,140
but all I see

964
01:01:52,183 --> 01:01:54,184
is President Jackson's puppet.

965
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:58,938
All I see is a man in a chicken coop.

966
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:01,708
I am defending my people
against pirates like you,

967
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,081
stealing our land.

968
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:07,906
History will sweep you
aside with a footnote.

969
01:02:07,948 --> 01:02:09,491
Perhaps.

970
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:10,867
Better a footnote

971
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,453
than a whole book of abominations.

972
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,121
(Chuckles)

973
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,291
No difference with what
you did in San Jacinto.

974
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,335
We are men on opposite sides,

975
01:02:20,377 --> 01:02:22,796
yet there is much we share.

976
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:25,340
A love of our countries,

977
01:02:25,382 --> 01:02:29,010
a love of... other things.

978
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:31,429
A remarkable woman, Miss West.

979
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:34,766
An extraordinary woman,

980
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:37,056
especially in bed

981
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,129
when she's screaming with pleasure.

982
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,632
I hear women are quite skilled

983
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,051
at pretending that sort of thing.

984
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,805
"Oh, Antonio, yes, yes, more.

985
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,473
Give me more."

986
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,184
Give him another one, Doc.

987
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:56,271
He's wrestling with
what defeat tastes like.

988
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:14,831
(Water splashing)

989
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:26,468
Colonel Portilla's got Emily West.

990
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,219
Wants to trade her for Santa Anna.

991
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,223
A whore for a chief of state.

992
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,269
Portilla is losing his mind.

993
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,602
Give this back to him.

994
01:03:46,366 --> 01:03:47,891
Flores.

995
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:51,050
Sir?

996
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,053
(Speaking foreign language)

997
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,388
Yes, sir.

998
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:56,723
Anderson!

999
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,078
- Yeah.
- Get ready.

1000
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,079
God is with us.

1001
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,310
Ha!

1002
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,716
Beads and whiskey

1003
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,342
always worked for me before.

1004
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,765
Whoa, whoa. Keep your head, mister.

1005
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:33,143
Else you're liable to lose
it along with your scalp.

1006
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:36,396
Everything's set.

1007
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,107
I need my volunteers.

1008
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,442
(Woman): Get out there, Phineas.

1009
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:41,501
- You be a man.
- All right.

1010
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:44,149
I can give you Clarence
and the other Negroes.

1011
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:45,258
Best if I stay back

1012
01:04:45,288 --> 01:04:48,685
and watch over the children and womenfolk.

1013
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,370
Bigfoot, let's meander.

1014
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:58,548
Well, move it.

1015
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,931
(Horse whinnies in the distance)

1016
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,964
Must've hanged your president by now.

1017
01:05:53,007 --> 01:05:54,937
When I know that's true,

1018
01:05:54,967 --> 01:05:56,926
I'll use you for my men's amusement.

1019
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:59,345
And where will you go?

1020
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:03,132
Texas... they'll hang you for Goliad.

1021
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:06,983
In Mexico, they'll shoot
you for San Jacinto.

1022
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:08,888
- (Smacks)
- (Yelps)

1023
01:06:22,753 --> 01:06:24,854

Deaf, we're... we're not here
to give you any trouble.

1193
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,967
We... we don't want
to cause a commotion.

1194
01:18:43,997 --> 01:18:45,177
We just don't want to...

1195
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,824
Though we could use your advice.

1196
01:18:46,854 --> 01:18:47,980
Please.

1197
01:18:48,352 --> 01:18:50,107
Advice.

1198
01:18:52,546 --> 01:18:54,611
Don't marry a woman that can whoop you.

1199
01:18:54,654 --> 01:18:57,656
She'll make you piss yourself.

1200
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,365
Portilla's got her. Don't he?

1201
01:18:59,395 --> 01:19:00,826
That's right.

1202
01:19:00,868 --> 01:19:03,144
I think I remember seeing him ride off.

1203
01:19:03,174 --> 01:19:06,044
I figured she was dead.

1204
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,783
Didn't tell nobody.

1205
01:19:07,813 --> 01:19:10,786
(Coughing)

1206
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,777
I'm gonna need a new mount.

1207
01:19:26,844 --> 01:19:28,771
(Anderson): Done.

1208
01:19:28,813 --> 01:19:30,631
(Woman): Excuse me.

1209
01:19:35,658 --> 01:19:37,362
Deaf, no.

1210
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,794
If you go out that door,

1211
01:19:39,824 --> 01:19:42,021
we know you ain't coming back.

1212
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:45,618
Lupe, darling,

1213
01:19:46,058 --> 01:19:49,420
I am coughing blood and farting dust.

1214
01:19:51,377 --> 01:19:53,087
Now, I reckon I can die in that bed

1215
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:56,006
watching all your caterwauling,

1216
01:19:56,049 --> 01:19:58,133
or I can die as I've tried my damnedest

1217
01:19:58,176 --> 01:20:00,648
to live all my days:

1218
01:20:00,678 --> 01:20:02,592
Like a man.

1219
01:20:06,851 --> 01:20:10,540
You done real good keeping
me around this long.

1220
01:20:11,176 --> 01:20:14,079
Can you do one more thing?

1221
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,281
You mind fetching me my clothes?

1222
01:20:32,854 --> 01:20:35,040
Those look real good.

1223
01:20:37,885 --> 01:20:40,438
Mind your chores,

1224
01:20:40,676 --> 01:20:43,744
and you be a comfort to your ma, you hear?

1225
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,682
Now, when you get older, well,

1226
01:20:47,049 --> 01:20:51,103
I'm gonna expect you
to account for yourself.

1227
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,981
Texas is gonna need a
young lady like yourself.

1228
01:20:55,611 --> 01:20:57,781
All right?

1229
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:02,214
I'm mighty proud of you.

1230
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:17,504
There ain't words for how much I love you.

1231
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:35,339
(Anderson): Make way!

1232
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:51,288
(Knock at door)

1233
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:52,915
(Man): Sam.

1234
01:21:52,957 --> 01:21:55,792
Your enemies are conspiring
against you as we speak.

1235
01:21:55,835 --> 01:22:00,547
(Burnet): He and Houston
want to annex our Texas.

1236
01:22:02,634 --> 01:22:06,929
If you would accept this...

1237
01:22:06,971 --> 01:22:09,014
It must be used for good.

1238
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,266
Your land is now forfiet
as well as the collateral...

1239
01:22:11,309 --> 01:22:13,019
You can't have Nate.

1240
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:16,772
What about this one?

1241
01:22:16,814 --> 01:22:19,149
Shoo, shoo, in the kitchen.

1242
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:22,861
Santa Anna's whore doesn't
eat with decent folk.

1243
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:25,781
I very much like your house.

1244
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:27,159
It would suit me.

1245
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:29,047
They may have cleaned you up.

1246
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,665
I know you.

1247
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:34,156
What do we got to do to join
up with a ranger company?

1248
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,826
(Gunshots)

1249
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,536
(Whooping)

1250
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:41,747
(Shouts)

1251
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,145
And I suggest you finish
up your little party here

1252
01:22:44,175 --> 01:22:45,634
and come with us and get back home

1253
01:22:45,677 --> 01:22:47,565
and fix Texas before it's too late.

1254
