1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,589
(Sizzling)

2
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,831
Why don't you sniff the wind
while you're at it?

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,193
Come on.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,158
I guess I'm just itching to get there.

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,196
OK.

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,636
Let's go.

7
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,953
(Playing harmonica)

8
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,600
(Singing)

9
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,356
(Gunfire)

10
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,874
Ready... fire!

11
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,238
Ready... fire!

12
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,074
Halt left... face!

13
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,913
Present arms.

14
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,636
(Bugler plays taps)

15
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,958
We was the lucky ones, Frank.

16
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,998
I thought we was gonna
come back that way.

17
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,358
Present arms!

18
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,795
We're sure sorry about your boy.

19
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,791
Left, face!

20
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,192
- He gave his life for his country.
- Forward march!

21
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,076
Mr Ewing.

22
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,830
We need us a new fence. Gotta get a gate.

23
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,876
We'll be all right.

24
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,475
Cabin ain't much, you know.

25
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,035
Well, imagine.
There wasn't even supposed to be a cabin.

26
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,076
There ain't.

27
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,040
Come on. Ho!

28
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,435
Hyah! Come on, y'all.

29
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,238
You're sure right about this place, Frank.
I ain't never seen such a pretty place.

30
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,312
Door was open.

31
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,835
Helped myself.

32
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,233
Always did have
the best water in the basin.

33
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,552
I saw the old clock was gone.

34
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,232
I suppose you sold it like you did
that land to them soldier boys.

35
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,158
Ain't you done enough to spite me?

36
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,600
Down to the two of us now.

37
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,512
Just us.

38
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,952
You should have married me.

39
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,996
We'd have had a child.

40
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,315
Be heir to it all. The whole basin.

41
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,188
Ain't too late.

42
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,355
I gotta hand it to you.

43
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,433
You hung on longer than anybody else.
You put up a hell of a fight.

44
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,071
But it don't take no genius
to see it's your last year.

45
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,633
I don't wanna have to ruin you, Ella.

46
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,110
Jacob, do you mind some company?
I've got a call in to Claire.

47
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,515
Did you see this? I think the Russians
are going to beat us into Berlin.

48
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,718
Neil, by fall I'll have the Connors place.

49
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,352
Do you really think
Ella's gonna go under?

50
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,396
You can bet on it.

51
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,228
Why don't you come back east with me?

52
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,869
We'll go down to the place in Virginia
and do some fishing.

53
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,632
I wish your father had lived
to see this basin back together again.

54
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,831
I could never have rebuilt it
without his help.

55
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,550
My father was a very generous man.

56
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,599
Cattle will cover this basin the way
buffalo did in my grandfather's time.

57
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,558
Sounds like that might take
a good deal of capital.

58
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,396
This is not a good time to talk about it,
but sometime I'd like to talk

59
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,836
- about the mineral rights to this valley.
- (Phone ringing)

60
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,836
- Oil and cattle are not incompatible.
- This is heartland. Cattle country.

61
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,559
That's the way it's going to stay.

62
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,029
That's probably Claire. I'll get it.

63
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,276
Hello? Yes, I did.

64
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,949
Hi, Claire.

65
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,796
I know it's late in New York but
I wanted you to know where things stand.

66
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,075
Who's that benefiting?

67
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,675
If it's the Belgian Red Cross, yes.

With all them broken bones of yours.

141
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,353
Well, there was a few accidents.
You had some, too.

142
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,916
You're a year older. You're brittler.

143
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,796
And your cows is older and tougher.

144

Hell, you've got cattle
ain't ever seen flat land.

You know, that deep water don't hurt.

148
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,553
It's that idea of being drug off the cliff
that's gonna get you.

- You can say no.
- Hell, no.

150
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,116
I made my choice.

151
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,150
Well, we got us one old man
and a banshee woman boss.

152
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,598
Feel like a fart in a wind storm. Giddup!

153
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,476
Well, we lost them.

Flushin' cows out of this timber

to use a typewriter.

Howdy.

157
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,434
I hear a terrible thing happened to you.

158
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,873
I think I got the man that did the shooting.

159
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,269
You did. He's dead.

160
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,912
Did you get the man that sent him?

161
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,037
You better get that son of a bitch
before I do.

162
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,351
His name is Ewing.

163
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,557
Better tell him that. He's the law.

164
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,720
The man you killed worked for me.

165
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,196
I'm Ewing.

166
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,391
Sorry your partner's dead.

167
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,235
Sorry all this had to happen but
sometimes things just work out that way.

168
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,073
We're disposed to give you the benefit
of the doubt when it comes to murder.

169
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,398
You take that and head someplace
where you've got a chance.

170
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,995
Whoa now, baby.

171
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,157
There you go. Oh, yeah.

172
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,674
(Frank) What's the matter with it?

173
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,796
Her mama's dead.

174
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,474
Did she get to nurse any?

175
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,835
I don't know.

176
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,355
I don't think so.

177
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,717
If it didn't, I don't imagine
you're gonna do her any good.

178
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,108
Nobody asked you.

179
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,992
Yeah. Thatta girl.

180
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,956
You're gonna be all right.

181
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,433
Yeah.

182
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,470
Please don't watch me.

183
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,509
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,356
I'll do it.

185
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,116
You seem full able to get around
and fix a meal and all.

186
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,239
I figure you might as well just get going.
Here, I'll do it.

187
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,155
I told you I wasn't running a hospital
and this ain't a hotel either.

188
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,800
Just thought I'd give you a little hand.

189
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,068
I don't need a maid, don't need a cook.

190
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,479
You can get that kind of work in town.

191
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,949
I gotta go in tomorrow. I'll give you a lift.

192
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,554
Here. I made you these.

193
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,514
I don't need no chaps.

194
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,955
Well, they sure as hell ain't gonna fit me.

195
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,750
It's a wonder you've got any flesh on them
legs with them skunk skins you wear.

196
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,113
Uh...

197
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,393
I need me a horse. Think I could buy one?

198
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,434
- It'll cost you.
- Yes, ma'am. I did say I'd buy one.

199
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,478
There's nothing I want from you
for nothing.

200
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,794
There you go.

201
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,599
You should have chose a gentler horse.

202
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,273
You're too stove up for Parsons.

203
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,868
He'll break you just taking you to town.

204
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,832
I don't want you to fall off here and sue me.

205
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,593
I'll take the risk.

206
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,353
I meant what I said
about taking you to town.

207
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,431
Thank you. I ain't going to town.

208
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,757
You're going back
to that toilet you call a cabin?

209
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,831
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,232
Excuse me.

211
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,670
It seemed to me a person in your situation
might use an able-bodied man.

212
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,277
Thank you.

213
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,073
(Ella) I guess I could use a hired hand.

214
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,950
(Frank) I ain't no hired hand. I'll work with
you but I sure as hell can't work for you.

215
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,949
You do owe me. You owe me for the care
and the time you spent at my place.

216
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,237
- Excuse me?
- I said you do owe me.

217
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,710
Lady, you've got balls
the size of grapefruits.

218
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,272
All right. I'll work for you a season.

219
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,392
You pay me any way you can at the end.

220
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,311
Except some of it's got to be in stock.

221
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,794
Of course, any of mine we find,
you help me trap them.

222
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,716
(Ella) It's a deal.

223
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,353
Back... Back.

224
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,034
(Frank grunting, horse snorting)

225
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,388
(Ella) Why don't you come on in?

226
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,317
I thought you might want something to eat.

227
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,516
Thank you very much.

228
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,956
- There's no need to thank me.
- Guess I lost my head.

229
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,198
Excuse me, can I use your sink here?

230
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,510
Help yourself.

231
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,909
You're working too hard.
You'll get yourself tore up.

232
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,389
You ain't gonna be fit to work.

233
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,112
A few days are OK but you get yourself
stove up, you might as well pack it in,

234
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,034
get yourself another boss,
cos I don't need no cripple.

235
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,509
The towel's under your hat.

236
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,398
I aim to get this drive done.

237
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,950
It's gonna be a long, hard pull.
You're gonna have to be fit.

238
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,879
Well, I imagine I can handle it.

239
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,555
I don't count on miracles.

240
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,878
Don't mind me. I always eat this way.

241
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,000
Do you mind if I do the same thing?

242
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,389
Suit yourself.

243
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,916
Excuse me.

244
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,275
Tragedies Of Shakespeare.

245
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,030
I'm sorry. I didn't know... I'm sorry.

246
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,350
It's my bills.

247
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,749
That's where I keep my bills.

248
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,076
Appropriate, ain't it?

249
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,796
(Frank clears his throat)

250
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,510
That paint horse
is gonna make a nice calf horse.

251
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,790
Nice house.

252
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,238
I noticed you had a clean spot
on that wall over there.

253
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,910
Mm. Used to be a clock.

254
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,313
Great-Grandad gave it
to my mom and dad for their wedding.

255
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,994
Like him, it was a noisy old thing.

256
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,590
Couldn't get a moment's peace.

257
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,869
It sure is peaceful now.

258
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,950
I got the rest of them
rounded up near the high mesa.

259
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,069
And them broncs of yours
are the smartest I've ever seen.

260
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,994
Took me three days
but I got them all gathered.

261
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,036
Hello, Buck.

262
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,399
You got some damn fine horses
for this madness of yours, though.

263
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,268
- Got enough?
- I wouldn't be here if we didn't.

264
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,999
Enough if he works with us?

265
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,392
- You think you're up to this?
- The way he talks, he better be.

266
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,910
Well... you look all right.

267
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,118
I just hope you don't go bad on us
when we need you the most.

268
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,351
I try not to make a habit
of going bad on folks, old fella.

269
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,637
My name's Dodger, if you don't mind.

270
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,716
You got a place of your own.
Why do you want to throw in with us?

271
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,558
How did you get so old
being so damn nosy?

272
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,713
Luck and brains, I guess.
You gonna answer the question?

273
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,950
You gonna give me a chew?

274
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,236
You sure picked a lulu.

275
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,396
Thank you.

276
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,716
Just don't take it all.

277
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,794
I think I got you figured.

278
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,475
- Let's get the gear.
- All right.

279
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,352

- You ever been married, Buck?
- I've never been that drunk. You?

288
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,431
No. I went with an old gal for quite a while.

289
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,431
We was laying in bed one morning
and suddenly she sprung it on me.

290
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,749
She said, "Dodger, don't you think it's
about time that we was getting hitched?"

291
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,515

(Ella) Ewing's moving his cattle
on your land.

296
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,676
He's gonna try to cross.

297
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,035
I believe you're on my land.

298
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,318
Take them around the long way,
we lose two to four pounds apiece.

299
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,192
- This is the best way.
- Don't mean a damn to me.

300
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,592
- I'll pay passage fees.
- I imagine you will.

301
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,753
You let him cross here,
he's gonna walk all over you.

302
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,037
This is a legal challenge.
He tried to do this to my dad.

303
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,076
Let me tend to my business.

304
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,235
- How many head are you bringing?
- A thousand.

305
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,788
He's pissing on you, Athearn.

306
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,714
Look like you're halfway through now.

307
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,554
Come on! Hyah!

308
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,356
Athearn.

309
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,036
Thanks.

310
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,639
Appreciate you helping out back there.

311
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,556
Think about working with me, Frank,
not against me.

312
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,153
The only thing I want you to appreciate

313
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,357
is I never want to see
you or your cattle on my land again.

314
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,671
Do you understand that?
Do you understand it?

315
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,192
(Dodger) Hello, Buck.

316
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,193
I'll be back for my things.

317
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,236
Well? What happened?

318
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,112
He was letting Ewing
run his cattle across his land.

319
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,077
Yeah?

320
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,074
I stampeded Ewing's cattle.

321
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,391
JW couldn't have split you two up
any more if he'd used a broad axe on you.

322
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,636
Can't trust Athearn.

323
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,595
Yeah, he's kinda sneaky all right.

324
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,798
All his talking up like he does
and having common sense.

325
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,715
It's real bad business.

326
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,189
(Hoedown music and chattering)

327
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,268
Sure did gather them cows
in a hurry, didn't you?

328
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,035
Yeah, we're just hell on wheels,
as you probably know.

329
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,552
Are you still looking for that dog to kick?

330
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:01,753
Damn, you're the one to jump in
when you don't know the right direction.

331
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,830
But you know, you gotta go back
quite a ways to make this all fit in.

332
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,074
- Guess I'm gonna have to hear this.
- Just the important part.

333
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,720
That's all that matters.

334
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,833
Well...

335
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,230
JW Ewing and Tom Connors,

336
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,393
they was raised like brothers
instead of cousins.

337
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,149
Tom never would give in to JW.

338
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,995
He wouldn't budge one inch on the land,
and he raised Ella as a fighter.

339
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,274
He tried to make her a son
that he needed but he never did have.

340
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,835
She was weaned on war.

341
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,069
She never knew nothing else.

342
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,149
They got a word down in Texas. Stargazer.

343
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,314
That's an old horse
that's had his bit jerked on real hard

344
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,474
whenever he'd slow up
or look down at the ground.

345
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,870
So to get away from that
he'd hold his head up

346
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,509
and always look at the sky.

347
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,592
That's Ella.

348
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,873
Something I can do for you?

349
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,679
This here's Ralph Cole.

350
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,716
Ewing has him round the place

351
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,998
to keep them windmills going
with that hot air of his, I think.

352
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,636
I'd sure like to know why he's on the prowl.

353
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,109
- Emil Kroegh was my buddy.
- Ah.

354
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,796
I understand why
they keep this old windbag around.

355
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,555
The only thing he's good for
is mending fences or sugar tooting.

356
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,279
But I heard you were a real cowman.

357
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,229
Shit, you ain't nothing but a paper bat
that couldn't lick his upper lip.

358
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,791
Well, any horse's ass
that would work for a woman,

359
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,111
he don't deserve nothing better
than road-apple pie.

360
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,558
I guess we know how Ella's paying you off.

361
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,711
Damn.

362
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,510
Drink your beer, Dodger.

363
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,515
I'm sure sorry, fellas.

364
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,715
We'll cover it.

365
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,473
I say you ought not have done that.

366
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,275
Look, you tell your boss
to stay clear of me.

367
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,116
Go on.

368
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,949
Didn't want you sneaking back
for your cattle.

369
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,476
I'm obliged. Where did you find them?

370
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,075
Ain't so hard if you know where to look.

371
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,991
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

372
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,190
Fine.

373
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,758
I can offer you a little water if you like.

374
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,354
We hid your cattle on you.

375
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,591
Figure it'd stretch more work out of you.

376
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,877
- Don't much matter.
- Yes, it does.

377
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,394
Ain't never cheated a man in my life.

378
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,237
Even had you stayed,
we'd have given them back.

379
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,437
- It's all right. How about the water?
- No.

380
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,155
I'm not gonna consider it a debt,
you taking a mouthful of water.

381
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,393
Woman, what in the hell
is the matter with you?

382
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,917
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means what's the matter with you?

383
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,356
Why don't you just say what you gotta say
instead of that nonsense about cattle?

384
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,512
You and the old man can't make it alone.

385
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,957
So you need me.
Well, I figure I need you, too.

386
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,237
I could make this work for a year
but then I'd have to pack it in

387
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,995
and then I figure you do, too.

388
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,513
- Sure like to figure, don't you?
- Yes, ma'am. It helps.

389
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,149
Look, I don't want to take over your ranch

390
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,676
but I'm not coming back as a hired hand.

391
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,316
- I ain't never had no partner.
- It's not real hard to figure out why.

392
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,750
For the season.

393
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,514
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

394
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,920
There's one more little thing.

395
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,872
I sure hate the way you say my name.

396
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,997
Athearn. Sounds like you're sneezing.

397
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,950
So I thought maybe we could call each
other by our first names, Frank and Ella.

398
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,349
- All right.
- Ma'am?

399
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,675
- All right.
- All right what?

400
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,798
All right, Frank.

401
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,519
- Jesus.
- There you go.

402
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,989
See you in the morning.

403
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,875
Hyah! Hyah!

404
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,597
Hyah! Hyah!

405
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,520
- Who says it's full?
- Oh, my God!

406
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,355
Morning, Ella. Can you spare a minute?

407
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:55,878
(Ella) Come in. This here's Virg Hoverton,
my banker, Frank.

408
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,829
- Guess you know about Frank Athearn.
- Morning, Miss Connors. Athearn.

409
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,878
Pleasure to meet you, Mr Athearn.

410
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,511
This is Neil Atkinson.
I'm sure you've heard of Atko Oil.

411
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,115
And this is George Bascomb,
his geologist.

412
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,079
I heard you were doing pretty good.
Still got a ways to go, though, huh?

413
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,393
I don't guess you came to talk about that.
If you've got something to say, say it.

414
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,391
You know, Miss Connors,
the characteristics of this valley

415
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,314
are almost identical to what we found
in other parts of the state

416
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,597
where there are substantial oil fields
in production.

417
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,035
There could be a lot of wealth in here.

418
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,476
But we can't really pinpoint
its exact location

419
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,710
without a more complete seismic record.

420
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,633
What he means is, they want to test for oil.

421
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,591
I'm not stupid, Virg. I also ain't interested.
You ought to know that by now.

422
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,515
I understand that. But have you given
any thought to what this means?

423
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,549
Hell, I imagine it means
you're gonna tear the earth apart.

424
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,431
You know, Ella, I admire you.

425
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,792
I've watched you and your father give
everything you had to this piece of land.

426
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,836
Now's your chance to make it pay.

427
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,593
I seen places where they drill for oil.

428
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,836
You better include my partner
in these dealings.

429
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,469
It's not just a question of a piece of land
or an oil company.

430
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,111
The war will be over soon and
we'll need more energy than ever before.

431
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,988
When it comes to land over the needs
of the people, I'd take people any time.

432
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,993
It sounds to me like
a bunch of speeches I heard

433
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,709
when they was trying to get me
to re-enlist in the army.

434
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,236
They sure don't seem
to have done a lot of good, do they?

435
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,831
I'm with the lady.

436
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,709
Got your answer, Virg.

437
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,191
You know, Ella,
you could lose this place overnight.

438
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,799
I know how you feel. I've dealt with a lot
of ranchers who feel the same way you do.

439
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,715
Think it over.
Good luck with your roundup.

440
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,631
Be seeing you, Virg.

441
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,670
I've been thinking. There could be
something to what that Atkinson said.

442
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,192
What are you talking about?

443
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,478
I mean, if you was to agree
and they was to find oil,

444
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,120
you'd have enough money,
you'd be set for life.

445
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:14,116
Then you'd be shed of Ewing and of me,
all them things that bother you so much.

446
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,272
I see you don't always
look at both sides of things.

447
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,954
Ain't about to start now.

448
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,031
Guess you're not.

449
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,188
I thought with all that oil money, hell,
you could buy you a nice house in the city.

450
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,829
Be a real fine lady. A real fine lady.

451
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,198
Drink champagne and eat that there caviar.

452
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,708
Drink tea with your pinkie up in the air.

453
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,112
Wear them nice little silk dresses
with them flowers all over it.

454
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,632
- Ain't that a pretty picture?
- Yes, ma'am. I think it is.

455
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,952
She'd never let you oil people
piss on that land,

456
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,429
even if it meant losing it to me.

457
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,670
I don't think she's gonna lose it to you.

458
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,356
She and Athearn are rounding up enough
cattle to see them through another year.

459
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,155
Ella and that young cowboy
make quite a team.

460
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,190
I admire you, Jacob.

461
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,034
My father always said you were
one of the last great empire builders.

462
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,395
Your father understood.

463
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,358
My father was a rich man's son
who played with money.

464
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,309
But I'm not him.

465
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,757
Of all the money my father lent you,
you've never paid back a cent.

466
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,674
I'm not asking you for the money
you owe my family.

467
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,320
But I want to test for oil on this land.

468
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,236
When my people have had a chance
to study the findings, we'll talk again.

469
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,597
And what if I don't go along with you?

470
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,513
I know how much
this ranch means to you, Jacob.

471
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,472
I'd hate to see you lose it.

472
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,711
(Explosions)

473
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,640
(Horse whinnies)

474
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,877
God damn.

475
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,112
(Gasps)

476
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,070
Let me get my air.

477
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,076
Frank!

478
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,309
(Galloping hooves approaching)

479
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,315
I just gotta get my air.

480
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,470
Get the truck.

481
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,673
Damn it.

482
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,795
(Explosions)

483
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,429
Doc says your limbs
are gonna be fine, old man.

484
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,114
Gonna have to stay put for a while.

485
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,839
Hell, I ain't that sick.

486
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,436
Besides, we still got
a hell of a lot of work to do.

487
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,511
Well, we got us a bunch.

488
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:48,754
Man's trying to tell you he's as straight
as a skeeter's peter during mating season.

489
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,513
(Dodger laughs)

490
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,315
I've been watching you pretty close, Buck.

491
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,110
I can tell you was taught by old Joe Voss.

492
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,112
He's as good a cowboy as I ever met.

493
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,636
I figure you could cut his trail any old day.

494
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,280
I never had his seam squirrels.

495
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,955
I always figured
that's what made him so fast.

496
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,068
He was the most cootie-laden critter
God ever put hair on.

497
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,435
But he was a cowboy.

498
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,270
I imagine.

499
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,000
Are you gonna give me a chew, Buck?

500
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,156
Hell, you bet.

501
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,273
All I got here is this Copenhagen.

502
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,029
Well, that's good enough.

503
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,710
I thought it might be.

504
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,150
You save me a pinch, now.

505
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,269
I'm gonna go tend to the horses.

506
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,716
Ella.

507
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,110
You ought to know better than anyone,

508
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,273
I won't allow no lying under my roof...

509
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,869
except some of my own tall tales.

510
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,431
But I know and you know,

511
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,629
my roping and riding days is over.

512
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,349
Who's top dog, baby sister?

513
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,800
The one that fights the hardest.

514
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:48,276
No matter what you think,
your dad would be damn proud of you.

515
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,029
Whoa, son.

516
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,916
(Groans softly)

517
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,955
(Breathes heavily)

518
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,871
Steady.

519
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,676
(Distant thunder rumbling)

520
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,480
(Flies buzzing)

521
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,948
My garden's dying.

522
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,190
It just needs a little water.

523
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,637
Windmill broke.

524
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,277
It's just an old machine.

525
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,272
(Explosions)

526
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,600
God damn you, Ewing!

527
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,514
God damn your soul!

528
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,471
(Frank) I imagine we got us
a big enough herd right now.

529
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,635
No sense getting hoggish
about the whole thing.

530
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,713
Especially with the weather getting bad
as it is. It kind of spooks me.

531
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,029
We turned out them good bulls
and nice heifers.

532
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,759
You have a nice start for next year.

533
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:35,511
I guess what I'm saying is
we could just go with what we got.

534
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,229
What do you think?

535
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,275
I slept with Ewing.

536
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,355
I slept with Ewing when I was a girl.

537
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,351
He was always watching me.

538
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,639
I was forbid to go near him
but he was always watching me and...

539
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,715
I'd come home from school
or I'd be out working the herd,

540
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,234
out by myself somewhere.

541
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,794
He'd be there just looking at me
and waiting.

542
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,714
Never said nothing, just...

543
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,836
just watching me and waiting.

544
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,631
And he had me.

545
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,869
My dad won a law case against him
over the land.

546
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,671
One night me and Dodger
and my dad were eating supper

547
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,672
and he rode up yelling
for my dad to come outside.

548
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,479
I stood right next to my dad on the porch.

549
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,594
Ewing told him every damn thing we did.

550
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,358
My dad looked at me to tell him
it wasn't true and I couldn't do it.

551
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,676
Just broke him. Just broke him.

552
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,911
I hate him.

553
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,436
I hate him.

554
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,871
It's gonna be...

555
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,630
nearly impossible for the two of us
to drive the herd down the hill,

556
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:46,239
so I was thinking
we ought to hire some hands

557
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,949
to help us get them
from here down on the ranch...

558
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,793
then from, uh...

559
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,635
you know, from the ranch to
wherever the hell it is we're gonna sell 'em.

560
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:08,469
I was just thinking I ought to go into town
and hire us some help.

561
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,514
I thought maybe I'd go tomorrow.

562
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,990
What do you think?

563
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,829
Hm?

564
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,157
Yeah.

565
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,595
- How was your trip?
- A bit rough.

566
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,716
There was turbulence in the mountains.

567
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,191
These are all records of the seismic
shooting we've done on your ranch.

568
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:26,795
We completely covered your land,
all the way to Ella Connors' property line.

569
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,351
The only place where it would be
economically feasible for us to drill a test

570
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,237
would be somewhere in here.

571
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,949
That's on the Connors ranch
and she's not gonna let us drill there.

572
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,916
But there's another possibility.

573
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,675
We could drill diagonally, under her land,

574
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,992
from the edge of the creek
at this point on your property.

575
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,038
We wouldn't have to put
any hardware on her land.

576
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,157
- We might get her permission.
- Thank you, George.

577
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,275
You can leave the reports here.

578
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,917
Thank you.

579
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,954
Now what are you going to do?

580
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,873
Wait her out, and hope, like you do,
that she'll go under.

581
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,077
That could take quite a while.

582
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,480
Yeah, it could.

583
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,470
In the meantime,

584
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,597
what do I do to protect my interests
from you?

585
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,234
If you could stop me, you would.

586
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,756
The only way to protect myself

587
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,355
is to have the Ewing ranch in my name.

588
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,273
I've gone over the whole situation.

589
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,398
With whom?

590
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,710
With Hoverton. With the bank.

591
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,269
Did you talk to Hoverton
about taking over my ranch?

592
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,320
Well, you don't own the bank, Jacob.

593
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,756
There was a time.

594
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,239
I'll make it as easy as I can for you.

595
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,313
We'll behave as if
you were still the owner of the ranch.

596
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,792
If you were in my position and you thought
there was a chance for oil in this valley,

597
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,474
wouldn't you protect yourself
by taking it over?

598
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,028
If you were me, what would you do?

599
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,872
I'd squeeze so hard
your nuts would fall off.

600
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,235
Hey, Neil, you don't have to leave.

601
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,114
Might as well make yourself at home.

602
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,908
Hell, the house is as good as yours now.

603
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,436
Tell me, Neil.

604
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,594
When you retire me,
are you gonna give me a gold watch?

605
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,070
JW.

606
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,230
Sit down, boys.

607
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,190
Ella and that soldier boy

608
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,670
have rounded up enough cattle
to hang on for another year.

609
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,348
You hadn't ought to worry about that, JW.

610
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,830
Just because they've got them penned

611
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,753
sure don't mean
that they're gonna stay penned.

612
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:28,111
They could be stopped real easy.

613
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,556
Ever since there have been Ewings,

614
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,719
there's been Blockers and Coles
at their side.

615
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,113
Through everything.

616
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,510
Nesters. Rustlers. All our enemies.

617
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,475
When I was a boy,
I saw a bulldog take a bull by the nose

618
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,120
and wrestle him to the ground.

619
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:13,432
The dog bit too hard
and the bull stomped that dog to death.

620
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,751
My boys...

621
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,712
we got a whole pack of dogs to deal with.

622
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,916
(Thunder)

623
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,556
(Gentle melody)

624
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,115
(Cattle lowing)

625
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,352
(Thunder crashing)

626
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,752
(Horses whinnying)

627
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,671
Hyah!

628
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,510
(Shouting)

629
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,632
(Horse neighs)

630
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,437
Hyah! Hup! Hyah!

631
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,592
(Shouting)

632
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,196
Hyah! Hyah!

633
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,192
(Man calls out dance steps)

634
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,236
(Jaunty fiddle music)

635
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,634
(Applause)

636
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,678
I imagine you'd like to try
one of them, huh?

637
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,398
Think you might like
to take your jacket off?

638
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,318
- (Caller) Let's do the Texas Star.
- (Cheering)

639
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,789
(Jaunty fiddle music)

640
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,874
(Caller) Bow to your partner
and bow to your corner.

641
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:31,350
Now turn your partner,
swing them round. Hey!

642
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,118
I'd better get started. I want to get
into those hills before it gets dark.

643
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,629
Julie, pick up some chow for Mr Atkinson.

644
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,188
- It's all taken care of, JW.
- Good.

645
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,555
Julie, I think you ought to know

646
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,632
we'll both be working for Mr Atkinson
from now on.

647
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,234
Is that a fact?

648
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:09,396
I appreciate you not saying anything
to anyone about taking over, Neil.

649
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,029
You'll see, Jacob.
Everything is gonna work out just fine.

650
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,032
(Caller) Into the centre, let's hear you yell.
(All) Whoa!

651
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,918
(Caller shouting out dance steps)

652
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,628
(Aeroplane overhead)

653
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,431
(Man) Good stock but a bit old.

654
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,398
I suspect a mite on the tough side.

655
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:13,190
- You know you won't find better beef.
- You should have sold it a long time ago.

656
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,557
Are we talking should-haves
and what-ifs or cattle?

657
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,072
(Frank) You won't need a pencil
to give us a price.

658
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,470
I like to make things official.

659
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,078
- You call that a price?
- I do.

660
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,197
You only have about 40 good head
in that whole herd.

661
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,391
Most of those cows' heads are sore
from being tied to the trees.

662
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:58,555
Army ain't buying any more. Everybody
knows the war is coming to an end.

663
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,518
I think five cents is a good price.

664
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,515
Well, I think...

665
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,675
there will be other buyers.

666
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,639
How about five and a half cents?

667
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,158
How about...

668
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,470
us thanking you for your time?

669
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:51,473
It's been a long trip. We appreciate it.
Now we'll just say goodbye.

670
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,151
Six cents and we do business.

671
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,915
I'm only doing that now
because I've known Ella so long.

672
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,549
That include delivery
or have we got to bring them in?

673
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,119
- No, you deliver.
- No.

674
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,197
We deliver,
I imagine we need another penny.

675
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:57,272
We're doing the work and all,
and weight loss.

676
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,952
Got to get another penny.

677
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,674
She was tough in the old days.

678
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:24,189
But the two of you is just plum awful.

679
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,354
OK. Seven cents.

680
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:33,279
And that's as high as I'm going to go now.

681
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,920
Is that a deal?

682
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,152
Deal.

683
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,551
Yeah, right.

684
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:56,555
Congratulations.
You're getting this place back on its feet.

685
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,870
Yeah.

686
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,394
I'll see you in town with them, then.

687
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:10,272
And don't be watering them just before
you get to town to add a little extra weight.

688
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,316
So long, Ellie.

689
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,758
So long, Cliff.

690
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,072
Imagine!

691
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,437
Sit down, Virgil.

692
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,836
Thanks, JW.

693
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,960
It's sad about Neil.

694
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,190
Yes, it is.

695
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:21,553
I understand
you're going over to Ella's later on

696
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:24,438
to pick up payment on her note.

697
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,238
Yes, I am.

698
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,709
Gonna celebrate?

699
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:34,199
Like you and Neil did
when you talked about taking me over?

700
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:39,113
Now, JW, it wasn't anything like that at all.

701
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:44,639
- I had no choice in the matter.
- I figure you did, Virgil.

702
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:50,396
JW, I have to tell you, I have
Neil's instructions regarding the ranch.

703
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,677
Oh. Neil left instructions...

704
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,792
to you?

705
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,908
Well, yes. I have to put the takeover
in the works.

706
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,434
But you don't have to worry, JW.

707
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:10,755
He left specific instructions that you were
to still run the ranch, at a good salary.

708
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,638
The ranch will still bear the Ewing name.

709
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,712
You're gonna be well taken care of, JW.

710
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,800
I hate to be the one to do this.

711
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,591
But you have to look at it
from my position, JW.

712
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:35,479
You see, my first responsibility
is to the bank.

713
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,120
You're talking to me about the bank?

714
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,115
My grandpa built that bank.

715
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,555
Well, I know that, JW.

716
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:48,713
Well you might, since you were the one
who came whining to us for money

717
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,870
when the bank was failing in '29.

718
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,915
We never failed you, Virgil.

719
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,033
Trusted you. And you sold us out.

720
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,389
Guess I've gotta rank you
with a dog, Virgil.

721
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,556
(Horse neighs)

722
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,236
Sit down.

723
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,075
Big day for you, ain't it?

724
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,316
Cattle to market, debts about to be paid.

725
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,355
New man in your life.

726
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,675
You'd best get out of here, JW.

727
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:55,310
I never wanted it to happen this way
but you left me no choice.

728
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,674
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

729
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,035
You don't give nothing.

730
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,515
If you want my land,
you're gonna have to kill me.

731
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,875
That's the way it's always been for you.

732
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,710
One of us had to kill the other.

733
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:19,873
No.

734
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,588
I just wanted to be left in peace
to work my land.

735
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,752
Whatever happens now,
you've brought it on yourself.

736
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,038
You're not gonna get away with it.
You know that.

737
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,315
Hoverton's on his way out here.

738
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,436
Frank!

739
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,875
(Coughs)

740
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,836
(Frank coughs and splutters)

741
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,636
Cut the rope on my hands.

742
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:56,790
(Coughing)

743
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,876
(Horse neighs)
