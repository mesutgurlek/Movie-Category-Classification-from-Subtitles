00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,763
where I picked up Mrs. Grange.

169
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,364
I'd say he was 2 days
dying, Apache style.

170
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:56,163
Then Chata's already come
north across the border

171
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,364
slaughtering anyone
they've run across.

172
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,997
Not without reason, Scotty.

173
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,696
The Apaches have been holed up

174
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:05,197
on that hellhole
reservation at San Carlos,

175
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,097
tricked, lied to, murdered...

176
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,997
it cuts both ways, Jess.

177
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,663
Bad enough when a man like
tom van ends the way he did.

178
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,830
When you find women and
children dead like that...

179
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,529
I've got to tell Maj.
Novac about van.

180
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,663
Wait a minute.

181
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,563
You sent me a message.

182
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:33,896
I'm here.

183
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,596
Aye.

184

[Bells tinkling]

185
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,863
That's a pretty nice scalp
you got there, mister.

186
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,863
I know where an Indian
scalp like that

187
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,030
would bring a pretty good price.

188
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,663
How much you want for it?

189
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,496
What was that, McAllister?

190
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,330
He was going to
kill you, Toller.

191
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,529
All I did was ask what he
wanted for the Indian scalp.

192
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,563
This Indian was his wife.

193
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,130
[Gasping]

194
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:38,397
What happened?

195
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,830
I hit you.

196
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:44,063
It's a good thing you did.

197
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,796
Where is it, Scotty?

198
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,464
Where'd you get it?

199
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,430
Ft. Concho, from
the town marshal.

200
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,230
New man. Clay Dean.

Clay Dean?

202
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:09,896
Aye. Killer for hire, wearing a badge.
You know the type.

204
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:16,830
Thanks, Scotty.

205
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:21,330
Dean may not be the man.

206
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:23,430
If he's not, he'll tell me.

207
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,629
The man who caught my wife alone is
gonna pay, and not just by dying.

208
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,097
He'll be praying...
stop it, Jess!

209
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,997
Apaches take revenge that way.
No civilized...

210
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,529
that was no Apache that
killed and scalped my wife.

211
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,763
That was one of
your civilized men.

212
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,297
We're heading for ft. Concho
in a couple of days, Jess.

213
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,230
I want you to come along.

214
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,663
You just wanna be with me
when I catch this man Dean.

215
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,230
You figure I'll let him die
quick and easy if you're there.

216
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,230
With tom van gone,
I need a scout.

217
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,097
No.

218
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:58,230
Jess. I've 2 wagon-loads of
ammunition and 25 green troopers.

219
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,896
Col. Foster needs them in ft.
Concho.

What are you bucking for?

221
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:06,696
I can't afford any
mistakes on my record.

222
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,097
I'm going to be a
general some day.

223
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:12,430
I don't remember you being
so damned ambitious.

224
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,730
I'm getting married
when I get to Concho.

225
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,197
Sgt. Neabamer's daughter.

226
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,030
She'll give you hell
if I don't get there.

227
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:33,263
I guess a week or so won't
make any difference.

228
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,529
We ought to bury that, Jess.

After I find the man
that took it off her.

Tell the major he'll
have to wait.

I've got some unfinished
business to take care of.

McAllister said you
wanted to kill me.

I don't much like that idea.

still in your mind.

Are you quite sure?

I said so.

00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,596
Then I apologize.

she was to those Apaches.

I can understand why you'd
want to run away, Mrs. Grange,

290
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:02,563
but there's something you
ought to think about.

291
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,030
If you go back to Chata's band,

292

his son, Nachee,

293
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:09,364
will most likely kill you
for running away from him.

294
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,397
I didn't run away.

295
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,663
I was taken away, unconscious.

296
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,163

while the men were out hunting.

00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:21,063
The trooper who gave me this

299
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,030
almost killed me before
he saw my blond hair.

300
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,997
But if I were your husband, Mrs.
Grange...

301
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:33,063
you are not my husband.

302
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,696
They all think any decent
woman would prefer to die

303
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,930
than live as an Apache squaw.

304
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,696
Maybe they're right.

305

00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:55,163
what's over is done.

309
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,197
You and your husband
could go someplace

where nobody knows
what happened to you.

311
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,563

00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:14,963
to accompany me to ft. Concho.

329
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,230
The army has to cooperate
with traders like Grange...

330
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,430
yes, sir, I understand.

331
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,063
He's been most helpful
to us many times.

332
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,430
Yes, sir. It's just that
with all green troopers,

333
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,496
and only 2 days
before we head out...

334
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,830
you don't have those
2 days, McAllister.

335
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:29,163
You'll be starting for ft.
Concho at dawn.

336
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:35,529
Sir, I need time to whip those raw
recruits into some kind of shape.

337
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,696
And half those horses Toller
delivered still aren't saddlebroke!

338
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:41,963
Then he will just have to finish
breaking them on the way to ft. Concho.

339
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,364
There's no time left... hold on!

340
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,030
My contract with the army calls for
delivery of fresh mounts to McAllister.

341
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,930
And I've delivered them.

342
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,330
Your contract reads that you'll be paid
for delivering saddlebroke horses.

343
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:55,130
It ain't my fault that he's got
to move out before I'm finished!

344
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,796
Sir, if I could have
just one more day.

345
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,230
You have your
orders, lieutenant.

346
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,297
Yes, sir.

347
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,430
Not with me, he don't!

348
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,397
Sir.

349
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:04,763
You can have your money for the 20
mustangs you've already broken.

350
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,696
If you want to get
paid for the rest,

351
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,596
you'll have to tag
along with McAllister.

352
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:11,629
He'll give you a receipt for every
horse you break in on the way,

353
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:14,796
and col. Foster will pay
you for them in Concho.

354
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:18,364
The men I hired to help catch those
mustangs are paid off and gone.

355
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,863
The clothes I lived in
for 4 months, I burned.

356
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,496
I didn't buy this new outfit
to eat no trail dust.

357
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:26,796
You're dealing me this off the bottom
of the deck. This is a swindle...

358
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:27,997
be careful, Toller!

359
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:29,629
You shut up, McAllister!

360
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:32,496
You don't scare me none.

361
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,596
And you sure can't
pull no rank on me.

362
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:36,997
Toller, I'm sorry.

363
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:39,730
But that's the way
it will have to be.

364
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,464
Hurry it up, Toller.

365
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:44,963
You might manage to break
another horse or 2 before dawn.

366
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:50,730
You enjoy seeing me on the
horn, don't you, McAllister?

367
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:53,197
You were a pretty good
sergeant once, Toller,

368
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:57,430
but to me, you're just another
money-hungry civilian.

369
00:30:57,496 --> 00:31:00,730
You used to be a pretty good
sergeant yourself, McAllister,

370
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,663
but now you're just...

371
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,696
a rank officer.

372
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,397

Yeah?

So?

395

Well, it doesn't make
any difference anyway.

400
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:03,730
She stole 2 horses, and
disappeared again last night.

No, why should I?

They could have sent
somebody after her.

Now, maybe she's got
too much of a start.

If she wants to go, she can go.

That's her son.

655
00:58:16,397 --> 00:58:17,796
Sorry, ma'am...

656
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,230
I didn't mean to...

657
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:25,896
Scotty, Harrington
didn't make it.

658
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,863
He was tortured before he died.

659
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,297
Probably told Chata
everything he knew.

660
00:58:33,364 --> 00:58:35,297
So Chata knows.

661
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:38,163
I'm waiting here for reinforcements
that aren't going to arrive?

662
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,430
He also knows what you
got in those wagons.

663
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:43,030
He wants that ammunition
and the glory.

664
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:46,063
And he gets both
by wiping us out.

665
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,963
Which makes him bigger than
ever with the Apaches.

666
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:50,796
Jess.

667
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,197
We've got to break
out and find water.

668
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:57,230
Where?

669
00:58:57,297 --> 00:59:00,297
There's only 2 places
between here and Concho.

670
00:59:00,364 --> 00:59:02,563
One of them's where Chata
left his families,

671
00:59:02,629 --> 00:59:04,596
20 miles inside those hills.

672
00:59:04,663 --> 00:59:07,063
With those wagons,
you'll never outrun him.

673
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,730
And the other place?

674
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,297
Diablo canyon.

675
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:13,330
Just a half a mile from
where Chata's sitting.

676
00:59:13,397 --> 00:59:17,130
But Diablo is a box canyon.
There's only one way in.

677
00:59:17,197 --> 00:59:19,830
I spotted 4 or 5 Apaches
just inside the rocks.

678
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:22,263
That's all he'll need
to hold you out.

679
00:59:23,997 --> 00:59:28,663
Weli... what's next... general?

680
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,830
How old is he, ma'am?

681
00:59:38,896 --> 00:59:40,197
4 months.

682
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:41,830
He don't favor his
mother, that's for sure.

683
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:43,330
[Man chuckles]

684
00:59:44,696 --> 00:59:46,163
That's yours?

685
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:48,663
Yes.

686
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,397
You didn't tell me that...

687
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,830
why?

688
00:59:52,896 --> 00:59:55,930
After the way you acted?

689
00:59:55,997 --> 01:00:00,263
So you ran off the first chance
you got to get back to this...

690
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,997
half-breed bastard!

691
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:03,464
Ah, come off it, Grange.

692
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:04,963
You stay out of this, Toller!

693
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,730
That's just a little
baby that's Ali...

694
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:08,663
you keep your mouth
shut or I'll...

695
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:18,663
you were saying?

696
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,230
Pick it up.

697
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:24,997
Be careful, Grange.

698
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:27,063
I told you to pick it up.

699
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,297
You got another one in your holster,
use that one or back water.

700

[Gun fires]

701
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,997
You two can play games
some other time.

702
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:57,263
Right now, we can't spare
either one of you.

703
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:10,130
You ought to play poker, Grange.

704
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:11,696
You got natural luck.

705
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,863
It. McAllister would
like to see you two.

706
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,297
[Scotty] Look, we
set out at dark

707
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:32,330
with the wagons for Concho.

708
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,496
Chata's not likely to follow us

709
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:36,163
till he's sure we're
not just trying

710
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,230
to feint him out of the canyon.

711
01:01:38,297 --> 01:01:39,896
He'll just scout us,

712
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:43,063
knowing he can catch us easy
enough when he's ready.

713
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:45,997
After a couple of hours

714
01:01:46,997 --> 01:01:48,930
I'll shift direction...

715
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:52,330
strike straight for where
he's left his families.

716
01:01:52,397 --> 01:01:55,997
His scouts will race
back to report it.

717
01:01:56,063 --> 01:01:59,763
Chata will have to
come out to stop us.

718
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,197
Only by then, I'll have
changed direction again.

719
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:08,263
Circling back to
Diablo canyon...

720
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,563
getting there

721
01:02:10,629 --> 01:02:12,997
before Chata realizes
what's happened.

722
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:19,330
You might make general one day.

723
01:02:19,397 --> 01:02:22,263
Except he'll probably
leave some men

724
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,796
in the entrance to that canyon,

725
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:26,030
just in case.

726
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:28,364
That's something you'll
have to take care of

727
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,663
before you set out for Concho.

728

You and the 4 best
men I've got left.

730
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:43,763
He's not under my orders.

731
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,163
But I'm thirsty, too

732
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,297
and I'm getting thirstier.

733

Sir, are you sure you're able?

As far as I'm concerned,

your job's done when
you report to Concho.

don't return with col. Foster.

Aye?

Keep an eye on Ellen Grange

"now and in the

Ferguson!

990
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,230
It's time to collect
that dry brush

991
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:53,796
and get it under
that ammo wagon.

992
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:55,763
If they rush us,

993
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:57,963
that wagon better burn fast.

Mrs. Grange!

Somebody's got to kill him.

998
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:48,529
Put an end to what
they're doing.

Ugh!

01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:52,830
Mrs. Grange.

1001
01:35:02,796 --> 01:35:04,930
Give me the gun and get down.

1002
01:35:24,496 --> 01:35:25,529
No.

1003
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,230
Oh.

[Moaning]

It's all up to you now, Toller.

1006
01:35:42,063 --> 01:35:45,097
Don't let them get
the ammunition.

1007
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:47,596
Chata won't get that ammunition

1008
01:35:47,663 --> 01:35:49,696
even if he wipes us out.

1009
01:35:49,763 --> 01:35:53,197
And he's lost too many men
against a force half his size.

1010
01:35:53,263 --> 01:35:55,030
And you did it.

1011
01:35:55,097 --> 01:35:56,130
No.

1012
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:59,563
I killed most of my men.

1013
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:02,297
Chata had to be stopped
and you stopped him.

1014
01:36:02,364 --> 01:36:05,430
That's what the army's out
here to do, ain't it?

1015
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:07,963
Is it?

1016
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,963
Yes.

you tell them that...

[Grange screams]

You sure this is what you
want to do, Mrs. Grange?

1024
01:37:17,896 --> 01:37:19,863
I don't want him to die.

1025
01:37:21,097 --> 01:37:22,930
Chata will take care of him.

1026
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,563
And raise him as an Apache.

1027
01:37:26,629 --> 01:37:29,896
My people would never raise
him as one of their own.

1028
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:39,796
They're getting
ready for the kill.

1029
01:37:39,863 --> 01:37:42,197
We better get back to the wagon.

1030
01:37:43,364 --> 01:37:44,997
Now, Mrs. Grange.

1031

They're coming, all of them.

1034
01:38:43,397 --> 01:38:45,230
If they get me, you
fire this wagon.

Let me go to him, please!

I'll find him.
