What happened?

Shot in the heart. Tied up
to a Mexican drug cartel operative.

Kind of like what we did in Iraq.

But why would the cartel kill
one of their own guys too?

275
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,850
Maybe Freddy and Octavio
double-crossed the cartel somehow.

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,887
Cheated them out of money.
Stole product.

277
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,114
Or maybe Mathias
ran the drug trade...

278
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,123
...and the cartel was his competition.

279
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,491
That would explain why Mathias
never informed us about his raid.

280
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,155
If Freddy wasn't working
with Mathias or the gangs...

It may be funny to you.

to come, trying to set us up.

You ever wonder if it was just you?

- Yeah.

Yeah, no, I would love that information.

Thank you.

Yeah, hey, ahem.
Did that car come with a GPS?

It did?

00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,939
Heard the chatter on the radio.

- No.

Just curious
why Octavio Mora's rental car...

Okay, well, at least now, we can put
Freddy and Octavio together.

They entered the woods alive,
floated out dead.

VIC: After the cartel
got kicked off the res...

341
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,332
...maybe they set up shop
in the national forest?

342
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,526
It's remote. Freddy could've been
looking for a new place to grow pot.

Call the forest service.
Have them poke around.

Nothing.

- You got a problem?
WALT: No, question.

348

If these murders are about the cartel
seeking vengeance...

349
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,462
...why are you still alive?
- Because I stood up to them.

They know not to mess with me.

to run them off?

By the way, what happened
to all that pot you seized, Mathias?

353
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,245
You think I'm involved
in the drug trade, sheriff?

- Just say it.
- I just did.

355

So I raided the cartel's grow
just to knock out the competition?

in these murders?

What do you think? Seem like
something he might be capable of?

00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,307
I hope not.

361
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:18,711
But, then again, all men are capable
of killing under the right circumstances.

Yep.

But when I got closer,

I didn't wanna get too close,

Look, Nomar. Nobody will know
you talked to me.

You just tell everyone

We have receipts
that say you used cash.

- From a Cheyenne boy, Freddy.

He would drop off bags of cash to me
from El Lupo.

This forest covers 1.2 million acres.
So we better start looking.

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,895
See if you can reach Eli.

455
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,178
I tracked these pipes
from that pot farm we found.

It is called Khyber Kush.
It is a rare strain.
