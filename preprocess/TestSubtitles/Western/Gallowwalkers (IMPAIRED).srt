1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,207
(man narrating)
Legend goes

2
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,942
that somewhere beneath
these mountains lies

3
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,979
a gateway
between heaven and hell.

4
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,218
It is said
that a sacred sisterhood
guards this portal

5
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,588
and the power of their prayers
keeps the damned

6
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,356
from tormenting the living.

7
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:31,029
Trouble with the damned is
they never stay put.

8
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,824
(bleating)

9
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,020
(splashing)

10
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,932
(hoofbeats)

11
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:38,814
(breathing heavily)

12
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,226
(horse neighs)

13
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:21,256
(footsteps)

14
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,713
(grunting)

15
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,784
(grunting)

16
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:10,039
(laughing)

17
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:18,013
(echoing)
My son.

18
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:21,283
We'll make a man
of him, eh, Red?

19
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,018
(laughter continues)

20
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,408
- What's wrong with ya?
- (Red laughing)

21
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,044
- Be a man!
- (laughs)

22
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:36,115
(caws)

23
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,840
(cawing)

24
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,776
(wind blowing)

25
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:08,530
(birds cawing)

26
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:18,841
(flies buzzing)

27
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,494
(distant rumbling)

28
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,554
Man:
Good to see you again.

29
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,106
(horse neighs)

30
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:00,492
(muffled)
Where is he?

31
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:03,345
Boss is careful
where he goes.

32
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:06,582
We've had
a little trouble.

33
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,735
Why so many horses?

34
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:20,161
Boss sent Red and me.

35
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,348
And now there's just me.

36
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,968
Like I've-- like I've said,
we've had a little trouble.

37
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,387
You brought
two too many.

38
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,346
Man:
I didn't bring that one.

39
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:41,617
(birds cawing)

40
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,257
(spurs jingling)

41
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:20,322
(spurs jingling)

42
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,802
You remember me.

43
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:43,612
- (gun cocks)
- (grunts)

44
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:17,896
(gun clicks)

45
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,411
(spurs jingling)

46
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,522
Where is he?

47
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,308
He did not come.

48
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,204
(squelching)

49
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,139
(grunts, laughing)

50
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,576
Still he eludes you.

51
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,815
- (man growls)
- (sobs)

52
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,950
(man laughing)

53
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,052
God's not gonna save ya.

54
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,656
(growls, grunts)

55
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,910
I was to meet him here.

56
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:28,616
(grunts)

57
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:33,121
I know nothing more.

58
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,224
(gasps)

59
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:45,366
(cawing)

60
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:55,760
(man narrating)
Most times when you bring
a man to justice,

61
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:59,481
the axe swings,
the noose tightens.

62
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,567
That's it.

63
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:05,654
Out here,
they come back...

64
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:08,957
Harder to kill.

65
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:13,711
The way I finish them--
rip out their heads.

66
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:16,364
As for these men...

67
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,300
Target practice.

68
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,656
(shallow breathing)

69
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:28,343
(metal squeaking)

70
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,768
(mutters)

71
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,745
(clacking)

72
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,416
(creaks,
squeaking stops)

73
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:12,253
Man:
Might I say that among
my many miracles

74
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:14,889
And holy relics,

75
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:18,810
I do carry certain
apothecary notes.

76
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:23,448
In these forbidding parts,

77
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,201
I sense a woman
is a rarity,

78
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:30,688
which means
a man must improvise.

79
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:42,367
What piece of you
can I buy for a dollar?

80
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:44,602
My pity.

81
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,606
I was being kind.

82
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:51,643
I like my men
heartless.

83
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,411
Man #2:
Get back to your post.

84
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,431
(horse neighs)

85
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,936
(boot rustles)

86
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:07,759
Well...

87
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,295
- That was clever.
- (men chuckle)

88
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,564
Fancy bitch.

89
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:17,502
You a thief?

90
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,570
(sighs)

91
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,297
You don't look
like a thief.

92
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,015
I'm a dancer.

93
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,103
So where'd you learn
a trick like that?

94
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:39,374
Ballet school.

95
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,081
You know if you cross
his path again,

96
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,849
he's liable to kill you.

97
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:51,186
Death ain't the worst thing
that can happen to you.

98
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:54,522
(exhales)

99
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:56,741
You ever heard
of the Gallowwalkers?

100
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:59,744
- (gasps)
- (guns rattle)

101
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,086
(chains rattling)

102
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,578
This special tonic

103
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,632
will cure all ailments...

104
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:23,751
- (bugle trumpeting)
- ...And keep the undead
at bay.

105
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:26,070
(rumbling)

106
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,538
Man #2:
Dang priest!

107
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,357
All right, the wagon's here!
Get 'em all up!

108
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,458
- Move!
- Go on!

109
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,060
- Whore, get up.
- Get in line!

110
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,995
- Line up, boys!
- Move! Move it!

111
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:36,081
- Okay, go on! Move!
- Go on, get up!

112
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,649
Go on, you piece of shit.

113
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:39,150
- Move your sorry ass.
- Go on!

114
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:41,936
- Go on, get in there!
- (watch ticking)

115
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,663
(gunfire)

116
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:53,197
- Woman: Oh!
- (grunts)

117
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,968
- (grunts)
- (gunfire stops)

118
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,705
- (horses neighing)
- (men groan)

119
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:13,401
- (gunfire)
- (chain clangs)

120
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:35,873
(chain clinks)

121
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,098
(gun fires)

122
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,022
(coach rattling)

123
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:24,071
(sighs)

124
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:28,376
What's a girl
gotta do to get
rescued around here?

125
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,144
(chain rattles)

126
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,788
(breathing heavily)

127
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:56,554
Hyah.

128
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:17,191
- Man: You that good or was
that a lucky shot?
- Lucky for you.

129
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:23,281
- Man: So now I owe you?
- Now you owe me.

130
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:25,666
Hup.

131
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:33,491
- Man: You got
a job in mind?
- Yes.

132
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:38,796
(whip snaps)

133
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,097
Priest: Sir...

134
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,067
Do you know
where we are bound?

135
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,838
Enoch's hammer.

136
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,808
Priest:
Sounds like a church town,
a place of tolerance.

137
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,876
They will look kindly
on one of their own.
Yeah?

138
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:57,899
So cruelly treated,
so manifestly wronged.

139
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:59,400
You know this place?

140
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,603
I have family there.

141
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:04,038
Seven brothers
and sisters.

142
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,825
All in the same grave.

143
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,631
(choir singing)

144
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,168
Whoa. Whoa there!

145
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,040
(singing continues)

146
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:49,451
Man:
Brothers and sisters
of Enoch's hammer,

147
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,020
eternally pure of heart,

148
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,556
We have gathered here
to bear witness

149
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,592
to god's justice
on the wicked

150
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:00,028
and the damned.

151
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:05,466
Bow now
your golden heads

152
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,852
and pray for their souls.

153
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:13,090
- Get out.
Come on. Come on.
- Get down.

154
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,893
- Hyah!
- (chattering)

155
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,463
- Git!
- Get up, boy.

156
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:21,632
- Get off.
- Come on, you.

157
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:24,669
- Git!
- Come on, little lady.

158
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,971
- Get up. Git!
- Woman: Oh. Oh!

159
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,236
Welcome, pilgrims.

160
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,757
I do not
call you prisoners...

161
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:51,112
Nor do
I call these gallows.

162
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,314
These are the gates

163
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,433
of your salvation.

164
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,120
For this sacrifice,

165
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:04,108
God has chosen you

166
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,227
as the lamb,

167
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,546
just as he chose me

168
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:11,482
to help
these righteous people

169
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:14,501
spread justice
across the land.

170
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:19,090
I was once a sinner.

171
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:20,958
Dancer:
Damn right you were,

172
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,710
Cherry Gaza,

173
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:25,746
Y'all virgin eater.

174
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:27,215
You whore of Babylon.

175
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,718
You painted cat.

176
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,453
You womb of vipers!

177
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:35,089
The smell of Jezebel
has no power

178
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,440
over me now.

179
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,945
When I saw the devil

180
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,580
rise up from his grave...

181
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,401
Priest:
Sir, to whom do we
plead our case?

182
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:50,905
- St. Peter!
- You cannot hang us
without a trial.

183
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:53,691
(grunts)

184
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,294
I can...
And I will!

185
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,397
You've already been judged

186
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:03,084
and found wanting
in the eyes of the lord!

187
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:05,286
It is through his mercy

188
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:07,755
that he's brought you here
to be cleansed by the rope,

189
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,490
just as he cleansed me

190
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:11,025
when I saw the devil

191
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:13,494
rise from the dust!

192
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:19,333
I'll be needing a shirt.

193
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,486
We've only got
one color, sir.

194
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:41,956
Can't go wrong
with white.

195
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:47,328
I'll do my best, sir.

196
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,063
We keep more
out the back.

197
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:57,455
(grunts, screaming)

198
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,194
Kiss cut.
And you must be...?

199
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:15,356
(thunder rumbles)

200
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:20,561
(blades slicing)

201
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,824
What do you think?

202
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,359
Is it me?

203
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,299
- How many?
- Five.

204
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:17,318
Hmm.

205
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:59,827
All right, stranger,

206
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:02,630
I'm gonna
have to see your face.

207
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:04,465
(breathing deeply)

208
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,400
(bones cracking)

209
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:55,516
- (gunshots)
- (people screaming)

210
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:58,552
(gunshot)

211
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:04,725
The cuffs are a little long.

212
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:12,116
(gunshots)

213
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:14,952
Bring 'em in.

214
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:19,556
(clangs)

215
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:24,411
- (horses neighing)
- (gunfire)

216
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,051
(screams)

217
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,537
Ooh!

218
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:37,007
And hell came forth
with chains and whips,

219
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,926
the horsemen
of the apocalypse.

220
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,422
(bird shrieks)

221
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:22,720
(insects chittering)

222
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,624
Whoa.

223
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,361
I'm not taking
another step until you
give me some answers.

224
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,021
(rattling)

225
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:29,487
I'm standing right here.

226
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:37,094
You see this?
My fucking hands hurt.

227
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:04,922
Hey.

228
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,714
Put it on.

229
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:43,410
(clangs)

230
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,652
Tsk tsk tsk.

231
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:01,995
(breathes heavily)

232
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,742
- (footsteps)
- (groans)

233
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:26,169
(loud bang)

234
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:28,856
(distant voices wailing)

235
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,426
(growling)

236
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:57,934
(gunshot)

237
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:05,259
- (thumps)
- (clanks)

238
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:07,828
- (footsteps)
- (panting)

239
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,966
(barrel spins)

240
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:24,278
(grunts)

241
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,296
Any good
with your left?

242
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:35,105
(clanks)

243
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:37,441
(coughs)

244
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:44,414
(growling)

245
00:31:56,894 --> 00:31:58,562
(clanks)

246
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:00,497
(panting)

247
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:13,543
(soft growling)

248
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:44,391
(clicks)

249
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:10,000
(coins clink)

250
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:11,852
Aman:
Half now.

251
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,955
Half when you've
finished the job.

252
00:33:16,157 --> 00:33:17,557
How many more?

253
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,611
It doesn't matter.

254
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:22,762
It only matters
if it's too many for you.

255
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,549
You gonna give me
some answers about
those things?

256
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:32,973
Aman:
Now that's starting a story

257
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:34,924
at the end.

258
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:38,512
It begins with a whore.

259
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:42,682
She's with child
when the mines dry up,

260
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:45,219
so she becomes a thief.

261
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,853
But not very good.

262
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:49,556
She's headed
for the gallows

263
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,659
when the sisters
of San Diablo find her.

264
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:56,397
They take her in
and teach her the secrets

265
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,932
of the dead.

266
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:03,337
When the boy child is born,
they tell her,

267
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:04,922
"you must give him up.

268
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:08,391
The gateway
to hell is no place
to raise a child."

269
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:11,578
So she sends him
to an orphanage,

270
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,482
and there he grows

271
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:19,152
and grows and grows

272
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:21,821
until the clock
strikes 12:00.

273
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:24,842
And then they tell him,
"you're a man.

274
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,610
You must leave."

275
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,379
But where?

276
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:35,168
A widow woman meets him,
likes him,

277
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,320
takes him in.

278
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:41,824
She's the mistress
of a slaughterhouse.

279
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:45,311
She teaches him a trade,
puts food on the table,

280
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:46,930
loves him...

281
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,419
And raises him
with her daughter.

282
00:34:53,788 --> 00:34:54,888
Aha.

283
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:58,408
Beautiful daughter.

284
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,711
He grows to love
the daughter.

285
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:05,198
Oh!

286
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,000
(laughs)

287
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:14,574
Aman:
She is his to protect.

288
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:17,911
One sunrise
she tells him,

289
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:19,496
"go with mother
to sell the skins.

290
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:23,016
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself."

291
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,771
He leaves her.

292
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:32,026
Five men ride by.

293
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:34,311
- They find her alone.
- (woman grunts)

294
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:36,663
- Go on!
- (laughs)

295
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:40,216
- Aman: And they
make use of her.
- (snaps)

296
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:45,221
(screams)

297
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:51,361
You bitch!
(growls)

298
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:55,231
She keeps it secret
until she can no more,

299
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,934
for now she is with child.

300
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:00,971
She begs him--
forgive her,

301
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:02,706
forget what
has happened to her

302
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,507
for the sake
of the unborn.

303
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:07,911
She says
the men are gone

304
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:10,280
and to her
they mean nothing.

305
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:12,299
But not to him.

306
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:15,452
No.

307
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:17,220
For one of them

308
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:21,224
grows inside of her.

309
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:25,562
Unbearable.

310
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,232
So for a second time
he leaves.

311
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:32,736
For the next five years,

312
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:35,038
he remembers nothing...

313
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,810
But the pain
of not being by her side.

314
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,014
He returns
to find her dead.

315
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,217
She died giving...

316
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,187
Birth to that child.

317
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:57,177
They took from him
the thing he loved most.

318
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:01,314
Those who were responsible...

319
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:06,419
Would pay.

320
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,758
(wind blowing)

321
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:28,475
(insects chittering)

322
00:37:44,592 --> 00:37:47,110
- (blow thuds)
- (body thuds)

323
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:48,996
(man mumbling)

324
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:57,754
(continues mumbling)

325
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:20,443
(chains rattle)

326
00:38:29,553 --> 00:38:30,753
Troy.

327
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:33,356
Son.

328
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:37,393
Get ready.

329
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,495
The boys are
sending someone.

330
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,116
(chuckles)

331
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:44,751
We're getting out of here.

332
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:52,292
He's here, my darling.

333
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,996
(footsteps)

334
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,776
(body thuds)

335
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,444
(cocking, firing)

336
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:13,129
I always hated
that bitch.

337
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:23,139
- Please, senor. Amigo!
- (gunshot)

338
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:26,642
(grunts)

339
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:30,730
Come on, get us out!
Get us out of here!

340
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:44,076
Who are you?

341
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,184
Her name...

342
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:54,521
- was Sueno.
- (cocks)

343
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,658
- (wheezes)
- (cocks)

344
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,695
(gunshots)

345
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,596
(thuds)

346
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,901
(breathing heavily)

347
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:10,153
(gun clatters)

348
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,446
(whimpering)

349
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:53,096
- You're late.
- Well...

350
00:40:57,185 --> 00:40:59,853
There was some
that needed convincing...

351
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:02,455
This was a good idea.

352
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,145
A bottle of beer
is a good idea.

353
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:11,314
Wearing a hat in the rain
is a good idea.

354
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:15,518
This... Is genius.

355
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,188
(screams, grunting)

356
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,433
- Hey!
- Oh!

357
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,201
Shut the hell up, bitch.

358
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,608
(grunts)

359
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,548
You touch me
and you're dead!

360
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:48,251
Compelling argument.

361
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:51,187
You must be a lawyer.

362
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,638
She's a whore.

363
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,341
Mmm.
An easy mistake.

364
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:57,394
- I apologize.
- (man chuckles)

365
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:02,098
- (whimpers)
- (man grunts)

366
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,384
(coughs)

367
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:12,325
- (coughs)
- Shh.

368
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:19,099
- (cloth rips)
- Ah! Ah.

369
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,266
Hmm.

370
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:24,020
Good texture.

371
00:42:24,022 --> 00:42:26,656
- (whimpering)
- (man chuckles)

372
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:29,025
Tough yet soft.

373
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:32,062
(coughing)

374
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:37,767
- (crying)
- (sniffing)

375
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:44,507
You'll fit in well.

376
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:52,949
I'm looking
for the right girl...

377
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:55,785
For my boy.

378
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,585
You freak!

379
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:15,438
Mmm. I get that a lot.

380
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:20,410
It doesn't stop it
hurting though.

381
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,046
Hmm?

382
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,535
- God have mercy!
- (thuds)

383
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:31,237
(crowd screaming)

384
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:49,806
We die, we come back

385
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:51,891
and you call us...

386
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:54,694
Gallowwalkers.

387
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:58,864
(laughing)

388
00:44:01,435 --> 00:44:03,869
Well, if it's
good enough for jesus,

389
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:06,306
it should be
good enough for us.

390
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:08,241
(laughter continues)

391
00:44:19,653 --> 00:44:21,387
It's a goddamn miracle,
ain't it?

392
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,091
It happens,
but no one knows

393
00:44:25,093 --> 00:44:28,194
who or how or why.

394
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:30,330
No one knows.

395
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:32,732
And here's the thing...

396
00:44:36,303 --> 00:44:38,003
I get shot.

397
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:47,096
My son gets shot.

398
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,900
Three of my men get shot.

399
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:53,886
The son of a bitch
even shoots my whore.

400
00:44:58,259 --> 00:44:59,859
I come back.

401
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:05,598
My men come back.

402
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,586
Even my fucking whore
comes back.

403
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:14,841
But with my son,
death persists!

404
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:21,397
Life's little mystery.

405
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:30,923
Does anyone here know

406
00:45:30,925 --> 00:45:34,160
where I might find
the sisters of San Diablo...

407
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:37,464
- (murmuring)
- ...In the mountain
of resurrection?

408
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:40,166
Hmm?

409
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:42,335
No.

410
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:08,494
(clanks)

411
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:10,430
(crowd gasps)

412
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:13,666
(moos)

413
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:31,801
(thuds)

414
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,461
(clacking)

415
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:42,462
Clear.

416
00:46:43,564 --> 00:46:46,232
- (moos)
- (clacks)

417
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:49,669
- (thuds)
- (blood squelches)

418
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:51,620
(clacking)

419
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,464
(metal clanking)

420
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:16,713
(thuds)

421
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:21,367
(scraping)

422
00:47:27,524 --> 00:47:28,674
Ah!

423
00:47:29,943 --> 00:47:31,744
(horse snorts)

424
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:13,786
You sleep now.

425
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:17,756
Eat if you're hungry.

426
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:21,244
How much time I got?

427
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:25,297
To sleep, to eat
or to live?

428
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,803
(running footsteps)

429
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,774
(bleating)

430
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:03,403
Who is he?

431
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:07,306
First I could find.

432
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:09,842
What happened?

433
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:14,530
They know who I am.

434
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:19,284
(ladle clanks)

435
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:21,770
So now they will come.

436
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:26,309
You bring this boy
because you think I cannot
fight at your side?

437
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:29,262
(grabs)

438
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:34,300
I can fight.
You know I can fight.

439
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:43,142
(clatters)

440
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:50,316
Did one see your face?

441
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:56,155
It was a mistake.

442
00:49:59,626 --> 00:50:01,594
You don't make mistakes.

443
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,231
Perhaps you want him
to come.

444
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:09,636
Perhaps you want him
to know who hunts him.

445
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,355
You want him to come...

446
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:17,276
To finish it,
here where it all began.

447
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,432
(spurs jingling)

448
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,415
(cutting)

449
00:50:58,185 --> 00:50:59,685
You gotta shave?

450
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,829
- I got no beard.
- Me neither.

451
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:11,664
Wanna play a game?

452
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,650
No, I don't.

453
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:16,652
Wanna throw shots
for money?

454
00:51:21,508 --> 00:51:23,275
Yes, I do.

455
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:57,977
(sniffles)

456
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:06,502
(rock clatters)

457
00:52:06,504 --> 00:52:09,221
(laughs)

458
00:52:09,223 --> 00:52:10,456
My turn.

459
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:16,628
(thuds, clatters)

460
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,501
- (clatters)
- (laughs)

461
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:39,902
Damn it!

462
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:45,841
One dollar and we never talk
of this day again.

463
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:07,580
(wind chimes clinking)

464
00:53:50,774 --> 00:53:52,474
(Aman narrating)
I never knew my mother,

465
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:56,629
but I can sense
that she was always there.

466
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:10,709
As for Sueno,

467
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:12,061
She was my everything.

468
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,848
My friend,

469
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:16,932
my lover...

470
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:20,435
The memory
that I lived for.

471
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:55,788
Fabulos:
So where you want me?

472
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,740
(footsteps)

473
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:03,863
Just get in the shed.

474
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:05,797
You're gonna need this.

475
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,444
(Fabulos chuckles)

476
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:20,345
There's--

477
00:55:20,347 --> 00:55:23,416
There's really nothing
coming that we won't see.

478
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:27,202
Well, you didn't see that.

479
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:29,955
(hissing)

480
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:32,758
Oh jes--
(grunts)

481
00:55:34,728 --> 00:55:36,729
Okay. Okay.

482
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:38,464
All right.

483
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,768
You win.
(chuckles)

484
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:45,471
Okay, so back
at the skinning shed,

485
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:48,006
two guns,
shoot 'em in the head.
Anything else?

486
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:57,549
Okay.
(sighs)

487
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:00,319
(sighs)

488
00:56:00,321 --> 00:56:02,387
(chuckles)

489
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:11,013
(flies buzzing)

490
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:14,183
(man screaming)

491
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:29,431
(woman screams)

492
00:56:47,283 --> 00:56:48,818
Ah.

493
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:51,954
Oh, you look good, boss.

494
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:56,175
He was young.

495
00:56:56,177 --> 00:56:57,893
- (woman screams)
- Eh.

496
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:02,264
Uh, what you think
of mine, boss?

497
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:05,134
(chuckles)
Oh, it's-- it's not pretty,

498
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:08,070
but it stands up
to the sun, huh?

499
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:11,273
(chuckles)
Oh, they may laugh,

500
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:14,543
but you don't see me
hiding in a hood, huh?

501
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:17,313
Shriveling
like beef jerky.

502
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:23,853
They need skinning again
in a week.

503
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:25,788
(man screams)

504
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,792
But me, I get
a good month wear of this.

505
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:32,928
And I think a lizard skin

506
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,964
is a good look for me.

507
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:37,716
Suit yourself.

508
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:40,419
All the more flesh
for us.

509
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:43,371
- (screaming continues)
- (chuckles)

510
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:46,825
Eh. Boss?

511
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,080
If I do a good job,

512
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:53,515
can I have her lips?

513
00:57:59,806 --> 00:58:01,440
Kansa:
Yes, you can.

514
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:20,025
You do a bad job

515
00:58:20,027 --> 00:58:22,728
and I'll sew her lips
onto your face myself,

516
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,632
and that will come
with a beard.

517
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:36,424
(grunts)

518
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:38,460
Man:
Priest.

519
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:45,266
About time.
I've been dying
for this.

520
00:58:47,169 --> 00:58:48,403
Man: Girl.

521
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,590
Take her.

522
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:17,199
Forgive me, father,

523
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:19,852
for I have skinned.

524
00:59:19,854 --> 00:59:22,020
- Mosca!
- Mosca: Ah yes, boss, I come.

525
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:24,857
- (whimpering) Oh no.
- (mutters)

526
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:26,374
Sit still, no?

527
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:29,645
Oh, you hiding something
from me. You hide, huh?

528
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:32,848
I find it. I find it.

529
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,950
Now where is it?!

530
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:37,019
(mutters)

531
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:41,523
Ah! Ah.

532
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:43,324
Tell me that's it.

533
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:47,796
Let me see.

534
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:50,349
Yes, boss. It's what
we've been looking for.

535
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,501
It's the map
to skull mountain.

536
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:54,703
It's ours now, yeah?
(laughing )

537
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:00,409
Hey.

538
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,847
And so it came to pass

539
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:10,252
in a time when popes
made pacts with pagan lords,

540
01:00:10,254 --> 01:00:12,754
the sisters of San Diablo

541
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,457
had forced upon them

542
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:17,626
a most cursed devotion...

543
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:22,414
One that no other sisterhood
could endure.

544
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,933
The passion
of their prayer

545
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,384
would become the power

546
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:29,320
that keeps the damned
from walking the earth.

547
01:00:29,322 --> 01:00:32,791
And so into their hands
passed the ancient secrets

548
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:35,994
of what divides
the living from the dead.

549
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:40,882
(chuckles)

550
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:42,685
Where are they,
chicken bones?

551
01:00:43,703 --> 01:00:45,970
Where do they hide?

552
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:04,790
Does the rest of him
arrive monthly?

553
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:07,559
Man:
We had a little trouble.

554
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:13,599
I got shot.
I got shot bad, boss.

555
01:01:20,773 --> 01:01:21,890
(gunshot)

556
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,897
He's back.

557
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:32,067
You know him?

558
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:41,243
You never forget
the man who kills you
for the first time.

559
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:46,315
The first time is
always special.

560
01:01:46,317 --> 01:01:49,517
Skullbucket,
take the rest of the men,

561
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,153
find the gunman.

562
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:53,889
Kill him and anyone
that's with him.

563
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:58,493
(wind blowing)

564
01:02:10,356 --> 01:02:12,040
(creaking)

565
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:16,378
(door banging)

566
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,480
(woman laughing)

567
01:02:35,515 --> 01:02:38,517
- Hey. Hey hey. Hey.
- Oh!

568
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:41,387
You gotta
sober up, ma'am.

569
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:43,389
- Uh...
- All right?

570
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:44,890
It could be today.

571
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:48,193
What did he tell you, kid?

572
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:54,400
(laughs)

573
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:56,235
He told you nothing.

574
01:02:58,304 --> 01:03:00,872
Look, it's five men--

575
01:03:00,874 --> 01:03:02,774
He has killed them once,

576
01:03:02,776 --> 01:03:04,676
now he must
kill them again.

577
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,081
I need dunking.

578
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:10,899
(bleating)

579
01:03:21,477 --> 01:03:24,146
You know, he's got
the one thing...

580
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:26,982
That a gunman needs
to be great.

581
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:31,853
A reason to live.

582
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:33,555
Now.

583
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:38,594
(gun cocks)

584
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,313
(gunshot)

585
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,594
(thunder crashing)

586
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:08,474
(cocks)

587
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,253
(guns firing)

588
01:04:38,255 --> 01:04:39,137
(blood splatters)

589
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:45,260
- (whinnies)
- (grunts)

590
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:46,478
(neighs)

591
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,880
- (whip whooshing)
- (grunts)

592
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:04,329
(guns firing)

593
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:09,234
(woman yelps)

594
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:15,640
(wind blowing)

595
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:30,949
- (wind howls)
- (screams)

596
01:06:30,951 --> 01:06:32,183
(skullbucket snarls)

597
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:37,706
(gasps)

598
01:06:39,525 --> 01:06:41,075
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

599
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:47,448
- (clangs)
- (grunts)

600
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,465
- (grunts)
- (skullbucket grunts)

601
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:04,866
(screams)

602
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,803
(skullbucket growling)

603
01:07:13,626 --> 01:07:14,960
- (whip snaps)
- (thuds)

604
01:07:36,482 --> 01:07:38,566
Come on, come on.

605
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:41,502
- (clangs)
- (grunts)

606
01:08:19,058 --> 01:08:20,826
(chains rattling)

607
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:22,443
(skullbucket grunting)

608
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:19,885
(gunshot)

609
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:21,770
(crashes)

610
01:09:41,373 --> 01:09:43,308
(gun clicks,
barrel whirrs)

611
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:48,630
You're okay, kid.

612
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:00,775
(growling)

613
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,794
Aman!

614
01:10:22,148 --> 01:10:23,714
Aman!

615
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:40,131
(grunts)

616
01:10:43,018 --> 01:10:45,587
(chuckles)
Kids.

617
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:26,178
You saved me.

618
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,963
I never wanna see
that thing again.

619
01:11:45,197 --> 01:11:46,664
Who are you
looking for?

620
01:11:52,838 --> 01:11:54,305
The one that didn't come.

621
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:58,493
Where is he?

622
01:11:58,495 --> 01:11:59,827
I'll find him.

623
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:03,364
I guess we made it.

624
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:08,936
(clears throat)

625
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:10,205
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go.

626
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:16,394
- Hey.
- Yeah?

627
01:12:16,396 --> 01:12:19,196
- (gunshot)
- (gasps)

628
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,424
(panting)

629
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:56,167
You killed me.

630
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:00,638
Why the fuck
did you shoot me?!

631
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,507
You would've bled
to death.

632
01:13:02,509 --> 01:13:05,693
(guns clicking)

633
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,053
(bullets clink)

634
01:13:20,909 --> 01:13:23,128
A man might take the news
of his own death

635
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,030
badly.

636
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,801
(laughing)

637
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,428
(Aman narrating)
I felt for the kid.

638
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,946
I really did,

639
01:13:41,948 --> 01:13:44,249
but I couldn't just
leave him to die.

640
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:47,652
Me? I had
unfinished business

641
01:13:47,654 --> 01:13:49,987
at the place
of my own resurrection.

642
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:59,947
I figured
if I ever made it back,

643
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:02,349
I would tell him
about the time

644
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:04,185
when I died.

645
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:30,144
(cocks)

646
01:14:30,146 --> 01:14:32,212
(gunshot)

647
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:30,921
It was over.

648
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:34,292
My death meant nothing.

649
01:15:34,294 --> 01:15:37,645
But to my mother,
it was everything.

650
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,017
Let him live.

651
01:15:43,019 --> 01:15:45,219
He's my only son.

652
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:47,755
And I'll stay here
as your servant.

653
01:15:47,757 --> 01:15:51,158
Devil:
Oh, my price is a little
higher than that.

654
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:54,762
He is one of mine now.

655
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:59,083
He has blood
on his hands.

656
01:16:01,387 --> 01:16:04,589
My deal is this:

657
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,309
When he is resurrected,

658
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:13,263
so too will all those
slain by his hand.

659
01:16:14,849 --> 01:16:17,001
(evil laughter)

660
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:20,705
Now you must pay.

661
01:16:23,191 --> 01:16:25,360
(mother screaming)

662
01:16:30,448 --> 01:16:33,234
(Aman narrating)
and so I awoke beneath
that mountain

663
01:16:33,236 --> 01:16:37,087
where my mother had
sacrificed her life for mine,

664
01:16:38,257 --> 01:16:39,823
whilst out there

665
01:16:39,825 --> 01:16:42,226
the damned were stirring.

666
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,434
(distant hoofbeats)

667
01:17:16,095 --> 01:17:18,029
(pickaxes clanging)

668
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:40,718
Fine flesh.

669
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,588
Not as fair as I would wish,
but you'll fit in well.

670
01:17:49,128 --> 01:17:52,413
What breed was
your mother?

671
01:17:53,832 --> 01:17:55,599
She was scottish.

672
01:17:58,503 --> 01:18:00,538
Those Celts have a luster.

673
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:06,010
And your father--
was he pale-skinned?

674
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:08,012
Pale?

675
01:18:08,014 --> 01:18:11,249
(chuckles)
He was invisible.

676
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:16,237
Well, I'll soon have
my boy again,

677
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,407
- once we patch him up with
that fine skin of yours.
- (gasps)

678
01:18:22,844 --> 01:18:24,561
(booms)

679
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:42,196
At last, the entrance.

680
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:48,886
(breathing hard)
Mosca, bring my boy.

681
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:53,725
Kiss cut, are you
my whore or what?

682
01:19:15,029 --> 01:19:17,098
Boss! Boss!

683
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,332
Ah...

684
01:19:22,671 --> 01:19:23,921
You see this, boss?

685
01:19:23,923 --> 01:19:26,840
It's called the Aumenta.

686
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:31,178
It means
"the land of the dead."

687
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,897
Huh?

688
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:35,199
You don't take
that path, boss.

689
01:19:35,201 --> 01:19:38,202
But this one, boss,
is called

690
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:40,621
"the Uroborus
at the pinnacle."

691
01:19:40,623 --> 01:19:45,059
It means resurrection
shall be found

692
01:19:45,061 --> 01:19:47,811
at the mountaintop.

693
01:19:47,813 --> 01:19:49,413
This is the path, boss.

694
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:51,148
I certain.

695
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:54,351
Stay here.

696
01:19:56,021 --> 01:19:58,022
- (spurs jingling)
- Bring my boy.

697
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:04,812
Mosca, you know this coat
of mine you like so much?

698
01:20:04,814 --> 01:20:07,014
You just earned it.

699
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:10,801
Ohh. Thank you, boss.
Thank you!

700
01:20:10,803 --> 01:20:14,171
Me, I like the cuffs.

701
01:20:17,509 --> 01:20:19,443
(water dripping)

702
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:47,454
I blew you a kiss...

703
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:53,427
And you blew me away.

704
01:20:53,429 --> 01:20:55,863
I had no choice.

705
01:20:55,865 --> 01:20:57,731
So choose now.

706
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:01,251
Knives or guns?

707
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,549
Guns.

708
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,387
(jacket thuds)

709
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,256
Guns it is.

710
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:34,518
(humphs)

711
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,886
(knife whooshes, clangs)

712
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:43,444
Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk.

713
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:39,834
(footsteps approach)

714
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:01,122
(grunting)

715
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:11,865
(grunts)

716
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:19,740
(gunshot)

717
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,397
I don't sleep.

718
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,333
But if I did...

719
01:23:46,335 --> 01:23:48,936
One thought
would keep me from it.

720
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:53,807
"Why did my son
not return?"

721
01:23:56,077 --> 01:23:58,028
You brought death
to every one of us.

722
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,611
So tell me.

723
01:24:24,156 --> 01:24:26,623
(footsteps approach)

724
01:24:38,352 --> 01:24:41,338
No no no no no
no no no no.

725
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,457
(clicks)

726
01:24:59,657 --> 01:25:01,225
You any good
with your left?

727
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,797
I thought
you wanted me dead.

728
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,754
Fabulos:
Yeah well, dead ain't
what it used to be.

729
01:26:01,252 --> 01:26:03,187
(spurs jingling)

730
01:26:24,809 --> 01:26:29,095
All this over
one petty piece
of pussy.

731
01:26:32,817 --> 01:26:34,885
(gunshot)

732
01:26:36,588 --> 01:26:38,188
(body thuds)

733
01:26:47,915 --> 01:26:49,550
(softly)
He took his own life.

734
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:54,171
(hoarsely)
My boy!

735
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:56,373
My son!

736
01:27:20,165 --> 01:27:22,266
I'm a woman
in need of rescue.

737
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:27,438
What kind of man are you?

738
01:27:30,675 --> 01:27:31,959
I'm the heartless kind.

739
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,776
Hey, come on.
I don't know how to be dead.

740
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:52,162
No one taught you
how to live.

741
01:28:00,838 --> 01:28:02,789
(rock music playing)

742
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:21,744
(acoustic guitar music
playing)
