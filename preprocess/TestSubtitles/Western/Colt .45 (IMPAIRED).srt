     Finest guns ever made.

Here's law and order            
in six-finger doses, yes, sir.  

5
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,947
Easy to load and as durable     
as your mother-in-law.

       a pair soon, Mr. Farrell?

40

No, not this far west yet.      

41

     Six shots instead of one.  
   Man, that makes a difference.

his order in first.

Just crimp in the bullets,

no wadding is necessary,        

50
