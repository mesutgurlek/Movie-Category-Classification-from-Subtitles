00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,169
[tires squeal]

3
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,505
Oh, hey. Uh, Sheriff.

4
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,757
Your Jane Doe is right over...

5
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,318
She's not a Jane Doe.

6
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,616
Do you want me to...

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,530
I can pray with you if you'd like.

8
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,534
What?

9
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,061
Would you like me to pray with you?

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,789
She must've meant a lot to you.

11
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,085
It's not Donna.

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,862
Oh, my Lord. But, uh...

13
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,257
But the description on the report.

14
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,368
Oh, I feel terrible I
put you through this.

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,869
It's just I-I couldn't get
Sheriff Wilkins to come down here

16
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,957
to I.D. our Jane Doe, and...

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,852
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,547
There's no need.

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,443
You did the right thing.

20
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,910
So, should I try to get
Sheriff Wilkins again?

21
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,204
No.

22
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,370
Hey there, Eamonn.

23
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,806
[Eamonn] God.

24
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,332
Hey, Walt.

25
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,228
This is a creepy sort of surprise.

26
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,065
I need to talk to you inside.

27
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,609
Look, I don't know what Vic told you...

28
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,928
- I don't care about you and Vic.
- Well, you say that,

29
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,948
but it's after 10:00
and you're lying in wait.

30
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,276
- I'm not lying in wait.
- You're sitting in the dark,

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,161
- your truck's nowhere to be seen.
- 'Cause I don't want to be seen.

32
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,080
- It's basically the definition...
- It's about your boss.

33
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,696
- It's a little hard to believe.
- Is it?

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,783
How much did Sheriff Wilkins
receive in, uh, campaign donations

35
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,326
from Newett Energy last election?

36
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,261
I don't know.

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,247
I do. I looked it up.

38
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,144
Every member of their board wrote
the maximum check allowable by law.

39
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,503
Just because he's accepting
political contributions

40
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,194
doesn't mean he's protecting a criminal.

41
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,298
- And yet that's what he's doing.
- According to you.

42
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,135
Why else would he check Walker
Browning out of the hospital

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,096
and ban me from his county unless
he's trying to hide something from me?

44
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,766
When you say "ban," you mean
in the legal sense of ban?

45
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,785
- Like a restraining order?
- I don't know.

46
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:51,438
But I do know that he ignored a Jane
Doe that matched my missing person.

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,791
That seems like a cover up to me.

48
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,193
[sighs]

49
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,296
All right.

50
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,843
Even if all of this were true,
what do you want me to do?

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,786
Help me.

52
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,538
Keep an eye out for Walker Browning.

53
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,723
Can you do that?

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,142
I don't know.

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,355
I'll think about it.

56
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,692
Fair enough.

57
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,594
[grunts]

58
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,907
Shit.

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,951
Don't move, asshole.

60
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,039
- Take off that mask.
- No.

61
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,874
Take it off or you're dead.

62
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,127
- You can't kill me.
- Oh, really?

63
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,462
Why not?

64
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,175
Because Hector lives,
and because I know you.

65
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,451
You're a thief.

66
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,929
But you're not a murderer.

67
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,063
[gunshot]

68
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,191
[knock on door]

69
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,817
Hey, Sheriff.

70
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,029
You didn't by chance stop
by the print shed last night

71
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,339
and pick up your Bronco?

72
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,633
- Yep.
- Ah.

73
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,786
Yeah, so normally when I'm
collecting evidence on a vehicle,

74
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,266
it helps to not have somebody take
the vehicle in the middle of the night.

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,101
- How's Larry doing?
- What?

76
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,106
Larry, the arson investigator
who's going over Donna's van.

77
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,464
He got pulled away.

78
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,758
Uh, suspicious brush
fire at Pronghorn Ridge.

79
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,818
Right.

80
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,407
- Can I have the keys to the Bronco back?
- Nope. I'm leaving.

81
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,329
What do you want me to do
with the kid in the cell?

82
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,689
Has anyone confirmed
that he's Donna's son?

83
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,191
No.

84
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,960
Then nothing.

85
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,216
[door closes]

86
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,692
[grunts]

87
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,055
[Donna] Came out after my
group and... and it was on fire,

88
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,100
and the fire department said
that someone broke the window

89
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,496
and threw a Molotov
cocktail inside, so...

90
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,167
[blows]

91
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,632
[Donna] Well, my
patient's suicide, um...

92
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,635
it was because of me.

93
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,932
Have you ever heard of transference?

94
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,796
This patient hasn't made
their last four sessions,

95
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,900
so I'm completely in the dark as
to their state of mind right now.

96
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,283
[Vic] Have you totally
lost your damn mind?

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,369
Where the hell did you go last night?

98
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,936
[Walt] Cumberland County morgue.

99
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,207
They called me in to I.D. a Jane Doe.

100
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,961
Uh, blonde, 5'6", 45, 50 years old.

101
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,341
Shit.

102
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,492
I'm so sorry, Walt.

103
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,886
It wasn't her.

104
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,724
What does this look like?

105
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,312
Um... Red Stripe.

106
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,148
Same brand that Duncan Butler was
drinking when we visited him yesterday.

107
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,553
So, then I was right.

108
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,221
It was one of her patients.

109
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,866
You go to his house,
I'll head to his work.

110
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,034
No way.

111
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,978
I'm not letting you back
behind the wheel again.

112
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,666
- Give me the keys.
- I'm fine, Vic.

113
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,885
What the hell have you gotten me into?

114
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,788
I would be happy to file a police
report for you, Standing Bear.

115
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
I almost got killed.

116
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,226
That is on you.

117
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,793
It was a good plan.

118
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,853
Good?

119
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,048
You told me I was retrieving a
single antique piece of pottery

120
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,934
from a residence where nobody was home,
but not a single part of that description

121
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,678
- turned out to be true.
- What do you mean?

122
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,574
- You couldn't find the pot?
- I found hundreds of pots!

123
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,016
It might've looked like
a residence from outside,

124
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:24,230
but inside it was some kind of warehouse
filled with counterfeit Indian artifacts,

125
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,874
and somebody was home.

126
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,292
Can you describe him?

127
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,462
I only remember the shotgun
he pointed at my head.

128
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,172
What else?

129
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,674
So, no apology.

130
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,742
[telephone ringing]

131
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,619
I got to take this.

132
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,473
[sighs] Yeah.

133
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,291
Anybody get hurt?

134
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,935
Good.

135
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,938
Well, we finally got
an excuse to get inside.

136
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,025
All right. Yeah, I'm on my way.

137
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,737
Well, Standing Bear, I got to go.

138
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,347
Apparently, there was a
home invasion last night.

139
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,202
Some broken pottery,
a couple shots fired.

140
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,704
Someone said they even saw Hector.

141
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,461
You knew somebody would be
in that house last night.

142
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,964
You sent me there to cause a disturbance
so you could enter the house legally.

143
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,468
I told you it was a good plan.

144
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,351
[cell phone ringing]

145
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,090

146
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,676
[cell phone beeps]

147
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,321
Hello, Jacob.

148
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,374
Duncan?

149
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,334
- Can I help you?
- [Vic] Uh, yeah.

150
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,277
We're looking for Duncan Butler.

151
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,879
Uh, maybe you should talk to Brent.

152
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,507
- This way?
- Yeah.

153
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,803
[Brent] Can I see some I.D.?

154
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,039
Duncan has the day off. Call him
at home. I'm sure he'll see you.

155
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,903
We already went to his
house. He wasn't there,

156
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,125
- so we figured he'd be here.
- [Brent] Well, he's not.

157
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,629
Look, I don't know what you guys
want to talk to Duncan about,

158
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,298
but he served his
country for four years.

159
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,861
I think the least the rest of
us can do is cut him some slack.

160
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:20,005
Really? 'Cause what we want to talk to
him about is a van that got firebombed.

161
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,012
[scoffs] I see.

162
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,849
So, just because he served in Iraq
means he's the one who bombed a car.

163
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,252
- Yeah, sort of.
- And the rest of us have no responsibility

164
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,557
to help people like Duncan
after all they've done for us?

165
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:29,466
[Walt] Brent.

166
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,690
I appreciate what
you're doing for Duncan,

167
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,650
but this is not just
about a firebombed van.

168
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,737
There's a woman missing. Now, she
was also trying to help Duncan.

169
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't know if he's done
anything wrong or if he's hurt her,

170
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,617
but I do need to speak to him.

171
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,702
Now, he doesn't have the
day off today, does he?

172
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,013
- He just didn't show up.
- Duncan is a good guy.

173
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,140
Brent.

174
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,041
When we spoke to you the other day,
you provided an alibi for Duncan

175
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,127
for the bombing and the abduction.

176
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,356
Would you swear to that
in front of a judge?

177
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,799
Sometimes Duncan has bad days.

178
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,237
He doesn't make it in, I...
I clock in and out for him.

179
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,615
This happen on the dates we asked about?

180
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,018
Yeah.

181
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,686
[Walt] You got any idea where he is?

182
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,788
No.

183
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,648
His wife wasn't home either.

184
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,734
- Do you know where she works?
- His wife?

185
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,598
His wife hasn't been
home since last November.

186
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,700
She left him.

187
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,428
[Walt] Okay, thanks, Ferg.

188
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,849
Duncan's wife filed
divorce papers in January.

189
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,209
Her most recent address is in Tensleep.

190
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,837
I'm no psychiatrist, but
Duncan seems delusional.

191
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,882
His wife leaves him and he keeps
her stuff laying around for months?

192
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,801
[static crackles]

193
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,803
[Ruby] I have Eamonn
O'Neill for you, Walt.

194
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,905
Put him through, Ruby.

195
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,282
- [Eamonn] I got to make this quick.
- Shoot.

196
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,225
[Eamonn] I think you
should come out here.

197
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,494
What'd you find?

198
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,288
I'd rather not say over the phone.

199
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,980
Where should I meet you?

200
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,165
I'll text you the address.

201
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,959
I don't have a cell phone.

202
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,569
[Walt] Text it through to Vic's.

203
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,964
Oh, you, uh, you with Vic?

204
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,549
Hey, Eamonn.

205
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,927
Hi.

206
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
Okay, send me that address.

207

[clears throat]

208
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,228
- [sighs]
- I'm not going out there.

209
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,046
No.

210
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,526
No, you're going to Tensleep
to look for Duncan's ex-wife.

211
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,845
You didn't hire Eamonn, did you?

212
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,680
[Walt] Nope.

213
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,782
What was that call about?

214
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:32,185
If we're wrong about Duncan, we
need to reconsider Walker Browning.

215
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,730
We still haven't ruled
him out as a suspect.

216
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,625
Eamonn may know where he's hiding.

217
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,960
I thought you said that I was right
about it being one of Donna's patients.

218
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,463
No, you said that.

219
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,091
I'm gonna need my keys back.

You better not be messing with me.

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,209
Hello, Mathias.

228
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,947
So, I went and checked on that
house you broke into last night.

229
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,257
It's hardly a warehouse.

230
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,491
What do you mean?

231
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,828
Only artifacts I saw were
two bowls and a cooking pot.

232
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,329
And they were broken.

233
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,350
One was thrown, the other two
were blown up by a shotgun.

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,917
I know what I saw.

235
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,336
They're filing an insurance claim.

236
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,648
- How much?
- $120,000.

237
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,358
For counterfeit clay pots?

238
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,596
Not counterfeit.
Authentic, but black market.

239
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,889
We believe that someone's
systematically been stealing

240
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,449
and selling our people's history.

241
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,142
Like that pot I sent you for,

242
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,621
that was stolen from Adele
Chapman's house last week.

243
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,373
Instead, you drove their
operation underground.

244
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,219
- Hector has that effect on people.
- Uh-huh.

245
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,154
I'm actually a little concerned
that Hector doesn't fully appreciate

246
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,632
the nature of our arrangement.

247
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,209
He's supposed to be an
asset in fighting crime,

248
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,794
and he's supposed to be stealthy.

249
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,315
He's not supposed to shoot up the
joint, scare the bad guys into hiding.

250
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,424
Next time, maybe you should arm Hector

251
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,320
with a little more information
about what you expect from him.

252
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,450
Okay. Here's what I expect from him.

253
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:21,021
He's gonna watch that house, see
who comes and goes, and follow them.

254
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,999
I need to find where
that merchandise went.

255
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,484
Now, last night was strike one.

256
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,797
You get one more chance or I
send my blood samples to the FBI.

257
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,519
That is not how strikes work.

258
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,938
I never had much patience for baseball.

259
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,768
You have the code?

260
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,578
Nope. We got to climb.

261
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,914
You sure it's worth it?

262
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,440
No.

263
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,944
But this morning, a shutoff
engineer from the Newett oil field

264
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:12,405
came in to report that some cranky cowboy
came sniffing around his work site.

265
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,866
Same work site where you and
I questioned Walker Browning.

266
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,093
I wasn't that cranky.

267
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,412
Yeah, well, shortly after that,

268
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,766
Sheriff Wilkins announced
he'd be working from home.

269
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,436
Sheriff Wilkins lives here?

270
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,729
Yep.

271
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,505
You think Walker Browning's here?

272
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,027
It's just a hunch, but Sheriff
Wilkins doesn't ever work from home.

273
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,696
Nobody there to laugh at his jokes.

275

[Walker] Hey there, Sheriff.

00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,057
Sound travels in the mountains.

277
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,603
Heard that old Bronco of
yours all the way up here.

278
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,757
Why don't you come on up for a chat?

deputy friend to join you.

Hey, Eamonn, you're not fooling
anybody. I can see you right there.

281
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,750
Yeah.

282
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,140
Curious that you recognize
the sound of my truck.

283
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,768
You been driving it recently?

284
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,627
Man, you are so literal.

285
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,379
[sighs] You got me there.
That's great detective work.

286
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,798
I didn't actually hear it.

287
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,985
This, uh, place has these
closed-circuit TV channels

288
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,179
[grunts] that show the
comings and goings at the gate.

289
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,156
Where is she?

290
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,434
Did you lose her?
After all that trouble?

291
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,494
Answer me, Walker.

292
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,455
I don't know where Gab
is. I didn't take her.

293
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,585
Took off after you
ambushed me, killed Trot.

294
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,962
That's not what happened,
and you know that.

295
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,550
You the sniper, huh?

296
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,429
You know, hiding in the woods
just like you were doing here?

297
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,641
For your sake, I sure as hell hope
you got a warrant this time, Walt.

298
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,500
I do not.

299
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:34,148
Walker invited us in, so
this is all perfectly legal.

300
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,382
Us?

301
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,676
You and Eamonn?

302
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,195
Are you two a couple now? [laughs]

303
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,865
Sheriff, I think this is
just a big miscommunication.

304
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,396
Well, we can straighten that
right out, can't we, Eamonn?

305
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,603
Escort this son of a bitch
back to Absaroka County.

306
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm not leaving.

307
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,624
You know what, scratch that.

308
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,605
- Arrest the sheriff.
- He hasn't done anything.

309
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,544
- Arrest him!
- There's no need.

310
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,890
Get up. Get off me!

311
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,333
You attacked me in my home,

312
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,020
and then you took Donna 'cause
you saw what she meant to me!

313
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,257
[sighs] I really like the
idea of hurting you, Walt.

314
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,558
I really don't give a shit
about hurting your feelings.

315
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,447
It was you! Say it! Get off!

316
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,973
All right, Longmire, that's it.

317
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,868
- You're under arrest!
- Say it!

318
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,227
- Say it!
- If I shot you, I would've shot you dead.

319
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,331
- I think you thought you did.
- Oh, I would've made sure.

320
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,377
[chuckles]

321
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,357
You may as well go, too,
Eamonn, you piece of shit.

322
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,238
I expect your resignation
on my desk inside the hour.

323
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,189
[Eamonn] He thought
that the she was Gab.

324
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,107
Yep.

325
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,568
So, he's a pretty good liar.

326
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,046
He is.

327
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:26,219
But this time... this time,
he's telling the truth.

328
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,890
He would've killed me
if he had the chance.

329
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,311
Why don't you come work for me?

330
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,340
Yeah, that sounds great.

331
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:44,403
Leap from one unstable, hostile
work environment to another.

332
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,699
But thanks for the offer.

333
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,231
[sighs] I'm sorry I got you fired.

334
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,359
Yeah, just a matter
of time before I left.

335
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,879
Hard to work for a
boss you don't respect.

336
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,758
You really should get that checked out.

337
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,429
You really don't want to bleed to
death in Sheriff Wilkins' county.

338
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,544
How was everything?

339
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,355
Eh, it was a little rare.

340
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,424
I am sorry to hear that.

341
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,527
I will let the kitchen know.

342
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,739
[grunts]

343
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,658
Hey, buddy, break it up!

344
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,742
Get down! Hey, back off! Back off!

345
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,276
- I'm making a citizen's arrest. Huh?
- Who the hell are you?

346
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:36,857
- Get off me!
- Shut up! Shut up, man!

347
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,815
Sir, please, just... just calm
down. I can call the sheriff.

348
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,336
No, no. No need. I got this.

349
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,921
Hey, you, come here.
Sweetheart, come here.

350
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,423
Come on! Get over here!

351
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,370
Here.

352
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,957
Zip his wrists up real tight, okay?

353
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,059
Don't move.

354
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,898
Jesus, come on, come on!

355
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,966
Come on, come on.

356
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,777
Okay, come on. Get up! Get up!

357
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,281
Stay back. Everybody,
stay where they are.

358
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,991
This'll be over real soon.

359
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,917
[Ferg] The abductor is a
male Caucasian in his 30s.

360
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,296
He is driving a red
pickup truck, Ram 2500.

361
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,797
You got any plate numbers?

362
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,425
County one-six,
license number four-two.

363
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,328
County one-six, license four-two.

364
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,992
Got it. Will you run
those plates for me?

365
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:36,636
That's what I'm doing. Hold on.

366
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,477
Ferg, this guy seems unhinged.
He might hurt someone.

367
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,768
I do not think it is wise
to wait for the cavalry.

368
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,022
I can run him off the road.

369
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,191
Don't, Henry.

370
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,819
Not until we know who we're
dealing with, which is...

371
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,321
Duncan Butler.

372
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,763
Holy shit. Are you sure, Ferg?

373
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,991
Truck was registered
to him just last year.

374
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,077
[siren wails]

375
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,665
- I don't know who you think I am...
- Look, I know who you are.

376
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,489
- I know what you did.
- I didn't do anything!

377
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,241
- Bullshit!
- Oh!

378
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,585
[tires screech]

379
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,623
- [grunts]
- Jesus, officer, watch where you're going.

380
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,174
I almost hit you.

381
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,657
Get on the ground!

382
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,759
Get out.

383
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,761
I got him! He can
tell us where Donna is.

384
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,204
Duncan, get on the ground!

385
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,681
Hey. Help me!

386
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,641
Hey! Stay back. This is police business.

387
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,094
- Get out.
- Let go of the hostage

388
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,404
and put your weapon down.

389
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,421
What? Oh, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

390
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,567
I arrested him, all
right? Citizens arrest.

391
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,361
[grunts]

392
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,804
- Duncan, what the hell is going on?
- He's the guy who took Donna.

393
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,491
- Which one of these guys is the bad guy?
- I don't know.

394
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,395
Oh, shit. I got him.

395
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,872
[grunts] Get down!

396
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,792
[Vic panting] Get down!

397
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,585
Okay.

398
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,820
[door closes]

399
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,044
Look, I don't know why you're
talking to me, all right?

400
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,647
Randal's the one who took Donna.

401
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,553
What makes you think that?

402
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,097
I've seen him hanging
around the parking lot,

403
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,683
waiting for Donna
after his group session.

404
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,687
Looking for a little, uh, one on
one time, if you know what I mean.

405
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,440
What were you waiting for?

406
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,567
Come again?

407
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,777
Were you waiting for
some one on one time, too?

408
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,804
No.

409
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,365
I was just looking after her is all.

410
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,950
Donna and me, we have a connection.

411
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,791
She has this ability...
see right through you.

412
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,568
Next thing you know, you're
just pouring your heart out,

413
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,963
feeling things you never felt before.

414
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,049
She's that good, why'd
you stop going to therapy?

415
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,678
You missed your last few appointments.

416
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,305
We had an awkward session.

417
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,683
[Vic] What exactly
happened at your session?

418
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,019
I brought her a stew.

419
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,901
I made it myself from
scratch from a rabbit I shot.

420
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,155
- Wow, you shot a rabbit?
- Right?

421
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,851
You know, I never cooked
that stew for nobody but Jean.

422
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:07,208
It was homemade, but she
just... turned it down.

423
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,941
How rude.

424
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,151
Right?

425
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,611
And instead of saying thank you,

426
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:15,072
she... she asked me

427
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,676
what I thought the nature
of our relationship was.

428
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,970
She went all robotic on me,

429
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,433
i-insisting that our relationship
was just doctor-patient.

430
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,703
- Like she was just toying with you.
- And that's not the worst part.

431
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,880
I missed a few sessions, and this
bitch sent me a... a bill, right?

432
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,190
Can you believe that shit?

433
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,611
- I'd have gone ballistic.
- I did.

434
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,155
I know.

435
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,160
[Walt] You recognize that beer bottle?

436
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,731
Red Stripe.

437
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,001
Only beer I know comes
in a bottle that shape.

438
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,860
I'm a Rainier man myself,

439
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,672
but they don't sell that in
bottles around here, so...

440
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,262
Not very useful for Molotov cocktails.

441
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,610
[Vic] And Duncan, before
you say another word,

442
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:08,431
you need to know that your boss
isn't backing up your story anymore.

443
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,586
We know that you don't have an alibi

444
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,410
for the time that that
van went up in flames.

445
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,555
Okay, okay. Okay, you got me, all right?

446
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,984
It's... [sighs]

447
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,529
I got anger issues.

448
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,014
Donna and I were working on that.

449
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:26,519
And I know it wasn't appropriate
to firebomb her truck.

450
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,788
I was upset.

451
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:34,235
I needed Donna to know that you
can't treat people like that.

452
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,714
You can't just... just brush me off.

453
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,511
That stew was homemade.

454
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,431
So, where is she, Duncan?

455
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,290
What?

456
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,725
I told you, Randal has her.

457
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,228
You just admitted to torching her van.

458
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,356
Yeah.

459
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,275
I torched her van, but I
wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

460
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,311
[Ferg] Hey.

461
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,021
I finally confirmed the
I.D. of Andrew Price.

462
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,649
He really is Donna's
son. I talked to her ex.

463
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,734
Okay.

464
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:19,614
Um, and his dad,
Donna's ex, is a lawyer.

465
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,325
He's pretty pissed that we're
holding his son without charging him.

466
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,034
You want me to charge him?

467
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,179
No. Uh, no.

468
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,333
Duncan just confessed to,
uh, firebombing Donna's van.

469
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,604
We'll see if that's all he's
done, but you can let Andrew go.

470
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,512
All right, make sure this is everything.

471
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,822
Sign here, okay?

472
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,356
- No, no, no, no.
- Hey, who's this?

473
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,608
My mom's old boyfriend?

474
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,992
You can show yourself out, Andrew.

475
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,736
- You locking me up?
- Yep.

476
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,881
This is insane. What about this guy?

477
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,342
This guy's pressing charges!
I might even sue your ass!

478
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,844
[Ferg] Sit down.

479
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,681
Hey, Sheriff.

480
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,249
You probably should hear this.

481
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,207
[cell phone beeps]

482
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,251
[Donna] Hey, Andy.

483
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,478
It's Mom.

484
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,255
Uh, no big dealio. Just checking in.

485
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,089
Look, she never just checks in,

486
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,275
and I've never heard her
say "dealio" in my life.

487
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,863
Okay, I think something is,
like, actually, seriously wrong.

488
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,282
Call log says she called two hours ago.

489
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,934
I'll have the phone company trace it.

490
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,995
Here. Write down your number.

491
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,082
So, that call came in
while Duncan was in custody.

492
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,791
[keypad clicking]

493
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,570
Yeah, I'm with the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department. I need a trace.

494
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,363
Yeah, I'll hold.

495
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,366
Hey, maybe Donna got access to a phone
after Duncan went to the Red Pony.

496
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,203
But if she was alone, why would
she feel the need to speak in code?

497
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,349
He only admitted to the
bombing, not the abduction.

498
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,058
So, maybe Duncan was telling the truth,

499
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,322
and the bomber and the abductor
are not the same person.

500
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:59,171
So, what, you think there's
a third person out there?

501
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,356
Nope.

502
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,528
Okay. You call me as soon
as that trace comes through.

503
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,365
[door closes]

504
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,309
[Vic] Tamar Smith was in the
hospital, Walt. She's got an alibi.

505
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,955
[Walt] For the bombing.
What about the abduction?

506
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,443
According to Donna, Tamar's
suicide attempt is related

507
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,796
to transference issues with Donna.

508
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,169
Think how she reacted when
she heard Donna was missing.

509
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,156
Nothing.

510
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,634
Yeah, and Duncan freaked out.

511
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,284
Right.

512
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,557
Tamar was more concerned that I
looked like her commanding officer.

513
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,501
[cell phone rings]

514
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,322
Hey, Ferg.

515
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,116
Yeah.

516
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,176
Okay.

517
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,515
Phone company confirms that
Donna's call came from here.

518
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,825
Vic.

519
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,745
Shit.

520
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,066
- I'm so sorry, Walt.
- It's not your fault.

521
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,776
She was here. I didn't see this.

522
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,487
- I didn't look here.
- At least we know she's alive.

523
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,965
We just got to figure
out where Tamar took her.

524
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,652
[man] Excuse me, ma'am.

525
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:11,145
- Looks like you could use a little air.
- Back up, asshole.

526
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,290
Whoa, take it easy, sweetheart.

527
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,699
I said back up.

528
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,995
God damn it! What the
hell's wrong with you?!

529
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,998
- I'm trying to tell you your tire's low!
- Do I stutter?! Back off!

530

Hang on.

00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
[Tamar] Let's go!

537
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,263
- Yes, okay, okay, okay.
- Now!

00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,991
- Okay.
- Come on.

539
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,352
Yeah.

540
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,896
Yeah, we heard it on the evening news,

541
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,042
but you got to keep putting that
information out there until we find her.

542
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,461
Yeah, I appreciate it.

on the whereabouts

545
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,810
of local woman Tamar Smith,

546
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,002
a Caucasian in her early 30s.

547
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,689
Ms. Smith is wanted in conjunction
with the possible abduction

of Dr. Donna Monaghan

[radio shuts off]

00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,410
You know you're not really a ghost.

You can't just run into traffic.

What are you doing out here?

I will not be needing this anymore.

- Why not?
- Because I will be in jail.

I am.

Are you serious?

I will not be manipulated
or exploited anymore.

563

I would rather be back in prison.

All right.

565
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,903
If that's how you feel.

[Henry] It is.

And I am sorry.

00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,886
I realize this puts you
in a difficult position.

Me? Why do you figure that?

570
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:48,645
You told me you were having a tough time
getting people on the Res to trust you.

00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,860
I imagine that will
become even more difficult

when they learn that you are
the one that arrested Hector.

573

Do you think people will thank
you for sending their folk hero

574
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,410
to the white man's prison?

575
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,787
I am not so sure.

576
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,168
What do you want, Henry?

577
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,715
I would like to renegotiate
the terms of our arrangement.

to be on the lookout

been missing for three days.

The sheriff is also looking
for a silver Subaru Forester...

582
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,798
I'm so stupid.

583
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,443
The media's gonna twist this
into some kind of sex scandal.

584
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,719
They're going to say
I'm a crazy lesbian lover

who just fell off the deep end.

No, they won't because I won't let them.

587
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,893
I should never have let you
make that call to your son.

588
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,121
You let me make that call
because you care about me.

589
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,981
I know that.

590
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,625

But now they're gonna come find me.

Look, Tamar, I'm gonna say something
as a friend, not a therapist, okay?

I...

595
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,472
Don't you think that on some level,
you want this whole thing to end?

596
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,763
I mean, you have no escape
plan, there's nowhere to go,

597
00:36:09,764 --> 00:36:12,145
- there's nothing that you can do.
- I just need to think.

598
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,466
Look, let's just try to figure
a way out of this together, okay?

599
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:21,178
I think that we should go to the police,
and you should just turn yourself in.

600
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,764
I-I don't think it's gonna be that bad.

601
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,700
Look, I will tell them that
you were only trying to help me.

602
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,496
You will?

603
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,831
Yes.

604
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,484
So... [sighs]

605
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,295
Basically, I just have to trust you?

606
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,840
Yes.

607
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,326
Well, a few weeks ago in session,

608
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,721
you said that I was placing
too much trust in you.

609
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,765
Well, this is different.

610
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,396
It sure is.

611
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,069
How am I supposed to trust
you when you do shit like this?

612
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,177
I think this ends tonight's session.

613
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,857
- Where'd she go?
- Around the side of the building.

614
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,507
To use the bathroom, I guess.

615
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,759
Can we see that video?

616
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,593
I only got one camera,
and it's to keep people

617
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,137
from helping themselves to free gas.

618
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,115
I never thought I'd
need one on the restroom.

619
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,349
Do you know if this woman was alone?

620
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,684
I don't know anything about her.

621
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,229
She just went a little psycho on the guy,
and he came in here to tell me about it.

622
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,930
Before I could go out and talk
to her, she peeled off in the car.

623
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,168
Which direction?

624
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,944
Uh, right on up the hill.

625
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,380
She went way faster
than the speed limit.

626
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,383
I suppose that's the
least of her crimes.

627
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:11,080
Man, those things are a pain
in the ass to fold back up.

628
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,664
- What are you looking for?
- Lake.

629
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,541
Pretty sure there's one nearby.

630
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,144
Foley Lake's right up that way.

631
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,186
Show me where.

632
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,296
Uh, right there.

633
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,215
What's so special about Foley Lake?

634
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,968
It's named for one of Custer's soldiers.

635
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,905
- Story is he had some relative...
- Tamar had a picture of a lake.

636
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,698
[Vic] Where?

637
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,497
At her house when we talked to her.

638
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,705
I didn't see it.

639
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,501
It came from the drawer.

640
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,128
Somebody's getting his memory back.

641
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,404
You think that's where Tamar's headed?

642
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,007
It's worth a look.

643
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,017
You really think there
are any houses out here?

644
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,519
[Walt] I see two docks.

645
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,046
One there.

646
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,982
One back there.

647
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,694
Chances are each one belongs to a house.

648
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,224
There's no boats at either of them.

649
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,518
We should probably
check them out anyway.

650
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,124
Let's just do a quick recon pass,
meet back up on the other side.

651
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,122
[Ferg] How do you
think he's really doing?

652
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,792
- Walt?
- He seems a little off.

653
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,395
Yeah, well, he got shot.

654
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,795
And hit in the head.

655
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,565
[sighs]

656
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,861
Just give him time.

657
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,745
[Ferg] Do you think
he'd even be able to deal

658
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,190
with having another
woman he cares about die?

659
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,126
Let's hope we don't have to find out.

660
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,488
Tamar!

661
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,033
Tamar!

662
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,761
You need to come out of there right now.

663
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,349
Come out slowly with
your hands over your head.

664
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,019
[Donna] Walt, it's me.

665
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,149
I'm okay, just drop your weapon.

666
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,176
Donna!

667
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,861
[Donna] Just please put the gun down.

668
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,515
You have to trust me.

669
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,326
Put down the weapon.

670
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,528
Okay.

671
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,047
I put it down.

672
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,571
[door creaks]

673
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,299
- Drop the gun!
- Drop it!

674
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,735
[Donna] Easy!

675
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:17,779
Everybody easy.

676
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,614
- I told you we couldn't trust him.
- I don't want to shoot,

677
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,825
but I will if I have to, now drop it!

678
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,995
Don't yell, Walt, okay?
Please just lower your voice.

679
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,606
You were supposed to
leave the gun outside.

680
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,441
- You lied to me.
- You shot me.

681
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,044
Was I supposed to trust
you? Now let Donna go.

682
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,672
- I can't let you hurt Dr. Monaghan.
- I won't.

683
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,882
- I'm trying to protect her.
- Bullshit!

684
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,790
Tamar.

685
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,460
I do not want to hurt
Dr. Monaghan or you.

686
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,688
But I also don't want you to hurt her.

687
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,423
Me?

688
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,924
I'm protecting her!

689
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,528
You shot her, and you kidnapped her.

690
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:03,199
T-To keep me from being raped, Walt.

691
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,559
You see, the other day when...
when... when you took me

692
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,228
back to my house to get some
things, Tamar saw us there

693
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,691
and she saw you, and she thought you
were big a-and threatening and macho,

694
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,253
and she just got very worried for me.

695
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,422
Do you understand what I'm saying, Walt?

696
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,514
Are you in love with Dr. Monaghan?

697
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,099
- See?
- No.

698
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,643
- Tamar.
- I told you.

699
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,439
- This is what everybody will think!
- No, no, they won't.

700
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,632
Walt, this is not about jealousy.

701
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,277
It is about trauma.

702
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,137
Tamar is a rape victim,
and you are triggering...

703
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,907
Shut up! No more!

704
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,158
Shut up!

705
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:50,229
There's a reason that
soldiers don't go to shrinks.

706
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,039
'Cause it just makes it worse.

707
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,668
I should've kept this to myself.

708
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,653
No.

709
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,756
But you opened me up, right?

710
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,533
And all the shit started
coming out of my head,

711
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,052
and it should've just stayed there.

712
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,265
Was it your C.O.?

713
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,102
Tamar?

714
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:17,422
The man in the picture that
you showed me who looks like me?

715
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,732
Did he rape you?

716
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:25,532
[breathing shakily]

717
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,334
He was supposed to protect us.

718
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,173
Off base, you know, where the enemy is.

719
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,742
[voice breaking] You
know, where the danger is.

720
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,804
Back on the F.O.B., it
was supposed to be safe!

721
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,604
But Captain... Frederick...

722
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,279
I never knew when he was gonna show up.

723
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,284
I'm not like him.

724
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,412
You don't know him!

725
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,664
You don't know what he's like!

726
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,667
[breathing shakily]

727
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,904
Dr. Monaghan, you say
that you trust this guy.

728
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,924
How well do you really know him?

729
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,384
Because I thought that I
knew my commanding officer,

730
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,953
but he had all the power,
and he used it against me.

731
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,665
And because of his rank,
nobody listened to me.

732
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,769
Why should I trust this guy?

733
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,590
You're right, Tamar.

734
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,067
You don't know me.

735
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,655
So, let's give Dr. Monaghan the power.

736
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,796
If you and me are both
trying to protect her,

737
00:46:50,797 --> 00:46:54,568
let's... let's let
her decide what to do.

738
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,125
Now, I want everybody to be safe.

739
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:04,421
So, I'm gonna give Dr. Monaghan my gun.

740
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,665
It's okay, Tamar.

741
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,435
You and I just wanted
Dr. Monaghan to be safe.

742
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,229
Now she is.

743
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,692
You've done your job.

744
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,528
Now you can go.

745
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,907
Nothing bad's gonna happen now, Tamar.

746
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,107
Uh...

747
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,092
Oh, yeah.

748
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,177
Wow.

749
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,054
[sniffs] If it makes
you feel any better,

750
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,933
I've never really used one
of these things anyway, so...

751
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,744
It, uh...

752
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,564
It does not make me feel any better now.

753
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,333
[gun clicks]

754
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,722
[Donna] I'm okay. I'm gonna be fine.

755
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,916
[Walt] You're okay.

756
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,686
[Donna] I'm okay. I'm okay.

757
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,127
- Thank you.
- You sure?

758
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,146
Yeah.

759
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,483
Listen.

760
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,428
You stay in here, and
you stay low, okay?

761
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,574
Yeah, okay.

762
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,205
Walt.

763
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,816
If you catch her, don't hurt her, okay?

764
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,526
She's... she's not a criminal.

765
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,296
She's just deeply traumatized.

766
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,258
Yeah.

767
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,185
[Walt] Tamar.

768
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,235
This was my grandpa's place.

769
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,114
It's the last place I felt
safe before I deployed.

770
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,450
Now I'm afraid to go out.

771
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,246
To sleep, even.

772
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,650
You've been through a lot.

773
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,944
So have you.

774
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,839
I'm used to it.

775
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,433
Where am I supposed to go, sir?

776
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,212
I can't function out there anymore.

777
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,648
Look at what I did to
you and Dr. Monaghan.

778
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,277
I'm hurting people.

779
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,699
That's not who I am.

780
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,744
Or who I was.

781
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,710
Cuff me.

782
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,089
I don't think that'll be necessary.

783
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,824
I don't trust myself anymore, sir.

784
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,760
Please.

785
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:43,242
When you tell your side of the
story, people will understand.

786
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:52,043
Can I just have a minute?

787
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,716
I just want to take one
last look at this place.

788
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,721
Try to keep one good memory in my head.

789
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,530
I'm so sorry.

790
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,741
What for?

791
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,351
I just... I seem to have a knack

792
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,372
for stirring up trouble in
other people's lives, and...

793
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,375
That's not how I see it.

794
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,382
[splash]

795
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,384
