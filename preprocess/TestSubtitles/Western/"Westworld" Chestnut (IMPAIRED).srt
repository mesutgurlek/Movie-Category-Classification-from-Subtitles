00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,284

             feel free to be
              someone else.

           Welcome to Westworld.

25
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,406
    Thanks.

26
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,409
          Given it's your first
          visit, I have a few
          personal questions.

27
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,871
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

28
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,539
       No, not that I know of.

29
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,374
        - Heart problems?
        - No.

30
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:51,667
            Any history
            of mental illness,
            depression,

31
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,587
              panic attacks?

32
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,380
             Just a little fear
             of clowns.

33
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,133
              I'm joking.

34
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:01,344
  Do you often experience
  social anxiety?

35
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,432
        What is this for,
        exactly?

36
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,560
  To make sure we don't
 give you anything more
  than you can handle.

37
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:12,021
       I thought that you
       couldn't get hurt here.

38
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,649
Only the right amount.

39
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,905
           The only limit here
          is your imagination.

40
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,033
        You start in
        the center of the park.
        It's simple, safe.

41
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,828
  <i> The further out</i>
  <i> you venture, the more</i>
  <i> intense the experience gets.</i>

42
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:31,207
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

43
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,927
         So, how does this work?
        Is there an orientation?

44
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,221
  No orientation,

45
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,181
   no guidebook.

46
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:50,518
Figuring out how it works
is half the fun.

47
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,645
All you do
is make choices...

48
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,522
starting here.

49
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:58,985
 Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

50
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:08,744
            You want to ask,
            so ask.

51
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:11,330
   Are you real?

52
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:15,167
       Well, if you can't tell,
       does it matter?

53
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,049
      Are those real?

54
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:24,010
                  <i> Real enough.</i>

55

      <i> But you can't kill anyone</i>
      <i> you're not supposed to.</i>

56
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,060
       Anything you like?

57
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,816
Is there a changing room?

58
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,901
   Or a robe?

59
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,528
             Of course.
             I can help you.

60
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:46,490
          Or if you prefer,
          I could step outside.

61
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,453
What do most people do?

62
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,873
          You don't have
          to worry about what
          most people would do.

63
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,752
     I understand.

64
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,048
           Do you really
           understand, William?

65
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:09,680
           All our hosts
           are here for you.

66
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,266
           Myself included.

67
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,060
          We could stay here
          a while if you like.

68
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,896
       Take as long as you want.

69
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,486
         Thank you.

70
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,738
    I don't want to keep
    my friend waiting.

71
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,823
              Of course.

72
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,450
            Take your time.

73
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,922
    How are the builds
    for the new narrative
    coming along?

74
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:46,467
          I'll get around to it.

75
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:50,096
        Look, we assumed
        that Abernathy's breach

76
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,390
          was triggered
        by the photograph
         that he found.

77
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,767
       I've reviewed
       every dissonant episode
       I could find.

78
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,144
        The reaction
        is immediate every time.

79
00:06:57,188 --> 00:07:00,815
        This guy makes it
        all the way back home.

80
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,567
          It's like
          he's mulling it over.

81
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:07,822
 You think he had
 an existential crisis?

82
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:11,409
    I think there's
    something fucked up
    going on with his cognition.

83
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:14,036
           And I think you feel
           exactly the same way
           that I do.

84
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,330
  Do we know where
  the error originated?

85
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,582
                   We do.

86
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,000
        And you covered for him.

87
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,088
       Let me rebuild Abernathy.

88
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,339
             I'll make sure
          this is not something
              more serious.

89
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:29,051
You know the policy.
Let it lie.

90
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:32,304
         Then let me at least
         pull the hosts who had
         contact with him,

91
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,640
      like the daughter Dolores.

92
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,308
         What for?

93
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:39,478
          Because if this is not
          a dissonant episode,

94
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:43,941
     then whatever Abernathy had
     could be contagious.

95
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:46,902
                So to speak.

96
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,780
    Dolores was examined
    and cleared.

97
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:54,368
 And the stories are
 best left to the guests.

         Maeve's voice:

178

    Whenever I wanted something,
    I could hear that voice

179
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,753
            telling me to stop,
            to be careful,

180
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:05,173
            to leave most
            of my life unlived.

181
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:08,051
       You know the only place
       that voice left me alone?

182
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,471
            In my dreams.

183
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:14,600
           I was free.
           I could be as good

184
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:17,936
           or as bad
           as I felt like being.

185
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,063
             And if I wanted
             something,

186
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,816
          I could just
          reach out and take it.

187
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,279
        But then I would wake up

188
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:28,989
           and the voice would
           start all over again.

189
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,911
               So I ran away.

190
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:36,204
        Crossed the shining sea.

191
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:39,124
     And when I finally set foot
     back on solid ground,

192
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:42,210
     the first thing I heard
     was that goddamn voice.

193
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,380
       Do you know what it said?

194
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,512
           It said...

195
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,849
           ( gasping )

196
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:02,189
I'm sorry, will you
please excuse me?

197
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:10,238
              Man:
       <i> All right, Maeve,</i>
        <i> what did it say?</i>

198
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:13,325
             Maeve:
       <i> It said, "This is</i>
         <i> the new world.</i>

199
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,910
       And in this world,

200
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,913
       you can be whoever
       the fuck you want."

201
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,749
Pupillary response is good.
Smile is good.

202
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:24,002
I'd fuck her.
What's the problem?

203
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,754
  Woman:
  The guests wouldn't.

204
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,047
  Sizemore is launching
  some huge new storyline

205
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,008
    and he wants us
    to clear out the deadweight.

       <i> No point in playing coy.</i>

210
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,187
    <i> If this doesn't work,</i>
    <i> we'll punt her to behavior.</i>

211

         <i> Let them deal with it.</i>

212

    We retired the two hosts

213

        how to make them,

214

        to turn them off.

217

           I know how that
           head of yours works.

      The photograph alone

219
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,857
     couldn't have
     caused that level
     of damage to Abernathy,

220
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,318
   not without some other
    outside interference.

221
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:33,363
       You think it's sabotage?

222
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,909
    Imagine someone's been
    diddling with our creations?

223

     Ah, Mr. Occam's razor.

225
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:47,210
The problem, Bernard,
is that what you and I do

226
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:51,757
       is so complicated.

227

     Hey, they're not
      going anywhere.

266
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,441
    First up,
    you're gonna buy me
    a drink, okay?

  <i> Bring yourself back online.</i>

         Yes, of course.

273
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,236
     And you haven't told anyone
     about our little talks?

274
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,241
    You told me not to.

275
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,870
           Step into analysis,
           please.

276
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,376
       How many interactions
       have you participated in
       since we last talked?

277
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:19,631
         138 encounters
       including this one.

278
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,174
          And has anyone
          altered or updated

279
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,510
          your core heuristics
          in that time?

280
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,262
No.

        Have I done
        something wrong?

285
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:44,072
       No, but there's something
       different about you,

286
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,617
       about the way you think.

287
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:49,452
         I find it fascinating,

288
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:52,998
           but others may not
           see it that way.

Do you know

          - No.

        Do what I do.

   You find yourself

     wake yourself right up.

326
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:48,780
Nice and warm
and safe in your bed...

327

You all right?

333
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,018
       You pay for the drinks,

334
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:20,437
                  not the right
                 to gawk at me.

335
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:27,777
              I think we have
              a problem.

336
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,612
           - Where?
           - Mariposa.

337
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:31,364
             Madam's listed
             as probationary,

338
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:34,159
        but her performance
        has continued to decline
        even further.

339
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,202
             Re-task Clementine
             for now.

340
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:38,621
      She's done the job before.

343
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,503
     Maybe leave her
     on the floor for the night,

344
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:48,590
       see if anyone wants
       one last turn.

345
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:50,383
          We recall her
          in the morning,
          decommission her.

346
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,554
            Shame.

347
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:14,407
        QA will fine you
        for this.

348
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,035
And that woman in charge

349
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,662
   is quite formidable.

350
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,835
       You can just say "bitch."
       I hear it enough.

351
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,463
       You've been talking
       to corporate.

00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,548
   The only times you light up
   are after you've been--

353
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:35,345
    This character analysis
    routine really isn't half
    as charming as you think.

354
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,846
 Oh, it went well, then?

355
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:41,601
     Just tell me
     your department will be
     ready for the launch.

356
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:43,228
We'll be ready.

357

    Abernathy and the update.

358

   I hear your department
   was still asking questions.

359

   That's what you
   pay us to do.

 But I'm not concerned.

      can we finish eating?

373

        driven, and inoffensive.

 I thought you didn't want
 to talk about work here.

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,271
   Well, that's not
   the term I'd use.

397
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:53,399
            - Fun?
            - Friend.

398
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,570
          ( chuckles )
          You're funny.

00:27:57,614 --> 00:28:01,824
                They say a man

     we can find someone who is.

            perfect for you.

00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:15,838
    No, you--
    you are perfect.

404
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:18,925
But I have somebody.

405
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:21,219
Somebody real

406
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,474
               I understand.

407
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:32,855
             Real love

  That's what I asked for.

413
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,515
          And this,
          this is what
          you give me?

414
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,309

415
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:12,895
              and jam it

    It's not exactly
    a savage horde with
    20 savages, is it?

424
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:46,053
           You get 20 additional
           hosts, not 50.

425
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:47,847
The board won't care about
a few extra line items.

     Has Ford even approved
     the narrative yet?

Oh, he hasn't weighed in

  Follow the blood arroyo

   Whatever you want.

  Why don't you go home,

           No, you don't
           understand, Lawrence.

536
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:57,419
          This time,
          I'm never going back.

537
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:20,401
     And we wanted to climb

           we weren't allowed.

539
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,823

540
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,245
                And here we are.

       the point of that?

     We do give them
     the concept of dreams.

608
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Specifically nightmares.

The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins
