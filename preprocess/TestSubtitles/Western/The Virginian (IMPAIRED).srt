So, you would like me
to read this

'Sides, she calls
herself a spinster.

A woman might be
considered a spinster.

178

Now, you know we talked

I swear to God,

You're gonna rehire him

I can teach you

about the ambush

And how he barely
escaped with his life.

Turn him over to the law.

have to let you go.

to fire him.

When you catch a fox
in your henhouse,

It seemed to be
a prudent course of action.

Nobody needs to kill you,

Since when
do you read?

966
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:32,837
These are schoolbooks.

967
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:37,842
You got new textbooks
for miss west, didn't you?

968

Thought
I'd surprise her.

You need to
have those wrapped.

Mm-hmm.

don't you?

Well...

00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,357
Where did you find these?

975
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,660
Well, it took some diggin'
and about a month's pay,

976
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:31,662
But I hear tell

977
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,665
Those're about the best damn
schoolbooks you can find.

Thank you.

979

You know,
you didn't have to do that.

00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,709
I know that.

981
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,882
So, seems like
you're recovering nicely.

982
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,784
Are you
taking it easy?

983
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:56,120
Nah, there's no time
for relaxing.

those rustlers.

I'm told it's a sin

987
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,963
Worse than murder
in Wyoming.

Yeah.

989
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,934

I suppose.

I should properly thank you

a place to stay.

has holes in the roof.

It is indeed a fact.

1307
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:03,159
I think I know what
you think of me.

1308
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,929
And, uh, I thought

1309
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,264
I was just
doing my job,

1310
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,200
But I was wrong.

1311
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,772
I hope we can...

1312
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:18,307
Get past this.

1313
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:22,912
Can you get past this?

1314
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,052
[Huffs emotionally,
stifles himself]

1315
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,789
He needed help.

1316
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:35,291
He needed help
and I killed him.

1317
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,826
I killed him.

1318
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,027
[Sighs]

1319
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,669
Molly...

1320
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,804
You just shut up for once.

1321
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:58,848
[Exhales deeply]

1322
01:16:58,882 --> 01:17:01,117
You did what
you thought was right.

1323
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,353
And we all do.

1324
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,892
That's why I've decided

1325
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,327
I'm leaving tomorrow
for Vermont.

1326
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:13,830
What about the school?

1327
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:15,098
Who's gonna...

1328
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,166
Who's gonna teach?

1329
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,202
I've written
for a replacement.

1330
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:21,905
The new teacher will
be here in two weeks.

1331
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:23,840
Don't.

1332
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:25,675
Please.

1333
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,113
I have to.

1334
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:06,482
I'm taking Molly to Cheyenne
in the morning.

1335
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,718
She's going home.

1336
01:18:08,752 --> 01:18:11,855
Alright.

1337
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,323
And I'm going with her.

1338
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,460
If she'll have me.

1339
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:25,034
It is a long train ride
to do by myself.

1340
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:31,407
[Starts chuckling]

1341
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,242
What's so funny?

1342
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,946
I'm just havin' a hard time...

1343
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,182
Picturing you in Vermont,
is all.

1344
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,752
I got some business
in Cheyenne myself.

1345
01:18:42,786 --> 01:18:43,820
Oh, really?

1346
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:46,055
Like what?

1347
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:50,526
I'm gonna take this
to the U.S. marshals.

1348
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,261
Maybe they can find
the guilty parties.

1349
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:54,931
I can round up
a whole lot more gunmen

1350
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,265
Than the U.S. government can.

1351
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:58,534
You oughta just give it here.

1352
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,338
If it's all the same to you,
I'll take it to Cheyenne.

1353
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:07,243
I want trampas to pay.

1354
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:10,013
You know, we sent some people
out to find balin.

1355
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:12,248
He's at the root
of all this trouble.

1356
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:15,218
Balin's too scared of the noose
to have anything to do with it.

1357
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,986
He's the one
that hired trampas.

1358
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,255
You hired him, too.

1359
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:23,159
What are you insinuatin', son?

1360
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,527
[South]: Not a thing.

1361
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:27,563
I'm just sayin' again

1362
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,099
That I don't think
balin's a thief.

1363
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,837
They're not going to
hurt him, are they?

1364
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:37,941
They will
serve justice, ma'am.

1365
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,343
[Molly]:
I understand all too well

1366
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,579
What constitutes "justice"
in Wyoming.

1367
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,680
[Judge]: We got a...

1368
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,550
Way of life we're trying
to protect out here, ma'am.

1369
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:51,487
[Shot rings out]

1370
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,457
Balin ain't done nothin'
to deserve your kind of justice.

1371
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,691
South...

1372
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,928
Why don't you just come out
and say what you want to say?

1373
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,596
I'm sick of

1374
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,932
The way you push
those small ranchers around.

1375
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:04,968
One of these days, one of 'em's
gonna push back.

1376
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,469
Yeah. And that,

1377
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:08,171
That's gonna be
somethin' worth seeing.

1378
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,839
Lynching a man
for stealing?

1379
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,878
Where theft
is worth a man's life.

1380
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:15,879
[Heavy thud]

1381
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,088
[Chair scrapes floor]

1382
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:27,256
Someday,
you'll pay for what you've done.

1383
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,125
I'm gonna pay?

1384
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,194
[Sets cutlery down]

1385
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,162
What is it I'm gonna pay for?

1386
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:34,931
Did you forget
who you're talking to?

1387
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:39,235
I've got the taste of bile
on my tongue because of you.

1388
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,569
Come on, Molly.

1389
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:42,005
Oh, so all of a sudden,
you're so high and mighty,

1390
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:44,040
'Cause you got yourself
a proper woman, huh?

1391
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,574
You keep her
out of this.

1392
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:47,576
And noble, too, huh?

1393
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:49,378
Let's not forget,

1394
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:51,147
You got blood
on your hands.

1395
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,248
Lots of it,

1396
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:55,184
And there never was
any cause for it.

1397
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,452
Do you have any idea

1398
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,888
How lawless this place
would be without me?

1399
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,423
I am the order!

1400
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:02,091
I am civilization!

1401
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:06,029
I made peace
where there was only chaos.

1402
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,597
I decide who dies around here!

And who lives, too.

Where are you
going, son?

1406
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:26,449
Sorry, but I seem
to have lost my appetite.

1407
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:34,090
I'll be leaving
tomorrow as well.

1408
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:37,360
That book of yours
finished?

1409
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,663
All except for
the ending.

1410
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,407
[Wagon rumbling]

1411
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,644
A word.

1412
01:21:58,114 --> 01:21:59,983
Whoa. Whoa.

1413
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:11,527
Wait for me
at the general store.

1414
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,997
Be careful.
Please.

1415
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:17,066
Walk on.

1416
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,202
Trampas wanted me

1417
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:20,503
To pass along a message
to you.

1418
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:23,372
You and him,
in front of the gallows, 4:00.

1419
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:26,109
Since when
are you his message boy?

1420
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:28,011
I ain't nobody's message boy.

1421
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:30,179
Maybe you ought
to ask me

1422
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:31,314
To take my gun off again.

1423
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:34,650
A lot easier to talk big
when you got a judge behind you.

1424
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,120
Not so much
when you're by your lonesome.

1425
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:38,454
I'm not alone.

1426
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:41,324
Mm. I remember when
the judge took you in,

1427
01:22:41,357 --> 01:22:43,626
A few years after
they found your father.

1428
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:46,595
You used to cry yourself
to sleep at night, like a baby.

1429
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:50,233
Boys used to joke
about it all the time.

1430
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:51,767
You been thinking
you're better than us

1431
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,336
Far too long.

1432
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,304
You're nothing more
than a dirty penny

1433
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:58,574
Someone saw fit
to try and shine once.

1434
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,376
You done?

1435
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:03,546
I'll be seeing you
in hell, South.

1436
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:04,680
Hey, you might be getting there

1437
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,549
A lot quicker
than you think, Broyles.

1438
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:20,029
I'm not going to
miss Wyoming.

1439
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:22,231
Not one bit.

1440
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:24,167
It's awfully pretty,

1441
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,169
For what it's worth.

1442
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:27,703
That's true.

1443
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,738
It's an evil
place, though.

1444
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:40,049
I've been called out
by trampas at 4:00.

1445
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:42,785
You don't
have to do this.

1446
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:45,354
This is something
that can't be left unfinished.

1447
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,193
We can leave
all this behind.

1448
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:51,694
I can't leave here a coward.

1449
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:53,129
That's not
important to me.

1450
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:54,730
It's important to me.

1451
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,365
It's important
to every other person

1452
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,502
That'd ever cross paths
with that snake.

1453
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,571
[Sighs tensely]

1454
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:04,473
I want you both
to stay here,

1455
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:06,142
Out of harm's way.

1456
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:08,711
I've been in harm's way
plenty lately.

1457
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:12,415
Owen, I'm asking you
to look after Molly.

1458
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:14,450
I don't need
to be looked after,

1459
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:16,085
And you don't need
to get yourself killed.

1460
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:18,254
I'm not plannin' on it.

1461
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:22,691
If you do this...

1462
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,793
I'm leaving.

1463
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:27,196
Right now,

1464
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,265
And I'm not coming back.

1465
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,269
You mean that?

1466
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:38,674
That it'd be the... end?

1467
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:40,276
Of us?

[Takes a shaky breath
and sighs]

1469
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:47,850
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me that, Molly?

1470
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:55,791
Well, that's how
it's gonna be?

Sure you want to do this?

01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,833
I have no choice.

You gut-shot me,
you bastard!

1488
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:17,873
I meant to.

1489
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,543
You deserve to die
slow and painful.

1490
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:23,412
Everything I done,
I done on orders.

1491
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,214
What do you mean?

1492
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:26,549
You stole all them
cattle, didn't you?

1493
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:28,817
Every one of them, you idiot.

1494
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:31,287
I already knew that.
I saw your ledger.

[Chuckling]

1496
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:35,758
It was the judge's ledger.

1497

You lie like a dog
even when you die.

1498
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:40,996
Why would he steal
his own stock?

1499
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,566
God, you're stupid.

1500
01:26:43,599 --> 01:26:46,635
If he can pin it on balin

1501
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:49,772
And them other
penny-ante ranchers,

1502
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,974
Then he gets all the land,

1503
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,809
And all the water!

1504

Hell...

You know what they call that?

1506
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:01,384
A monopoly. [Laughing]

1507
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:06,955
Yeah, he's wanted you dead
for some time now.

1508
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:10,726
He paid me to kill you today!

1509
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:13,562
Finish
what I started.

1510
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:16,399
Guess he never got
his money's worth.

You got to do it yourself.

You were gonna
be my heir.

Till you had to go believing
that the "code"

Was for everybody,
even folks like me.

The code ain't about murder.

a matter of time

Before you figured
that out, so...

to kill his son.

There ain't gonna be no God
to save your ass.
