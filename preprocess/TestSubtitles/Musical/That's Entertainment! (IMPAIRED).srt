It's been quite some time
since I first came to this place.

And MGM is certainly
not the same studio...

But the films we made here
are still around.

Some studios can claim
they made the finest gangster films...

...or the greatest horror movies...

48
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,839
...but when it came to musicals,
MGM, they were the champions.

49
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,927
Musicals were fantasy trips
for the audiences of their day.

50
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,222
For instance, boy meets girl,
boy loses girl...

...boy sings a song and gets girl.

00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,111
The work was hard, but it was great fun.

158
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,406
Because the people you worked with
really knew what they were doing.

159
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,619
It was said that through those doors
passed the most famous stars in Hollywood.

160
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,289
I don't think you'll find anyone around
this town who will argue about it.

161
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,292
Here's one of the most lovely
and talented of those stars...

162
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,002
...Miss Elizabeth Taylor.

163
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,769
I was 10 years old
when I first came to MGM.

164
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,106
And I spent most of the next 18 years
of my life...

165
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,484
...behind the walls of that studio.

166
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,695
As a young girl growing up
in that strange place...

167
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,740
...it's hard to recall
what was real and what wasn't.

168
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:48,162
Perhaps, my most vivid memories
were of MGM musicals.

169
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,665
Just to stand there on the set and watch...

170
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:55,503
...the singing and the dancing.
It was like fantasy come true.

171
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,048
Total innocence. Loveliness.

172
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:04,470
[SINGING]
I love a melody

173
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,972
Of spring

174
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,848
Lilacs in bloom

175
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,226
Birds on the wing

176
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,689
TAYLOR: I made my musical debut
when I was 15 years old...

177
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,857
...in a film called Cynthia.

178
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,653
I was certainly no threat
to Jane Powell or Judy Garland...

179
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,113
...as you will see.

180
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,992
[SINGING]
For life is an eager

181
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,453
Joyous thing

182
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:34,000
Whenever I hear

183
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,378
The music

184
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:43,342
Of

185
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,053
Spring

186
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,890
Maybe that experience helped give me...

187
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,436
...the enormous regard
that I have for musical talent.

188
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,731
And believe me, at MGM, I saw the best.

189
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,235
HORNE [SINGING]
Every honeybee sighs with jealousy

190
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,072
TAYLOR: For instance, if Lena Horne
was in a movie...

191
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,325
...then it almost had to be from MGM.

192
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,619
HORNE:
Honeysuckle rose

193
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,334
When we're passin' by
Flowers droop and sigh

194
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,586
And I know the reason why

195
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,922
You're much sweeter
Goodness knows

196
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,676
Honeysuckle rose

197
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,348
I don't buy sugar

198
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,352
You just have to touch my cup

199
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,064
You're my sugar

200
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,150
It's sweet when you stir it up

201
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,279
When I'm takin' sips
From your tasty lips

202
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,115
Seems the honey fairly drips

203
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,453
You're confection
Goodness knows

204
00:22:52,621 --> 00:23:07,426
You're my honeysuckle rose

205
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,262
- 'Cause it's one
- Two

206
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,139
- Three strikes, you're out
- Three strikes, you're out

207
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,101
- At the old ball game
- At the old ball game

208
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,397
TAYLOR: When Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly
teamed up for a series of films...

209
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,357
...the results were irresistible.

210
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,152
This is one of their best,
Take Me Out to the Ball Game.

211
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,546
[SINGING]
Thou swell, thou witty

212
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,049
Thou sweet, thou grand

213
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,261
Wouldst kiss me pretty?

214
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,222
Wouldst hold my hand?

215
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,058
Both thine eyes are cute too

216
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,770
What they do to me

217
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:47,151
Hear me holler
I choose a sweet lollapalooza in thee

218
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,572
TAYLOR: June Allyson, MGM's most popular
musical sweetheart...

219
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,533
...in Rodgers and Hart's Words and Music.

220
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,704
ALLYSON:
Two rooms and kitchen

221
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,916
I'm sure would do

222
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,585
Give me just a plot of

223
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,421
Not a lot of land

224
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,424
And thou swell

225
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,093
Thou witty, thou grand

226
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,521
TAYLOR:
Everybody's favorite college musical...

227
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,942
...Good News, starring June Allyson
and Peter Lawford.

228
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,111
Those sure were the good old days.

229
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,668
ALL [SINGING]:
The boy, "garçon"

230
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,753
His girl, "la fille"

231
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,922
That's good, "c'est bon"

232
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,924
The show, "fini"

233
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,053
The moral to this tale
Is not just "parlez-vous"

234
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,347
Send her a billet-doux

235
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,058
Tell her her eyes are blue

236
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,602
They sure are blue.

237
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,895
"Je vous adore" means

238
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:52,359
I love you

239
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,079
What wonderful years those were at MGM.

240
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:09,335
One day, I remember meeting a terribly
handsome young man from England.

241
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,881
He'd just started work at the studio.
Naturally, I fell wildly in love with him.

242
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,883
I still adore him.

243
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,553
He's still one of my closest
and dearest friends.

244
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,180
Peter Lawford.

245
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,408
This building, or what's left of it...

246
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,370
...was, among other things,
Tait College in Good News.

247
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,416
You might say that June Allyson,
Mel Tormé and I graduated from here.

248
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,753
We were all under contract to MGM
in those days.

249
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,591
And the studio pretty much told us
what pictures we were gonna appear in.

250
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,928
They put us in dramas, comedies
and in my case...

251
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,598
...don't ask me why, an occasional musical.

252
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,853
As a singer or dancer, I was ill-equipped
to compete with Astaire or Kelly...

253
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,023
...but we did what we were told to do.

254
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,448
LAWFORD: When I first came to MGM,
the world was at war.

255
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,702
To the Gls overseas and the audiences
here at home...

256
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,329
...the musicals were
a very special kind of escape...

257
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,124
...both during the war and sfterwards.

258
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,796
The films we made here
had a certain style...

259
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,006
...a look that was unmistakable.

260
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,135
Whether it was the directing,
or the writing, or the scenery...

261
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,513
...the costumes, the lighting,
I don't really know.

262
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:48,350
But somehow you could always tell
that it was an MGM movie.

263
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,185
Especially the musicals.

264
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,318
MAN 1:
All right, cut it.

265
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,695
- Print it, Jane.
- Okay.

266
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,031
All right, take me into number one.
Okay, number one.

267
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,658
MAN 2:
Can you see your marks, Joe?

268
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,161
MAN 3: Okay, everybody.
- Quiet! We're rolling.

269
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,330
Speed. Action.

270
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,333
LAWFORD:
The studio was constantly experimenting...

271
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,210
...constantly showcasing new talent.

272
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:19,006
For instance, Debbie Reynolds and Carleton
Carpenter in Two Weeks with Love.

273
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,424
BOTH [SINGING]:
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a

274
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,218
[SINGING]
Said the chimpy to the monk

275
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,763
Said the monkey to the chimp

276
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,224
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they were happy and gay

277
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,227
Swinging and singing
In a honky-tonky way

278
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,562
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a

279
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,522
Means, "Monk, I love but you"

280
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,734
"Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a" in monkey talk
Means, "Chimp, I love you too"

281
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,529
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon

282
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,200
They went upon their
Aba daba honeymoon

283
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,703
LAWFORD: Elizabeth Taylor starred
in A Date With Judy...

284
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,207
...one of the first in a new wave
of teenage musicals...

285
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,210
...most of them produced by Joe Pasternak.

286
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,420
That isn't Elizabeth's voice you're hearing.

287
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,256
MGM kept her too busy
to rehearse and record.

288
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,635
But her costar, Jane Powell,
quickly became one of the studio's...

289
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,470
...most popular young talents.

290
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,764

It's a most unusual day

There is sunshine everywhere

00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,953
There are people greeting people

And a feeling of spring in the air

It's a most unusual time

I keep feeling my temperature climb

If my heart won't behave in the usual way

Well, there's only one thing to say

302

It's a most unusual
Most unusual

On the Atchison, Topeka

314
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:46,486
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe

315
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,947
LAWFORD: The Harvey Girls,
directed by George Sidney...

316
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,408
...starred Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.

317
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,329
And this Oscar-winning song was written
by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.

318
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,374
ALL [SINGING]: In this day and age
Girls don't leave home

319
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,920
But if ya get a hankerin'
You wanna roam

320
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:07,174
Our advice to you is run away

321
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,802
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the

322
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,183
Santa Fe

323
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,770
All aboard!

324
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:25,442
We came across the country lickety-split
Rolling 90 miles an hour, fit to be tied

325
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,905
I can't believe I'm here at last

326
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,033
When you go traveling
It's natch for you

327
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,286
To take the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe

328
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,499
I can't believe that anything
Would go so fast

329
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,211
Then you pull that throttle

330
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,713
Whistle blows

331
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:51,009
A-huffin' and a-puffin'
And away she goes

332
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:57,683
All aboard for California

333
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,769
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison

334
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,855
- On the Atchison, Topeka
- On the Atchison, Topeka

335
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,984
- On the Atchison, Topeka and
- On the Atchison, Topeka and

336
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,902
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the

337
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:16,034
Santa Fe

338
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,041
By the 1950s, the movie musical
was reaching a level...

339
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,670
...of inventiveness and sophistication
that was pretty hard to top...

340
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,755
...even by today's standards.

341
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,094
But it wasn't always like that.
And here's someone to tell you about it.

342
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,432
And he's pretty hard to top too.
Mr. James Stewart.

343
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,603
In the late 1920s and early '30s...

344
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,900
...these 200 acres of real estate
were seeing a panic, pandemonium.

345
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,947
Sound pictures had replaced silent films
virtually overnight.

346
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,243
The only actor in town that wasn't worried
was Rin Tin Tin.

347
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,997
As long as he could bark,
well, sound was no threat to him.

348
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,087
STEWART:
For MGM and the rest of Hollywood...

349
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,298
...there were gloomy days ahead.

350
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:16,553
Some of the biggest silent stars
spoke with thick foreign accents.

351
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,640
Others had a lisp
or talked through their noses.

352
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,353
The early microphones seemed
to exaggerate the flaws...

353
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,898
...that silent film had hidden.

354
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,819
As quickly as the sound stages went up,
careers collapsed.

355
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,282
The studio heads were desperate.

356
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,870
Where would the new stars, the new
personalities come from, they wondered.

357
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,166
Well, the answer was obvious.
From the theater, from Broadway.

358
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:51,004
Theatrical experience suddenly became
a passport to Hollywood...

359
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:55,342
...even if it meant no more than
a few weeks of summer stock.

360
00:34:55,968 --> 00:35:00,013
Over the next few years,
a steady stream of hopefuls...

361
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,518
...marched through the gates of
every studio in town, including MGM.

362
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:13,193
I should know, I was one of those
hungry young actors from the East.

363
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,487
- Sam, is everything all right?
- Okay, Fred.

364
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,364
- How are the cameras?
- All right.

365
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,698
Bob, how are your lights?

366
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,534
BOB:
All set, whenever you are.

367
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,285
Good. How's the music...?

368
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,914
STEWART: Musicals were the most popular
commodity in the early '30s.

369
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,292
And they were cranked out
at an incredible rate.

370
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,837
Most of them really weren't very good.

371
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,048
But if audiences suffered,
they didn't complain.

372
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,552
The real victims were the dramatic actors.

373
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,973
The studio pushed nearly
every one of them into musical roles.

374
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,977
MONTGOMERY [SINGING]:
It must be you

375
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,689
Who carries me away

376
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:55,902
STEWART: Here, an uncomfortable
Robert Montgomery tries his best.

377
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,199
MONTGOMERY:
But when you're near

378
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,619
The music in my soul

379
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:10,709
Would fade each time we part

380
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,796
STEWART: Bob Montgomery was only
one of many MGM contract players...

381
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,174
...forced to sing and dance.

382
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:21,720
In the frantic search for musical stars,
many would be called...

383
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,097
...but few would succeed.

384
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,101
Here's one of my favorites.
And I know you all like her too.

385
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,937
Because she's the personification
of youth...

386
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:34,107
...and beauty and joy and happiness,
Joan Crawford.

387
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,322
[SINGING] Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody

388
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,116
Much as I love you?
Huh, did you?

389
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,953
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody

390
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,288
How about me too, huh?

391
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,541
Oh, my
You're the one I crave

392
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,212
I could be your slave

393
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,339
Honey, let me rave

394
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,549
Got a feelin' for you

395
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,969
Crazy about your smile

396
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,971
Hey, an easy style

397
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,057
Got it all the time

398
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,809
Got a feelin' for you

399
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,145
Like your turned-up nose

400
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,397
Like your knees down low

401
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,149
From your head to toe

402
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,235
Got a feelin' for you

403
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,446
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody

404
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,531
Much as I love you?

405
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,451
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody

406
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,495
Could you love me too?

407
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,664
You're the one I crave

408
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,999
I could be your slave

409
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,419
Honey, let me say
Got a feelin' for you

410
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,924
What'll you ever be?
What'll you ever do?

411
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,343
How'll you ever know
If you don't take a chance?

412
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,054
STEWART:
Jean Harlow, the blonde bombshell...

413
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,807
...tried out her musical abilities in Reckless.

414
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:53,311
HARLOW:
I wanna live, love, learn a lot

415
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,691
I'll light my candle
And I'll burn a lot

416
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,860
You'll have some bad shots
Hard knocks

417
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,196
I'm on my own if I bruise

418
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,533
And there'll be smiles here
Shouts here

419
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,161
And I can take it on the chin if I lose
Because I'm reckless

420
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,706
Because she's reckless

421
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,873
Reckless

422
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,626
Because I'm reckless

423
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm gonna go places
And look life in the face

424
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,048
Hey.

425
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,634
[SINGING]
Did I remember

426
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,346
STEWART: Jean Harlow's musical talents
were somewhat limited...

427
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:32,058
...and the studio usually used
someone else's voice for her vocals.

428
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:36,896
But in a movie called Suzy, her costar,
Cary Grant, did his own singing.

429
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,857
And darn well too.

430
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,650
HARLOW: How do you know?
You didn't hear it.

431
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,820
I assure you I heard every word.
Let me convince you.

432
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,782
Sit down. Gentlemen, play it again.
You be the audience.

433
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,165
Did I remember to tell you
you're delightful?

434
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,169
You're everything I want you to be.

435
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:05,508
[SINGING] Your eyes look lovely
And far beyond comparing

436
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,346
Especially when they're glaring
At me

437
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,769
I can't think up words to say
How swell you are

438
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,646
But I can tell you are

439
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,275
I know so well you are

440
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,238
I started falling
The moment that I saw you

441
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,327
Believe me, I adore you
Chérie

442
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,499
[SINGING]
I'm sure you'll hate to hear

443
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,044
That I adore you, dear

444
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,798
But grant me just the same

445
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:51,346
I'm not entirely to blame

446
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,558
For you'd be

447
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,645
So easy to love

448
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,648
STEWART: I was lucky enough to sing
a Cole Porter song...

449
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,067
...in Born to Dance with Eleanor Powell.

450
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,488
At first, the studio planned to have
someone else record the vocal.

451
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,659
But the tune became such a big hit
that they decided to let me do it.

452
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,868
You see...

453
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:19,165
...they figured the song was so good
that even my singing couldn't hurt it.

454
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,627
[SINGING]
We'd be so grand

455
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,712
At the game

456
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,757
So carefree together

457
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,845
That it does seem a shame

458
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,973
That you can't see

459
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,061
Your future with me

460
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,190
'Cause you'd be, oh

461
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:51,156
So easy to love

462
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,785
I know that you'll join us in giving
a really rousing, rip-roaring reception...

463
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,663
...to Harry Van and Les Blondes. Mr. Van.

464
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,750
STEWART: Norma Shearer and Edward
Arnold looked on as Clark Gable...

465
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,545
...made his musical debut in Idiot's Delight.

466
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,631
GABLE: Hello, people, and thanks a lot
for that very lovely reception.

467
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,468
Thanks a million,
and I won't settle for a cent less.

468
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,053
In our modest act tonight,
we'll be ably assisted...

469
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,891
...by Professor Palova and his talented
team. Give them a hand, folks.

470
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,563
Okey-dokey, fellas. Take it away.

471
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,610
- This will be amusing, Achille.
- I hope so.

472
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,074
[SINGING] If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to

473
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,952
Why don't you go
Where Harlem sits?

474
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,954
Puttin' on the Ritz

475
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,708
Spangled gowns upon the bevy
Of highbrows

476
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,669
But down the levee
All misfits

477
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,421
Puttin' on the Ritz

478
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,717
That's where each and every
Lulu Belle goes

479
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,930
Every Thursday evening
With her swell beaus

480
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,097
Rubbing elbows

481
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,934
Come with me and we'll attend
The jubilee

482
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,853
And see them spend
Their last two bits

483
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,813
Puttin' on the Ritz

484
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,881
STEWART: Clark Gable surprised everyone
with his delightfully corny routine.

485
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,592
And yet, his fans were just outraged...

486
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,137
...to see him even try singing and dancing.

487
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,974
Their hero was above such nonsense.

488
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,686
But it was perfectly all right
for a youngster named Judy Garland...

489
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,438
...to dedicate a song to their idol.

490
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,275
GARLAND [SINGING]:
Dear Mr. Gable

491
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,736
I am writing this to you

492
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:58,658
And I hope that you will read it
So you'll know

493
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,787
My heart beats like a hammer

494
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,665
And I stutter and I stammer

495
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:11,004
Every time I see you
At the picture show

496
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:16,843
I guess I'm just another fan of yours

497
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:23,641
And I thought I'd write
And tell you so

498
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,358
You made me love you

499
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,823
I didn't wanna do it

500
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,454
You made me love you

501
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,873
And all the time you knew it

502
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,876
I guess you always knew it

503
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,713
You made me happy

504
00:43:54,381 --> 00:44:00,845
Sometimes you made me glad

505
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:07,143
But there were times, sir

506
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:12,565
You made me feel so sad

507
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:18,112
You made me sigh 'cause

508
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,493
I didn't wanna tell you

509
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,289
I think you're grand

510
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,957
That's true

511
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:35,046
Yes, I do, 'deed I do
You know I do

512
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:40,051
I don't care what happens
Let the whole world stop

513
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:45,431
As far as I'm concerned
You'll always be the top

514
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,393
'Cause you know

515
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,396
You made me

516
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:58,361
Love you

517
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,825
"Dear Mr. Gable"
was a milestone in its day.

518
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:08,621
It was the first time a studio permitted
a song to be dedicated to one of its stars.

519
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,082
And it was sung by a little girl...

520
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,961
...who would soon become
MGM's newest star.

521
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,215
And here's someone who can tell you
more about that remarkable talent.

522
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,094
He's a remarkable talent himself.
Mickey Rooney.

523
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,328
This is Carvel Street.

524
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,415
For anyone who's ever seen
an Andy Hardy movie...

525
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,543
...well, this is where
they were all shot, right here.

526
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,255
Over there, that was
Polly Benedict's home across the street.

527
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,841
And this was the home
of the Hardy family.

528
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,303
The picket fence is gone,
and the mailbox too...

529
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,306
...but it's still the Hardy home.

530
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,935
It might seem strange
that a person could spend over 20 years...

531
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,521
...growing up on the same movie set.

532
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,232
But in a way, that's what happened to me.

533
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,487
I was about 10 years old when I first came
to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer...

534
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,363
...and I was raring to go.

535
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,170
ROONEY:
The movie was Broadway to Hollywood.

536
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,923
And you guessed it, it was a musical.

537
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,467
[APPLAUSE]

538
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,891
Well, we... We all change a little
over the years, don't we?

539
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,604
You know, when you've been raised
at a studio, the way I was...

540
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,399
...you learn a certain ability
that time can't seem to erase.

541
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,694
You learn to recognize real talent.

542
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,905
You see so many people
come and go...

543
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,366
...that when an exceptional talent
comes along...

544
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,244
...it seems to stick out like a sore thumb.

545
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,747
I was a seasoned veteran of 17
when I first had the opportunity...

546
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,251
...of working with the great
and wonderful Judy Garland.

547
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,587
I knew when I saw her
standing before the camera...

548
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,381
...that she had that certain magic.

549
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,050
Her talent seemed to jump
right off the screen at you.

550
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,177
GARLAND [SINGING]:
Do re mi fa so la ti do

551
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,764
ROONEY: Judy and I became close friends
when we did a series of films together...

552
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,560
...that the studio called
"backyard musicals."

553
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,020
Audiences seemed to love the pictures...

554
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,481
...even though the plots
were suspiciously alike.

555
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,359
Only our names seemed to change.

556
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,027
How do you do?

557
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,281
Good morning. I'm Betsy Booth.

558
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,700
- I sing, you know.
- I know, I heard you.

559
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,326
You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?

560
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,954
This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.

561
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,706
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.

562
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,125
Danny, this is my grandchild,
Ms. Ginger Gray.

563
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,628
- Yes, we've met.
- This is my cousin, Ms. Polly Williams.

564
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,089
Mr. Daniel Churchill, a junior.

565
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,134
Ms. Barton, this is Ms. Essex,
the once famous "Baby Rosalie."

566
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,636
How do you do? This is Mickey Moran.

567
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,971
How do you do?

568
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,515
My name's Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?

569
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,851
- I don't think I like you.
- Thank you.

570
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,102
You're welcome.

571
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,648
- I want success.
- And you'll have it.

572
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,903
I know you will, Mickey. Just think
when our names are up in electric lights.

573
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,406
You the big composer and producer,
and me the singing star.

574
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,117
We could have our own great
modern dance orchestra.

575
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,953
We've got everything we need here.
We've got the brass...

576
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,580
...the piano and the reeds.

577
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,334
We can make our own arrangements,
specialties and play for all the dances.

578
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,961
We've gotta have a great show
with a million laughs.

579
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,422
And color, a lot of lights to make it sparkle.

580
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,342
And songs, wonderful songs
with you out there selling them.

581
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,509
It'll be wonderful.

582
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,638
Say, that's not a bad idea.

583
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,515
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.

584
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,101
Why, it looks as if you'll need
a whole city block.

585
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,354
Yeah. Sure, that's it.

586
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,148
Right in the neighborhood,
and everybody'll come to it.

587
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,859
A Western rodeo, once a year
we'll bring back the West.

588
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,903
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James, Buffalo Bill.

589
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,988
- A hundred beautiful girls.
- On horseback.

590
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,240
- Glorious costumes, happy, carefree.
- Gay!

591
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,910
I'm gonna write a show for us
right here in Seaport.

592
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,205
It'd be the most up-to-date thing
these hicks around here have seen.

593
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,707
Opening night, we'll have
Max Gordon and Sam Harris...

594
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,543
...down to give us the once-over.
How about it, kids?

595
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,964
- They call us babes in arms
- We never dance

596
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,384
- They think they must direct us
- But no chance

597
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,804
- But if we're babes in arms
- High romance

598
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,349
- We'll make them all respect us
- Why, oh, why

599
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,185
Why have we got our arms

600
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,897
What have we got our sight for?

601
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,858
Play day is done
We've a place in the sun

602
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,654
We must fight for

603
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,161
ROONEY: When our movies took off
at the box office...

604
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,831
...we found our budgets taking off too.

605
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,751
So they moved Judy and I
out of the backyard and into the barn...

606
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,503
...then to the high school gym...

607
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,924
...and later to a Broadway stage
that would never have fit in a real theater.

608
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,593
Where we got all that energy,
I'll never know.

609
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,264
But a lot of it was inspired
by our director, a genius...

610
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,849
...Busby Berkeley.

611
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,728
ALL [SINGING]: Small town
Living in a small town

612
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:28,524
When you're in a small town
You gotta make friends

613
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:34,113
- One, two, three
- One, two, three

614
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,763
Watch them shuffling along

615
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,599
See them shuffling along

616
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:05,186
Go take your best gal
Your real pal

617
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,439
Go down on the levee
I said to the levee

618
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,817
And we'll join that shuffling throng

619
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,695
Hear that music and song

620
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,739
It's simply great, mate

621
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,449
Waitin' on the levee

622
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,328
Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee

623
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,958
We're babes on Broadway

624
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,876
We're goin' places

625
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,255
When our new faces appear

626
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:18,259
It's a wonderful street
For babes like us to be on

627
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,054
We're here because
We want our names in neon

628
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,016
We left Topeka
We left Eureka

629
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,311
And came to seek a career

630
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,274
Oh, we're milkin' applause
Instead of milkin' a cow

631
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:39,446
'Cause we're babes on Broadway now

632
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,104
With our flag unfurled

633
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:16,525
We can face the world

634
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,611
Hey, leader

635
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:23,282
Strike up the band

636
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,141
ROONEY: There's another fellow
who worked on this lot with Judy...

637
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,310
...and some of MGM's best musicals...

638
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,897
...are a direct result
of his considerable talents.

639
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,815
Gene Kelly.

640
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,320
This is MGM's New York street.

641
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,781
And for as long as I can remember...

642
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:07,660
...this has been the busiest standing set
on the whole backlot.

643
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,453
Any actor or actress...

644
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:13,165
...who made more than one or two films
at this studio...

645
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,586
...sooner or later probably would find
himself shooting a sequence here.

646
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,923
Which reminds me,
if you're a song-and-dance man...

647
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,676
...and you've spent some time
in pictures...

648
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,470
...inevitably, some interviewer will ask:

649
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,139
"Who was your favorite dancing partner?

650
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:33,519
Was it Rita Hayworth, or Vera-Ellen,
or Leslie Caron?"

651
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,439
But if you're smart,
you'll never give them a straight answer.

652
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,110
I'm gonna break that rule right now.

653
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,070
It may not be gallant...

654
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:47,658
...but I'd like to show you
the greatest partner I've ever danced with.

655
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,671
KELLY: When you dance with Fred Astaire,
you really have to be on your toes.

656
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,465
This number from Ziegfeld Follies...

657
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,385
...was the only time we've had a chance
to work together.

658
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,055
But I'd change my name to Ginger
if we could do it again.

659
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,807
KELLY:
Fred Astaire has been the tops...

660
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,476
...in every field of show business
he ever entered.

661
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,729
And the motion-picture musical
owes him a great deal.

662
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:45,109
ASTAIRE [SINGING]:
The way you wear your hat

663
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,155
The way you sip your tea

664
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:55,869
The memory of all that

665
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:02,292
No, no
They can't take that away from me

666
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,505
The way your smile just beams

667
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,468
The way you sing off-key

668
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:17,224
The way you haunt my dreams

669
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:23,313
No, no
They can't take that away from me

670
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,152
KELLY: When he starred in a series
of musicals with Ginger Rogers...

671
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,946
...they quickly became
the most popular dance team...

672
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,031
...in the history of motion pictures.

673
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,576
But for Fred, as an individual...

674
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,287
...it was only the beginning
of a screen career...

675
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,874
...that would delight
several generations of moviegoers.

676
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,947
ASTAIRE [SINGING]:
Stand up and sing

677
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,283
We've got the gang together

678
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,410
We always sang together

679
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,579
Stand up and sing

680
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,415
KELLY: Over the years,
Fred Astaire's trademark would become...

681
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,917
...the top hat and tails.

682
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,045
He wore the outfit
in his very first film appearance...

683
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,547
...Dancing Lady with Joan Crawford.

684
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,914
BOTH [SINGING]:
I guess I'll have to change my plan

685
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,794
I should have realized
There'd be another man

686
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,297
KELLY: Jack Buchanan,
the debonair British musical star...

687
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,341
...joined Fred in The Band Wagon.

688
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,512
BOTH [SINGING]:
Until the big affair began

689
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,933
Before I knew where I was at

690
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,854
I found myself upon the shelf
And that was that

691
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,650
I tried to reach the moon

692
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,278
But when I got there

693
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,073
All that I could get was the air

694
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,994
My feet are back upon the ground

695
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:48,333
I've lost the one girl I'd found

696
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:54,673
KELLY: But besides elegance,
there's a lot more to the Astaire style.

697
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,218
Fred was constantly striving
for perfection.

698
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,554
Rehearsing hour sfter hour...

699
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,931
...searching for a new step
or a new device...

700
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,643
...that would bring something fresh
to each of his numbers.

701
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,405
KELLY:
Because of his ingenuity and precision...

702
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,366
...audiences never realized
how much incredible effort...

703
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,201
...Fred poured into his work.

704
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,704
He made it all appear so easy.

705
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,249
In Royal Wedding,
Fred danced with a hat rack.

706
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,711
And as usual,
he made his partner look good.

707
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,420
KELLY:
In The Barkleys of Broadway...

708
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,006
...Fred and choreographer Hermes Pan...

709
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,927
...conceived the brilliant
"Shoes With Wings On" number.

710
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,514
KELLY:
Fred and director Stanley Donen...

711
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,017
...collaborated on this mind-boggling routine
from Royal Wedding.

712
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,896
Movie buffs are still arguing
about how it was done.

713
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,526
KELLY: The gimmicks Fred used
were exciting and fun.

714
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,903
But his talents were so extraordinary...

715
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,906
...that he could easily get along
without them.

716
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,367
This is the Astaire I love to watch.

717
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,328
With a lovely partner like Cyd Charisse...

718
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,163
...a simple settiing...

719
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,917
...a marvelous song by Howard Dietz
and Arthur Schwartz...

720
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,586
...these are the only ingredients
Fred would need...

721
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,713
...to create a classic moment.

722
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,800
"Dancing in the Dark"
from The Band Wagon.

723
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:46,358
Fred Astaire was and is a unique talent.

724
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,693
There'll never be another like him...

725
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,571
...and that's what I love
about our profession.

726
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,324
Because every so often
an artist comes along...

727
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,993
...who's impossible to compare
with anyone else.

728
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,538
KELLY: Here's another
of my favorite dancing partners...

729
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,040
...Donald O'Connor.

730
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,294
MGM seemed to acquire talent
the way you and I pick up paper clips...

731
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,088
...by the handful.

732
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,673
When I was at the studio...

733
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,052
...we were up to our ears in tenors,
baritones, tap dancers, pianists...

734
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,096
...and they were all good.

735
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,723
But this set belonged pretty much
to one star...

736
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,558
...and one star alone.

737
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,311
I only wish we'd had a chance
to work together.

738
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,816
Well, she was not only a lovely actress,
with a beautiful face and figure...

739
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,528
...but she could also sing and dance,
and even handle comedy.

740
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:37,075
And if that wasn't enough,
she was dynamite in the water.

741
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,453
Of course I'm talking about
Ms. Esther Williams.

742
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,998
O'CONNOR:
A champion swimmer...

743
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,626
...Esther was working as a model
in a Los Angeles department store...

744
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:49,421
...when MGM talent scouts
discovered her.

745
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,303
The studio built a special swimming pool
for her on the backlot...

746
01:06:57,471 --> 01:07:00,432
...and starred her in a film called
Bathing Beauty.

747
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,267
The rest is history.

748
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:10,692
O'CONNOR: MGM featured Esther
in a series of spectacular productions.

749
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,485
During her career, she swam...

750
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,947
...opposite some of MGM's
most popular leading men.

751
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,700
Some of them even got their hair wet.

752
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,036
Like Howard Keel...

753
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,126
...Fernando Lamas,
whom she would later marry...

754
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,880
...Van Johnson...

755
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,633
...Peter Lawford...

756
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,805
...Ricardo Montalban...

757
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,311
...even Tom and Jerry.

758
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,486
Jimmy Durante...

759
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,865
...and Red Skelton.

760
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,049
As her fame grew...

761
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,843
...so did the size and population
of her swimming pools.

762
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:22,722
Esther no longer could simply climb up
a diving board and jump in.

763
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,850
Now, she had to be presented
like Venus...

764
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,560
...rising from the sea.

765
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,611
In the ranks of great musical stars,
there have been singers, dancers...

766
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,030
...musicians, even ice skaters.

767
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,034
But MGM saw to it
there was only one Esther Williams.

768
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,729
[LAUGHS]

769
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,773
Eat your heart out, Mark Spitz.

770
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,985
People say that performers
are overly affectionate with one another.

771
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:47,612
And that may be true.

772
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,114
I don't have to apologize
for the way I feel...

773
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,742
...about a young lady
that I worked with here at MGM.

774
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,369
I love her.

775
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,746
And she's as big a hit

REYNOLDS:
When I first reported at the studio...

803
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,837
...MGM was celebrating
its 25th anniversary.

804
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,549
They had converted the biggest
sound stage on the lot into a restaurant.

805
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:36,429
They only served one meal, but it was
a lunch that old-timers still talk about.

806
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:42,101
The studio used to boast that it had
more stars than there are in the heavens.

807
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:44,395
And that day, they weren't kidding.

808
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:53,321
The first time I met the king,
Clark Gable...

809
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,491
...he looked down at me and said,
"Hello, beautiful."

810
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,242
And I nearly fainted.

811
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:02,747
This place was the land of giants,
and I was a small fry.

812
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,875
But like any other young hopeful,
I was determined...

813
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:08,586
...that somehow and someday
I'd measure up.

814
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,922
In the early 1950s...

815
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,925
...MGM was entering
a new era of motion pictures...

816
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,468
...with more star power...

817

820
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,346
When I feel that I might fall

821
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,141

In The Pirate with the Nicholas Brothers...

kind of acrobatic dancing...

he became one of the most versatile...

01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:33,039
She spent the next few years
in low-budget musicals.

1091
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,958
Once in a while, she'd appear
as a sort of novelty act...

1092
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:39,670
...in a big extravaganza like
the Broadway Melody of 1938...

1093
01:43:39,838 --> 01:43:41,297
...with Buddy Ebsen.

1094
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,722
Mama once told me...

1095
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,808
...MGM seemed obsessed
with Shirley Temple.

1096
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:56,812
They even offered 20th Century Fox
Jean Harlow and Clark Gable...

1097
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:00,524
...just to get Temple for a certain picture
Metro was preparing.

1098
01:44:00,692 --> 01:44:02,276
But the deal fell through.

1099
01:44:02,444 --> 01:44:05,613
So MGM finally went ahead
with the picture...

1100
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:09,283
...and let Mama play the role of Dorothy
in The Wizard of Oz.

1101
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,746
ALL [SINGING]: You're off to see the wizard
The wonderful wizard of Oz

1102
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:17,166
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

1103
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:20,795
If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was
The wizard of Oz is one because

1104
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:24,298
Because, because, because
Because, because

1105
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:26,926
Because of the wonderful things he does

1106
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:31,597
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandelion

1107
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:33,975
A fate I don't deserve

1108
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:37,561
I'd be brave as a blizzard

1109
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:39,355
I'd be gentle as a lizard

1110
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,524
I'd be clever as a gizzard

1111
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:46,362
If the Wizard is a Wizard
Who will serve

1112
01:44:46,863 --> 01:44:48,906
Then I'm sure to get a brain

1113
01:44:49,074 --> 01:44:51,075
- A heart
- A home

1114
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,368
The nerve

1115
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:56,914
MINNELLl:
The Wizard of Oz finally did it for Mama.

1116
01:44:57,082 --> 01:45:00,042
With Ray Bolger, Jack Haley,
and Bert Lahr...

1117
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:03,004
...she really started off
on the road to success.

1118
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:06,048
Whatever rocks or bumps
there were in that road...

1119
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,259
...she never let it show in her films.

1120
01:45:08,427 --> 01:45:12,054
For Mama, it was straight up all the way.

1121
01:45:12,514 --> 01:45:17,852
Somewhere over the rainbow

1122
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:22,356
Way up high

1123
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:28,738
There's a land that I heard of

1124
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:32,283
Once in a lullaby

1125
01:45:34,619 --> 01:45:39,582
Somewhere over the rainbow

1126
01:45:40,709 --> 01:45:44,211
Skies are blue

1127
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:51,093
And the dreams that you dare to dream

1128
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:55,765
Really do come true

1129
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,311
Someday I'll wish upon a star

1130
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:02,855
And wake up where the clouds are far

1131
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:06,359
Behind me

1132
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,489
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

1133
01:46:11,656 --> 01:46:14,325
Away above the chimney tops

1134
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:20,456
That's where you'll find me

1135
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:29,298
They're writing songs of love

1136
01:46:30,008 --> 01:46:33,594
But not for me

1137
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:38,474
A lucky star's above

1138
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,602
But not for me

1139
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:47,233
With love to lead the way

1140
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:51,987
I've found more skies of gray

1141
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:57,201
Than any Russian play

1142
01:46:57,369 --> 01:47:00,579
Could guarantee

1143
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:03,958
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley

1144
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:06,919
Ding, ding, ding went the bell

1145
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,131
Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings

1146
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:13,008
From the moment I saw him, I fell

1147
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:18,806
Chug, chug, chug went the motor

1148
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:22,101
Bump, bump, bump went the brake

1149
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:25,271
Thump, thump, thump
Went my heartstrings

1150
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,357
When he smiled
I could feel the car shake

1151
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:33,028
He tipped his hat and took a seat

1152
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:36,657
He said he hoped
He hadn't stepped upon my feet

1153
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:40,035
He asked my name, I held my breath

1154
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:42,955
I couldn't speak
Because he scared me half to death

1155
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:44,123
Howdy Doody!

1156
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,168
Chug, chug, chug went the motor

1157
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,588
Flop, flop, flop went the wheels

1158
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:53,674
Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings

1159
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:57,052
As he started to go
Then I started to know

1160
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,430
How it feels

1161
01:47:59,598 --> 01:48:03,309
When the universe reels

1162
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:10,566
If you like-a me, like I like-a you

1163
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:14,236
And we like-a both the same

1164
01:48:14,779 --> 01:48:17,990
I like-a say this very day

1165
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:21,202
I like-a change your name

1166
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:25,206
'Cause I love-a you and love-a you true

1167
01:48:25,373 --> 01:48:28,751
And if you-a love-a me

1168
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:32,588
One live as two, two live as one

1169
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,007
Under the bamboo tree

1170
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:39,094
How can I ignore

1171
01:48:39,262 --> 01:48:42,348
The boy next door

1172
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:48,437
I love him more than I can say

1173
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,775
Doesn't try to please me

1174
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:56,445
Doesn't even tease me

1175
01:48:56,947 --> 01:49:00,115
And he never sees me

1176
01:49:00,283 --> 01:49:03,786
Glance his way

1177
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:11,544
MINNELLl: Summer Stock
was Mama's final film for MGM.

1178
01:49:12,003 --> 01:49:14,922
Her last days of shooting here
were devoted to this number...

1179
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,801
...which a lot of people including myself
feel was one of her very best.

1180
01:49:21,471 --> 01:49:24,139
GARLAND [SINGING]: Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

1181
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:26,809
You better chase all your cares away

1182
01:49:27,143 --> 01:49:29,812
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1183
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:32,481
Get ready for the judgment day

1184
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:35,484
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy

1185
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:38,153
The Lord is waiting to take your hand

1186
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:41,073
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1187
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:43,867
We're going to the promised land

1188
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:46,870
We're heading across the river

1189
01:49:47,038 --> 01:49:49,790
Wash your sins away in the tide

1190
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:54,628
It's all so peaceful on the other side

1191
01:49:55,338 --> 01:49:57,965
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

1192
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:00,718
You better chase all your cares away

1193
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,679
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1194
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:06,015
Get ready for the judgment day

1195
01:50:06,182 --> 01:50:09,476
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

1196
01:50:10,186 --> 01:50:11,812
Chase your cares away

1197
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:15,232
Hallelujah
Get happy

1198
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,818
Before the judgment day

1199
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:20,487
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy

1200
01:50:20,655 --> 01:50:22,906
The Lord is waiting to take your hand

1201
01:50:23,074 --> 01:50:26,327
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1202
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:29,038
We're going to be going
to the promised land

1203
01:50:29,205 --> 01:50:31,707
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1204
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:34,126
You better chase all your cares away

1205
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:37,379
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1206
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:44,637
Get ready

1207
01:50:45,347 --> 01:50:49,016
For the judgment day

1208
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,438
[APPLAUSE]

1209
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:02,821
Thank God for film.

1210
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:06,617
It can capture a performance
and hold it right there forever.

1211
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:10,454
And if anyone says to you,
"Who was he?" or "Who was she?"

1212
01:51:10,705 --> 01:51:12,456
Or "What made them so good?"

1213
01:51:12,957 --> 01:51:17,211
I think a piece of film answers that
question better than any words I know of.

1214
01:51:17,587 --> 01:51:20,798
My generation...
Well, we're just beginning.

1215
01:51:21,424 --> 01:51:25,219
It takes a lot of film
and a lot of experience...

1216
01:51:25,887 --> 01:51:28,472
...and a lot of talent
to become a real star.

1217
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:33,102
Now here's somebody who I think
qualifies on all of those counts. Oh, boy.

1218
01:51:33,269 --> 01:51:34,645
Mr. Bing Crosby.

1219
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:39,566
You know, one sound stage,
well, it looks pretty much like another.

1220
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,820
But a backlot, out here
where they shoot the exteriors...

1221
01:51:42,987 --> 01:51:46,949
...that seems to me that the backlot
reflects the personality...

1222
01:51:47,242 --> 01:51:48,784
...the character of its studio.

1223
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:50,160
This was the biggest...

1224
01:51:50,328 --> 01:51:53,664
...and I think, perhaps,
the best backlot in all of Hollywood.

1225
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:58,252
Of course the old backlot looks
a little shabby right now, sort of scruffy...

1226
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:00,671
...kind of an illusion on an illusion...

1227
01:52:00,839 --> 01:52:03,632
...but that's because
most Hollywood filmmakers...

1228
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,592
...they don't use backlots any more.

1229
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,428
They prefer the real thing.

1230
01:52:07,595 --> 01:52:08,846
ALL [SINGING]:
Hollywood

1231
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:12,015
Hollywood

1232
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:17,271
CROSBY: I remember when I did
my first musical at this studio...

1233
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:19,815
...they designed
a big production number.

1234
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:23,944
It was all to take place
in a vast Manhattan railroad terminal.

1235
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:27,322
Of course we didn't bother
to go to New York City.

1236
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:30,075
MGM simply recreated
Grand Central Station...

1237
01:52:30,243 --> 01:52:33,746
...added a couple of thousand extras
and filmed the whole number right here.

1238
01:52:33,913 --> 01:52:35,330
ALL [SINGING]:
Once again

1239
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:38,167
Goodbye, pal

1240
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:43,422
Out where they say
Let us be gay

1241
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:46,341
I'm going Hollywood

1242
01:52:48,052 --> 01:52:51,388
I'll ballyhoo greetings to you

1243
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:54,516
I'm going Hollywood

1244
01:52:55,602 --> 01:53:00,189
Say, while you sleepyheads

Well, it was vigorous. Spirited, anyhow.

1252
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:22,169
I was, what you might call,
a casual participant in MGM musicals...

1253
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:24,171
...because over 20 years went by...

1254

...between the little effort
which you've just seen...

...and my next attempt.

1256
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:31,011
And I found fantastic changes
had occurred.

1257
01:53:31,179 --> 01:53:34,723
They had color, oh, stereophonic sound,
even wide screens.

1258
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:38,977
And MGM, in a loose moment,
had decided to give me another chance...

1259
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:42,189
...in a little pastiche
to be called High Society.

1260
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:45,734
This starred Grace Kelly, Louis Armstrong,
and Celeste Holm...

01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,861
...and was directed by Chuck Walters.

Oh, yes, there was another
featured performer in there.

What was his name?
A brash young newcomer. Frank, uh...

01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:56,912
A clever kid.
He had a lot to offer too. Frank, uh...
