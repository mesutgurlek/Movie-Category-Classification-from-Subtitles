1
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,759
Tanya, Fievel...

2
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:23,359
will you stop that
twirling, twirling?

3
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,961
That's it.
I mean it.

4
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,132
But, Mama,
it's Hannukah!

5
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,143
For you, every night
is Hannukah.

6
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,644
Papa,
enough already.

7
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,010
They'll never
get to sleep.

8
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,675
All right.
All right.

9
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,047
Presents.

10
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,847
What about presents?

11
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,979
Presents?
What presents?

12
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,024
Oh, Papa.

13
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,395
Just a joke.

14
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,897
For Tanya,
a new babushka.

15
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,831
Happy Hannukah.

16
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,562
Oh, Papa.

17
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,069
Thank you.

18
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,230
You have
only one parent?

19
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,830
Thank you, Mama.

20
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,344
And for you, Fievel,

21
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,878
a new hat.

22
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,746
A hat that has
been in the family...

23
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,785
for three generations.

24
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,376
It belonged to me,

25
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,252
my father,
and my father's father,

26
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,258
and now
it belongs to you.

27
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,692
Happy Hannukah.

28
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,731
It's too big.

29
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,061
You'll grow.

30
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,068
Ah, did I ever tell you...

31
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:35,267
about the giant
mouse of Minsk?

32
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,399
No.

33
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,738
No.

34
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,404
Like the mouse
with long hair...

35
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,244
that the prince
climbed up?

36
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,752
No. This mouse,
the mouse of Minsk,

37
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,253
was tall as a tree.

38
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,985
His tail was
a mile long.

39
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,083
Really?

40
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,286
Really.

41
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,261
He was so big,

42
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,730
he frightened
all the cats.

43
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,767
Don't say that word.

44
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,768
Talk about
something else.

45
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,768
America.

46
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,270
Another fairy tale.

47
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,931
America.

48
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,804
What a place.

49
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,173
What a place.

50
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,078
In America, there are
mouseholes in every wall.

51
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,342
Who says?

52
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,508
Everyone!

53
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,518
Bread crumbs
on every floor!

54
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,019
You're talking
nonsense.

55
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,023
In America,
you can say anything.

56
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,649
But most important,

57
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,694
and this I know,

58
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,197
in America,
there are no cats.

59
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,233
Shh. They'll
hear you.

60
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,030
How could they hear us?

61
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,536
There, you see?

62
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,832
Waa!

63
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,670
The cossacks!

64
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,903
The cossacks!

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,083
Don't cry, Yasha.

66
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,915
I'll scare them away.

67
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,887
Fievel, you'll get hurt!

68
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,983
Go away!

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,763
Go away, cats!

70
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,264
Go away!

71
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,265
Grrr!

72
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,323
Aah!

73
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,846
Whoa!

74
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,185
Whoa!

75
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,851
Aah!

76
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,448
Fievel, angel,
are you all right?

77
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,643
Yes, Mama.

78
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,448
Then never
do that again!

79
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,621
Mama, look.

80
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,730
In America...

81
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,463
there are no cats.

82
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,370
Look, Papa, water.

83
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,535
Is it the ocean?

84
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,636
Yes. Keep walking.

85
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,713
Look, Papa, smoke.

86
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,156
Is the boat on fire?

87
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,955
No. Keep walking.

88
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,904
Look, Papa, birds!

89
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,735
Are they sea gulls?

90
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,707
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

91
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,038
Keep walking.

92
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,544
Keep walking!

93
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,245
I just wanted to see.

94
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:16,254
This is the last time
I take you to America.

95
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,482
Bye-bye!

96
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,761
Auf wiedersehen.

97
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,228
Auf wiedersehen.

98
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,425
Auf wiedersehen.

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,435
I got a cousin
in America.

100
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,494
You and everybody else.

101
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,183
Are we there yet?

102
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,627
Not yet. Soon.

103
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,528
How soon?

104
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,691
Soon.

105
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,929
Maybe we should have
stayed in Russia.

106
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,971
We'll be all right.

107
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,472
As long as
we're together,

108
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,338
we'll be all right.

109
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,166
Ahh, so, Mr. Curious,

110
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,361
you've discovered
the herring.

111
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,334
Herring?

112
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,702
I thought
they were fish.

113
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,172
But, Fievel,

114
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,505
Herring are fish.

115
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,839
Really?

116
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:50,814
Certainly. In the ocean,
there are all kinds of fish.

117
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,214
All kinds?

118
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:56,414
Yes. Tiny fishes,
not so tiny fishes,

119
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,515
fishes as big
as this boat.

120
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,355
Wow!

121
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,863
Let's go up
and see the fish!

122
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,524
Not now.
Your mama's worried.

123
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,925
Come back, Fievel.

124
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,099
Wait!

125
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:20,545
What am I going
to do with you?

126
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,012
Mama!

127
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,778
Ah, so we return,
hmm?

128
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,046
We saw some fish.

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,212
Fish?

130
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,348
Lucky you didn't
see some cats.

131
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,357
Cats!

132
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,358
<i>Gato!</i>

133
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,359
<i>Katzen!</i>

134
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,452
Cats!

135
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,020
I didn't see any cats.

136
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,227
Whew.

137
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,235
Won't it be nice
to get to America...

138
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,238
where we don't
have to worry.

139
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,241
There are no cats
in America,

140
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,176
but back home
in Mother Russia...

141
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,304
ohh...

142
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,576
# Our family
was traveling #

143
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,811
#Through the snow
to Minsk #

144
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,251
# Suddenly Papa #

145
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,414
# Saw those
huge paw prints #

146
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,458
#When I heard him
screaming #

147
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,993
# I fainted dead away #

148
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,723
#And I woke up
an orphan #

149
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,662
<i># Oy vey #</i>

150
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,260
But...

151
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,495
But...
<i>But...</i>

152
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,698
# But there are no cats
in America #

153
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,833
#And the streets
are paved with cheese #

154
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,345
#There are no cats
in America #

155
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,281
# So set your mind
at ease #

156
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,946
<i>Ma la cosa terribile</i>
<i>que esiste in la patria mia.</i>

157
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,889
If you think things
were bad in Russia,

158
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,087
you should see things
in my country.

159
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,925
#The times were hard
in Sicily #

160
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,828
#We had no provolone #

161
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,799
#The Don, he was a tabby #

162
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,768
#With a taste
for my brother Tony #

163
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,804
#When Mama went
to plead for him #

164
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,102
#The Don said
he would see her #

165
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,972
#We found her rosary
on the ground #

166
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,308
Poor Mama mia.

167
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,842
But...

168
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,512
# But there are no cats
in America #

169
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,818
#And the streets
are paved with cheese #

170
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,349
#There are no cats
in America #

171
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,658
# So set your
mind at ease #

172
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,332
Sure, that's sad,

173
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,697
but sadder still...

174
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,896
#When I was but a lad #

175
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,270
# I lost
my true love fair #

176
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,831
#A calico #

177
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,313
# He caught us
by surprise #

178
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,441
# In a flash
of teeth and fur #

179
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:43,614
# Her tail was all
he left of her #

180
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,816
# 'Neath the heather #

181
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:56,859
# Is where it
tirra-lirra lies #

182
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,870
But...

183
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,135
# But there are no cats
in America #

184
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,666
#And the streets
are paved with cheese #

185
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,975
#There are no cats
in America #

186
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,949
#There are no cats
in America #

187
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,453
#There are no cats
in America #

188
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,584
#There are no cats
in America #

189
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,253
#That's why #

190
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,854
#We sail #

191
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,459
#These seas ##

192
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,224
Hey, fellas,
want a bite?

193
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,277
Oh, it's the end
of the world.

194
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,244
No, it's worse.

195
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,308
Aah!

196
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,181
Hmm.

197
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,845
Aah!

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,102
Fievel.

199
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,003
Fievel,
come, sit here.

200
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,871
Yes, Papa.

201
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,535
Fievel.

202
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,545
Fish!

203
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,708
Fievel!

204
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,944
Fievel!

205
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,216
Fievel!

206
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,053
I'm getting
my hat, Papa.

207
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,226
Fievel!

208
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,595
Fievel, come back.

209
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,463
My hat!

210
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,594
Wait!

211
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,705
Fievel, stop!

212
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,975
Stop!

213
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,643
Papa!

214
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,984
Fievel!

215
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,920
Don't move!

216
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,426
Papa!

217
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,122
Grab my hand!

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,493
Help!

219
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,498
Grab my hand!

220
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,596
Fievel!

221
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,829
Aah!

222
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,006
Aah!

223
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,627
Aah!

224
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,129
Fievel, come back!

225
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,187
Aah!

226
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,998
Papa, help!

227
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,410
Aah!

228
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,617
Fievel!

229
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,450
Fievel!

230
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,029
Fievel!

231
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,967
Papa!

232
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,027
America.

233
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,533
No, no. New York.

234
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,033
Name?

235
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,538
Smovolodnydhromovichsky.

236
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,098
Ok, Mr... Smith.

237
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,375
Family, Mousekewitz.

238
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,880
How many?

239
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:10,937
Five...

240
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,712
I mean four.

241
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,275
Ok. Next.

242
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:21,616
Papa, why did they
change my name to Tilly?

243
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,597
# Give me your tired #

244
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,405
#Your poor #

245
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,379
#Your huddled masses #

246
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,749
#Yearning to breathe free #

247
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:57,421
#The wretched refuse
of your teeming shore #

248
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:05,699
# Send these,
the homeless #

249
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:11,732
#Tempest-tossed, to me #

250
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:21,276
# I lift my lamp
beside the golden door ##

251
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,795
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>

252
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,296
Ah-choo!

253
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,629
Ah! A little immigrant.

254
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,898
Now they are
coming by bottle.

255
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,138
Uh, where is
your papa...

256
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,177
your mama, eh?

257
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,737
They were on
the boat to America.

258
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,581
Then you are in luck,
my little immigrant.

259
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,210
This is America!

260
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,654
America.

261
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,157
I thought
it was bigger.

262
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,159
Oh, it is bigger.

263
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,822
All of that
is also America.

264
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,387
Wow!

265
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:11,402
This is just an island
at the doorway...

266
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,836
where I,
Henri Le Pigeon,

267
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,397
am putting up
my Statue of Liberty.

268
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,238
Ah, that's better.

269
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,687
I know,
my little immigrant,

270
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,690
you want to find
your family,

271
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,225
and you will.

272
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,726
But how?

273
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,696
It's so far away,
and it's so big!

274
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,199
I'll never
find them anyway.

275
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,201
<i>Je m'excuse, pardon...</i>

276
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,203
but did you say...

277
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,704
never?

278
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,209
So young,
and you have lost hope.

279
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,210
Ah, this is America,

280
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,906
the place to find hope!

281
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,744
If you give up,

282
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,580
you will never
find your family.

283
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,210
So, never...

284
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,345
say...

285
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,411
never.

286
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,478
Say...

287
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,422
# Never say never #

288
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,858
#Whatever you do #

289
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,226
# Never say never,
my friend #

290
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,229
Henri...

291
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,560
<i>Ah, tais-toi!</i>

292
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,330
# If you believe that
your dreams will come true #

293
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,837
#They'll come true
in the end #

294
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,838
But...

295
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,874
Ah ah ah!

296
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,670
# Keep up your courage #

297
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,177
# Don't ever despair #

298
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:31,614
#Take heart
and then count to 10 #

299
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,674
# Hope for the best #

300
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,583
#Work for the rest #

301
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,748
#And never
say never again #

302
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,257
But it's impossible!

303
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,759
I'll never
find my family.

304
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,286
Never say never.
Don't say that.

305
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,424
# Never say never #

306
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,967
#Whatever you do #

307
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,002
Again.

308
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,764
# Never say never #

309
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,770
#To me #

310
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,329
See how easy?

311
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,776
# If you believe
you can come
shining through #

312
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,780
That's how
it's going to be.

313
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,872
Perfect!

314
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,940
# Now don't you
go and give up #

315
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,746
# Give out or give in #

316
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,083
#When the going's rough,
just get tough #

317
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,352
#And just tell yourself
you're gonna win #

318
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,589
# Remember to look on
the bright side till then #

319
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,721
#And never #

320
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,164
# Say never #

321
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,633
#Again #

322
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:28,139
Now are you ready
to go find your family?

323
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,298
Yes!

324
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,466
Chantal!

325
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,976
Take my friend
to immigration.

326
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,979
You will find
your family there.

327
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,981
Everyone goes
through immigration.

328
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,483
I would take you myself,

329
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,578
but I'd never
finish my statue.

330
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,748
Henri, you said never!

331
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,520
Oh, so I did!

332
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,083
# Never #

333
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,892
# Say never #

334
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,329
# Never #

335
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,765
# Say never #

336
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,632
# Never #

337
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:03,333
# Say never #

338
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,841
#Again ##

339
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,343
Au revoir!

340
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,844
<i>Bonne chance!</i>

341
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,403
Good luck!

342
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,080
Good-bye!

343

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,704
Yeah. We should
all get together.

510
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,216
This is America.
We have free speech.

511
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,718
You can say "cat."

512
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,721
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!

513
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,723
Shh! Not so loud.

514
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,315
Not that word.

515
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,883
Wait a minute.

516
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,953
Come back.
Where are you going?

517
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,956
Ahh...

518
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,073
s-s-so...

519
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,577
if we all got together,

520
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,910
we could do something
about the...

521
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,244
cats.

522
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,750
Yeah.

523
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,251
C...

524
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,651
Ca...

525
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,313
Cat.

526
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,357
Hhe-whe-nuh...

527
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:32,985
Tony?

528
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,489
Tony, what's
wrong with you?

529
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,774
She's talking
about <i>C- A-T-S.</i>

530
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:54,284
But there are
no cats in America.

531
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,843
I'm getting
out of here!

532
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,185
What are you
afraid of?

533
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,690
Cats, cats, cats.

534
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,625
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.

535
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,185
There are no cats.

536
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,169
Hey, you all right?

537
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,673
I mean, you ain't
hurt or nothing?

538
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,674
No. No, I'm ok.

539
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,175
Thank you.

540
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,678
No, really,
I'm all right.

541
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,236
Really, I am.

542
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,682
How about you?

543
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,682
Nah!

544
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,844
Who do those cats
think they are?

545
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,286
I'll show them
next time.

546
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,221
Hey, where's Fillie?

547
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,849
Fillie?
Who's Fillie?

548
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,621
Oh, I gotta find him.

549
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,253
He's just a kid.

550
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,491
Fillie!

551
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,636
Tony!

552
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,263
Whoa!

553
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,774
Phew!
Some scrap, huh?

554
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:29,404
There are cats here!
Wait'll I tell Papa!

555
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,641
If I find him.

556
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,707
You see, he's looking
for his family.

557
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,308
Aw, the poor darlin'.

558
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,810
Wait a minute!

559
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:42,916
HonestJohn,
at Tammany Hall.

560
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,655
He knows every mouse
in the city.

561
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,562
Told you to stick
with me!

562
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,690
Come on.

563
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,133
Oh!

564
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:58,369
Well, Mr. "There-are-no-
whats-in-America"?

565
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,070
Cats!
Ha-ha!

566
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,387
It's me third wake
today,

567
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,184
and I'm not finished.

568
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,693
We've got
to do something
about them cats.

569
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,194
Aah!

570
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:23,256
Besides paying
Warren T. Rat
for no protection.

571
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,203
Oh, oh, poor lad.

572
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,704
So young.

573
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,209
He never had
a chance to vote.

574
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:36,576
Well, he'll vote
from now on.

575
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,672
I'll see to that.

576
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,176
[Knock On Door]

577
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,621
HonestJohn.

578
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,056
It's Gussie Mausheimer.

579
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,490
Oh.

580
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,963
Ooey, the richest
and most powerful
mouse in New York.

581
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:58,661
What's she doing
slumming in this
part of town?

582
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,329
There's a dead mouse
on that table.

583
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,773
It's an Irish custom,
Gussie.

584
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,277
The cats
got him today.

585
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,282
Pwecisely why
I am here to see you.

586
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,786
Would you care
for a wee drop?

587
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,787
Today was the worst.

588
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,289
Those cats
are killing everyone.

589
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:24,795
They don't know
the difference
between wich and poor.

590
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,159
The wretches!

591
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,561
Oh, shameful!

592
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,158
As you know,
I've dedicated my life...

593
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,671
to helping those wess
fortunate than myself...

594
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,172
That's everyone.

595
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,674
And now you'll help me.

596
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,405
We must have a wawwy.

597
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,003
A wawwy?

598
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,513
What's a wawwy?

599
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,641
You know, a wawwy.

600
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,915
A warge gathewing of mice
for a weason.

601
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,421
Oh, a rally!

602
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,824
That's what I said,
a wawwy.

603
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,098
Tomorrow
at Mausheimer Park,

604
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,602
we will all decide
what to do.

605
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,103
I'll bring
the uptown mice.

606
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,936
You bring the mice
from downtown.

607
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,603
Madam, you can count
on HonestJohn.

608
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,084
At last, we're all
getting together...

609
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,585
about the cats.

610
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,745
Bridget.

611
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,913
Oh, Fillie.

612
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,047
HonestJohn,

613
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,715
he's lost his family.

614
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,783
Do you know
the Mousekewitzes?

615
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,990
Oh... hmm... are they
registered to vote?

616
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,090
They just
got off the boat.

617
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,932
Oh. Ahem.

618
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,871
Sorry. Don't
know them yet.

619
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,385
That's me mother
and father.

620
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,389
The cats got them
two years ago November.

621
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,391
Now, don't you worry.

622
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,450
Yours are all right.

623
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,495
They're out there
somewhere.

624
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,830
Now get some sleep.

625
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:32,319
# Somewhere out there #

626
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:38,385
# Beneath
the pale moonlight #

627
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:45,163
# Someone's
thinking of me #

628
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:50,731
#And loving me tonight #

629
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:58,109
# Somewhere out there #

630
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,414
# Someone's saying
a prayer #

631
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:09,849
#That we'll find
one another #

632
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:14,990
# In that big
somewhere out there #

633
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,300
#And even though
I know #

634
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,363
# How very far apart
we are #

635
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,773
# It helps to think
we might be wishing #

636
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,711
# On the same
bright star #

637
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,772
#And when the night wind
starts to sing #

638
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,819
#A lonesome lullaby #

639
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,787
# It helps to think
we're sleeping #

640
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:43,088
# Underneath
the same big sky #

641
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:51,028
# Somewhere out there #

642
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:56,733
# If love
can see us through #

643
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:03,478
#Then we'll
be together #

644
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:07,074
# Somewhere out there #

645
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:16,355
# Out where dreams
come true ##

646
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,268
Attention, pwease!

647
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,141
Attention, pwease!

648
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,905
You all know
why we are here.

649
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,248
We have got
to do something...

650
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,752
about these cats.

651
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,756
Not so loud!
They'll hear you!

652
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,258
So? Let them hear me.

653
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,760
You can talk!
You're rich!

654
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,262
Money isn't everything.

655
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,766
I know. I have
money <i>and</i> everything,

656
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,270
but what are they worth
without fweedom?

657
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,634
Hear, hear!

658
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,263
Yeah!
Yeah!
Right!

659
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,207
Why did we come
to America?

660
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,709
For fweedom!

661
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,336
Yeah!
Yeah!
Right!

662
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,348
Why are they building
that statue?

663
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,850
What does it stand for?

664
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,010
Fweedom!

665
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,520
So what do we want?

666
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,989
Fweedom!
Fweedom!
Fweedom!

667
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,158
Wight!

668
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,664
Fweedom from cats.

669
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,666
Because this is America,

670
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,635
we can do something
about them!

671
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,137
What can we do?

672
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,194
Yeah!
Yeah!

673

01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,406
And Fievel.

1007
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,805
And Fievel?

1008
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,400
Papa.

1009
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:32,743
No, there are many
Fievel Mousekewitzes
in New York,

1010
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,077
maybe thousands.

1011
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:38,450
It could
still be another
Fievel Mousekewitz.

1012
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,751
No, Papa.

1013
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:43,484
Look.

1014
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,476
Get a load
of this.

1015
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,911
You're sleeping
in my place.

1016
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,471
Huh?

1017
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,449
Hey, give me that!

1018
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,985
What's your story?

1019
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,454
I've been looking
for my family.

1020
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:49,957
He's looking
for his family.

1021
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,459
He's looking
for his family!

1022
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,691
I stopped that
long ago.

1023
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,289
You know
who they are.

1024
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:01,461
They should be
looking for you.

1025
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,903
They don't care.
Forget them.

1026
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,146
Right,
they don't care!

1027
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:15,149
If they did,
they would have found me.

1028
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,983
If they don't care,
I don't care!

1029
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,147
Yeah, forget them.

1030
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,657
You're one
of us now.

1031
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:26,923
Here. Make
yourself a bed.

1032
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,720
Pitiful.

1033
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,508
I'll never find them
again anyway.

1034
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,339
Never.

1035
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,003
Never.

1036
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,706
Never.

1037
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,409
This is my home now.

1038
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,987
Fievel!

1039
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,664
Fievel!

1040
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,181
Fievel!

1041
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,115
Fillie!

1042
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,677
Hey, Fillie
Mousekewitz!

1043
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:40,127
I never dreamt I'd
be riding a fewine.

1044
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,628
A fewine?

1045
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,130
A cat!

1046
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,133
I knew that.
I knew that.

1047
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,135
Keep playing.
Keep playing.

1048
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,727
We'll find him.

1050
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,702
Fievel!

1051
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,318
Fievel!

1052
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,547
Fievel,
where are you?

1053
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,658
Fievel?

1054
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,490
Fievel?

1055
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,057
Papa?

1056
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,060
Papa?

1057
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,672
Papa.

1058
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,332
Fievel?

1059
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,069
Papa!

1060
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,907
Where are you?

1061
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,674
Papa!

1062
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:36,479
Fiev... Wait, stop!

1063
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:40,181
Fievel!

1064
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:43,247
I'm coming, Papa!

1065
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,349
Fievel!

1066
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,893
Papa!

1067
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:51,199
Fievel, Fievel!

1068
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,497
Mama, look!

1069
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,231
Mama!

1070
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,069
What's come over me?

1071
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,877
I am hugging a cat.

1072
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,010
I've never been
so happy before.

1073
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:15,182
I have friends, lots
of little tiny friends.

1074
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,248
Tony,
isn't it grand?

1075
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:21,262
I don't hear no one
thanking me here.

1076
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,489
Oh!

1077
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:27,433
Fievel, I knew
you were alive.

1078
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:32,937
My little boy
back from the dead.

1079
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,776
America.
What a place.

1080
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,215
My Fievel.

1081
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:45,219
I thought I would
never see you again.

1082
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,380
Never say never, Papa.

1083
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,287
Oh!

1084
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,724
Oh! I nearly forgot.

1085
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,786
Here, Fievel, your hat.

1086
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,567
Your hat...
it fits.

1087
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,732
My son...

1088
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,300
now you are a mouse.

1089
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:16,575
My statue is finished.

1090
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,586
Oh, la la la la.

1091
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,747
Wait till you see her.

1092
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:24,919
She is beautiful.

1093
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:26,426
<i>Magnifique.</i>

1094
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:31,091
Mama, don't
be afraid to
open your eyes.

1095
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,769
Look what
you're missing.

1096
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:36,600
You're missing
everything.

1097
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,607
Papa, when we land,
I'll look.

1098
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,108
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1099
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,111
No, whoa!
This is... oh, whoa!

1100
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:47,114
This is nice.
Oh, thanks, fellas.

1101
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:50,117
You in the front,
higher, higher!

1102
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,846
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1103
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,192
Oh, Henri,
she's so beautiful.

1104
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,479
Henri, what's that
over there?

1105
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,278
Oh, that is
more America.

1106
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,319
Can we see it?

1107
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:30,325
Ho ho ho! You will,
my little American.

1108
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:35,659
Ha ha ha!
Someday, you will.

1109
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,894
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

# Beneath
the pale moonlight #

thinking of me #

# Someone's
saying a prayer #

1116

#That we'll
find one another #

# How very far apart
we are #

1120

we're sleeping #

01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,648
# Can see us
through #
