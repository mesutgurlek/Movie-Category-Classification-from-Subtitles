(MELANCHOLY HUMMING)

00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:13,030
Tell me, who's that writing?
John the Revelator

3
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,867
Wrote the book of the seven seals

4
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,662
Who's that writing?
John the Revelator

5
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:28,253
Tell me, who's that writing?
John the Revelator

6
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,882
Wrote the book of the seven seals

7
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:36,053
You know, God walked down
In the cool of the day

8
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,931
Called Adam by his name

9
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,851
And he refused to answer

10
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,815
Because he's naked and ashamed

11
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,068
Who's that writing?
John the Revelator

12
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:55,114
Well, who's that writing?
John the Revelator

13
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,617
Who's that writing?
John the Revelator

14
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,204
Wrote the book of the seven seals

15
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,375
You know, Christ had 12 apostles

16
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,920
And three he led away

17
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:16,927
Said, "Watch me when I walk
Till I go yonder and I pray"

18
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:28,564
Who's that writing?
John the Revelator

Wrote the book of the seven seals

20
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,196
Christ came on the Easter morning

21
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,825
Mary and Martha was down to see

22
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:46,832
Go tell my disciples
And meet me in Galilee

23
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:51,295
Tell me, who's that writing?

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,604
- Good morning, Warden.
- Tom.

31
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,289
Is that Elwood Blues?

32
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,750
Yes, sir. Released yesterday.

33
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,962
Did you tell him about Jake?

34
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,547
No, sir. I thought you told him.

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,826
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,472
(BLUES SONG PLAYING)

37
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,153
Listen, I work for a friend of yours.

38
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,779
Who's that?

39
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,365
Your old drummer, Willie.

40
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,659
I dance at his club.

41
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,495
They told him you were out
and he asked me to come check on you.

42
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,914
He said he'd give you a job.

43
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,086
Matara, could you drop me off here, please?

44
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,480
- What can I do for you, boy?
- Sir,

45
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,648
how much would something like

46
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,152
that full-sized Ford police package
in the middle there run me?

47
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:06,615
Get yourself $500
and you come back to see me then.

48
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,784
Okay, sir.

49
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,580
That's a nice car.

50
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,624
I'll save it for you.

51
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,001
Thanks.

52
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,389
I wasn't sure
you were going to come, Elwood.

53
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,143
Hey, a letter from you
is like a command, Sister. You know that.

54
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,316
- Actually, it's Mother Mary now.
- That's a promotion, isn't it?

55
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,028
I'm sorry to hear about Jake.

56
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,325
Yeah, well, I guess
he's in a much better place.

57
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,664
Uh...

58
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,582
Where is Curtis?

59
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,878
Curtis has gone on as well, Elwood.
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,090
So, that's why he stopped writing me.

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,679
He was very upset
when the orphanage closed.

62
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,683
Curtis was the closest thing to a dad
that Jake and I ever had.

63
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,185
He gave us the music.

64
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:23,191
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Elwood.
We all must go on and fight the good fight.

65
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,445
The orphanage is gone, Jake's gone,
Curtis is gone.

66
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,031
I got no brother, I got no roots, I got no life.
I got nothing, for Christ's sake.

67
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,201
Young man...

68
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,661
Ow!

69
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,955
...you were not taught and raised by me

70
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,417
to fold at the slightest whiff
of adverse circumstances.

71
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,795
Now quit your silly moping,

72
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,756
pull your sorry self together
and snap out of it!

73
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,133
But... (EXCLAIMS)

74
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,388
But nothing! Wise up!
Turn your heart to the Creator.

75
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,390
You are so quick to despair.

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,102
You are not the only person in the world
who has had tragedy in their lives.

77
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,190
You didn't know that Curtis had a son,
did you?

78
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,776
Curtis had a son?

79
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,947
Before Curtis came to us
at St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud

80
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:15,535
he had a musical group
that toured the juke joints of the Midwest.

81
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,831
In one town,
Curtis had an affair with a married woman.

82
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,708
Go, Curtis.

83
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,545
I mean, that's terrible.

84
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,756
That's what I thought you meant.

85
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,385
Anyway, the woman became pregnant
and decided to remain with her husband,

86
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,014
never telling him
that the boy child wasn't his.

87
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,849
Curtis was devastated.

88
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,310
He came to us as a custodian

89
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:45,023
and spent the rest of his life
caring for little orphans like you, Elwood.

90
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,107
(CRYING)

91
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,987
Thanks.

92
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,786
That's a beautiful story.

93
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,210
Hey, wait a minute. If Curtis had a son,

94
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:09,214
then that guy would be
kind of like my stepbrother.

95
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,632
I have a family.

96
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,969
Curtis always stayed in touch
with the boy's mother.

97
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,179
He sent his paycheck every week.

98
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,515
Where is this boy now?

99
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,227
He's a grown man now, Elwood,
and doing quite well.

100
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,771
Lives in the city.
His name is Cabel Chamberlain.

101
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,315
Cabel Chamberlain.

102
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,610
He doesn't know anything about Curtis,
and it's not your place to tell him.

103
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,571
I wouldn't say anything.

104
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,031
Do you know
anything about mentoring, Elwood?

105
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,493
No. What about it?

106
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,954
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

107
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,375
Sister, would you send Buster
in here, please?

108
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,043
Wait a minute.

109
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,336
Thank you.

110
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,715
l...

111
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,846
Come in, Buster, and sit down.

112
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,438
Elwood, say hello to Buster.

113
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,356
Hi. How ya doing?

114
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,525
Buster, say hello to Elwood.

115
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,402
Hi. How ya doing?

116
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,780
Hey, the kid's a wiseass.

117
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,450
(EXCLAIMING) Shit!

118
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,952
What did you say?

119
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,914
I said, what a sweet kid.

120
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,126
That's more like it. Now, here's my proposal.

121
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,921
Young Buster here is a ward of the state,
and due to lack of space

122
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:36,718
the archdiocese has agreed to house
homeless children here at the hospital.

123
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,346
What's that got to do with me?

124
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,599
I thought perhaps that you would
come and spend time with Buster.

125
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,979
Why don't you take Buster here to the library
in the meantime?

126
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,399
You know, I've been jacked around...

127
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,863
The library. No problem.

128
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,784
See you in two hours, boys.

129
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,454
Okay, kid, here's the deal.

130
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,082
You wait here
and I'll come back for you with the car.

131
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,167
Do you have a car?

132
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,503
I'm working on it.

133
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,017
Chicago. Cabel Chamberlain.

134
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,727
(BLUES SONG PLAYING)

135
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,776
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

136
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,919
Hey, kid, are you stalking me?

137
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,095
What are you, 15? Seventeen?

138
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,055
I'm 10.

139
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,015
Ten, huh?

140
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,562
Look, I know what you're going through.

141
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,064
You're lonely,
searching for your place in life.

142
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,774
Just don't blow it like I did.

143
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,736
Stay away from drugs, gangs,
cyber porn on the internet,

144
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,155
and you could be
President of the United States someday.

145
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,618
But I don't want to be
President of the United States.

146
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,912
Look, I'm busy.
I got kind of a brother in there.

147
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,914
He must be in some kind of trouble.

148
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,794
Besides, you don't want to hang around
with some over-40 recidivist.

149
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,379
Now scram.

150
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,846
A Mr. Elwood J. Blues is here to see you.
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,435
Mr. Blues, Commander Chamberlain's office
is on the 12th floor. He's expecting you.

152
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,689
"Commander" Chamberlain?

153
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,525
Now, how can I help you, Mr...

154
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,278
Blues. Elwood J. Blues.

155
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,410
Would you mind taking your hat
and glasses off in my office, please?

156
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,204
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

157
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,590
Okay, you can put your glasses back on.

158
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,886
Now, what exactly is the nature
of your visit here, Mr. Blues?

159
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,638
Well, it's like this. See,

00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,556
- I used to be in a band...
- Yes.

161
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,601
...called the Blues Brothers.

162
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,644
So?

163
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,064
With a partner whose name was Jake Blues.

164
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,398
Go on.

165
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,070
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

166
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,115
And you are our long-lost brother.

167
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,288
Mr. Blues, I am an only child.

168
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,416
Yeah, but your real father
was like a real father to me, too.

169
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,001
My real father?

170
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,545
Yeah, Curtis.

171
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,798
Have you noticed, Mr. Blues,
that I am an African American?

172
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,259
Yeah, that's okay. So was Curtis.

173
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,391
You see, your mother and Curtis
had an extramarital affair,

174
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,018
which produced a little boy, that's you.

175
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,024
My father passed away 14 years ago.

176
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,612
He was a full bird colonel
in the United States Air Force.

177
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,532
My mother now lives in Phoenix, Arizona,

178
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:33,454
and a more honorable, sweet-tempered
and goodly woman does not exist.

179
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,457
Look, I'm not making
any moral judgments here,

180
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,335
but one can project
what might have happened in this case.

181
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,922
Your mom, young,
her husband in the military,

182
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,383
away from home much of the time,

183
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,554
which may have pushed her to reach out,
stray from the nest.

184
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,638
That's enough.

185
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,142
Just a minute.

186
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,978
Please.

187
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,819
Hi, Ma. It's me, Cab.

188
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,740
Listen, I have a gentleman
in my office here who's telling me

189
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,701
some story about some man named Curtis.

190
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,457
What?

191
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,710
Right.

192
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,427
So, what precisely is it you want from me?

193
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,555
Well, seeing as we're
kind of like stepbrothers,

194
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,724
I thought maybe, you know,
you could help me out.

195
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,059
How could I do that?

196
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,144
I need 500 bucks for this car, see.

197
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,440
And I thought maybe you could, you know,
loan me the money. Or...

198
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,025
Or what?

199
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,778
I'm thinking of putting
the band back together.

200
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,071
Maybe you could join us.

201
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:56,913
I am a commander in the Illinois State Police.
And I enjoy my job.

202
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,875
You waltz in here telling me that I have

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,296
a dead, white, criminal brother,
who was in a band,

204
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:11,511
which the last time they played anywhere
were charged with grand larceny,

205
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,058
reckless endangerment,
felonious motor vehicle assault,

206
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,729
over 700 violations
of the Highway Traffic Act,

207
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:28,528
and damages, both public and private,
in excess of $24 million.

208
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,532
And you are asking me
if I want to join this band?

209
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,659
I could show you all the moves.

210
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,162
Get the hell out of my office, right now!

211
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,040
I think you need a hug.

212
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,044
And don't ever come back here again!

213
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,095
(GRUNTS)

214
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,389
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

215
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,104
He dropped this.

216
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,201
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

218
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,210
Thank you, sir.

219
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Is this your boy?

220
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,549
He's...

221
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,386
I'm his associate.

222
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,972
Yeah. Yeah, that's who he is.

223
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,476
Well, you're lucky you came by today.
I'm selling the place tomorrow.

224
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,810
Why is that?

225
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,898
Going down to New Orleans for a while.
Try out a new career.

226
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,358
Good luck to you, Mr. Gasperon.

227
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,653
Good luck to you, Mr. Blues.

228
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,244
Mother Mary, we've done two bed checks,

229
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,122
searched the grounds
and we still can't find him.

230
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,249
Can't find who?

231
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,835
Buster. He's missing.

232
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,338
Elwood!

233
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,969

From Willie's old band.

Is this your son?

let's get you something to eat.

What would you say if I told you
I was putting the band back together?

254
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,337
I'd say I've got myself a good little business
here and I'm not going back to jail.

255
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,881
You're telling me you don't miss it?

256

That's right. I don't miss it.

could ever equal the rush you get

All right.

00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,329
Just the cash is missing. Where was it?

267

Turned in to lost and found in a paper bag,
along with this note.

Hey, all you married men. If you're tied up,

282
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,265
you better stay tied up,
because it's cheaper to keep her.

01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:47,997
Their brands were still on fire
And their hooves were made of steel

Excuse me. Thank you.

Take your men behind the stage.

793
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:58,383
A bolt of fear went through them
as they thundered through the sky

794
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:02,220
For they saw the riders coming hard

795

We start walking.

What's the point? I say we turn around.

Why don't you give the boys
a motivational speech?

So, you all want to quit?

Well, honestly, who can blame you?

837

I guess I've dragged you down
as far as living humans can go.

You're not the Elwood Blues I know.

847

The Elwood Blues I know once said

848
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,696
that no pharmaceutical product
could ever equal the rush you get

849
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,448
when the band hits that groove,

850
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:18,035
and the people are dancing and shouting
and swaying and the house is rocking.

from your crafts, your skills, your vocations,

leaving the next generation with nothing

but recycled digitally sampled
techno grooves, quasi-synth rhythms,

859

pseudo songs
of violence-laden gangster rap,

860

acid pop
and simpering, saccharine, soulless slush.

861

Depart now and you forever separate
yourselves from the vital American legacies

the fragile candles of blues, R&B and soul,

868
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:34,237
and when those flames flicker and expire,
the light of the world is extinguished

869
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,280
because the music
which has moved mankind

through seven decades,
leading to the millennium,

871

will wither and die
on the vine of abandonment and neglect.

From Chicago. That's right.

01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:25,357
Well, kid, I guess it's time to say goodbye.

1260
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:28,026
- I'm not going with them.
- You can't stay with Elwood.

1261
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:29,945
They think he kidnapped you.

1262
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:31,238
But they're wrong.

1263
01:54:31,322 --> 01:54:33,323
It would be hard to convince them of that.

1264
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:34,825
He's right, Buster.

1265
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:40,414
If I go back with them,
they'll put me in some foster home

1266
01:54:40,498 --> 01:54:43,876
with people who don't love me.
They'll put you back in jail,

1267
01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:45,711
and I'll never see you again.

1268
01:54:45,795 --> 01:54:47,796
And we'll both be sad forever.

1269
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:50,591
So, what do we do?

1270
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:55,888
We're all brothers now, right?

1271
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:57,055
Right.

1272
01:54:57,181 --> 01:55:00,851
You guys stay here and distract them.
I'll kidnap Elwood.

1273
01:55:03,521 --> 01:55:05,522
Good luck.

1274
01:55:05,982 --> 01:55:07,399
Catch up with you down the road.

1275
01:55:07,483 --> 01:55:09,234
Further on up the road.

1276
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:20,203

The Lord does work
in mysterious ways, Elwood.

1282
01:56:12,548 --> 01:56:13,632
Yep.
