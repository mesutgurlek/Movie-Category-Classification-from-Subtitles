1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,834
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee: The Glee Club started
out as underdogs,</i>

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,452
<i>singing show tunes in the choir
room, and now they're headed
to Chicago</i>

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,387
<i>to compete for a national
championship.</i>

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,323
<i>I mean, they made it
to Nationals last year
in New York,</i>

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,882
<i>but they came in 12th.
It was sort of a nightmare.</i>

6
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:11,967
<i>Rachel's nightmare totally
came true when she choked</i>

7
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,894
<i>at her NYADA audition,
and literally all she's talked</i>

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,780
<i>about for three years is New
York, Broadway, Streisand,
Dreams, Broadway.</i>

9
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,166
<i>Ugh!
And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

10
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:21,869
(beeping)

11
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,988
What's going on?
How bad is it?

12
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,722
Her temperature's 101 degrees.

13
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,709
Given the fact that Weezy's
complaining

14
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,193
about an upset stomach,

15
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:32,563
it's either Amazonian dengue
fever or the H1N1 super virus.

16
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:33,961
Or I have
food poisoning.

17
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:36,367
We all wanted burritos for
lunch, so we went to Chipotle,

18
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:39,554
but Mercedes tried some dive
called "Señora Salsation."

19
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,105
Will, word, please.

20
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:42,840
With Monique down
for the count,

21
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,843
<i>we are entering
the Hunger Games of
show choir competition</i>

22
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:47,862
without one of our most
powerful voices.

23
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:49,213
We need to have a plan.

24
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,147
Right. Because if New 
Directions doesn't win

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,316
that means you go back
to being co-captains

26
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,617
of the Cheerios with
Roz Washington.

27
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:56,370
Your sniping is as expository
as it is wrong.

28
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,856
Yes, I have fantasized
about handing that prize money

29
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:02,226
to Principal Figgins
so I could buy back my sole
control of the Cheerios,

30
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:05,279
but my main concern right now
is for these kids.

31
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:06,998
I want this win for them.

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,724
I just don't want everything
we worked for to collapse

33
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:11,469
because of one bad burrito.

34
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:14,930
So here's what's gonna happen:
Mercedes, you're on bed rest,

35
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,890
Quinn, you're stepping in.
No, no, no, I can't

36
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,899
dance that number. I can't sing
it, either, not like...

37
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,277
The Trouble Tones need you.

38
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,462
And you're better than you
think you are.

39
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:22,746
Tina, you, too.
You're in the Trouble Tones.

40
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,914
Mr. Shue, this is my last
competition.

41
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:25,716
I don't want to miss it.

42
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,734
Amen, to that, sister.
That's why I'm putting you

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,018
on a vitamin B-12 drip.

44
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,053
We're flushing your system

45
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:31,253
with Pedialyte, and I'm gonna

46
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,084
fill that bathtub with ice
and see if we can't get

47
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,959
your ambient body temperature
back down to normal.

48
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,077
<i>Worked in Jacob's Ladder.</i>

49
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,629
All right, we all have
our marching orders.

50
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,280
Let's do it.

51
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:42,305
+++

52
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,085
Hey.

53
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,870
You okay?

54
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:50,737
What if we don't win? What's
gonna happen with those kids?

55
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,092
It's a competition.

56
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,476
They understand
that everybody can't win.

57
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,176
But they never get to win.

58
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,466
School's almost over,
forever for most of them.

59
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,686
Can you imagine what
what it would be like
for them

60
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,105
to have just a couple
of days walking the halls
as champions?

61
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,691
It's something
they would carry
around with them

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,109
for the rest
of their lives.

63
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,312
If you're gonna lead
them to the promised land,

64
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,113
you're gonna have
to have an attitude
adjustment.

65
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:14,148
(sighs)
But, Will,
they're ready.

66
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:15,983
You made 'em ready
for three years.

67
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,904
But what if it wasn't enough?

68
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,408
Will, you better
come downstairs.

69
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,659
We got a problem.

70
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,380
(kids yelling)

71
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:33,384
Hey, calm down!
Hey, hey, calm down! Calm down!

72
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,585
Fight, fight, fight!

73
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,753
Hey, cool out!

74
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:37,054
He's studying
for geography

75
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,055
while we're trying
to rehearse! It's bogus!

76
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:39,506
'Cause I already
know the dance!

77
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,308
You dance like you
got your feet caught
in bear traps.

78
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,126
You're trying
to gnaw them off.

79
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:44,979
Mr. Shue, are you aware
that while we're arguing
about jazz squares,

80
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:48,315
Unique is being handed the key
to the city by Rahm Emanuel?
Really?

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,068
And plus my pillow and my
blanket fell into the pool.
Disaster.

82
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,303
Look, I think everybody is
just a little tired.

83
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:54,822
We've been rehearsing
for three straight hours.

84
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:56,523
Yeah, and we'll rehearse
all night if we have to.

85
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,441
We can rest after we've won!

86
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,975
Just because we've lost Mercedes

87
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:02,279
doesn't mean we can be anything
less than perfect. Perfect!

88
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,580
That's easy for you to say.

89
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,616
Okay, you know what?
You know what?

90
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,919
Hey! I don't want
to hear any of this,
"We can't do it without her,"

91
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,005
because guess what?
We don't have a choice.

92
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,457
So be warned:
if you are not giving this

93
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,175
everything you've got,

94
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,961
I will go all
Lima Heights on
your sorry asses.

95
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,096
Listen to yourselves.

96
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,798
I know. I'm sorry.
I always go

97
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,683
to the yelling place.
I have rage.

98
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:26,804
No, it's a good thing.
A great thing.

99
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,172
There is so much passion
in this room

100
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,842
Even all your arguing,
it's about the work.

101
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,644
You guys really want this.

102
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:35,646
Okay, so let's take
a half-hour break,

103
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,398
and then we'll run it
from the top.

104
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,566
Mr. Shue, is it okay
if we keep going? We got

105
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,517
the first slot,
which is, like, the death slot.

106
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,819
We have to be amazing.

107
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,203
Yeah, "Edge of Glory's"
a bitch.

108
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,521
I said I'd be dancing
by nationals.

109
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,789
I'll be damned if I don't.

110
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:47,023
Okay, then let's
keep going.

111
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,525
Mike, help the guys out
with the choreography.

112
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,160
Artie, help Puck
with his geography.

113
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:51,962
Ladies, "Edge of Glory."
Come on.

114
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,380
Brittany, run us through it.

115
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:55,582
From the chorus?
Yeah, from the chorus.
Let's do it.

116
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,168
Watch out. We're gonna
do it. Okay. Ready?

117
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,420
Five, six,
seven, eight.

118
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,005
One, two, three, four, five...

119
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:02,973
You okay?

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,374
...six, seven, eight.

121
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,477
One, two, three, four...

122
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,678
Keep up.

123
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,070
Looking for what's left
of your dignity?

124
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,555
Nice to see you, too, Jessie.

125
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,891
If I were you, I'd be
spending more time fing

126
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,576
on how you're gonna wrap up
fourth place

127
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,027
than looking for her.

128
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,062
There's no way in hell
Carmen Tibideaux's coming here.

129
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,414
Wait. How do you know
about Carmen?

130
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:28,615
It's my business
to know everything

131
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,750
that goes on with
my competition.

132
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,401
I'm always looking
for that extra edge.

133
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,921
I hate to think
you pull the same
choke job up there today.

134
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,956
Look, I know exactly what
you're doing right now, okay?

135
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,574
We didn't date for that long,

136
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,076
and I don't even know how much
of it was actually real,

137
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:41,879
but when you get nervous,
you get mean

138
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,131
and you get really pale,
and then you start putting
your hands

139
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:45,599
through your hair
like Danny Zuko.

140
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,935
Look, you have no idea
the kind of pressure
I'm under.

141
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:51,271
Last year, Vocal Adrenaline
only lost for the first time
in eight years.

142
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:54,257
If we lose again
this year, that's it.
The dynasty is over.

143
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:58,145
The mystique and aura
that we used to intimidate
our opponents with will vanish.

144
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,448
I promised them that
I would reboot the program.
I'll be humiliated.

145
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:02,816
You did help the program.

146
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,267
What you did with
Unique was amazing.

147
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,537
It was a pretty
inspired idea of mine.

148
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,906
It was actually Kurt's
and Mercedes', but...

149
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,492
But I implemented it.

150
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:13,610
I don't know. I just think
these new rules are

151
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,747
messing with my head; 33%

152
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,550
of the numbers have
to be vintage? What does
that even mean?

153
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,302
The only thing vintage
about me is my Tyrone Powers
haircut and my pager.

154
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,421
Are you forgetting who you are,
Jesse, okay?

155
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:26,590
<i>Your Bohemian Rhapsody was,
like, the benchmark performance</i>

156
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,343
of every show choir
competition in the
past ten years.

157
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,178
Most people don't realize

158
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,896
I lost ten pounds
during that performance.

159
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,264
You guys are
gonna do great today.

160
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,984
Even though we're
definitely gonna beat you.

161
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,319
Oh, cocky all of a sudden.

162
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,104
I like it.

163
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,639
Hey, everything okay?

164
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,409
Yeah, everything's good.
I'm gonna go get ready.

165
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,528
It was very good to see you.
You, too.

166
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,997
Hi.

167
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,147
Heard you two are getting
married.

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,983
Yeah.

169
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,919
Good for you.

170
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,006
Good luck today.

171
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,040
You, too.

172
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,931
For me?
Well, it's for the wedding.

173
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,834
For the Jewish part
where you smash the glass.
It'ske, the climax

174
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,269
of the wedding, right?
Right before we kiss?

175
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,820
Yeah, it's supposed to symbolize
the fragility of life

176
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,472
or the destruction of the temple

177
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,340
or something like that.
It's very sweet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,227
But whatever. I wanted
a piece of this town
to be there.

179
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,029
This is the town where
everything's gonna change.

180
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:24,314
We're gonna go from losers
to National Champs.

181
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,900
Your optimism if very sexy.

182
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,987
Well, I'm so optimistic, I put
my money where my mouth is.

183
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:31,655
You want to bet me

184
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,657
that your dork club is gonna
outdork all the other

185
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,142
dork clubs
in the country?

186
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,460
500 bucks.

187
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,412
You're so on.

188
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,214
Wait a minute.
That money was supposed

189
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,715
to be for our honeymoon, okay?

190
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,084
It was our money that we saved
from babysitting

191
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,003
and the tips you made
at the tire shop!

192
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,338
I'm gonna double it. I'm gonna
make it a thousand dollars.

193
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,373
That's, like, an extra
two nights in Niagara Falls.

194
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:51,925
What if we lose?
Not this time.

195
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,178
Carmen Tibideaux is coming,
and we're gonna be perfect.

196
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,147
And then we're
gonna get married,

197
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:58,565
and I'm gonna smash this glass,

198
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,067
and then we're gonna live
happily ever after.

199
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:02,886
I love you.

200
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,696
All right, gather around,
everyone!

201
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,064
(kids cheer)

202
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:17,084
I just want to say a few words
before we go out there.

203
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,286
Hold on, Mr. Shue. Hold on.
You've given us

204
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,672
a lot of pep talks
over the years, but remember,

205
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,290
you told us once
that, you know,

206
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:28,078
a teacher's job is done when his
students don't need him anymore?

207
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,883
Okay. Finn, the floor is yours.

208
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,052
Last night we all sat around
in a circle

209
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,087
after you went to bed
and we told stories.

210
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,855
But then we went around
the room,

211
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,441
and everybody said what they
wanted to win this thing for,

212
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,310
and we all said the same thing:

213
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,696
we want to win this for you.
Yeah.

214
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,981
And I know every year at school
Figgins gives away

215
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,767
the Teacher of the Year award.

216
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,203
But I don't think
any of us have to wait

217
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,271
to see how we feel about that.

218
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,991
You're, like, our
Teacher of a Lifetime.

219
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:58,959
GIRL:
Yeah.

220
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,994
Whoo!
Yeah, definitely.

221
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,279
Thank you, Finn, all of you.

222
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,631
I love you guys so much.

223
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,616
(over P.A.)
New Directions, line up.

224
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,119
All right, that's it.
Show time. Hands in, everyone.

225
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,805
Now I know you weren't planning
on doing the show circle

226
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,390
without me.
Mercedes?

227
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:14,591
You're alive!

228
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:16,226
Yeah, thanks to Sue.
She's a miracle worker.

229
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,061
Oh, well, it's amazing
what a little TLC,

230
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,296
some cortisone
and a witch doctor will do.

231
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,232
Thank God you're okay
because that just means

232
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,900
I'm not gonna fall on my face

233
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:24,935
during that Trouble Tones
number.

234
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,236
Oh, screw that.

235
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,971
This is our last time
performing together.

236
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,906
You're doing it,
and so you are you, Tina.

237
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,808
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

238
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,477
Plus I have so many steroids
going through my body right now,

239
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,030
I may turn into the Incredible
Hulk if you piss me off.

240
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,199
Okay, if we don't get out
of this room soon,

241
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:42,285
none of us will be performing.
Let's go!

242
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:43,203
Go, New Directions!

243
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:45,003

244

Dick Butkus,
I beg of you,

245
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,806
chew your cud with
your mouth closed.

246
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,810
Sorry. I'm as nervous
as a cat in a room full
of rocking chairs.

247
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:58,263
Think how you'd feel
if your entire teaching
career were riding on this.

248
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,965
Okay?

249
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,134
(sighs) I really wish
we weren't going first.

250
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,320
The kids are right,
it's the death slot.

251
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,639
Carmen Tibideaux isn't here,
Mercedes still has a fever.

252
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,524
I don't know if Quinn...
Okay.

The unholy trinity...

ending together.

266

Just the way
it should be.

461
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,507

At least that's what real stars do.

-Yeah, but that's not how we roll in the New Directions.
Not really our style.

Ruby red or sugar rose?

465

Sugar Rose.

466
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,154

I have a confession
to make.

568
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:30,033
I am a show choir junkie.

569
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,401
Some people
follow football;

570

some people follow the NCAA
basketball tournament;

571

some people follow

in the life of their
wife and children.

573
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:40,994
Not me. I follow competitive
high school show choir.

574
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, my God!

575
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,115
Seriously?
Did you blog just about me

576
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,116
during that performance?

577
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:51,088
You're welcome. It's already
got over three million hits.

if you don't love show choir,

then what exactly are you
doing here, Lindsay Lohan?

580

If you have to ask

581
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:00,514
why a 12-time Teen Choice Award
nominee

582

crack the top ten.

606

I liked them, but they weren't
the best singers and dancers.

607
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:52,983
They are likable.

608
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:54,651

609

What?

627

This thing isn't
even televised?

628
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:30,053
I am in full imagery-
rendering mood, people.

629
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,388
I show up here and there's
not even a red button to push?

630
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,274
And a chair that can
spin me around?

631
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:37,160
Or I can then point
at a kid onstage and yell,
"I would work with you!"

632
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,913
Really? I'm seriously
firing my manager.

633
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:40,947
Can I use that as an exclusive?

634
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,032
Absolutely not.

635
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,667

what it looks like

638
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:53,093
when a kid's show choir
dreams are disrespected?

639

782
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,200
well worth the wait.

783
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:40,925
But I meant thank you
for everything.

784
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,750
This whole year,
it's been incredible.

785
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:47,475
And I'm so grateful to
have you by my side.

786
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Many more years to come.

787
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,625
SUE:
Award ceremony's
about to start.

788
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,350
Lots of competition for
teacher of the year.

789
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,375
My source, and when
I say my source I mean

790
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,900
Becky Jackson hiding in
a dummy filing cabinet

791
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,225
that I put in
Figgin's office.

792
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,950
My source said Sue
Sylvester make room

793
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,775
in your trophy case
for yet another accolade.

794
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
Let us review why.

795
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:16,325
I led your tragic band of misfits
 to a victory at nationals.

796
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,450
I defeated my
Nubian nemesis.

797
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:21,875
And of course the Cherrios
welcomed me back with open arms.

798
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,600
And I did all of this without
missing a single day of work

799
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,925
and in spite of the fact
that I've been pregnant now

800
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,750
for indeterminate
number of months.

801
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,475
Sue.
I've gotta give you your due.

802
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,700
No question you helped
us win Nationals

803
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:35,225
and I know you've had
a tough year but you

804
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,450
never gave up.

805
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,075
You do deserve this.

806
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
Thank you William.

807
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,225
Truer words never came
out of your mouth.

808
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,450
(laughs)
Shall we?

809
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,675
Yea.

810
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,400
Why do you look
different?

811
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:52,225
MRS HAGBERG:
I'd like to thank you all
for forty years of memories

812
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,450
here at McKinley

813
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:56,575
and I plan on using my
retirement to finally

814
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
kick my addiction
to painkillers.

815
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:04,325
A reminder that my
episode of Intervention

816
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,850
airs at the end
of June

817
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:10,075
and my Hoarders episode
airs in early August.

818
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,800
Thank you for your support.

819
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:15,825
(applause)

820
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,850
Thank you Mrs. Hagberg

821
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,175
go softly into
that sweet night.

822
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,200
+++++

823
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:27,535
FIGGINS:
And now the award you've all

824
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:28,837
been waiting for:

825
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,571
Teacher of the Year.

826
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:32,740
To announce the winner,
please welcome to the stage

827
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:34,843
so-called Finchel.

828
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,744
(applause, whooping)

829
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:43,918
FINN:
Hi.

830
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:48,973
The 2012 William
McKinley High School

831
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,775
Teacher of the Year Award
goes to...

832
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:55,280
Mr. Will Schuester!

833
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:57,315
Yeah!
(cheering)

834
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,770
Way to go, buddy.

835
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,993
Wait, just, uh...

836
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,045
before you come up
to accept the award,

837
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,081
we just wanted
to say a few things.

838
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:14,966
Uh...

839
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,671
Three years ago,
I thought I had it all.

840
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,839
I was the quarterback of
the football team,

841
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,892
I was dating
the head cheerleader.

842
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,927
And then I met you, Mr. Shue,

843
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:27,478
and I realized
everything I was missing.

844
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:31,566
There's a lot of great teachers
at this school,

845
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,935
who teach their students
a lot of important stuff,

846
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:35,353
like how to drive
and-and fractions...

847
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:43,328
...but you teach your students
how to dream.

848
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:44,645
As far as I'm concerned,

849
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:46,030
there's nothing more
important than that.

850
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:54,722
Mr. Shue...

851
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,224
when I first met you,

852
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:57,892
I was just an
annoying Jewish girl

853
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,727
with two gay dads
and a very big dream.

854
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,247
Today...

855
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:04,933
I still have two dads,
and I'm still Jewish,

856
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,136
and I'm probably
just as annoying, but...

857
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:11,723
I stand before you
headed to New York City

858
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,174
come hell or high water

859
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,476
and, um, I can honestly say

860
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,145
that I couldn't have
done it without you,

861
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:21,515
and I will carry you
every step of the way, so...

862
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,284
Congratulations.

863
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,702
Um... no one deserves this
more than you.

864
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:27,188
We love you and...

865
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:29,290
(sniffles):
this is for you.

866
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:35,213
(applause)

867
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,968
