NARRATOR: Long before the age

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,206
an evil force, The Forbidden Arts,

5
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,794
came to Earth from the underworld
through a magical crystal.

The crystal was his earthly domain

his strength and power.

of a Glowing Stone

18
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:44,062
and warned the good creatures of the
Earth to keep it safely hidden,

19
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,607
for the stone would give evil
the power to withstand

greater than his own,

(LAUGHING) Yes! Yes!

he drew the sorcerer to him

and promised him power untold if he
would destroy the Swan Princess.

But Princess Odette

proved too strong for Rothbart.

The Forbidden Arts remained
tortured by this truth.

487
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,953
Oh!

488
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,916
Frosting the snowman.

489
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:09,631
No one touches the Queen,
you heinous hamsters!

490
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,259
You put me down!
How dare you?

491
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:22,518
(CHUCKLES)

492
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,943
Take her to
the village! Go!

493
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:36,407
I will wait beyond your traps,
just in case you fail again.

494
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,578
Well, go on now, use him
as a battering ram!

495
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,247
But the door's unlocked.

496
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,083
Well, it's no fun just waltzing in.

497
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,511
Hmph.

498
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,432
Hey, half-pint!

499
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,230
What are those things?

500
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,690
Where'd they come from?

501
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,275
What they want?

502
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,194
Never mind that!
Where are we?

503
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,614
This is the castle cellar, Uberta.

504
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,367
You mean, when I say,
"Take it to the cellar!"

505
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,203
This is what I'm talking about?

506
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,497
Yes.

507
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,623
Ooh!

508
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,209
This simply will not do!

509
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,254
Hello? Furry person in charge?

510
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:36,759
Remove me from this place!
I can taste the air down here!

511
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,762
Right. But I don't
really get the point,

512
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,099
because in the morning,
we're just gonna fling ya.

513
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,350
Fling me?

514
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:49,314
That's right. For giving aid and
shelter to the Swan Princess!

515
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,898
(THUMPING)
Did you hear that?

516
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,742
You will fling the Queen
over my dead body!

517
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,494
You'll have to go first then.

518
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,582
Well, actually, it was just
a figure of speech, really.

519
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,503
I refuse to be flung!
I just spent three hours on this hairdo!

520
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:16,215
Well, I'm afraid the only
way to avoid it is to

521
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,302
"Deny your allegiance to
the evil Swan Princess."

522
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:25,308
Evil? I will never deny the honest
and pure-hearted Swan Princess.

523
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,186
Right. So, tomorrow,
we'll have your trial,

524
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,688
it's more of a formality, really,

525
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,857
with a flinging to
follow directly after.

526
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:33,983
(ALL GASP)

527
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:36,861
And if you could wear
something light and simple,

528
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:40,782
so we can really get
some good distance on ya.

529
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,954
You monster!
There's mold down here!

530
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,791
ROGERS: Never fear, my noble Queen!

531
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:53,127
Lord Rogers, Esquire,
shall defend you!

532
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,879
Thank you, Rogers.

533
00:36:54,963 --> 00:37:00,301
And when we win, we're going after
the guy who built this cellar next.

534
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,313
Odette!

535
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,746
Be careful.
There are traps.

536
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,914
Okay.

537
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:49,976
Odette!

538
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,352
I see it.

539
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,239
They're the real deal.

540
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,997
Fools! They failed again!

541
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,127
(GASPS) Watch out!

542
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,677
Derek.

543
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,387
(RUSTLING)

544
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,222
The Swan Princess.

545
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,724
Who...
Shh...

546
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:36,481
(GRUNTS)

547
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,859
What?

548
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,657
But I'm sure I hit the Prince!

549
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,659
Well, she must've gone on alone.

550
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,119
I'm going back to the village!

551
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:53,414
Find him!
He couldn't have gone far.

552
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,377
I can't let her rescue the girl.

553
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,965
Who... What are you?

554
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,510
Oh, my gosh, I'm a little nervous.

555
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,095
Okay, now those are
two questions I intend

556
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,640
to answer with absolute
clarity, Princess.

557
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,600
But first, if you'll step aside,

558
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,977
I've just a few seconds
to save your husband's life.

559
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,062
What?

560
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,859
A robust poison, indeed!

561
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,027
Poison?

562
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,904
These guys know what
they're working with,

563
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,241
but they don't know who
they're dealing with. Me!

564
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,993
Okay, now, to your
first question, Princess.

565
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,872
I am a scullion. Order, Rodentia.
Family, Sciuridae or squirrel.

566
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:39,418
Subfamily, Pteromyinae, or as we say
in the business, flying squirrel!

567
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,128
Please?

568
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,713
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Back to work.

569
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,509
However, we are a very,
very rare genus and species.

570
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,302
And I'll tell you
one thing we can do,

571
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,230
right here, right now,
and that's save lives.

572
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,059
In record time, I might add.

573
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,478
Look at that.
Look at those cheeks.

574
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,523
Okay, I think it's coming back,
I think he's going to be okay.

575
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,733
Thank you.

576
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,944
Now, as to your second question.

577
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,613
I am your loyal servant,

578
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:09,323
Bortan Gali Gali
Gumwatt Sumwatt Bing!

579
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,994
I'll just call you Scully,
if you don't mind.

580
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,497
Scully!
(LAUGHS) I see.

581
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,000
You're very charming, Majesty.

582
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,043
Thank you.
That's brilliant.

583
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,254
Your friends are trying to kill us!

584
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,715
Friends? Those are not friends.

585
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,884
I haven't spoken to
another scullion in years.

586
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,094
I was banished.

587
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,345
Banished?

588
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,098
Yes. It's your fault, actually.

589
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,100
I'll tell you all about
it, if you want me to.

590
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,103
There's no time, Scully.
They've kidnapped Alise.

591
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,354
Who's that, your daughter?

592
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,273
Hopefully someday, yes.

593
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,358
You won't be fighting
just the scullions

594
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,485
to get her back,
I can promise you that.

595
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,614
You'll be fighting
The Forbidden Arts, as well.

596
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:50,865
What?

597
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,411
If you succeeded, then
where are their bodies?

598
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,957
It's only a matter of time
before we find them, Master!

599
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,877
I want proof now.

600
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,590
You brought her here?

601
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:11,093
As proof that the plan worked.

602
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:15,931
She must never leave this place.

603
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:20,728
(SCREAMS)

604
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:31,447
Now, go back to the forest, find their
bodies and bring them back to me.

605
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:43,250
Mangler has been promised
your kingdom if...

606
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,169
If he would...

607
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,088
Yeah. And that other chap,
what's-his-name,

608
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,048
had been promised
the exact same thing.

609
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,510
You know who I'm talking about.
Rottweiler, Rothlisberger...

610
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,595
Rothbart.
That's the one.

611
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,055
Derek!

612
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:02,228
So, we're up against
The Forbidden Arts again.

613
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,813
I don't know how to tell you this.

614
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:07,775
There's no rescuing Alise.
It's impossible.

615
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:12,488
I made her a promise,
Scully, and I will keep it.

616
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,615
Well, of course, I mean impossible

617
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,701
for a non-Swan Princess person.

618
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,537
But for you, only next
to impossible. But still!

619
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:20,830
Say, "Ah!"

620
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:25,000
Ah... I'll find her.
Just show me the way to your village.

621
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,128
Getting you into my village

622
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,881
would be a little like pushing an
elephant through a keyhole, I'm afraid.

623
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,301
No. No, that would...
How are you feeling? You dizzy?

624
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,636
Sleepy.

625
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:41,058
That's it! A sleeping potion!
That's how we'll do it!

626
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,560
Do what?

627
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:45,855
Squeeze you through the keyhole.
(DISTANT SHOUTING)

628
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,151
Charge!

629
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:58,117
That's it, boys! Hold him
down for interrogation.

630
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,494
(SHOUTING)

631
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,747
Hurt you so bad!

632
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,165
ODETTE: Are you guys all right?

633
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,583
Friends of yours, Princess?

634
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,668
This is Puffin and Speed.

635
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:11,964
I'm sorry. So embarrassed.
Under my fur, I'm blushing.

636
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,591
A secret tunnel?

637
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:15,259
Well, yeah, at least I thought so.

638
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:18,846
Fortune smiles!

639
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,434
No. Ze name is Jean-Bob.
And zis is a frown.

640
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,896
The potion I'm about to make
calls for frogs' eyes!

641
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,734
No, no. Jean-Bob is
also a friend of mine.

642
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,903
A thousand apologies.

643
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,863
You can come down,
Jean-Bob.

644
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:40,701
No way. He's still got zat look
in his eyes about my eyes.

Where have I...

653
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,822
It's right on the tip of
the tongue of my brain.

654
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,032
It rings a bell of
some kind deep inside...

655
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,326
I'll tell you this much.
It's definitely got

656
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:24,411
something to do with the legend.

00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,416
I don't know.

660
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,627
All I did was touch this image.

661
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,672
But I've run my paws over
this image a dozen times!

Maybe two to 12...
Let's just say a lot.

663
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,514
It responds to Odette's touch
because she's the Swan Princess.

664
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,141
Of course. That's it.
Why didn't I...

665
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,185
You really believe that I...

Okay, she's special!

00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,943

don't touch ze button

I'm afraid that frosty, freaky feeling
