Yes, I had plenty of time.

how becoming this outfit was.

when I first
went out with you.

I was still living
home with Mama.

I used to sleep
in the same bed with her,

and once,
in the middle of the night,

I woke up kissing her.

1572
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:22,865
And she woke up and said,
"This ain't Nick."

Oh, God.

I remember that first time
in Baltimore,

1596
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:18,856
when I went up
to your hotel room.

And I went
into your bathroom.

1598
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:30,951
Jesus. You
had seven toothbrushes.

1599
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:36,582
Seven. I guess one
for every day in the week.

1600
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:41,336
And you had this big wooden bowl with soap in it.

1601
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:48,051
"By appointment to His Majesty,"
it says on the bowl.

Phew. Royal soap.

were these silk pajamas,

I was all over the place.

Because I fell in love
with those toothbrushes.

You haven't seen her
in six years.

And you don't even think to ask about her.
You ask about Mama, Mr. Rose.

I don't need the money.

1809
02:12:07,836 --> 02:12:11,756
Well, maybe not,
but you need me.

1810
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,759
You?
You I've had.

1811
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:21,182
If you gotta get personal it's gonna
be a little south of complimentary,

1812
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:24,185
but professionally,
I only helped you.

1813
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:27,855
In the work department,
I was good for you, a good lift.

1814
02:12:29,524 --> 02:12:33,110
Come on. Let's
get together again, huh?

1815
02:12:35,697 --> 02:12:39,492
You know something?
My timing was always off for us.

1816
02:12:39,576 --> 02:12:42,787
It's too bad, really.
I just...

1817
02:12:42,871 --> 02:12:45,581
loused it all up.

1818
02:12:45,666 --> 02:12:49,043
Don't get such a swelled head.
I mean, you don't get all the credit.

1819
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:55,299
What do you say? "Billy Rose presents Fanny Brice."
I don't like the billing.

1820
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:57,593
All right.
I'll‒ I'll think it over and I'll call you.

1821
02:12:57,678 --> 02:13:01,722
You'll think it over?
That's what you're sayin'? "I'll think it over"?

1822
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:05,059
Billy, I haven't done anything
without thinking in over ten years.

1823
02:13:07,145 --> 02:13:12,566
You wanna know the truth?
I was rattled as hell, you comin' here tonight.

1824
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:19,407
I think what I wanted was for you to
come in here beggin' me to come back...

1825
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:23,744
so I could have the pleasure of sayin' no.

1826
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:27,164
It's taken me a long time
to learn how to say no.

1827
02:13:27,249 --> 02:13:30,793
I wanted a chance to practice.
That's what you're sayin' to me, no?

1828
02:13:30,877 --> 02:13:35,548
To me you're saying no? No.
I'm saying I'll think it over and call you.

1829
02:13:35,632 --> 02:13:38,843
Think fast. I don't wanna think fast.
That's the whole point.

1830
02:13:38,927 --> 02:13:41,679
No, the point is I'm at the Beverly Hills till noon,
day after tomorrow.

1831
02:13:41,763 --> 02:13:43,931
So yes or no,
no or yes, yes or no?

1832
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:47,685
So I'll call you before noon day after tomorrow,
yes or no, no or yes, yes or no.

1835
02:14:05,078 --> 02:14:08,956
Make it yes. Rose and Brice.
Brice and Rose.

1836
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:11,917
Rose and Brice.
Whatever.

1837
02:14:12,002 --> 02:14:16,380
We could
have a terrific time.

1838
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:31,604
Make it yes, huh, Fanny?
