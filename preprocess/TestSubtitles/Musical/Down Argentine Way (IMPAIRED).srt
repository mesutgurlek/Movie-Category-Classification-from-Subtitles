Here are the prices
I wish you to get for the horses, my son.

16
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,704
Wishing is one thing, but what will you take?

17
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:36,754
- When you win an event, double the price.
- If I lose, should I cut it in half?

18
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:39,554
<i>If you lose, muchacho, cut yourself in half.</i>

19

Ricardo, have the same success you had at
the London horse show and I'll be very happy.

22
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:54,748
You see, I did not open it.

<i>- ¿Me llamó usted, señor?
- Unload the horses.</i>

26

Unload the horses?

27
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,232
<i>Sí. Unload the horses.
Get every one of them off the ship.</i>

28
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:28,354
<i>Sí, señor.
Enseguida, que bajen los caballos pronto.</i>

29
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:32,189
- Why do you change your plans, Papa?
- That cable.

30
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,314
The woman is interested in buying
some horses. Why is that so terrible?

31
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:42,391
I would rather kill every one of my horses
than have that woman get hold of them.

32
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,266
Why, is she as bad as that?

33
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:50,143
I do not know her, but her brother,
Willis Crawford, is a scoundrel.

34
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:54,626
We were at school together in Paris.
I trusted him and he cheated me.

35
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:58,025
Well, tell me what he did to you
and then we can hate him together.

36
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:01,107
I do not consider this
a matter for joking, Ricardo.

37
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:06,508
Papa, why do you change your plans because
of somebody you have not seen for years?

38
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:10,383
If he or his sister attempts to buy
any of the horses, I won't sell to them.

39
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,864
- Perhaps you are right.
- Why, certainly.

40
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:16,789
- And the passage is paid for?
- Why, yes.

41
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,712
Esteban.

42
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:24,424
<i>- Esteban!
- Sí, señor.</i>

43
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,064
Esteban, I have changed my mind.

44
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:30,385
Load the horses.

45
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:32,306
Lo-lo-load the horses?

46
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,034
<i>Sí, load the horses.</i>

47
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,505
<i>Suban los caballos pronto.
Suban los caballos, aprisa.</i>

48
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,631
<i>Suban los caballos, pronto.</i>

49
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,309
<i>Pronto, suban los caballos.</i>

<i>(fanfare)</i>

51
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:43,432
What are you doing here?
You have to get ready for your event.

52
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:46,109
I have plenty of time, Dad.
I had to see this event.

53
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:51,110
<i>Carmelita, you show off for all the judges.
¡Vamos!</i>

54
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,867
- Wonderful, isn't he?
- Do you mean the man or the beast?

55
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:09,305
- Beautiful.
- You're not thinking of buying that animal?

56
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,114
Of course not.
What would I do with him? I have 12.

57
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:14,868
That's what you said when you had 11.

58
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:35,505
Señor, that's the most
beautiful jumping I've seen all year.

59
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,506
<i>Muchas gracias, señorita.</i>

60
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,984
Carmelita is a great horse.

61
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:43,784
- I don't suppose she's for sale?
- Oh, yes. That is exactly what she is.

62
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:48,266
Oh, she's really something.
I don't see how you can sell her.

63
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:53,110
That is the trouble with breeding - you keep
getting more horses, and some you must sell.

64
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,548
What are you asking?

65
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:57,832
She was 10,000 before she won,
but now she's 20.

66
00:07:57,832 --> 00:08:00,031
I'll give you five.

67
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:05,826
It would give me great pleasure for you
to have the horse, but that is impossible.

68
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:08,224
- Shall we say 15?
- Five.

69
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:12,354
Oh, señorita... I have it.

70
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:16,826
In as much as you were interested in her
before her victory, you can have her for ten.

71
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:19,110
Five. This is your last chance.

72
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,270
Well, you... you drive a hard bargain, señorita,
but if you will have dinner with me...

73
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,710
I have an engagement at the Westchester.

74
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,344
- A martini before dinner?
- Fine. Nine o'clock at the Westchester.

75
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,586
- All right. Good luck, señorita.
- Thank you.

76
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:39,066
<i>Muy bien, Carmelita. Muy bien.
Te portaste como nunca.</i>

77
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:42,306
Now, señor, you can sell her for a fortune.

78
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:46,513
I have already sold her, Esteban, for $5,000...

79
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,109
and a martini.

Glenda said it would only take a minute.
What sort of a deal is this?

Write to your Congressman.
It comes under international relations.

Aren't you getting into rather deep water?

Why should I deny it?
I'm in over my head already.

your remarkable eyes,

152
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,912
I knew that I was lost.

153
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:23,793
I've flown over the high mountains,

154
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:27,834
I've gone down narrow rapids,
I've even loved other women,

155
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:32,864
but never have I been so dizzy,
so-so helpless as I am at this very moment.

156
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:36,148
It is like a sudden storm over the pampas.

157
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:40,592
You think you can run. Before you know it,
it is upon you, sweeping you off your feet,

158
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:43,906
and your heart,
your heart is beating like the storm.

159
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:48,273
It may frighten you,
but it is too wonderful to miss.

160
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:51,153
I'm not frightened. Not a bit.

161
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:58,624
Isn't that horse sold yet? Well, well. Just
an old South American custom, I presume?

162
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:01,354
Hello, Binnie. This is...

163
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,312
Ricardo Quintana.

164
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:05,590
This is my aunt, Binnie Crawford.

165
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,428
Crawford? You are Binnie Crawford?

166
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:11,029
Yes. I cabled you about buying some horses.

167
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,471
I wanted to start a stable,
but my riding teacher got married.

168
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:17,786
Besides, I got an archery set
for my birthday. I was 32 last month.

169
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,628
She's your aunt on your mother's side, no?

170
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,512
No, on my father's side.

171
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:25,029
Oh, then you are also a Crawford?

172
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,664
Yes. Glenda Crawford.
Evidently you don't care for it.

173
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:34,671
Yes, I do. I like Glenda very much. For the last
name I would have preferred something else.

174
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,905
- Have you ordered?
- I'll have a martini.

175
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:38,906
- A sirocco for me.
- What is that?

176
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:42,351
- Straight brandy with a cherry.
- I'll have that with no cherry.

177
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:46,428
I'll have the cherry. It doesn't matter,
but Jimmy's about to blow a gasket.

178
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,791
I'll go in. If you have a bill of sale,
I'll give you a cheque.

179
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,106
Oh, yes, of course, the bill of sale.

180
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:58,633
I-I do not know quite how to say this,
but it is something that must be said.

181
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:02,503
Perhaps after we have the drink.
Shall we sit down?

182
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,745
You're not backing out on our bargain?

183
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:10,269
I am desolate, señorita, but it is impossible
for me to sell you Carmelita.

184
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,349
- I suppose someone offered more money?
- Oh, no. No, it is not that, I assure you.

185
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,905
I could not sell you the horse
for any amount of money.

186
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:23,591
Just this evening I found out that my father
had already made a previous commitment.

187
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,508
But I bought the horse.
We made a deal. We agreed on it.

188
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:30,952
I should have told you a long time ago,
I know, but I did not know how to say it.

189
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:35,267
So that's what you've been building up to.
Well, I won't let it ruin my life.

190
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:38,984
Oh, no, we must not
let it ruin anything, señorita.

191
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:43,227
- We must have this last dance together, no?
- No, no. Jimmy's waiting for me.

192
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:46,546
He always keeps his engagements, señor.

193
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,347
- Have you ever tried a blackout?
- What is that?

194
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:53,471
Straight gin with a green olive.

195
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,752
<i>I will get one right away.
Con su permiso.</i>

196
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,433
I love cherries.

197
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,428
# Two dreams met

198
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:08,985
# They knew of two hearts that were lonely

199
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,906
# That could be so happy

200
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:16,433
# If only they found romance

201
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:19,268
# Two dreams met

202
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:23,151
# They said we must go out and find them

203
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:26,352
# And then as we tiptoe behind them

204
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:30,314
- I'd like to dance with you, señor.
- You are very kind, señorita.

205
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:33,148
I'm just mad about that horse of yours.

206
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:35,703
Thank you too much.

207
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:40,630
# "Turn around," my dream kept saying

208
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,593
# I did, and you were there, then

209
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:48,950
Next month we're going up Mount Rainier
with nothing but mules.

210
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:56,105
I said next month we were going up
to Mount Rainier on mules.

211
00:17:56,105 --> 00:18:00,347
- Well, what do you think of that?
- Hm? Oh, not this week, Jimmy.

212
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,546
Señorita.

213
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:13,868
<i>- It is time for me to leave, so I will say adiós.
- Goodbye.</i>

214
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:17,791
I hope we'll be meeting again sometime soon.

215
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,073
<i>Perdóneme, señorita.
Adiós. Adiós.</i>

216
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:28,391
Congratulate me, my dear. I just bought
Carmelita the champion Argentine jumper.

217
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:31,184
You bought her?

218
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:35,109
Yes. Considering your interest in the owner,
it's a wonder you didn't.

219
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:38,153
- How could I? You had a commitment.
- Commitment?

220
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:44,344
I didn't have any commitment.
I offered him 5,000 just now and he took it.

221
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:48,314
Well, that's what I offered him.
Why would he do that?

222
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:50,955
Perhaps it was my dancing, darling.

223
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,984
Shall we sit this one out?

224
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:58,112
"Your eyes. Your remarkable eyes."

225
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:03,223
If he ever looks into my eyes again,
he'll really see a storm over the pampas.

226
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:06,705
- What bit her?
- I don't know. Something about the pampas.

227
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:09,707
Oh, well, cheer up, Jimmy.
The pampas is a long way away.

228
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:12,548
If I'm not mistaken,
you were about to ask me to dance.

229
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:15,149
You were mistaken.

230
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:17,385
I was mistaken.

231
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:19,510
I was mistaken.

232
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,155
# For two lonely hearts were one

233
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,954
# Do-do-do, do-do-do-do

234
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:29,506
# When two dreams met

235
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:33,786
We'll sell this one. Sell Apprentice too.

236
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:39,307
We'll keep this mare. Tendon's a little sore.
Better put a blister on her.

237
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:42,865
- Yes. I'd like to turn her out till spring.
- Yes, do that.

238
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,185
I want to keep Vain Belle,

239
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,505
and Lady Bosun.

240
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:50,393
- Morning, Aunt Binnie.
- Morning, Miss Crawford.

241
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:52,386
- Sell all the rest.
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:56,991
Why are you unhorsing yourself? You'll have
a lot of saddles and nothing to put them on.

243
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,669
- Oh, I'm fed up.
- Fed up?

244
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,985
You're fed up? Hm.

245
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:06,068
I'm gonna get rid of everything
but the mares and bring in some new blood.

246
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:09,625
Maybe I'll go to Ireland
and get some hunters for a change.

247
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,706
Or I...

248
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:14,184
I might get some racehorses.

249
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:18,712
I may even go to Kentucky
or I may even go out to California.

250
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:22,504
Ireland, Kentucky, California?
Why don't you come out with it?

251
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,631
When do we leave for South America?

252
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:28,913
What's wrong with that? They have
wonderful horses in South America.

253
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:32,192
Wonderful horses, and wonderful men.

254
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:36,427
I'd trust the men about as far
as you could throw the horses.

255
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:39,791
- Are we going by boat?
- No. There's a plane leaving tonight.

256
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,991
I thought we might take that.

257
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:47,110
I bet we do, and with a good, strong tailwind,
I suppose you'll get there as soon as he does.

258
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,993
Get in, you beautiful brat.

259
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,912
South America, here we come.

260
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:19,624
<i>- Señorita Crawford?
- Oui, oui. I mean, sí, sí.</i>

261
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:26,065
I was Señor Montero. I have the honour
to general manage for your brother

262
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:28,111
his piston rings in South America.

263
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:31,744
I would wish you to want to know
my sales manager, Señor Rufino.

264
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:35,908
I'm so very much delightful to meet you.
My assistant, Señor Valerga.

265
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,872
The pleasure, she's all mine.

266
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:40,708
How do you do.
My niece, Miss Glenda Crawford.

267
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,513
How do you do.

268
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:45,507
We wish you to welcome us in Buenos Aires,

269
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:51,227
so that any little service we can be to you,
all you have to do is lift your little finger.

270
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,704
- That's good of you.
- No, it is good of you.

271
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:56,309
- It's very good of you.
- No, it's good of you.

272
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,193
Oh, why don't you toss for it?

273
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,224
For your connivance while you are here,

274
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:06,705
we have provide
the automobile and the chauffeur,

275
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:10,310
equipped, of course,
with Crawford's piston rings.

276
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,786
And now, if we will come with you,
you can escort me to the hotel.

277
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:18,106
- Us will be glad to.
- Thank you very much.

278
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:24,584
The inside is open.

279
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,631
Anastasio.

280
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,512
Anastasio!

281
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:42,792
<i>Che, dormilón.
Al Hotel Rosedal.</i>

282
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,070
Go! Go! Go!

283
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:50,708
Oh, this is completely incidental,
I can insure you.

284
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,786
Thank me very much.

285
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,754
Oh, I... I will never forgive yourself.

286
00:23:07,675 --> 00:23:10,553
Miss Crawford, welcome to Buenos Aires.

287
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:13,672
I'm Dr Padilla,
your father's friend from the embassy.

288
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:17,270
I wish to take you and your aunt
to dinner and to a concert.

289
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,314
Oh, that's very nice of you.
Just a moment. I'll ask her.

290
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:25,513
It's Dad's ambassador friend.
He'd like to take us to dinner and a concert.

291
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:30,874
I wouldn't go if Beethoven was playing "The
Woodpecker Song". I'll sleep for two days.

292
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:33,833
Well, I'm not.
I didn't come 6,000 miles to go to bed.

293
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:40,388
Hello? My aunt won't be able to go.
She's rather infirm, you know? But I'd love to.

294
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:44,434
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You make me very happy. Yeah.

295
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:49,145
<i>- Snice girl. Get two tickets for the concierto.
- (woman) For the contesto?</i>

296
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:51,146
<i>- No. Concert.
- Por la corrida?</i>

297
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,624
<i>- No. Please! Concert!
- Consommé?</i>

298
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:56,024

I was 31 my last birthday, Your Excellency.

I'm... I'm very sorry, señorita,
that you could not have had Carmelita.

449
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:54,430
Oh, please don't worry about it.
Helen was so thrilled.

450
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,349
It would have pleased me very much more
if you could have had the horse.

451
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:02,553
You couldn't help it. Your father made a
commitment. Besides, Helen's my friend.

452
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:07,755
You are very generous, señorita.
Many people would not be so understanding.

453
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:10,508
- Thank you.
- What shall I order for you?

454
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:13,667
Not a thing. I've had a little
too much champagne already.

455
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:17,543
Oh, that's wonderful.
I have had too much brandy.

456
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:21,230
- Tell me, is your aunt with you?
- What did you say?

457
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,670
I was asking about your aunt.
Is she with you?

458
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,394
- Yes, but she's back at the hotel.
- Oh, good.

459
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:29,626
I mean, I hope she is getting a good rest.

460
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:34,507
If the orchestra is trying to make
conversation difficult, they are successes.

461
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:38,664
- Don't they have verandas in Buenos Aires?
- No.

462
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:41,189
But they have balconies.

463
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:43,789
<i>(orchestra plays "Mamae Eu Quero")</i>

464
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:51,670
Sebastián, what are they up to?

465
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,873
With me it is not guesswork.
I know where the stairway leads.

466
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,832
<i>(Glenda gasps)</i>

467
00:41:57,832 --> 00:42:00,475
This is lovely.

468
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:05,834
- Do you come here often?
- No. A friend of mine told me about this.

469
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:13,233
This is just like the Westchester, no?

470
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:17,354
- Except that Binnie won't interrupt us.
- And I do not have to catch a plane.

471
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:20,347
And there's no
misunderstanding about a horse.

472
00:42:20,347 --> 00:42:23,472
If I did not know that you had
come down here to buy horses,

473
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:26,433
I would be hoping
that you had come down here to see me.

474
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:28,028
Perhaps I did.

475
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:34,748
You said it was like a sudden storm,
but it didn't really hit me until after you left.

476
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:37,474
You have thought of me, Ricardo?

477
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:40,149
<i>Oh, sí, querida.</i>

478
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:45,389
You have been with me
in my mind every waking moment,

479
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,909
and at night I have adored you in my dreams.

480
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:52,193
But if I hadn't come down here,
we never would have seen each other again.

481
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:54,186
It had to happen.

482
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:58,393
If we'd not met like this,
I would have found you some way.

483
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,591
Nothing could have stopped us.

484
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:03,747
You said it was too wonderful to miss,
didn't you, Ricardo?

485
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,508
<i>Sí, mi vida, sí.</i>

486
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:09,870
- Well, I didn't.
- Why did you do this to me?

487
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,311
- That's what I came down here to do.
- Wait! Explain yourself.

488
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,625
Shh. Carmen Miranda.

489
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:34,714
Your client has been away for a long time.
You don't think she has left?

490
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:38,185
I have absolutely not a worry.
Her credit is phenomenal.

491
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:42,507
Every time you see an automobile,
it has a piston ring of her father's inside it.

492
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:46,144
<i>- Tomad la adición.
- Oh.</i>

493
00:43:48,235 --> 00:43:51,193
- Anastasio.
- Anastasio.

494
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:53,664
Take me to the hotel.

495
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:09,987
There he is! Surround him.
Be careful. He may be armed.

496
00:44:09,987 --> 00:44:13,863
- What have you done with my niece?
- How dare you, señor?

497
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:18,267
Do you not know it is a serious offence
to impersonate an official?

498
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:22,985
I have impersonated nobody but myself. I'm
Tito Acuña, the best guide in Buenos Aires,

499
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:26,954
and tonight was purely business,
although I haven't been paid.

500
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:29,549
- Then where is Señorita Crawford?
- I lost her.

501
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:33,071
The young lady, I heard her
tell the driver to go back to the hotel.

502
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:35,749
Just the same,
I do not believe this man's story.

503
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:39,748
I've taken thousands of women out
and never have I had a single complaint.

504
00:44:39,748 --> 00:44:41,393
Really?

505
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:47,866
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind, Your Excellency.

506
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,666
<i>(whines)</i>

Don Diego!

509
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:14,945
Tourists outside want to buy horses.

510

<i>¡María, mate para Casiano!</i>

511
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:22,505

- Hm... the man... nothing.

512
00:45:22,505 --> 00:45:26,668
<i>But the señora,
or maybe señorita, is Americana.</i>

513
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:29,667
Ah, in that case,
perhaps she can afford to buy.

514
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:33,748
They got girl with them.
She want to see baby horses in the paddock.

515
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:35,985
- I told her all right.
- A young girl?

516
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:40,591
Well, Ricardo, my eyes don't see so good
like they did long time ago,

517
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:45,908
but she is young, beautiful like a flower.

518
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:48,190
That much I see.

519
00:45:48,835 --> 00:45:51,065
Excuse me, Papa.

520
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:53,066
<i>- Sit down, Casiano.
- Gracias.</i>

521
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:57,230
Him -just like his father, eh?

522
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:12,468
That old groucho said
he was getting a Don Diego.

523
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:16,025
- Where do you suppose they keep him?
- Wherever it was...

524
00:46:16,025 --> 00:46:18,071
Ah, he has been found already.

525
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:22,866
Panchito, where are you taking Furioso?

526
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,515
No place, señor. I take him back to the stable.

527
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:28,632
Wait a minute.
I asked you where you were taking the horse.

528
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:30,706
Uh...

529
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,751
What is the matter with you?

530
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:37,545
He got a memory to forget. I told him
to take Furioso to the north pasture.

531
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,433
He no like no more
the grass on the south pasture.

532
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:43,427
<i>- What a magnificent horse.
- Gracias.</i>

533
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:46,473
- Is he for sale?
- Oh, no, no, señora.

534
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:49,547
There is not enough money
in all North America to buy him.

535
00:46:49,547 --> 00:46:53,230
This is Furioso,
the finestjumper in the Argentine.

536
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:59,307
For last three year - three - he win every
blue ribbon at horse show in Buenos Aires.

537
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:03,354
- He'll win another one in two weeks.
- Go about your business, Panchito.

538
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:07,792
Go with him, otherwise the boy may forget
and turn himself out to graze.

539
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,469
<i>Vamos, muchacho.</i>

540
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:21,551
Well, señora,
what kind of horses did you wish to buy?

541
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:24,991
The four-legged kind.
My name is Binnie Crawford and...

542
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:27,589
- Crawford?
- That's right, Crawford.

543
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:31,634
You will please me very much, señora,
if you leave my property at once.

544
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,145
I only asked to buy horses.

545
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:37,307
I sell no horses to Crawfords. Go, señora.

546
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:41,832
Tito, are you gonna
let that goat talk to me this way?

547
00:47:41,832 --> 00:47:43,951
Señor...

548
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:47,912
Señorita, I think it is too late.
He said it already.

549
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:52,352
You will go this instant, señora,
or I will have you put out.

550
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:54,346
I'll go all right.

551
00:47:57,395 --> 00:48:01,024
I wouldn't stay
if you threw a barbecue in my honour.

552
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,551
<i>(horn beeps)</i>

<i>(Binnie) Ye Gods! What next?</i>

554
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:31,152
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

555
00:48:31,152 --> 00:48:35,945
Well, stay away from that house. There's a
madman there. He just threw me off the place.

556
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:39,152
You refer to my father.
You must have told him your name.

557
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:41,954
Yes, I did. And I added a few under my breath.

558
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:46,825
Well, I apologise for him. About some
subjects he's a little strong-headed,

559
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:48,906
but he's very nice when you know him.

560
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:52,586
Until you get acquainted
you'd do well to have a hatchet.

561
00:48:52,586 --> 00:48:55,109
Get in, Glenda. I've had enough.

562
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:58,904
No. I have asked Señorita Glenda
to ride back to the city with me.

563
00:48:58,904 --> 00:49:04,991
All right. You can take chances with your life
if you want to, but I'm much too young.

564
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:17,067
<i>(horn beeps)</i>

565
00:49:17,595 --> 00:49:20,667
- Well, shall we go and get the car?
- What about your father?

566
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:26,113
Oh, I promise you, he will not attack without
warning. We Quintanas are sportsmen.

567
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:28,834
What's over there?

568
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:31,304
Oh. Come. I'll show you.

569
00:49:33,955 --> 00:49:36,753
All our favourite horses are buried here.

570
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:41,909
This big stone is on the grave of Tempestad.
He won the Palermo handicap three times.

571
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:47,467
All told, he won 48 races,
until he died in 1925.

572
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:51,707
- He was the greatest horse my father had.
- I didn't realise you had racehorses.

573
00:49:51,707 --> 00:49:57,472
Oh, yes. We did at one time.
But now we have not raced for 15 years.

574
00:49:57,472 --> 00:50:00,467
Tempestad was cut down
and killed on the track.

575
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:03,194
My father has refused to race since that day.

576
00:50:03,194 --> 00:50:06,950
It isn't fair to condemn the whole sport
because of one accident.

577
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:07,700
No.

578
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:11,430
Oh, here he comes now.

579
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,551
Ricardo.

580
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:17,105
What's the best footpath back to the city?

581
00:50:17,105 --> 00:50:21,473
I have been looking for you, Ricardo.
I have had the most unfortunate experience.

582
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:22,544
What was that?

583
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:26,389
I have just had to put some people
named Crawford off the place.

584
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:30,593
Oh, we saw a car drive away. That is too bad.

585
00:50:30,593 --> 00:50:33,473
The young lady, Ricardo.
I do not believe we have met.

586
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:37,753
<i>Tenéis razón, papá.
This is Señorita Cunningham.</i>

587
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:43,592
We met in New York. Something happened
to her car. I will drive her back to the city.

588
00:50:43,592 --> 00:50:48,430
I am sorry, Señorita Cunningham,
if I seemed abrupt, but I am somewhat upset.

589
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:53,509
- You will be in the Argentine for a little time?
- Well, my plans are a little indefinite.

590
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:56,348
Before you leave,
you must pay us another visit.

591
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:58,187
Thank you very much. I'd love to.

592
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:02,746
<i>Then I shall be expecting
Ricardo to bring you. Adiós.</i>

593
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:09,233
- Well... He-he's nice.
- Then you will accept his invitation?

594
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,751
That was to a Miss Cunningham.
I doubt if he'd want Miss Crawford.

595
00:51:12,751 --> 00:51:14,905
After he gets to like Miss Cunningham,

596
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,829
then he will feel much more
favourably disposed toward Miss Crawford.

597
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:20,826
Of that I am certain.

598
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:23,186
<i>(band plays)</i>

599
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:48,909
- What's going on?
- This is the annual village fiesta.

600
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:52,988
Once each year, the peons get together
and drink and dance...

601
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:55,589
and perhaps make love.

602
00:51:55,589 --> 00:52:00,226
In this little village
you will find the true Argentine.

603
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:07,590
- The true Argentine, huh?
- Ye...

604
00:52:31,075 --> 00:52:34,385
<i>- Sing, señorita.
- (all) Sing, señorita!</i>

605
00:52:40,675 --> 00:52:44,873
# Just sing to your señorita

606
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:47,788
# She'll be sweet to you, señor

607
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:51,426
# Every gaucho and caballero

608
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:54,985
# Should be a true troubadour

609
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:58,385
# Sing to your señorita

610
00:52:58,385 --> 00:53:01,785
# And you never will go wrong

611
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:04,992
# She'll confess to the magic music

612
00:53:04,992 --> 00:53:08,351
# And she'll say yes to a song

613
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:15,352
# Try a serenade to tell her of her charms

614
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:21,624
# And you'll find the words
and music in your arms

615
00:53:21,624 --> 00:53:25,469
# So sing to your señorita

616
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,865
# All your cares won't mean a thing

617
00:53:28,865 --> 00:53:31,992
# She will gladly be your chiquita

618
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:35,704
# So sing to your señorita, sing

619
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:48,273
Hey!

620
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,954
Hey!

621
00:53:50,155 --> 00:53:51,952
Hey!

622
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:13,026
# Try a serenade to tell her of her charms

623
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:19,429
# And you'll find the words
and music in your arms

624
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:23,394
# So sing to your señorita

625
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:26,785
# You'll be happy as can be

626
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:29,673
# If a song brings romance along

627
00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:34,192
# Tell me why, oh, why
won't someone sing to me?

628
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:36,345
# Sing, señorita, sing

629
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,993
- What is it? A fire?
- No, a horse race.

630
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:52,024
Whenever ten or more Argentinians
get together there is always a horse race.

631
00:54:59,315 --> 00:55:01,431
Furioso, I want to tell you something.

632
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:06,270
Remember, this race is only 300 metres, so
you've got no time to stop and eat the grass.

633
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:11,031
Watch the man with the flag. When
you see his fingers move, then you start.

634
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:14,551
Don't show off because
you know you can beat these other horses.

635
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:17,229
Remember I love you.

636
00:55:17,229 --> 00:55:19,112
And I got four to one.

637
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:22,187
<i>(man) Me tiene loca.</i>

638
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:26,348
<i>Mire, mire las patas
y tiene cara de ganar con estas patas.</i>

639
00:55:26,348 --> 00:55:27,834
<i>¡Andan! ¡Andan!</i>

640
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:54,026
- That horse! That is Furioso!
- He's wonderful!

641
00:55:54,026 --> 00:55:56,549
He is our champion jumper.
How is he in this race?

642
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:59,832
I don't know how, but he's certainly in it.

643
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:27,386
<i>- Casiano, te felicito. Casiano, te felicito.
- Sí, sí.</i>

644
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:29,670
<i>Sí, my horse, my horse.</i>

645
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,905
<i>Muy buen caballo. Vamos a tomar algo.</i>

646
00:56:40,475 --> 00:56:44,150
<i>- Ysuerte.
- Gracias, señor. Gracias. Gracias.</i>

647
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,228
Maybe some time you get a horse
with four legs, then we have another race.

648
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:51,352
- No, you won't.
- Ricardo.

649
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:54,507
<i>Please, for the love of soledad
do not give me away.</i>

650
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:58,031
- Casiano, you'd better start explaining.
- I mean to do no harm.

651
00:56:58,031 --> 00:57:02,028
Furioso likes to run a little bit now and then,
and I make a few pesos.

652
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:05,346
But the pesos,
it's to send Panchito to school someday.

653
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:09,428
- You mean that this has happened before?
- Only a couple of times.

654
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:11,983
We win a good race at La Plata by ten lanes.

655
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:14,430
La Plata? You've had him on the racetracks?

656
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:19,270
It was just once. When Don Diego was in Rio,
I paint star on Furioso,

657
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,152
call him American horse.

658
00:57:21,152 --> 00:57:23,112
He paid 25 to one.

659
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:27,074
Casiano, when my father hears
that you have been racing his bestjumper,

660
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:29,225
he'll nail your ears to the stable door.

661
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:34,309
<i>- That other horse wasn't even in it.
- Sí. He only touched the ground two times.</i>

662
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:36,750
He ought to be racing on the flat.

663
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:40,464
'Course he should. He was born for it.
His grandfather was Tempestad.

664
00:57:40,464 --> 00:57:43,388
But to Furioso
I guess that makes little difference.

665
00:57:43,388 --> 00:57:46,308
He's happy. Three meals a day,
other horses for company.

666
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:51,185
No, Ricardo. There you make big mistake.
Furioso want to be a racehorse.

667
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:53,835
I catch him worrying many times about this.

668
00:57:53,835 --> 00:57:57,191
Your papa isn't the same
since he stopped racetrack business.

669
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:01,234
What you say is true. But he would
eat his heart out before he would admit it.

670
00:58:01,234 --> 00:58:05,831
If you can't reason with him, show him.
Train the horse, put him in a race.

671
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:09,385
If he loves the track,
he couldn't resist seeing his silks win.

672
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:12,747
He would skin us
and put us in the trophy case.

673
00:58:13,235 --> 00:58:15,669
I thought the Quintanas were sportsmen.

674
00:58:15,669 --> 00:58:20,590
Señorita, there is only
one possible answer to that.

675
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:25,908
Casiano, day after tomorrow we work the
horse on the racetrack on the north pasture.

676
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:28,350
Ricardo!

677
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:33,748
No. Maybe it's no good. For me, Ricardo, it
don't make much difference. I'm an old man.

678
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:37,748
But for you it's too soon
to die so young by the hand of your father.

679
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:42,113
<i>But then I guess we all die sometime.
¿No es cierto?</i>

680
00:58:54,315 --> 00:58:56,670
1:41. What kind of a breeze was that?

681
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,952
<i>And the boyero,
he was holding him all the time.</i>

682
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:11,984
<i>(Ricardo) 1:40 and two.</i>

683
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:23,669
<i>1:37 and one. (whistles)</i>

684
00:59:32,995 --> 00:59:35,463

Hey, Ricardo! Ricardo!

735
01:03:19,235 --> 01:03:21,795
Furioso, he don't want his dinner.

736
01:03:21,795 --> 01:03:24,992
- What is the matter with him?
- Maybe he's all mixed up.

737
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:27,794
He don't know
if he is racing horse orjumping horse.

738
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:31,754
In the morning he jumps with your papa,
in the afternoon he races for you.

739
01:03:31,754 --> 01:03:34,986
This morning,
he could notjump over the jumping beam.

740
01:03:34,986 --> 01:03:38,954
- He ran all right this afternoon.
- That's it. He knows he should be racing.

741
01:03:38,954 --> 01:03:42,505
But how long he'll know it...
That's no way to train a racing horse -

742
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:45,553
jumping him, running him -
mixing him all up.

743
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:49,423
Soon he'll have nervous breakdown,
then we can do nothing with him.

744
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:53,793
- We should stop jumping him.
- Stop jumping him? But the show is Sunday.

745
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:56,867
- Señorita Cunningham.
- Papa.

746
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,628
Casiano said there is
something wrong with Furioso.

747
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:02,388
He's notjumping
and he would not eat his dinner.

748
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:04,670
Perhaps we should take him out of the show.

749
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:08,828
Take him out? Miss the show
for the first time in years? Oh, no, no, no.

750
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:11,793
He will be all right. He is just a little bit stale.

751
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:13,945
No, he more than stale.

752
01:04:13,945 --> 01:04:18,347
Don Diego, Furioso gives me a look.
I don't like it.

753
01:04:18,347 --> 01:04:21,188
You are getting old, Casiano.
You are seeing things.

754
01:04:21,188 --> 01:04:25,268
Furioso is entered in the show,
and Furioso will be jumping Sunday,

755
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:27,630
and will be taking the ribbon again.

756
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,309
If you'd honour me
with a game of backgammon,

757
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:35,071
we'll leave these two worriers
to worry by themselves.

758
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:39,387
The old man, he's more stubborn
than Furioso. Much more.

759
01:04:46,075 --> 01:04:49,704
<i>(PA) Categoría primera:

<i>propiedad del Teniente Eugenio López.</i>

761
01:05:06,995 --> 01:05:10,624
That is a very good horse.
He is almost as good as Furioso.

762
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:14,185
- A plough horse.
- Oh, be reasonable, Papa.

763
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:17,426
I am the most reasonable man in the world,
and I know horses.

764
01:05:17,426 --> 01:05:22,589
I leave it to Señorita Cunningham if he
comes within a thousand miles of Furioso.

765
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:25,269
Not within 10,000 miles.

766
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:31,187
Don't forget, I bring you up like my own son.

767
01:05:31,187 --> 01:05:34,984
When you were a little baby horse,
who feed you when your mama was sick?

768
01:05:34,984 --> 01:05:38,624
Who sit up all night and rub your stomach
when you got the belly ache?

769
01:05:38,624 --> 01:05:40,910
No, I don't want you to thank me.

770
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:47,025
But, please, Furioso, if you love me,
keep your mind on what you do today, huh?

771
01:05:47,025 --> 01:05:48,787
All right.

772
01:05:48,787 --> 01:05:50,831
Panchito.

773
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:51,551
Go on.

774
01:05:54,715 --> 01:05:59,186
<i>- Glenda, darling, what a surprise.
- Buenas tardes, Señorita Crawford.</i>

775
01:05:59,186 --> 01:06:01,505
Crawford?

776
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:03,711
- Your name is Crawford?
- Yes, but...

777
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:06,309
- Then this is all a trick. You lied to me.
- But...

778
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:10,070
You came to my house, you accepted
my hospitality, and you lied to me.

779
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:13,033
- Blame me for that.
- I do blame you - to foster this,

780
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:14,992
to encourage it behind my back,

781
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:18,112
to bring the daughter
of my worst enemy under my own roof.

782
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:22,507
I wanted you to know and like her. Has she
changed because you know who she is?

783
01:06:22,507 --> 01:06:27,749
Yes. I will not listen to you.
You are no son of your father. And she is...

784
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:30,986
Here, here! Hold your tongue, you old goat.

785
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:36,229
Even though you are a Crawford, you are
a woman, and there is nothing I can do.

786
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:38,704
But I will ask your escort to answer for you.

787
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:42,868
Señor, my presence here
is purely professional.

Oh, Furioso, you're going to pieces.

You're supposed to be jumping.
Jumping! Jump!

793
01:07:15,915 --> 01:07:20,511
What's the matter with your horse?
Does he think he's running a flat race?

794
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:26,626
<i>(laughter)</i>

01:07:33,065 --> 01:07:37,831
- I'm sorry.
- I do not want sympathy, Señorita Crawford.

797
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:43,188
- Papa.
- It's my fault, Ricardo.

798
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:45,266
No. It is mine.

799
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:49,951
We must win the race at San Isidro. It's our
only chance to make this up to your father.

800
01:07:49,951 --> 01:07:53,550
- Furioso is not going to race at San Isidro.
- What?

801
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:56,911
I'm sorry. I do not intend
to go against my father again.

802
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:58,667
But we'll be doing this for him.

803
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,394
The best thing
we can do for him is not to interfere.

804
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:04,148
But we can't leave things
in the mess they're in.

805
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:08,387
- There is no point in making things worse.
- But how can they be worse?

806
01:08:08,387 --> 01:08:13,105
I've already told you it was a mistake
to go against my father in the first place.

807
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:15,993
I'm sorry, Ricardo. You're right.

808
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:18,828
There's no use in making things worse.

We haven't a moment to lose.
You can sleep after I'm gone.

812
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:39,264

Where does it keep coming from?

How nice. Just what I need.

816
01:08:50,863 --> 01:08:53,913
Since the suite will be vacant,
do you mind if show it?

817
01:08:53,913 --> 01:08:56,270
I'm having a rumba lesson. It's awkward.

818
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,984
<i>Gracias. ¿Señor, quiere usted pasar?</i>

819
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:01,986
This is the living room.

820
01:09:01,986 --> 01:09:06,466
You will notice the bay window
with the most beautiful look over the city.

821

- We've been trying to get you on the phone.
- Maybe that's why they said you were not in.

822
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:15,626
It wasn't important. We wanted to tell you
we didn't want anything to do with you.

823
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:19,913
The bedroom is very notable
for its built-in features. You...

824
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:22,953
<i>- Con su permiso.
- Señor.</i>

825
01:09:22,953 --> 01:09:25,754
- This is the bedroom.
- How dare you come in here?

826
01:09:25,754 --> 01:09:28,554
I am looking at this suite.
I'm going to move to town.

827
01:09:28,554 --> 01:09:34,346
The bathroom's on a grand scale,
also with a beautiful look over the city.

828
01:09:34,346 --> 01:09:37,507
Glenda, I was wrong yesterday.

829
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,553
I have decided to race Furioso at San Isidro.

830
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:43,707
Glenda, please believe me.

831
01:09:43,707 --> 01:09:45,945
I love you.

832
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:52,190
This time there's not the storm
over the pampas. This time it is real.

833
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,984
As long as your father feels
as he does about me, it won't work.

834
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:58,066
The odds are not as bad as that.

835
01:09:58,066 --> 01:10:01,386
It's no worse than even-money
he'll change if Furioso wins.

836
01:10:01,386 --> 01:10:05,229
When he is standing there with the cup
in his hands, how can he be angry?

837
01:10:05,229 --> 01:10:07,783
No matter what he tells himself, he likes you.

838
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:10,787
And when he hears
that it was your idea to race the horse,

839
01:10:10,787 --> 01:10:13,343
the fact you are a Crawford
will be forgotten.

840
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:16,745
Señor, now that you have settled
your personal problems,

841
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,951
do you or do you not want this suite?

842
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:22,027
Of course we want it.
Señorita Crawford is going to stay.

843
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:25,073
Señor, if I understand you correctly, and I do,

844
01:10:25,073 --> 01:10:30,070
even so, you will have to register
in the proper manner.

Casi...

01:10:57,515 --> 01:11:00,154
- Did you call?
- Not for you. Where is Casiano?

852
01:11:00,154 --> 01:11:04,023
- Casiano has gone to the west pasture.
- Why did he not consult me first?

853

<i>Tell Panchito to bring Furioso out.

Furioso to the north pasture.</i>

855
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:14,185
Why would he do a thing like that?

856
01:11:14,185 --> 01:11:17,267
I'll look at the alfalfa.
Get me Cipriano and Machito.

857
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:20,870
<i>Siento mucho, señor,
but they have gone to the east pasture.</i>

858
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:24,311
West pasture, north pasture, east pasture.
What has happened?

859
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:27,387
María! What pasture is she in?

860
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:29,306
She has gone to visit her mother.

861
01:11:29,306 --> 01:11:32,546
Her mother has been dead five years.
I know it. I buried her.

862
01:11:32,546 --> 01:11:36,753
You are lying, Esteban. Speak up
before I shake the ears off your head.

863
01:11:36,753 --> 01:11:39,872
I will tell you, Don Diego.
They have gone to San Isidro.

864
01:11:39,872 --> 01:11:43,914
- The racetrack? Why would they go there?
- I don't know.

865
01:11:43,914 --> 01:11:48,386
- You do. You lie. Answer or I'll strangle you.
- They've gone to see Furioso run.

866
01:11:48,386 --> 01:11:53,469
Furioso in a flat race? Who did that?
Who would dare to do that?

867
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:58,071
Ricardo, Casiano and Señorita Cunningham.
They've trained him for the handicap.

868
01:11:58,071 --> 01:12:01,591
<i>¡Pedazo de animal!
Why did you not tell me?</i>

869
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:03,552
I was not going to deceive you.

870
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:08,390
I was to tell you in half an hour, when
it'd be too late to take him out of the race.

871
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,753
<i>- ¡Animal! ¡Anda! Get my hat! Get my gun!
- Sí, señor.</i>

872
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:32,390
It gives me great pleasure to have
a Quintana horse in the handicap.

873
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:37,026
<i>Muchas gracias, Señor Rosales. I hope he's
not the only one who gets pleasure out of it.</i>

874
01:12:40,435 --> 01:12:42,790
<i>Vete, caballo.</i>

875
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,945
Do not get nervous, Furioso.

876
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:51,508
Listen. This race like the race in the village,
only here they got more people. Understand?

877
01:12:51,508 --> 01:12:53,825
- Unsaddle that horse.
- Wait, Casiano.

878
01:12:53,825 --> 01:12:57,703
Papa, Furioso is a racehorse.
You developed a certain bloodline.

879
01:12:57,703 --> 01:13:01,993
You worked till you had a horse as great as
Tempestad. You have one who's greater.

880
01:13:01,993 --> 01:13:07,593
Oh, you've gone against me once too often,
and I've nothing to say to you now, or ever.

881
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:09,506
Unsaddle that horse!

882
01:13:09,506 --> 01:13:11,950
Come on. There is nothing more to be done.

883
01:13:16,795 --> 01:13:21,107
Don Diego, for 40 years I work for you,
never I say anything like this.

884
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:25,427
When you keep a horse in the barn on
handicap day, when he runs the mile in 1:36,

885
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:28,348
you are a... you are a criminal.

886
01:13:28,348 --> 01:13:31,313
Hold your tongue, old man.

887
01:13:32,315 --> 01:13:34,670
<i>- Did you say 1:36?
- Sí.</i>

888
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,711
Three time. Three.

889
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:40,151
With the horses like he run with today,
he break a world record.

890
01:13:40,151 --> 01:13:42,351
1:36.

891
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:46,586
<i>- 1:36?
- Sí. 1:36.</i>

892
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:49,064
I've changed my mind, Casiano.

893
01:13:49,064 --> 01:13:51,715
<i>- ¡Que suba!
- Sí. ¡Que suba!</i>

894
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:57,994
<i>Ponga su dinero y ganará con él.
Buena suerte que le dé.</i>

895
01:13:57,994 --> 01:14:01,351
Hurry, you imbeciles! We will be too late.

896
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:03,744
Casiano. How much money have you got?

897
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:07,464
Oh, money. Plenty money, Don Diego.
Eight pesos.

898
01:14:07,464 --> 01:14:11,343
Oh, I'm not after feed for chicken.
I need money.

899
01:14:12,435 --> 01:14:16,633
- Quintana. I never expected to see you here.
- Martínez, I need a little cash.

900
01:14:16,633 --> 01:14:20,390
Sure. Everything for an old friend.
How much? 100 pesos is enough?

901
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:22,352
- How much have you got?
- 2,000.

902
01:14:22,352 --> 01:14:25,074
- Give me all of it.
- You gonna bet all this money?

903
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:27,111
Hey, you must have a tip.

904
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:33,191
<i>It is my own horse, Furioso. He has done
the mile in 1:36 in his workouts. Gracias.</i>

905
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:37,951
Julio. Just a minute.
Can you lend me a little cash?

906
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,310
- How much?
- All you got. I send you a cheque.

907
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,944
This has been a very bad day for me today.
All I have is 800 pesos.

908
01:14:43,944 --> 01:14:47,391
- Don't tell me you'll bet all this?
- No. This is an investment.

909
01:14:47,391 --> 01:14:52,071
I put all this money in Furioso. He has
broken the world record in his workout.

910
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:55,465
<i>- ¡Muchas gracias!
- Sí, Alberto. Por favor.</i>

911
01:15:00,475 --> 01:15:02,033
- Señorita.
- Tito.

912
01:15:02,033 --> 01:15:06,427
Now, here. There's your cut. Now, you
haven't lost a race all day. How do you do it?

913
01:15:06,427 --> 01:15:08,710
It is simple. I eliminate all guesswork.

914
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:13,391
I have a cousin and an uncle who work
around the stables. They'll stoop to anything.

915
01:15:13,391 --> 01:15:18,595
They sound charming. When your mother's
out of the Bastille I'll have you all over for tea.

916
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:21,826
<i>Gracias, señorita.
With my winnings, may I buy you a drink?</i>

917
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:25,669
Aren't you nice? First I want
to bet everything I've got on Furioso.

918
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:28,349
Well, he's 80 to one now.
Wait. He may go to 100.

919
01:15:28,349 --> 01:15:31,791
Wonderful! That would be
like having our own printing press.

920
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,548
<i>- Cinco, Tortilla.
- Carlos, no.</i>

921
01:15:34,548 --> 01:15:39,868
It's in the bag for Furioso.
Number three. Don't tell a soul.

922
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,913
- Did he say Furioso?
- It's in the bag. Number three.

923
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,713
<i>Furioso. Sí, Furioso.</i>

924
01:15:44,713 --> 01:15:47,229
<i>- Furioso, cinco ganadores.
- (man) Sí.</i>

925
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:51,224
Furioso.

926
01:15:51,435 --> 01:15:52,424
Furioso.

927
01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:56,948
<i>- Furioso.
- Furioso. Dos ganadores.</i>

928
01:15:59,795 --> 01:16:03,390
- Bet on Furioso.
- I know. I gave you the tip.

929
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:10,153
<i>- (man) Señorita.
- Señorita.</i>

930
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:13,033
- You haven't bet yet?
- No. The odds are dropping.

931
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:14,833
Do not put a nickel on Furioso.

932
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:17,475
- Tortilla is the one.
- What's wrong with Furioso?

933
01:16:17,475 --> 01:16:21,514
I don't know. I learned by experience
never to go against my uncle's tips.

934
01:16:21,514 --> 01:16:25,304
You've been right every race.
I won't change touts in mid-afternoon.

935
01:16:25,304 --> 01:16:28,148
- 50,000 pesos on Furioso.
- Oh, señor.

936
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:31,511
- You haven't heard that your horse will lose.
- What?

937
01:16:31,511 --> 01:16:34,553
Now that you're
going to bet 50,000 pesos on Furioso,

938
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:38,514
I've got it straight from the feedbox
he'll be missing at the finish.

939
01:16:38,514 --> 01:16:42,474
Señorita, there is no one
whose opinion interests me less than yours.

940
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:46,230
- 50,000 pesos on Furioso.
- 10,000 on Tortilla.

941
01:16:51,075 --> 01:16:54,784
Don Diego, something terrible happened.
Very bad.

942
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:59,107
They make crooked business against you.
They take Panchito off Furioso.

943
01:16:59,107 --> 01:17:02,232
Panchito? Then what is he doing
on the horse's back?

944
01:17:02,232 --> 01:17:05,785
No, that's not Panchito. That's anotherjockey.

945
01:17:10,915 --> 01:17:13,383
That is what that Crawford woman meant,

946
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:16,353
and she had the nerve
to tell me what she was going to do.

947
01:17:16,353 --> 01:17:21,270
At first, I want to take Furioso out of the race,
then this boy come tell me he ride good.

948
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:25,746
I told Furioso everything what happened.
He understand this serious time.

949
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:28,474
He gonna be all right.
Maybe this boy can ride good.

950
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:32,309
- I knew you would put Furioso in the race.
- Don Diego, I am so glad.

951
01:17:32,309 --> 01:17:38,391
I have no doubt you are glad, señorita,
with a strange jockey on Furioso's back.

952
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:44,467
He did that deliberately. He is tiring him out.

953
01:17:44,467 --> 01:17:48,992
It is all part of the dastardly scheme. I might
have expected as much from Crawfords.

954
01:17:48,992 --> 01:17:51,543
- How can you say that, Papa?
- How can I say it?

955
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:55,105
That aunt of hers
was brazen enough to say it to my face.

956
01:17:59,395 --> 01:18:01,670
I'll put an end to this. I'm going to stop it.

957
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:06,988
No, Don Diego, it is no good.
They will be started before you get there.

958
01:18:06,988 --> 01:18:09,714
Later on we will kill a couple of people.

959
01:18:20,555 --> 01:18:23,672
Furioso is in front!
He is the smartest horse in the world.

960
01:18:23,672 --> 01:18:27,953
He remembers all my instruction.
Look - he do everything I told him.

961
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,912
Come on, Furioso!

962
01:18:32,635 --> 01:18:35,866
For a horse that was going to lose,
Furioso's doing all right.

963
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:39,265
It is the finish that counts,
and that has been arranged.

964
01:18:39,265 --> 01:18:41,710
My uncle took care of that personally.

965
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:46,823
You worm. If I'd known you'd do anything
to that horse, I'd have run you off the track.

966
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:49,509
Your money is on Tortilla.
You are taken care of.

967
01:18:49,509 --> 01:18:53,144
- I'll take care of you after the race. Furioso!
- Come on, Tortilla!

968
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:56,227
- Furioso!
- Tortilla! Furioso!

969
01:18:56,227 --> 01:18:57,714
Come on, Furioso!

970
01:19:07,675 --> 01:19:11,065
Look how he holds him.
He's breaking his neck.

971
01:19:14,595 --> 01:19:17,063
All of the horses have passed him.

972
01:19:19,595 --> 01:19:23,110
Oh! I think maybe he's got the bit in his teeth.

973
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,311
Yeah, yeah, he got the bit in his teeth.

974
01:19:29,955 --> 01:19:33,106
Oh-ho-ho, nobody stop him now! Nobody!

975
01:19:33,106 --> 01:19:35,584
Go, Furioso!

976
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:39,708
Come on, Furioso.

977
01:19:42,755 --> 01:19:45,030
Come on, Furioso!

978
01:19:47,595 --> 01:19:48,948
Come on, Furioso.

979
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:55,703
Furioso!

980
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:57,990
He... he win.

981
01:19:59,235 --> 01:20:02,910
- Oh, Furioso. They could not beat him.
- He had to win.

982
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,634
Furioso, he wanted
to be a racehorse all the time.

983
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:11,028
Crooked people, crooked jockey,
don't mean nothing to him, nothing.

984
01:20:11,355 --> 01:20:14,028
- I said Glenda had nothing to do with this.
- She tried.

985
01:20:14,028 --> 01:20:17,949
Oh, Glenda.
I just discharged Tito with my own hands.

986
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:23,393
After all I've been to him, he turns out to be
a horse fixer. He switched jockeys on Furioso.

987
01:20:23,393 --> 01:20:26,785
- The Crawfords had nothing to do with this.
- They might have.

988
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:30,311
I'm tired of this. For years
you've told how my father cheated you.

989
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:32,829
Well, I've found out what really happened.

990
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:36,624
- Here is a letter from my father.
- Why should we go into all that now?

991
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:39,752
I am a broadminded man.
We will let bygones be bygones.

992
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:42,588
No, we won't.
When your father was in school at Paris

993
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,428
he got mixed up
with a girl from the rue St Augustine.

994
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:47,471
He wanted to marry her.

995
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:50,353
My father took her to Capri for a weekend.

996
01:20:50,353 --> 01:20:53,825
The reason was to keep
your father from making a fool of himself.

997
01:20:53,825 --> 01:20:59,194
That is his story. If he told the truth, he would
tell how he stayed three weeks in Capri.

998
01:20:59,194 --> 01:21:01,550
That is unforgivable.

999
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:06,390
Papa, let's the four of us go and have
some champagne in the clubhouse, huh?
