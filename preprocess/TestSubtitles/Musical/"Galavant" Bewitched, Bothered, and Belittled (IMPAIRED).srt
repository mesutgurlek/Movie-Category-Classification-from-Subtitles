1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,128
Let's cut to the chase.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,565
If you help me save my love,

3
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:09,067
you'll be celebrated in song for 100 years,

4
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:10,969
and that's a promise from Galavant,

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,704
the most beloved warrior
in the five kingdoms

6
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:15,340
and<i> Knight Beat</i> Magazine's
Swordsman of the Year...

7
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,843
Three times running.

8
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:20,546
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you've
already given us your résumé.

9
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:21,513
So...

10
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,715
What's in this deal for us?

11
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:26,451
Perhaps I have something that might help.

12
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:27,419
Jewel of Valencia!

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,787
Boom!

14
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:30,155
Where did you get that?

15
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:31,790
I smuggled it out when
we escaped from the kingdom.

16
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,358
How? We didn't have anything with us.

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,460
I swallowed it.

18
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:37,029
It's huge. Believe me, I know.

19
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,097
I had to slather it with bacon
grease to choke it down.

20
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:40,666
Richard, that's insane.

21
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,234
No, what's insane is when it came out.

22
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:43,569
Do you remember that day on the ship

23
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,970
when I was screaming for hours?

24
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:47,039
Well, now I know what my mother
was always complaining about.

25
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,873
Enough!

26
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:50,842
We have a deal.

27
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,111
I mean, rinse it off one more time...

28
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:54,379
And we have a deal.

29
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,881
Excellent.

30
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,749
Uh, can I just say,

31
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,519
it is so nice to negotiate
with men of honor.

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,920
I mean, you outnumber us 10 to 1.

33
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:03,422
You could've just as easily murdered us

34
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:04,756
and kept the Jewel for yourself,

35
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:08,526
but, you, sir, are a class act.

36
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:12,664
Roberta, we're leaving!

37
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,733
Grab the horses, pup-pup!

38
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,969
Right! Uh...Pup-pup?

39
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,271
Well, no one's called me that since...

40
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,705
Wait a minute.

41
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:26,644
Are you Roberta Steingas?

42
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:28,413
I am!

43
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,415
Oh...My...God!

44
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,918
Bobby Steingas!
Why didn't you say something?

45
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:35,320
I didn't think you'd remember me. Duck!

46
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,823
Not remember you? Are you crazy?

47
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:39,324
We grew up together, you big dummy!

48
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:42,461
Galavant, you're not gonna
freakin' believe this!

49
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,997
Our new traveling companion
is Bobby Steingas!

50
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:47,332
She was one of the children my parents
used to hire to play with me!

51
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,101
Do you think maybe
we could catch up later?!

52
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:51,637
Oh, sure, she was 7 and I was 13,

53
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:52,703
but it just worked, you know?

54
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,506
Yeah, we can talk about this later.

55
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:04,116
Richard, I need you to focus.

56
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:06,418
Yes, it's good you smuggled
the Jewel out in your...

57
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,953
Bottom. Well, mouth first.

58
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:08,987
Wait, what?

59
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,155
But we can't have any more mistakes.

60
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:11,957
This Jewel is now our key
to getting an army.

61
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,260
And it's Isabella's life, her salvation.

62
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,294
How she must be suffering in Hortensia.

63
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:27,039
No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,108
Jester, it's slide, back, slide.

65
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,276
Please get it right,

66
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,378
otherwise my wedding dance
is gonna look so stupid.

67
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,113
Sorry, Princess.

68
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,782
I'm a prop comic, not a dancer.

69
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:37,816
Excuse me, excuse me.

70
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:38,850
Snacky time!

71
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:39,984
Yay!

72
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:45,656
Okay, everyone, let's take five.

73
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:51,196
Milady, I hope it won't sound impertinent,

74
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:53,465
but I can't help noticing the big change

75
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,599
that's come over you lately.

76
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,936
Oh. I guess I'm just happy.

77
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:00,472
After all, I am getting married!

78
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,375
Yeah, but your pupils
just spun 'round then,

79
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,243
and your tiara started to glow, which...

80
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:09,381
She said... She's happy, okay?

81
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:10,482
Right.

82
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,917
Let's all go back to one, shall we?

83
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,427
Chef, no! Don't throw it away!

84
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:26,698
Gwyndolin, bae, you know you
don't have to do that anymore.

85
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,967
We are officially big-pimpin'.

86
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,535
No more living on leftovers.

87
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:33,738
We can be as wasteful as the fine folk.

88
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,776
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

They're beautiful, My Queen.

And you're sure
they don't make me look poor?

No, because they're gold.

does not mean that you can take

Uh, I thought we agreed
on "personal assistant"?

And the Von Falconburgh sisters
are not tarts.

00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,743
They are the most popular queens
in all the seven realms.

148
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:34,081
I remember the first time I saw them.

149
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,816
I was just a little girl, and
they passed through my village.

150
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,121
I'd never seen anything like them.

151
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:43,357
They could've bought or sold all of us

152
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:46,325
with just one of their
spectacular earrings.

153
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,097
And, to my amazement,

154
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,732
they singled me out for special attention.

155
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,733
Little girl, do you want a ride?

I wanted to be just like them.

00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:24,731
Hey, Gal, listen,

164
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:26,967
I want to apologize again
for screwing up earlier.

165
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,769
I was only trying to be helpful,

166
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,904
but I promise, from now on,

167
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:33,073
I'm going to do everything right.

168
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:34,441
You're sitting on the map.

169
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,275
Oh, sorry. From now on.

170
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,381
Sorry. From<i> now</i> now on.

171
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:42,416
Sorry.

172
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,684
No need to apologize.

173
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,585
Listen, I was thinking from here on out,

174
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:48,588
maybe I'll do the hero thing...Alone.

175
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,323
What?

176
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:51,758
Why?

177
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,828
Well, because you nearly got us
killed by those mercenaries

178
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:55,962
and the mercenaries before that

179
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:57,197
or any of the countless other times

180
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:58,331
you've put our lives in jeopardy.

181
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:01,535
But helping you is all I have right now.

182
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:03,770
I mean, what else would I even do?

183
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,706
I don't know. For argument's sake,

184
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:07,641
maybe you could spend
some more time with Roberta.

185
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:08,842
Hmm?

186
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:11,510
I mean, you two obviously
have something going on.

187
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:14,081
Me and<i> her?</i>

188
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,348
Are you serious?

189
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,417
No. I just said it to get out
of an awkward situation,

190
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,920
but, actually, now that I think about it,

191
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:21,088
yeah, that would be a really good way

192
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,489
to get you out of my hair.

193
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,557
Okay, that is officially

194
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:25,692
the grossest thing I have ever heard.

195
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:26,893
Me and Bobby?!

196
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:28,662
I mean, we played together as children!

197
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:30,731
She's like a sister!

198
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:32,833
And not the kind of sister you marry.

199
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:35,435
Yeah, look, I know it's hard to
see people in a different light.

200
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,671
Unless someone comes up with
a ridiculous plan

201
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:39,639
to force you together.

202
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,641
Apropos of nothing,

203
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:44,111
why don't we all go for dinner
tonight, hmm?

204
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:45,912
Somewhere candlelit.

205
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:46,913
Hmm.

206
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,815
So...Anywhere?

207
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:49,915
Yeah, pretty much anywhere at all.

208
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,490
I've brought luncheon, Your Highness.

209
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,858
Oh, just a moment.

210
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm practicing writing my married name.

211
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,228
Oh.

212
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:04,030
Although, isn't it exactly
the same as your current name?

213
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:05,799
Yeah.

214
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:10,303
My lady, I hate to trouble you

215
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:13,440
with the problems of those
so far, far beneath you.

216
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,275
But I can't help noticing,

217
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,878
after several weeks
of constant escape attempts,

218
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,378
you've settled in here pretty fast.

219
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:22,983
My Gwynne is having a hard time adjusting.

220
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:24,885
Is there anything I can do to help her?

221
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:27,821
You just need to let Gwynne know
how special she is.

222
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:30,223
Buy her something expensive.

223
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:32,658
Every woman wants to be treated
like a princess.

224
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:36,596
Have you been sleeping in that thing?

225
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:37,998
Allow me to straighten it for you.

226
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,498
Mine!

227
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:42,636
A million pardons, my lady.

228
00:09:42,637 --> 00:09:45,238
I'll go get you a lozenge for that throat.

229
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:52,044
[Sighs

230
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,559
May I present to you our guest of honor,

231
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,195
all the way from Valencia...

232
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:09,963
Queen Madalena!

233
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,900
Thank you so much.

234
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,138
It is such a thrill to be
invited to share Sunday roast

235
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,973
with such esteemed company.

236
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:23,109
So, what are we roasting...
Wild boar, stag, heretics?

237
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:27,347
Oh, no, Madalena, you've got it all wrong.

238
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,381
We're roasting you.

239
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:29,549
What?

240
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:34,855
Welcome, gentle lords and ladies
and especially you, friars.

241
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:36,089
Thank you for letting us use your club.

242
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:40,927
Today, we roast Queen Madalena,

243
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:43,263
a target so easy,
it almost doesn't seem fair.

244
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:45,298
I know.

245
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,901
Now, we all know how she got her title...

246
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:49,736
By killing or beheading all her exes,

247
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,071
which just goes to show

248
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:53,406
that even when
she throws them in a dungeon,

249
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,108
she still can't keep her man!

250
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,311
But this isn't all about

251
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:01,615
what an absolutely
massive hussy Madalena is.

252
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,117
Yeah, she is very regal.

253
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:05,952
We always knew
she would end up in a castle.

254
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:07,587
Yeah, we just thought she'd be cleaning it.

255
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:10,690
- Okay, let's get real for a moment.
- Mm.

256
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:13,593
Madalena, you have done so well.

257
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:14,928
You have come from nothing,

258
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,931
- and we are really, really proud of you.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:21,700
We think that you've turned yourself
into the queen who has everything.

260
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:24,271
Except love, respect, friends...

261
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,438
And a decent pair of earrings!

262
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:26,439
Oh, yes.

263
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,975
See?

264
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,776
I see.

265
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,164
That was so much fun for us.

266
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,033
Yeah, thank you for being
so easy to make fun of.

267
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,768
I-I loved it. I just loved it.

268
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,303
We should definitely do this again.

269
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,715
Of course.

270
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,757
Gwynne?

271
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,127
Gwyndolin?

272
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,294
In here!

273
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,707
What are you doing in there?

274
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,609
You have a bed to sleep in now.

275
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,145
Like I'm gonna sleep
in the thing people use

276
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:32,283
to give birth and die in...
Sometimes simultaneously.

277
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,151
Wow. Grim.

278
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:36,720
I can't live like the fancy folk.

279
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,455
It just isn't me.

280
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,124
I'm never on edge anymore.

281
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,959
I haven't had a disease for weeks.

282
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,294
But isn't that a good thing?

283
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,096
Maybe for some people... For you.

284
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:49,033
But the thought that we're drifting apart

285
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:53,037
has gotten me so down, I can
barely get out of drawer.

286
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,305
So I think it's best if I just leave.

287
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,542
Wait.

288
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,109
I'll pack our things.

289
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,215
Done.

290
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,650
What? No.

291
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:07,785
Unpack right now.

292
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,586
You can't leave. You love it here.

293
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,323
Gwyndolin, don't you understand?

294
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,725
Sure, it's nice not going hungry,

295
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:16,593
and my bones don't bend anymore,

296
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:19,663
and my teeth don't wiggle in their sockets.

297
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:22,766
I could be the king of a castle.

298
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,802
But without you,

299
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,171
I'd be the lowliest man in the world.

300
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,451
Oh, Vincenzo.

301
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,277
We leave the castle together.

302
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,417
So, as soon as we're all seated,
you come and send for me.

303
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:41,952
That looks romantic, doesn't it?

304
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,588
Oh, Roberta! Ooh, you look smashing!

305
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,890
Please excuse the dress.

306
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:49,193
The blouse I usually wear under
it has completely disappeared.

307
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:50,627
Wha... mine, too!

308
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,396
Must be fairies. Big problem around here.

309
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:53,197
Shall we sit?

310
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,498
Oh.

311
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,032
- You're over there.
- Okay.

312
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,068
Uh!

313
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,003
You're across from her.

314
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,305
All right.

315
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:03,273
- Isn't this nice?
- Mm.

316
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:05,743
An urgent crow for you, sir.

317
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,844
Oh, thank you.

318
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,380
Unexpected.

319
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,316
Oh. I've got to take this.

320
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,484
Uh, you carry on without me.

321
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,185
Here.

322
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,154
Oh, thank you.

323
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,524
Oh.

324
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,893
Thank you.

325
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,795
He's... He's a bit odd.

326
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:28,699
I'm sorry. This is crazy.

327
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,300

Oh.

Oh, Richard, honestly, do I
have to do everything myself?

By the way, I know
what you were up to last night.

Oh, yeah. I guess it was pretty obvious.

374
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,438
Because I sang it out loud.

Hey, Bobby, I was right!

376
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,142
Galavant<i> was</i> trying to set us up.

- The worst!
- Yeah, all right.

380
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,549
But, hey, at least we got that
all figured out.

Mm. So, what's next?

384
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,825
We head to the forest.

385
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,027
I hear there are Giants
in the Southern Reach.

386
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,328
Perhaps we can convince them

387
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,863
to join us in attacking Hortensia.

388
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,631
So, we're right back where we started.
