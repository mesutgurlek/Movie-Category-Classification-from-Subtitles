<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:03,355
<i>McKinley's doing West Side
Story, and everyone's excited,</i>

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:04,849
<i>especially Coach Beiste
and Emma and Artie,</i>

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,390
<i>because they're the directors.
Blaine got the lead,</i>

5
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,111
<i>and so did Rachel, which made
Mercedes quit the glee club</i>

6
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:09,806
<i>and join Shelby's Troubletones
with Santana and Brittany.</i>

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,808
<i>Mike Chang's playing Riff,
even though his dad told him</i>

8
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,510
<i>he can't be a dancer.
Riff is perfect for you.</i>

9
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:15,541
<i>I think he wants him to go to
doctor college or something.</i>

10
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,844
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

11
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,487
(school bell ringing)

12
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:25,417
<i>ARTIE: You see this face?
This is what enlightenment looks like.</i>

13
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,250
<i>It doesn't matter if
he's in prison like Gandhi,</i>

14
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:30,867
<i>or trapped inside a woman's
body like Chaz Bono,</i>

15
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,468
<i>or stuck in a wheelchair
like me,</i>

16
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:36,854
<i>when a man finds his calling,
all is right in his world.</i>

17
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:39,307
<i>I still ve performing,
but thanks to Mr. Shue</i>

18
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,601
<i>and the school musical,
I've finally discovered</i>

19
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:42,843
<i>my true passion...</i>

20
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,185
<i>bossing everyone around.</i>

21
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,763
<i>I mean directing.</i>

22
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,397
<i>The key to being a director</i>

23
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:48,996
<i>is having opinions
about everything.</i>

24
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,079
No.

25
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:51,490
<i>Even stuff you have no id.</i>

26
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:53,115
No.
I think it's great.

27
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,571
Go.

28
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:55,998
Definitely.
Really?

29
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:57,002
That's it.
No.

30
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,442
That's it.

 It all began tonight 

36
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:20,192
 I saw you
and the world went away 

37
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:27,021
 Tonight, tonight,
there's only you tonight 

38
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:34,711
 What you are, what you do,
what you say 

39
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:40,283
 Today,
all day I had the feeling 

40
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:43,619
 A miracle would happen 

41
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:49,135
 I know now I was right 

42
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:52,922
 For here you are 

43
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:59,726
 And what was just a world
is a star 

44
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:06,494
 Tonight... 

45
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:09,852
Are you going to cry
every time we sing?

46
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,244
I'm such a girl.

47
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,069
My only note is more teeth.

48
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,835
Can I be honest?

49
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,506
This song is about
sexual awakening,

50
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:18,832
as is the entire musical.

51
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,325
You two lack passion.

52
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,347
Have either of you two
actually...?

53
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,373
Wow, okay. I have to go.
Because I have...

54
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,131
Those footballs aren't going
to inflate themselves.

55
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:30,682
I'm out of here.
Let's go.

56
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,254
Look, I remember my
first time with Brittany.

57
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,774
The excitement, the way it
made me feel like a man...

58
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:39,230
even though she called me
the wrong name like four times,

59
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,718
during and after.

60
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,353
What was it like for you guys?

61
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,787
Um...

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm, I'm waiting
for the right time.

63
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,106
Yeah. Yeah, me-me, too.

64
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,308
I'm so glad that
you're my Tony.

65
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,736
Look...

66
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,295
as your friend I support
your strange aversion to fun.

67
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,371
But as your director,
I'm concerned.

68
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,785
I'm, I'm sorry,
what do you mean?

69
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,372
Well, how do you expect
to convey

70
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,985
the human perience
to an audience

71
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,506
when you haven't even opened
yourself up to one of humanity's

72
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,235
most basic and primal ones?

00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:19,419
Um... one over there.
Um...

77
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,092
So, you, um...

78
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,211
you still haven't told me
who you're ving for yet.

79
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,425
Well, I haven't decided.
Kurt's my brother.

80
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,884
It's kind of hard to vote
against your brother.

81
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,774
Well, I mean, you can't do
this with your brother.

82
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,895
Not unless you
live in Kentucky.

83
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:41,793
(giggles)
What's gotten into you?

84
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:44,325
Nothing. It's just the
confidence of success.

85
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,369
I mean, I sold out
the April Rhodes Auditorium

86
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:48,928
for three shows, Jacob Ben
Israel's poll have me in tied

87
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,715
for first place in
the presidential race,

88
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,463
and I have
the hottest guy in school.

89
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,383
I hope that my radiance
isn't too much for you.

90
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,464
It won't be after Friday night.
What's Friday night?

91
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,847
That is the day
that the recruiter

92
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,227
from Ohio State is coming.

93
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,290
They're looking for
a new quarterback.

94
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,212
Really?
That's amazing!

95
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,646
Yeah, I know.
You... you're not pissed?

96
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,477
No. No, of course not.

97
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,290
It's not like NYADA
has a football team.

98
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,027
It's really happening.

99
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,364
You know, our dreams are coming
true, and we're growing up.

100
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:17,026
I know.

101
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,729
And... hey,
I was thinking.

102
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:22,323
Um, Burt and my mom are
out canvassing all week

103
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,743
and I have the house to myself.

104
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:26,689
Maybe you could come over.

105
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,854
To your house?

106
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,863
I'll be there at 6:00.

107
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,511
Oh, boy.

108
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:52,559
(Roxy Music plays loudly)

109
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,690
God. Roxy Music makes me
want to build

110
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,891
a time machine just so
I can go back to the '70s

111
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,615
and give Brian Ferry
a high five.

112
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,603
Do you think I'm boring?
Are you crazy?

113
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,649
You're the single
most interesting kid

114
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:05,358
in all of Ohio.
I mean, like...

115
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,902
sexually.

116
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,579
I mean, we are playing
it very safe by

117
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,080
not granting our hands visas
to travel south of the equator.

118
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,211
Oh, I-I thought
that's what we wanted.

119
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,252
It is.
I'm just wondering,

120
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,742
have you ever had
the urge just to

121
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,322
rip off each other's clothes
and get dirty?

122
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:21,214
Uh, yeah. But that's why
they invented masturbation.

123
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,578
It's so hot in this room. Could
we, could we open up a window?

124
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:27,199
Hey, I'm serious. We're young.
We're in high school.

125
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,706
Yeah, we have urges, but

126
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:34,342
whatever we do, I want to make
sure that you're comfortable.

127
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,642
So I can be comfortable.

128
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,389
And besides,

129
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,732
tearing off all of your clothes
is sort of a tall order.

130
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,018
Because of the layers?

131
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,398
Because of the layers.

132
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,701
Man, I love to weld.

133
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,216
Clearly.
Coach, I'm concerned.

134
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,138
Why did you run out of
rehearsal the other day

135
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,370
when we started
talking about S-E-X?

136
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:00,574
Artie, this conversation
is totally inappropriate.

137
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:02,588
Wait.

138
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,129
Have you never...?

139
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,723
Why? Have you just never
found the right...

140
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,709
person?
Guy. I like guys.

141
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:13,145
And no, I haven't found him.

142
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:16,516
All right, I'll play.

143
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,862
There's this
one gentleman.

144
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,416
He's the bee's knees.

145
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,871
His name's Cooter Mankins.

146
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:24,982
He's a recruiter
for Ohio State.

147
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:28,480
<i>He's beautiful. He makes me
feel like a girl...</i>

148
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,798
<i>but he's not interested.</i>

149
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,775
You're a hell of a coach, Coach.
So much talent.

150
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:35,542
I'm famished.
Want to go get some lunch?

151
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,866
Nah.

152
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,878
But you can have
the rest of my chili.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,215
There's nothing left but
gristle and a few beans,

154
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:42,827
but it eats pretty good.

155
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:46,084
So, anyway, that's my type.

156
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:47,509
Not that it matters.

157
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,119

BOTH:
What?

261
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,848
No, no, look, I figured since

262
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,012
you have some more experience

263
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:17,330
than I do, you could
recommend a brand of condom.

264
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,796
Are you cheating
on Rachel, dude?

265
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:19,657
Because if you are,
that is not cool.

it'd be you.

271
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:30,445
As for the condoms,
no idea... never used them.

272

for me about 99% of the time.

00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:31,683
You like Coach Beiste, right?

320
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:32,923
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

321
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,525
She's the best
football coach in the state.

322
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,951
Yeah, but do you like her,
like her?

323
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,033
You know, I've asked her out
about a million times.

324
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,738
She's not interested.
Last week I told her

325
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,770
I had a gift
certificate to Applebee's.

326
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,628
She told me fancy restaurants
make her nervous.

327
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:51,625
You have to ask her out again.

328
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,068
No way, Andy.
She's gonna blow me off.

329
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,230
Trust me.

330
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,235
You need to ask her out again,

331
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,556
but make it really obvious.

332
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:03,082
I have the perfect idea
for a date.

333
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,567
I can't believe you asked

334
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:07,215
for a shot of Courvoisier
in your coffee.

335
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,892
I forget how lame
this town is.

336
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,986
When I lived in Paris,

337
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,905
I drank it like it was
mother's milk.

338
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,283
When...?

339
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:15,617
Oh, okay, wow.

340
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:16,183
What?

341
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,123
You're just so, you know,
you're out there.

342
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,809
And your whole bashful
schoolboy thing?

343
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,703
Super hot.

344
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:25,398
Look, Sebastian,
I have a boyfriend.

345
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,050
Doesn't bother me
if it doesn't bother you.

346
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,565
No, I mean, I really care
about him.

347
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:30,702
He doesn't need to know.

348
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:32,081
I'd just never want to mess

349
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,477
my thing up with him in any way.

350
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,194
He's really great.

351
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,058
Who's really great?

352
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,644
You!

353
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,537
We were just talking
about you.

354
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:44,586
Sebastian, this is Kurt,
my boyfriend, who I was just...

355
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,641
Got it.
Wow. Wow.

356
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,399
Pleasure.

357
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,089
And how do we know
Sebastian?

358
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,337
We met at Dalton.

359
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,591
Was dying to meet Blaine.

360
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:56,216
Those Warblers just won't
shut up about him.

361
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,177
Didn't think he could
live up to the hype,

362
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,950
but as it turns out...

363
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:03,382
Yes, he's even more impressive
in the flesh.

364
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,985
Hey, what are you guys doing
tomorrow night?

365
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:08,380
Well, we're rehearsing
for the school musical.

366
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:09,853
And then, at bedtime,

367
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,340
we do a rigorous skin-sloughing
regimen over the phone together.

368
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:15,174
And as sexy as that sounds,

369
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,121
what do you say
we shake things up?

370
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,934
I get you guys
a couple of fake IDs

371
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,561
and we head over
to Scandals in West Lima.

372
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,270
Scandals?
That's the gay bar.

373
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,771
The last time
I was there,

374
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:26,677
I met the man of my dreams on
the dance floor.

375
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:27,651
That's so sweet.

376
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,916
And are you two
still together?

377
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,503
Sadly, no.

378
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,676
We broke up about
20 minutes after we met.

379
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,091
Come on, guys.

380
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:35,094
Live a little.

381
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,699
We would love to,
Sebastian.

382
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,559
Thank you for the offer.
That's very nice of you,

383
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:42,644
but that just isn't
our kind of thing.

384
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:43,824
Let's do it.

385
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:46,810
What? Yeah.
We have a whole bunch of firsts

386
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,521
to start crossing
off our list.

387
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:49,668
We're in.

388
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,027
Great.

389
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:52,400
Great.

390
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:57,626
(Rachel sighs)

391
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,544
That was amazing.

392
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,152
I've never had
meat substitute before

393
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,548
that tastes that
much like real meat.

394
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,659
Of course.
Because you're a vegan,

395
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,554
which I remember because we know
each other so well.

396
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:08,632
More sparking cider?

397
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,790
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

398
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,144
Should we make a toast?

399
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,158
Yeah.
All right.

400
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,348
To four full months
of no fighting

401
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,676
or threats of us breaking up.

402
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:21,161
Nothing but love, love, love.

403
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:27,959
BOTH:
Cheers.

404
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,676
Oh, should I go
make dessert?

405
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,029
I've got pound cake.
It's Sara Lee.

406
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,761
Oh, actually I thought maybe we
could just go snuggle

407
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:41,102
by the fire first.

408
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:47,201
Okay.

409
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:08,810
I brought protection.

410
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,071
Me, too.

411
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,483
Every modern girl
comes prepared.

412
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,919
Wait, wait.
Before we do this,

413
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:20,762
I need to know, why now?

414
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,118
The last time we talked
about this, you said

415
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,696
you wanted to wait
until you won a Tony.

416
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,470
Or any other major award.
Emmy, Golden Globe.

417
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,293
People's Choice would have
gotten you to third base.

418
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,758
But I don't know what changed.

419
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,101
I mean, even the thought

420
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,980
of going to New York a virgin
felt silly to me.

421
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:35,418
But when and who's gonna feel

422
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,912
more right than you and now?

423
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,759
And I love you.

424
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,219
I just want to make sure this is
special enough for you.

425
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:48,531
I've been saving up
for a hotel for us.

426
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:52,014
Someplace nice like a Marriot
or something.

427
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,606
If we wait a couple of weeks,
I could probably...

428
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,049
No, I can't wait
a couple weeks.

429
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,151
I have to get this done before
opening night.

430
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,568
Get this done?

431
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:03,337
I can't play airl
who has a sexual awakening

432
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:04,771
if I'm not woken up myself.

433
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,198
So you're doing this
so you can act better?

434
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,045
No! No! I'm doing this
because I love you

435
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,126
<i>and so that I can act better.</i>

436
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,414
But that's
my business, okay?

437
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:17,979
It has nothing to do
with you, so...

438
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,268
Where are you going?

439
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:21,827
No, no, I'm-I'm ready.
Please come back.

440
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,210
I-I just need a minute.

441
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,881
I'm gonna make dessert.

442
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:43,900
When were you
gonna tell me?

443
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,200
- Tell you what?
- That you're doing the school musical.

444
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,638
I overheard your mother
talking about it on the phone.

445
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:51,292
You lied to me, and you made
a liar out of your mother.

446
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:53,425
You will quit immediately.

447
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,806
No!
I love being a dancer.

448
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,859
When I was in high school
I wanted to be a tennis player,

449
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,647
but then I had to wake up
and realize that

450
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,774
I wasn't good enough.

451
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,129
Grow up, Michael!

452
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,917
You need to learn the difference

453
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,530
between grown-up dreams
and kid dreams.

454
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,763
I'm not going to be a doctor.

455
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,341
I will be a professional dancer.

456
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,325
I'll pay my own way
through college.

457
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,617
I don't want your money.

458
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,695
As long as you continue
to waste your life

459
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,407
with this silly fantasy,

460
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,850
you will no longer be my son.

461
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,972
Then I guess I don't have
a dad anymore.

462
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,642
(bell ringing)

463
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,250
Need somebody to spot you?

464
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,711
No, I'm good.

465
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,212
I lift big and solo.

466
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,218
You'd be surprised how much
I could bench.

467
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,875
If I got the chance.

468
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,215
Gotcha.

469
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,711
I'll be through
here in a sec,

470
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,982
and then
they're all yours.

471
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,792
Did you need me for something?

472
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,958
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I, uh...

473
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,146
I got these.

474
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,689
Are you going to a graveyard?

475
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,753
No, no, I got them for you.
I'm not sick.

476
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:11,227
Dang it, Shannon, can you just,
can you drop the weights,

477
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,393
please,
and talk to me for a second?

478
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,362
Man, you ever just have
something

479
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:23,924
you really wanted to get out,

480
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,820
and you just
couldn't seem to do it?

481
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,357
I had a chigger in
my thigh once.

482
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,325
It was the size of a Tic Tac.

483
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,827
I want to take you out
on a date.

484
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,255
A real honest-to-God sit-down
date where you dress up

485
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:39,087
like a lady and I dress up
like a gentleman.

486
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:42,584
Yes or no?

487
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,709
Why are you doing this, Cooter?

488
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:47,422
Somebody put you up to this?

489
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:50,135
Geez.

490
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,450
Why don't you get
that I'm attracted to you?

491
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,972
Because you're the kind of man

492
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,363
that could have any pretty girl
he pointed at,

493
00:21:56,365 --> 00:22:01,637
and I don't look the way
pretty girls look.

494
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,726
Well, good...

495
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,626
'cause I don't date girls.

496
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,388
I just date women.

497
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,107
Beautiful women.
Like you.

498
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:17,151
So, take the flowers.

499
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:19,139
Go on.

500
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,001
(sighs)

501
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:27,584
So, Friday...

502
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:28,822
after the game.

503
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:31,807
(door opens)

504
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:33,398
(sniffles)

505
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,603
This emergency meeting is now in
session.

506
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,234
Now I realize that we are a
house divided,

507
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,614
but I need the advice
of my girls.

508
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:43,914
The last time I called a meeting
like thiwas during

509
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,496
our Madonna lesson, and all of
you were wildly unhelpful.

510
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,914
But it's been two years now,
and we've all grown up,

511
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,424
so I'm optimistic.

512
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:54,247
Finn and I were...
almost intimate.

513
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:56,162
Almost? What happened?
He ran out.

514
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:57,964
I just... I wanted my
performance of Maria

515
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:00,176
to be as realistic as possible
and when he found out that

516
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,689
that's why I was doing it,
he got really, really hurt.

517
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:04,620
Of course he was hurt.
Yeah, that's really bad, Rachel.

518
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:07,630
I know. I know. I feel terribl
And now I realize that I was

519
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:09,486
just doing it for
all the wrong reasons.

520
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,050
Do you want my advice?

521
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:12,650
Just wait.
Just wait?

522
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,351
Look what happened to me.
You could've used protection.

523
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,411
I'm not just talking about
getting pregnant, I'm-I'm

524
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,693
talking about losing something
that you can never get back.

525
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:23,715
It changes you.
It makes everything more complicated.

526
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:26,043
I also think that
you should wait.

527
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,751
Speaking from experience,
Finn is terrible in bed.

528
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:30,441
Santana, that is not cool.
Oh, what?

529
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,560
If Rachel wants my sloppy seconds,
she should at least know the truth.

530
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:35,889
Look, it was like being
smothered by a sweaty,

531
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:37,497
out-of-breath sack of potatoes

532
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:38,769
that someone soaked
in body spray.

533
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:40,712
I lost my virginity at
cheerleading camp.

534
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:43,719
He just climbed into my tent.
Alien invasion.

535
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:46,213
Okay, well, then I guess
it's settled.

536
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:49,041
Obviously, things are heating up
between Finn and I.

537
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,415
But I think we should wait.

538
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:55,423
Losing my virginity was a great
experience for me...

539
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:57,183
because I was with
someone I love.

540
00:23:57,217 --> 00:24:02,090
 I have a love 

541
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:06,900
 And it's all that I have 

542
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:09,727
 Right or wrong, what else 

543
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,724
 Can I do? 

544
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:13,198
<i>TINA:
It happened this summer.</i>

545
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,236
Mike and I had talked
about it for awhile,

546
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,208
because we knew that
the first time was gonna be

547
00:24:17,242 --> 00:24:18,427
something we'd want
to remember forever.

548
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,079
 I love him 

549
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:24,438
 I'm his 

550
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:28,932
 And everything he is 

551
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,181
 I am, too... 

552
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,100
And when that
moment came...

553
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,620
we just knew.

554
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:36,985
It was right.

555
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:39,163
It wasn't rushed.

556
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:40,564
It was amazing.

557
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:47,439
RACHEL AND SANTANA:
 When love comes so strong 

558
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:53,456
 There is no right or wrong 

559
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:57,957
 Your love is... 

560
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,806
He's my first love.

561
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,961
And I'll always look back at
that moment as

562
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:05,767
absolutely perfect...
no regrets.

563
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:10,009
 Your life... 

564

KURT:
Chazz Donaldsworth?

565
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:28,838
This doesn't even
look like me.

566
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:30,667
Don't worry.
Mine says I'm 38.

567
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,006
They'll work.
Okay.

569

Aloha!

570
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,399
Enjoy.

571
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,683
It's Drag Queen Wednesday.

572
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,743
Great.

573
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:56,558
It's not very scandalous...

574
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:58,297
Au contraire.

575
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:00,325
Look at all the, uh,
glamorous drag queens.

576
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,534
Look, there's uh, Cher and
Tina Turner and, uh, uh...

577
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,754
is that Lucy or Reba?

578

<i>That is Ginger from
Gilligan's Island.</i>

579
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:13,216
KURT:
Of course.

580
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:16,591
 Then I say "I love you"
and foul the situation... 

581
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:17,806
I really don't
like that guy.

582
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,872
He's harmless.

583
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,892
A beer for Blaine,

584
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:25,155
and for Kurt, a Shirley Temple
with extra cherries.

585
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:27,152
I heard you're the
designated driver.

586
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,329
Like, all the time.

587
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,826
Cheers, boys.

588
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:31,995
To the glamorous life.

589
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,279
 I thought you loved me,
but it seems you don't care 

590
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:40,256
 I care enough to know I can
never love you 

591
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:44,755
 Who broke my heart?
You did, you did... 

592
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,052
You better watch
your boyfriend.

593
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,037
Could I get another
beer, please?

(Thelma Houston's "Don't Leave
Me This Way" plays)

So, how's life
at your new school?

596
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,682
Fine.

597
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:03,621
Look, I just want to have a
normal senior year and play

598
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,987
football without my teammates
hearing rumors about me.

599
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:09,604
Just so that you know, I would
have never told anyone.

600
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,532
It's not who I am.

601
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:16,700
So, you come here
all the time?

602
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:21,259
People like me here.
I feel accepted.

I'm what they call a bear cub.

604
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,603
Because you look like Yogi?

605
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:27,621
I don't know, because
I'm burly or something.

606
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,436
So... so is this the point
where you judge me?

607
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,327
No, as long as you're not
beating people up, I am all for

608
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:39,974
being whoever you have to
be at your own speed.

609

 Oh, baby,
don't leave me this way 

610
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:48,263
Right now, I'm just trying
to get through high school.

Here's to baby steps.

 Your tender kiss
Baby steps.

 Don't leave me this way

 Baby, my heart is full of love
and desire for you

 Now come on down and do what
you gotta do

 You started this fire down in

I want to live here.

And I just want to make art

624

and you know, just help people.

625
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,513

people make fires with your breath.

Hey, come on,
I only h one beer.

Sure, you did.
Hey.

628
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:32,275
What?
Kiss me. Kiss me.

629

Oh, no, no, no, no...
Come on...

630
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,695
Come on, you're riding
in the back. Come on.

throw up that way.

Whoa, wait! Okay...

635
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,150
All right, Blaine, all right.
Cold hand, cold hand!

Come on, come on.
Hey, Kurt, let's just do it.

00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,794
I... I want you.
No, no...

638
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:48,525
I want you so...
No, Blaine, no, just... Stop it...

639
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:51,427
Hey, listen, I-I know you wanted
to do it in a field of lilacs

640
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:54,007
with Sting playing in the background and
all that, but who cares where we are?

641
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,344
It's all about us, right?
Right, it's about us.

642
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,346
Which is why I don't want
to do it on a night

643
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,215
that you spent half of
dancing with another guy

644
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,374
and that you're sober enough
to remember it the next day!

645
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,878
Why are you yelling at me? Because I have never
felt less like being intimate with someone

646
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:08,317
and either you can't tell
or you just don't care.

647
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:09,844
(sighs)

648
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
Where are you going?

649
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm sorry if I'm trying to
be spontaneous and fun.

650
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:21,411
I think I'm just
gonna walk home.

651
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:23,563
Blaine!

652
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,779
(sighs):
God!

653
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,749
(audience murmuring)

654
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:47,502
Just so you know, your
Maria has disappointed you.

655
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,438
I'm still a virgin.

656
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,892
And your Tony has
disappointed you.

657
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,437
- Me, too.
- Look, the audience is smart.

658
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:57,232
The only sensible solution is to
just cancel the show.

659
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,560
I'd rather send everybody home than
give a false, inauthentic performance.

660
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:02,167
Five minutes!

661
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,729
Rachel, darken your eyebrows.
Blaine, tone down the blush.

662
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:07,907
My eyebrows are fine.

663
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,704
Artie? Artie, are you okay?
You look upset.

664
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,255
Everything is wrong.

665
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,245
The scenery, the costumes,
the staging.

666
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:29,240
You know, I thought if I just
pretended like I knew

667
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,012
what I was doing I could lie my
way through it,

668
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,906
but in five minutes that curtain
is going to go up

669
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,612
and everybody is going to know
that I'm a fraud.

670
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,575
Artie, you were brilliant.

671
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,714
Really, this show is absolutely amazing,
and that is all thanks to you.

672
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:44,702
It's awful.
I let everybody down.

673
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,944
Hey, Artie, some of the cast needs
to talk to you before we go on.

674
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,275
See? It's mutiny.

675
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,444
Dude, we have a problem.

676
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:56,478
We haven't officially thanked you for
everything that you've done for us.

677
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,122
All of us were so nervous, and we
didn't know what we were doing

678
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:09,841
and you were like the lighthouse
that lead us to the way.

679
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:11,713
But I didn't know what I was
doing, either.

680
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:16,817
When you're in a chair,
it hard to...

681
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,424
ever feel
like you've grown up.

682
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:24,195
Everyone's always doing stuff
for you,

683
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:26,339
they get freaked out about
saying the wrong thing,

684
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,222
so... they coddle you.

685
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,686
Sometimes it's hard to ever
picture a life

686
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,422
of being totally
self-sufficient.

687
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,890
But directing you ys,

688
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,233
the way you trusted me,

689
00:31:38,283 --> 00:31:42,582
the way you looked at me
and listened to me,

690
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,627
it was the first time in my life
that I ever...

691
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:47,007
felt like a grown man.

692
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:51,486
That's the greatest gift
you can give a guy, so...

693
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,155
So, thank you guys...

694
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:57,668
for the flowers and for
everything.

695
00:31:57,678 --> 00:31:58,917
All right, show circle.

696
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:00,151
(relieved laughter)

697
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,322
May I, chief?

698
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,920
Let's kick some ass!

699
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:05,709
(collective cheer)

700
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:15,524
When I think about how we came
to America!

701
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:17,778
Like children! Believing!
Trusting!

702
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,338
Ah, trusting with our hearts
open...

703
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:21,679
With our arms open...

704
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,387
(Irish accent): You
came with your mouth open.

705
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,303
We gotta work on this
kid's diction.

706
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:29,660
Without a doubt, the best
musical McKinley's ever done.

707
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,306
We'll see. It's a risky artistic
choice weaving the Jets

708
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,143
into "America,"
but Artie insisted.

709
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,034
(Latin music plays)

710
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:38,644
I just hope that people go with
it, you know?

711
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:42,154
 Puerto Rico 

712
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:45,319
 My heart's devotion 

713
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:49,822
 Let it sink back
in the ocean 

714
00:32:49,856 --> 00:32:51,324
(laughing)

715
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:56,293
 Always the hurricanes
blowing 

716
00:32:56,327 --> 00:33:01,500
 Always
the population growing 

717
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:04,215
 And the money owing 

718
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,544
 And the sunlight streaming 

719
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:10,222
 And the natives steaming 

720
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,843
 I like the island Manhattan 

721
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:15,012
I know you do!

722
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:17,935
 Smoke on your pipe 

723
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,715
 And put that in 

724
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,684
 I like to be in America 

725
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:28,988
 Okay by me in America 

726
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,241
 Everything free in America 

727
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,394
(all shout)

728
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:40,033
 Lots of new housing
with more space 

729
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:44,085
 Lots of doors slamming
in our face 

730
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,455
 I'll get
a terrace apartmt 

731
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:49,285
 Better get rid
of your accent 

732
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:52,256
 Life can be bright
in America 

733
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:54,740
BOYS:
 If you can fight in America 

734
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,873
GIRLS:
 Life is so bright in America 

735
00:33:56,907 --> 00:34:00,466
 If you're all-white
in America 

736
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:06,352
 La-la, la-la-la, America 

737
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,417
 La-la, la-la-la,
America 

738
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,639
 La-la, la-la-la, America 

739
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:13,780
 America! 

740
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,761
 Here you are free
and you have pride 

741
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,980
 Long as you stay
on your own side 

742
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,230
 Free to be anything
you choose 

743
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,867
 Free to wait tables
and shine shoes 

744
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,286
 I like to be in America 

745
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:33,703
 Okay by me in America 

746
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:35,445
 Everything free in America 

747
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:38,576
 For a small fee in America 

748
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,280
 I like to be in America 

749
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:42,447
 Okay by me in America 

750
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:45,124
 Everything free in America 

751
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,000
 For a small fee in America 

752
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:49,119
 La-la, la-la-la, America 

753
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:51,551
 La-la,
la-la-la, America 

754
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:54,309
 La-la, la-la-la, America 

755
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,791
 La-la,
la-la-la, America! 

756
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:02,486
(cheering, shouting)

757
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,669
How are we, as virgins,
supposed to follow that?

758
00:35:21,676 --> 00:35:24,324
Tony and Maria
were soul mates, okay?

759
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:27,334
Against all odds,
they found each other.

760
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,656
I know what that's like.

761
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,282
And you do, too.

762
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:35,104
So we just have
to play that, okay?

763
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:36,487
We, as actors,

764
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,722
have to tap into that.

765
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,268
Okay?

766
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:56,107
(quiet whooshing)

767
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,524
Shouldn't you be celebrating?

768
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,809
I'm going over this move.

769
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:05,051
I messed it up tonight.

770
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:06,555
I know I can do it better.

771
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,527
Beauty of the stage...

772
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,527
we get to do it all over again
tomorrow night.

773
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,091
Personally, I thought both of
you guys were perfect.

774
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:16,208
Thank you.

775
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:17,781
Your Officer Krupke killed.

776
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,718
Brought the house down.

777
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:22,133
Well, I can't help
but pull focus, sorry.

778
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:23,451
Don't apologize.

779
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:25,488
It was great.

780
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,804
All your friends
were here tonight.

781
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:31,647
The Warblers...
Sebastian...

782
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,972
They were all loving it.

783
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,818
Come here.

784
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:40,234
Give me your hand.

785
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,515
Hold it to your heart.

786
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:45,967
Just like the song?
Like the song.

787
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:49,478
Kurt...

788
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,313
Sebastian doesn't mean
anything to me.

789
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,653
And you were right...

790
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:58,873
our first time
shouldn't be like that.

791
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:03,133
I was drunk and... I'm sorry.

792
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,164
Well, sure beats the
last time you were drunk

793
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:06,375
and made out with Rachel.

794
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:07,790
(sighs)

795
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,865
(both laughing)

796
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:11,974
But I'm sorry, too.

797
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:14,338
I wanted to be your
gay bar superstar but...

798
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:18,679
try as I might, I'm still
just a silly romantic.

799
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,994
It's not silly.

800
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:26,298
You take my breath away.

801
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,524
Not just now;
tonight on that stage.

802
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:30,226
I was so proud
to be with you.

803
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:32,190
I hope so.

804
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:35,545
I want you to be.

805
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:42,977
Um... Artie's having
an after party at Breadstix.

806
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,840
Would you... accompany me?

807
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:48,050
No.

808
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,774
I want to go to your house.

809
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:53,089
Okay.

810
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,714
(dogs barking in distance)

811
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,472
(knocking)

812
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,167
Hi.

813
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,254
I got your flowers.

814
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,303
They were beautiful.

815
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,749
You were really good.

816
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:17,103
Can I come in?

817
00:38:17,138 --> 00:38:18,741
Yeah.

818
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,029
Where is everybody?

819
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:27,615
Kurt's out with Blaine,

820
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:30,455
and Burt and Carole left
for Toledo right after the show.

821
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,006
They got some kind of
meet-and-greet in the morning,

822
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,096
so... spending the night.

823
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,081
Why didn't you stay for
the after party?

824
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,575
I mean, I know that you're still
mad at me abouthe other night.

825
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,220
He didn't like me.

826
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,489
What? Who?

827
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,227
The recruiter.

828
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:48,836
<i>He watched the game and then</i>

829
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,388
<i>I waited like an idiot
for 20 minutes</i>

830
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:52,622
<i>while he talked to Shane.</i>

831
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>I didn't even shower
or change out of my uniform,</i>

832
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,944
<i>because I was afraid
I'd miss him.</i>

833
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,175
So you guys
are going after Shane?

834
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:02,429
Kid's a monster.

835
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:05,122
Look, kid,

836
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:07,348
just 'cause your football career
ends in high school,

837
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:09,991
it doesn't mean
your life does.

838
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,938
Wait... I don't,
I don't understand

839
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,152
what any of this means.
It means I suck!

840
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,650
It means I'm gonna
be stuck here forever.

841
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,437
Cooter's not
gonna recruit me!

842
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:20,418
He said I...
I'd reached my ceiling.

843
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:22,098
There are other colleges.

844
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,638
Like there are other schools
for you besides NYADA?

845
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,065
I'm not good enough!

846
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:27,292
I'm not a good enough
quarterback

847
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,201
to get a scholarship!

848
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,590
I'm not a good enough singer
to get into NYADA!

849
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:32,342
It's all over for me!

850
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,296
Stop it!

851
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:34,894
Finn, look at me.

852
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:37,830
Your dreams are
not dead, okay?

853
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:38,711
You've just
grown out of them.

854
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:40,494
You have to find
new ones now.

855
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:41,832
I don't know how.

856
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:43,405
Then we'll figure
it out together.

857
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,458
You're special.

858
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:47,489
You know how I know that?

859
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:49,157
Because I'm going
to give you something

860
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:50,858
that no one else is
ever gonna get.

861
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:58,372
You... You don't need
to do this, okay?

862
00:39:58,374 --> 00:39:59,654
The play's over.
There's no point.

863
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,838
No, the point is, is that
I was wrong and stupid

864
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:04,742
and immature, and probably
not for the last time,

865
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:06,861
lost in my ambition and...

866
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,955
And now?

867
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,995
Now I'm just a girl,

868
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:14,029
here with a boy
that she loves,

869
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:16,009
and wanting to
remember this moment

870
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:18,342
for the rest of her life.

871
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,493
With this ring, I thee wed.

872
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,640
With this ring, I thee wed.

873

<i>("One Hand, One Heart"

 Make of our vows

00:40:55,894 --> 00:41:00,103
 One last vow 

880
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,831
<i> Only death </i>

881
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:06,543

 Death won't
