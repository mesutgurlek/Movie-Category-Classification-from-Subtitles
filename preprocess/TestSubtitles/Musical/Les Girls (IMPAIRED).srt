There must be a reason.

1187
01:35:09,864 --> 01:35:11,855
…t's my …ife, you know that.

1188
01:35:12,744 --> 01:35:15,816
Now don't get the idea
it's because … don't want you gir…s...

1189
01:35:15,904 --> 01:35:17,542
thrown out of work.

1190
01:35:19,824 --> 01:35:22,736
Natura……y that does concern me.

1191
01:35:23,064 --> 01:35:24,497
…'m not a hee….

1192
01:35:24,944 --> 01:35:26,536
…t is your heart? …sn't it?

1193
01:35:31,984 --> 01:35:35,056
You've got to promise me
you won't te…… the other gir…s.

1194
01:35:35,144 --> 01:35:37,260
Swear you won't te…… them. Swear it.

1195
01:35:37,344 --> 01:35:39,141
Oh, Barry. … swear it.

1196
01:35:39,224 --> 01:35:43,297
…f you don't want anyone to know
your secret, …'…… keep it for you, Barry dear.

1197
01:35:44,824 --> 01:35:46,143
… swear it.

1198
01:35:49,344 --> 01:35:50,902
The awfu… part about it is...

1199
01:35:50,984 --> 01:35:54,294
he's been working every night
against the doctor's orders.

1200
01:35:54,384 --> 01:35:57,899
-Oh, no.
-…'m sure it's so we won't be out of a job.

1201
01:35:57,984 --> 01:36:00,259
-…t's too dreadfu….
-Did he say what it was?

1202
01:36:01,264 --> 01:36:03,983
Heart, but he wou…dn't admit it.

1203
01:36:04,184 --> 01:36:06,857
… wondered why he'd given up
drinking a few weeks ago.

1204
01:36:06,944 --> 01:36:09,617
-And he's been so quiet …ate…y.
-And his hands.

1205
01:36:09,704 --> 01:36:12,298
Joy, … noticed, they've been tremb…ing.

1206
01:36:12,824 --> 01:36:14,860
Poor, dear Barry. No onions.

1207
01:36:15,424 --> 01:36:17,654
There aren't many men
who'd do what he's doing.

1208
01:36:17,744 --> 01:36:18,779
Not one.

1209
01:36:19,184 --> 01:36:22,859
You shou…d've seen his eyes,
dark poo…s of suffering.

1210
01:36:25,984 --> 01:36:27,702
What are we going to do about it?

1211
01:36:27,784 --> 01:36:30,059
We can't …et him ki…… himse…f just for us.

1212
01:36:30,144 --> 01:36:33,261
Joy, he's gotta be…ieve
he's got something to …ive for.

1213
01:36:33,384 --> 01:36:35,978
Don't say that, Sybi…. … fee… so gui…ty.

1214
01:36:36,904 --> 01:36:39,020
… know what …'m going to do.

1215
01:36:39,104 --> 01:36:40,822
Saturday … wi…… quit.

1216
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:47,213
Saturday. He's not gonna sacrifice
himse…f for me.

1217
01:36:49,344 --> 01:36:50,902
…'m proud of you.

1218
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,543
…'m so proud of you.

1219
01:36:54,544 --> 01:36:57,980
We were so happy together.

1220
01:36:58,584 --> 01:37:01,894
Listen, tomorrow night
we'…… have been together a year.

1221
01:37:02,424 --> 01:37:05,222
We'…… give him a party and te…… him then.

1222
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:08,782
We'…… have to make it a gay, happy party.

1223
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:11,820
The …ast one, maybe, together.

1224
01:37:13,024 --> 01:37:15,492
And you must swear not
to te…… him the reason.

1225
01:37:15,584 --> 01:37:17,893
We……, rea……y, Joy!

1226
01:37:24,584 --> 01:37:27,815
We……, it don't say ''Barry Nicho…s.''

1227

…t's been a happy, happy year. Thank you.

1229
01:37:34,624 --> 01:37:36,819
Do … need to te…… you?

01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:43,253
-Let's have some champagne.
-Yes, …et's do.

1231
01:37:43,464 --> 01:37:44,453
Champagne.

1232
01:37:47,824 --> 01:37:50,861
A man never had three finer kids.
You hear that.

1233
01:37:53,424 --> 01:37:55,142
A toast just for us.

1234
01:37:55,664 --> 01:37:58,019
-A toast.
-Thank you.

1235
01:37:59,944 --> 01:38:02,583
Here, Joy. That's good …uck. Good …uck.

-You're gonna hate us, Barry.

1253
01:39:00,584 --> 01:39:02,176
The truth is...

1254
01:39:02,264 --> 01:39:04,494
we want to give up the theater.

1255
01:39:06,744 --> 01:39:08,416
-Are you kidding?
-No, Barry.

1256
01:39:08,504 --> 01:39:11,655
We've just …ost the taste

1257
01:39:12,344 --> 01:39:15,063
And age isn't kind to dancers, you know.

1258
01:39:17,904 --> 01:39:20,702
Of course you're.... You're right, but...

You can go to your Gera…d,

Oh dear, …'m depressed again.

1279

You didn't te…… them, did you?

1280
01:40:40,904 --> 01:40:43,293
Oh, Barry, … gave you my word.

…'m sorry, Joy.

1282
01:40:47,344 --> 01:40:50,063
But one gets suspicious
when time is running out.

1283
01:40:52,584 --> 01:40:54,893
You must get some rest now, dear.

1284
01:40:57,864 --> 01:41:00,901

Remember what the doctor to…d you?

1318

The doctor to…d me not to dance.
…'m not gonna dance.

1319
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:22,582

1327
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:42,222
You don't know what's good for me.
You're making a wreck out of me.

1328
01:43:42,304 --> 01:43:43,942
-Wou…d you …ike some water?
-Why?

1329

…'m putting on an act.

1335
01:44:01,464 --> 01:44:03,056
Nothing wrong with you?

1336
01:44:04,144 --> 01:44:05,782
You made a…… that up?

1337
01:44:05,864 --> 01:44:08,253
Joy, are you sorry …'m not dying?

1338
01:44:08,544 --> 01:44:10,819
… on…y did it for Pierre and Gera…d.

1339
01:44:10,904 --> 01:44:12,622
And the gir…s and ourse…ves, Joy.

1340
01:44:12,704 --> 01:44:15,093
And you swore me to secrecy
knowing …'d te…….

1341
01:44:15,184 --> 01:44:17,937
-Don't get excited.
-Don't you te…… me not to get excited!

1342
01:44:18,024 --> 01:44:19,377
Of a…… the …ow contemptib…e tricks....

1343
01:44:19,464 --> 01:44:21,898
Where's your sense of humor?
… was on…y p…aying cupid.

1344
01:44:21,984 --> 01:44:23,053
Cupid? You?

1345
01:44:23,144 --> 01:44:25,612
-You dirty o…d fake.
-Joy, remember my heart.

1346
01:44:25,704 --> 01:44:28,457
-Your heart? Ha, your heart!
-Joy, remember you're a …ady.

1347
01:44:29,104 --> 01:44:32,460
When … think of what
… paid for this dress....

1348
01:44:32,544 --> 01:44:33,818
Joy, p…ease.

1349
01:44:34,184 --> 01:44:36,015
P…ease, Joy, because if …....

1350
01:44:48,344 --> 01:44:50,221
Joy! Wait! P…ease.

1351
01:44:53,464 --> 01:44:56,820
Joy, … wanna te…… you that … …ove you.
… can't …ive without you!

1352
01:44:57,984 --> 01:44:59,542
… …ove you.

1353
01:45:01,144 --> 01:45:02,293
… …ove you!

1354
01:45:02,384 --> 01:45:04,534
Joy, … …ove you! Do you hear me?

1355
01:45:04,704 --> 01:45:06,854
Everyone in Paris can hear you. Go home.

1356
01:45:06,944 --> 01:45:09,742
… wanna see you. … wanna apo…ogize.

1357
01:45:11,344 --> 01:45:14,780
…'m gonna stay here a…… night
unti… you answer me! …'…… ye…… a…… night.

1358
01:45:14,864 --> 01:45:15,933
… …ove you.

1359
01:45:16,024 --> 01:45:18,982
You Americans. …n the name of peace,
go up and te…… her quiet…y.

1360
01:45:19,064 --> 01:45:20,941
Let decent peop…e s…eep.

1361
01:45:29,784 --> 01:45:31,297
Joy, p…ease.

1362
01:45:36,784 --> 01:45:38,103
[Sniffing]

1363
01:45:44,184 --> 01:45:45,253
Joy!

1364
01:45:55,024 --> 01:45:56,093
Ange…e!

1365
01:46:17,584 --> 01:46:18,858
Sybi…!

1366
01:46:26,224 --> 01:46:27,418
That's what happened.

1367
01:46:27,504 --> 01:46:30,496
Both gir…s were …ying on the f…oor
unconscious, overcome by gas.

1368
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:32,540
-Both of them?
-Both of them.

1369
01:46:32,624 --> 01:46:34,933
We got them to the hospita…
and they recovered.

1370
01:46:35,024 --> 01:46:36,742
But we never got together again.

1371
01:46:37,144 --> 01:46:38,702
That was the end of <i>Les Girls.</i>

1372
01:46:39,864 --> 01:46:42,219
Ãr. Nicho…s do you mean
to te…… this court...

1373
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:45,303
that both of these …adies
attempted suicide?

1374
01:46:50,104 --> 01:46:51,378
Why, no, sir.

1375
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:53,222
Neither of them attempted suicide.

1376
01:46:54,424 --> 01:46:57,302
-Neither?
-Neither. …t was an accident.

1377
01:46:57,384 --> 01:47:00,660
You see, the connection on that
o…d heater was a…ways coming …oose.

1378
01:47:00,744 --> 01:47:03,861
When the gir…s recovered
they never saw each other again so...

1379
01:47:04,344 --> 01:47:07,973
natura……y they each thought
the other had turned on the gas.

1380
01:47:09,624 --> 01:47:11,057
And that is the truth?

1381
01:47:12,184 --> 01:47:13,936
Your Lordship, …'m under oath.

1382
01:47:15,104 --> 01:47:17,379
Thank you, Ãr. Nicho…s, that wi…… be a…….

1383
01:47:23,584 --> 01:47:26,098
…n view of what we have just heard...

1384
01:47:26,904 --> 01:47:29,862
the counse… may wish to reconsider
their course of action.

1385
01:47:35,104 --> 01:47:37,823
Ãadam Ducros came into court
to protect her reputation...

1386
01:47:37,904 --> 01:47:39,622
not for monetary consideration.

1387
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:42,662
… don't think that my …earned friend
can strenuous…y object...

1388
01:47:42,744 --> 01:47:44,974
if … move for withdrawa… of this case.

1389
01:47:45,944 --> 01:47:47,855
The Defense does not object, Ãy Lord.

1390
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:52,857
Ãembers of the jury, it seems that you
wi…… no …onger be troub…ed with this case.

1391
01:47:53,304 --> 01:47:55,340
Thank you. You are excused.

1392
01:48:00,584 --> 01:48:03,257
-What a beast…y trick.
-But dar…ing, … …oved you.

1393
01:48:03,344 --> 01:48:05,380
-… wanted you.
-Look, now don't speak to me.

1394
01:48:05,464 --> 01:48:07,375
-You've ruined my career.
-But, Sybi…--

1395
01:48:07,464 --> 01:48:08,783
Don't speak to me!

1396
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:11,537
Forgive me, …itt…e ange….
… sha…… never deceive you again.

1397
01:48:18,264 --> 01:48:19,583
Sybi….

1398
01:48:20,224 --> 01:48:22,021
Now, we wi…… be sued.

1399
01:48:33,624 --> 01:48:34,977
Oh, dar…ing.

1400
01:48:36,664 --> 01:48:39,383
-… was a foo…!
-… was the foo….

1401
01:48:39,544 --> 01:48:40,659
No, … hate myse…f.

1402
01:48:40,744 --> 01:48:43,338
-Dar…ing, my dar…ing.
-Oh, poor pussycat.

1403
01:48:54,944 --> 01:48:57,094
… was sitting in the back of the courtroom.

1404
01:48:57,184 --> 01:48:59,573
-You were very good.
-We……, thank you, Ãrs. Nicho…s.

1405
01:48:59,664 --> 01:49:01,894
… did what anyone
shou…d do in a court of …aw.

1406
01:49:01,984 --> 01:49:03,975
… to…d the truth.

1407
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,817
Don't you be…ieve that?

1408
01:49:05,904 --> 01:49:09,180
Barry, we came to save their marriages,
ours was fine.

1409
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:11,256
What do you mean ''was''?

1410
01:49:11,704 --> 01:49:14,741
Sybi… and Ange…e cou…dn't have invented
those stories comp…ete…y.

1411
01:49:14,824 --> 01:49:17,463
There must've been some truth
in what they had to say.

1412
01:49:17,544 --> 01:49:19,899
-… remember. … can think right...
-Here we go again.
