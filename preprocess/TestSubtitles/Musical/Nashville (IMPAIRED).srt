00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,400
on the first Tuesday
in November...

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,400
we have to make some vital decisions
about our management.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,000
Let me go directly
to the point.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,700
I'm for doing
some replacing.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
I've discussed
the Replacement Party...

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,100
with people
all over this country,

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,100
and I'm often confronted
with the statement:

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,300
"I don't want to get
mixed up in politics,"

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,800
or "I'm tired of politics,"
or "I'm not interested."

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,000
Almost as often someone says, "I
can't do anything about it anyway."

[Snare Drum:

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Let me point out two things.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Number one: All of us
are deeply involved with politics,

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,200
whether we know it or not
and whether we like it or not.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
And number two:

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,300
We can do something about it.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,300
When you pay more
for an automobile...

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,300
than it cost Columbus
to make his first voyage to America,

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
that's politics.

What did you say
the piano player's name was?

- Frog.
- Yeah.

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
When I ask for Pig,
I want Pig.

169

Now, you get me Pig, and then we'll
be ready to record this here tune.

This is Bill Jenkins on special
assignment for Channel Two News.

177
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,500
Here at Metro Airport we're awaiting
the arrival of Barbara Jean,

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
who has been away for treatment
at the Baltimore Burn Center.

179
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,000
Already,
prior to her arrival,

180
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,000
around 3,000 Barbara Jean fans and
supporters are here at the airport.

181
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,500
They are being held inside
the terminal by security police.

182
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,100
Ma'am, excuse me.
Am I late for Barbara Jean's plane?

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,700
- I don't think so.
- Thank you, ma'am.

184

Also, Haven Hamilton will make
an appearance here at Metro Airport.

186

[Walker On P.A.] There is
no question about being involved.

187
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,100
The question is,
What to do?

188
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
It is the very nature
of government...

189
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,500
to strain at a gnat
and swallow a camel.

190
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,200
As loyal citizens,
we accept our take-home pay,

191
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,800
understand
most of the deductions...

192
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,400
and even, to a degree,
come to expect them.

193
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,200
However, when the government
begins to force its citizens...

194
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,700
to swallow a camel,

195
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,000
it's time to pause
and do some accounting.

196
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Her plane has touched down and will
be turning onto the ramp area...

197
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,800
directly here in front of us
at Metro Airport.

198

Could you pass me
the crackers, please?

- Hi!

201
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,400
A... a caramel sundae,
please?

202
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,600
Honey, we ain't got
no caramel sundae.

203
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,700
- Butterscotch?
- Ain't got no butterscotch sundae.

204
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,200
- Oh.
- Got a strawberry.

205
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,100
- Strawberries are always in season.
- Fine, fine.

206
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,900
- That's fine. Thank you.
- Good for you too.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Thank you. Then I'll have
a strawberry sundae, if I may.

208
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,300
- [Woman] You got it.
- Thank you.

- One strawberry sundae!

210
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,800
Sueleen, did you see
what he just did?

211
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,400
He took the thing off the salt
and threw it up in the air.

212
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
Why'd you do that?

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
What are you doin'
in Nashville?

214
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
- Oh, I live here.

My wife is sick,
unfortunately.

Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

It's just one of those things
that happens.

- Happens in the best of families.
- [Chuckles] Yeah.

221
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,800
I wrote me this real hot song.
You wanna hear it?

It's called
"I Never Get Enough."

stepping out and will be greeted...

Of course, he's the president
of Barnett Enterprises.

are terrific.

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
[Barnett]
Get up here.

307
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Get on
the other side.

308
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,400
[Haven]
Here's our own Barbara Jean!

309
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
May I have a word,
Barnett?

310
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,300
Not here.
Come on. Come on.

311
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,800
Who do you think you are?
Marlon Brando?

312
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,300
[Haven]
Barbara Jean, ladies and gentlemen!

313
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,200
- Hi!
- Oh, look at that!

314
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
[Excited Chatter]

315
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Is that a sight!

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
Hello, Haven darling.

317
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Hi, Bill. Hi, Mary.
Where's Tom?

318
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,700
- Can you take my bag?
- Sure.

319
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,700
- The gate.
- Then let's go meet at the gate.

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
- Norman, let's go to the limo.
- The limo is just outside.

321
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,600
- Barbara Jean, for you.
- [Applause Continues]

322
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,900
- Thank you, Haven.
- Right here for the photographer.

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
Thank you, Tennessee Twirlers,
for coming out today,

324
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,700
and thank you,
Franklin High School Band.

325
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,700
I think you kids
get better every year.

326
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
[Applause Continues]

327
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,300
- [Band: Up-tempo March]
- [Man] Twirlers, let's twirl!

328
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,900
- [Crowd Gasps]
- Oh, little beauty!

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,100
Thank you so much!

330
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,700
Are you gonna ride into town
with me or not?

331
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Go on without me. I'm gonna wait,
'cause I think she's gonna sing.

332
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,800
Who, her?
She ain't gonna sing.

333
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
She don't sing
unless she gets paid.

334
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,000
I'd like to thank you for coming out
to greet me today.

335
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,200
It's great to be home.
It's as hot as a firecracker.

336
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,100
[Laughs]

337
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,100
[Barnett]
What's so funny about that?

338
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,600
Me and the boys are gonna be
out at the Opry this week,

339
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
and like my grandaddy
always used to say,

340
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,600
if you're down to the river
I hope you'll drop in.

341
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,700
- [Applause]
- [Haven] Ohh! Yes, that's sweet.

342
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,100
[Man]
Who writes your material, darlin'?

343
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,000
Barnett, who are
all those people inside there?

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,200
That's just airport security,
'cause of all the hijackers.

345
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,300
- Did they come to see me?
- They can see you pretty good.

346
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,700
Then I'd like to go in
and say hello.

347
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,400
[Pearl]
Aww, that's so sweet!

348
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,400
Barnett,
I'm sorry, darlin'.

349
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,800
[Reporter]
This is a little bit unscheduled.

350
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,700
She's on her way to greet some
of the fans that are inside there.

351
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,000
- Stepping on down with Barnett.
- Watch out for the water.

352
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,000
[Pearl]
That was real nice.

353
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,000
Right behind, Haven Hamilton and all
the other friends, members and, uh...

354
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,300
- [Woman Screams]
- She's fallen!

355
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,900
Harold, come on!
She's fallen somewhere down there!

356
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
- If we can get down there...
- [Shouting, Screaming]

357
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,100
Don't know how far
we can make it.

358
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,600
[Walker On P.A.] Who do you
think is running Congress?

359
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Farmers? Engineers?
Teachers? Businessmen?

360
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,500
No, my friends,
Congress is run by lawyers.

361
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,400
A lawyer is trained for two things
and two things only:

362
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,600
- [Siren Wailing]
- To clarify... that's one...

363
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,100
and to confuse...
that's the other thing.

364
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,900
He does whichever
is to his client's advantage.

365
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You ever ask a lawyer
the time of day?

366
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,000
He told you how to make a watch,
didn't he?

367
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,000
Ever ask a lawyer how to get to
Mr. Jones'house in the country?

368
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,400
You got lost, didn't you?

369
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,300
Congress is composed
of 535 individuals.

370
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,500
Two hundred and eighty-eight
are lawyers.

371
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,500
And you wonder
what's wrong in Congress.

372
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,500
No wonder we often know
how to make a watch,

373
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,500
but we don't know
the time of day.

374
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,900
- No wonder it takes 6 or 7 years...
- [Man Shouting, Hooting]

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
[Walker Continues, Faint]

376
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,100
What the hell
is the matter with you?

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,500
[Walker Continues On P.A.]
Yes, I'm talking about replacement...

378
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
replacing this lawyeristic,
red-taped...

379
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
and blank-taped government...

380
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
with the yes-and-no language
of farmers and teachers,

381
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
engineers and businessmen.

382
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm not pessimistic
about this country.

383
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,800
She finally collapsed here on
the sidewalk. Sort of a faint.

384
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,800
That's all we've been able
to determine at this moment.

385
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,900
We interviewed Mr. Sperry.
He said the same thing.

386
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,300
Haven Hamilton
said the same thing as well.

387
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,300
That's about it for the moment
from Metro Airport.

388
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,900
For Channel Two News,
this is Bill Jenkins reporting.

389
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,400
[Walker On P.A.]
Let's consider our national anthem.

390
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,400
Nobody knows the words.

391
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
Nobody can sing it.

392
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nobody understands it.

393
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,100
[Walker Continues] I suppose
all the lawyers supported it...

394
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,500
because a lawyer wrote the words
and a judge wrote the tune.

395
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Careful, Buddy.

396
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,800
- Read it through carefully.
- Watch out for that truck.

397
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,800
And I say read it
because I know you can't sing it.

398
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,000
Read all four verses and you'll
understand what I'm talking about.

399
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,500
Yes, sir, I would support work
and vote for replacement.

400
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Change
our national anthem...

401
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,700
- This is terrific, Norman.
- To something people understand,

402
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,500
back to something that would make
a light shine in their faces.

403
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Hey, man, get off my car!

404
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Don't lean on my car!

405
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,800
I just got this goddamn thing fixed,
so don't lean on it now.

406
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,300
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, God.

407
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Hey, man,
get the hell off my car!

408
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,600
[Wade]
You almost made me fall!

409
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,600
Okay, thanks.
You got one too?

410
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,900
Thanks a lot. Just keep those
cards and letters comin' in, folks.

411
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,500
- I cannot. I feel faint.
- I'm gonna get us a Popsicle.

412
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
- H-Hello!
- Those mangled bodies.

413
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,100
Would you go to that Popsicle truck
and get us a couple of sweet ices?

414
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,800
There must be 20 cars piled up,
one on top of the other.

415
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,200
- Oh, now, come on.
- I saw a leg sticking out.

416
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,700
This is gonna be a mess.
I don't know how long it, uh...

417
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,200
Can you just pull on through
where the ambulance went through?

418
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,500
You wanna come on in
and try it?

419
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,500
- What's the matter, son?
- I'm stalled.

420
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,500
- What did you want? Popsicle?
- I wish my cameraman had been here.

421
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,900
He's never around. I need something
like this for my documentary.

422
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,000
I need it.
It's... It's America.

423
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Those cars
smashing into each other...

424
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
and all those
mangled corpses...

425
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,100
Just a minute now.
Just a minute.

426
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,900
- [Radio: Country]
- Aren't there any rock stations?

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,900
Well, hard to really say.

428
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,900
You see,
after they opened her up...

429
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,400
they figured
they oughta do an exploratory.

430
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,100
You know, give her
kind of an overhaul.

431
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,100
- Twenty dollars?
- Twenty dollars.

432
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,600
- I'll give you five.
- No, I'll take 15.

433
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,100
You'll take 15?
I'll give you ten.

434
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,100
[Walker] I can think of
no sensible reason why New York...

435
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,100
must of necessity have
12,000 major crimes committed...

436
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,100
for every 1,000
committed in Tokyo.

437
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,300
- Yet these are the true victims.
- Excuse me.

438
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,100
Some very funny notions have
developed in American politics.

439
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,400
Let me see.
Um, have you any children?

440
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Yes, I have two children.
I have a boy and a girl.

441
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Oh, isn't that nice.
How old are they?

442
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,600
Twelve and eleven.

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,800
Do they want to be singers
like their mummy?

444
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,500
Uh, well,
my children are deaf.

445
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,300
They're... They are deaf.
They were born deaf.

446
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Oh, my God, how awful.

447
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,400
- It's so depressing.
- Now, just a minute. That's not so.

448
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,700
- I wish you could see my boy.
- Oh, I couldn't.

449
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,200
He has the most
incredible personality.

450
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,700
It's the sadness of it.

451
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,200
See, what happened is, he made
a million dollars on a fly swatter,

452
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,700
because it had
a red dot in the center.

453
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,700
- Fly swatter?
- That's right. Just a red dot.

454
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,800
He was sittin' in the buffet,
he was eatin', and he saw a woman...

455
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,700
and she was
swattin' flies.

456
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,300
And, uh, she...
Uh, he said,

457
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,300
"What makes the difference
in fly swatters?"

458
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,200
'Cause it has to do with
the industrial revolution.

459
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
The thing with
these country people is,

460
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
they have
a real grassroots appeal.

461
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
Oh, hell, they got fans.

462
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
And they're the people
that elect the president.

463
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
We're gonna do
everything we can.

464
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
You line up
a lot of movie stars...

465
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,200
People here feel that movie stars
are eccentric and crazy.

466
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,200
- Communists.
- Well... [Laughing]

467
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,000
- A lot of'em are.
- It's been said.

468
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,500
- I want to go to the Grand Ole Opry.
- Forget that.

469
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
- 'Cause I have to have my record...
- I don't like music.

470
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
- I'm gonna go see what's goin' on.
- I have a gold record.

471
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,700
- It needs to be signed.
- Get away from my truck!

472
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,400
- Goddamn it. Sons of bitches.
- Shit.

473
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,900
I say, could I please speak
to Mr. Tommy Brown?

474
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
I'm sorry. What?

475
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,900
Is it possible to have a few words
with Mr. Tommy Brown?

476
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm from the BBC. I'm doing
a documentary on Nashville.

477
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
What is the BBC?

478
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,600
- British Broadcasting Company.
- Oh, English.

479
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,600
It was called
"Wanda, Wander."

480
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,700
No, that song was called
"Wonder, Wanda."

481
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,300
- Wanda, wander's got me bad
- I don't have a pen.

482
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,900
- No... Wonder, Wanda's got me bad
- I keep travelin'

483
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,300
And I'm sad
Buddy, Buddy, which was it?

484
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,800
- I don't really know.
- Thank you, thank you.

485
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,600
- Goddamn it, it was "Wanda, Wander."
- It was "Wonder, Wanda."

486
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,600
- "Wanda, Wander"! "Wanda, Wander"!
- "Wonder, Wanda."

487
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,600
What difference does it make?
It was a hit!

488
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,500
[Walker On P.A.]
There's no breathing space.

489
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,800
What we need,
first and foremost,

490
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,300
is a common-sense approach.

491
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,300
Nothing complicated.

492
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Is Mr. Brown going to...
Will he be here soon?

493
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Yeah, he's in the back
changin'.

494
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,300
Whenever he's going to have an
interview, he puts his makeup on...

495
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
and likes to
get all prettied up.

496
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,800
[Laughing]
That's nice.

497
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,800
He must be
a marvelous person...

498
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,800
to have all you lovely people
working for him.

499
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,300
I know the problems in the South.
I mean, I've heard of them.

500
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,500
[Chuckles]
Well, yeah.

501
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,500
- He's a very liberal guy.
- Oh, that's lovely.

502
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,800
By the way, I'd like for you
to meet his wife. This is Joy.

503
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,800
- Mrs. Brown?
- Yes.

504
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,400
[Gospel Choir]
You may say that I ain't free

505
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,800
But it don't worry me

506
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,300
No, it don't

507
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,300
[Walker On P.A.]
Today in America,

508
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
with its unmatched resources,

509
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,100
it is exceedingly ridiculous,

510
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,800
a total absurdity...

511
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,500
that any citizen with any ailment,
mental or physical,

512
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,500
should go
medically unattended.

513
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,500
We're settin' up
everything for you.

514
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,000
- We got pictures the right height.
- Oh, yeah, the bird again.

515
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Isn't that beautiful.
I remember when you gave that to me.

516
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
I remember I almost threw it out.
[Laughs]

517
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,500
Good afternoon, girls.

518
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,700
I'd like you to wait
outside the room a while...

519
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,300
because I know Aunt Esther would
like to fix herself up a little.

520
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,400
I want my dog.
Where is my dog?

521
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,800
- I'm sorry. I've got a date.
- You do?

522
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,800
[Laughs]

523
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,800
- I just need one shot.
- I'm sorry. Could you excuse us?

524
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,300
- Come right on in, sir.
- How you doin', Howard?

525
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm sorry.
No press allowed.

526
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
- Put these pictures above your head.
- Fine, Buddy.

527
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,800
- Delbert, I got no time.
- I know, I know.

528
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,300
I just stopped by
to see Barbara Jean.

529
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,300
How you doin'?
How's lawyerin'?

530
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,800
Nobody pays me no mind.
I'm just like another flunky.

531
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,300
- Would you mind crankin' me up?
- More white carnations.

532
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Bud, what are you doin'?
This is a hospital!

533
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
This ain't no construction site!

534
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
- I am not the press.
- Go build another chair!

535
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Goddamn it.

536
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,000
I am not the press.
I am from the BBC.

537
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
Damned if I don't
keep my pledge.

538
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,400
- Look who's here. Mr. Brown.
- Glad you're here, but cut it short.

539
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,100
How do you do?
Nice to see you.

540
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,100
You look as beautiful
as a big black butterfly.

541

You better get outta here.

- You got it.

All right, everybody.
Doctor's gotta talk turkey.

546
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,700
Barnett, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

547
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,000
- John Triplette from California.
- John Triple?

548
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
- Triplette.
- Okay. All right.

549
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,600
- Okay.
- He's a killer.

550
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,600
- Give us some good news.
- Excuse us, please.

551
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,600
- Are you a relative?
- No, no.

552
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
- Can you tell me how she is?
- She's fine.

553
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's her husband
I'm concerned about.

554
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,400
[Barnett] Now say somethin'good.
You got two seconds.

- Can I have a light?
- Yeah, sure.

557

The incident you described just now
is very similar...

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,700
to what was diagnosed as
some kind of intestinal disorder.

She's dying to see you.

I'll be there in a minute.
I'm talking to someone right now.

- I'm talking to someone.
- I beg your pardon.

That's my uncle.

down the hall.

What do you do?

569
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,600
Well, I know
it sounds arrogant,

570
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,600
but I'm on my way to town,
if I ever make it,

571
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,200
to become a country-western
singer or star.

572
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah? What are you gonna do
if you don't?

573
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,700
If I don't? I don't kn...
Oh, I could always go into sales.

574
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
- Like ladies' clothes?
- No... I don't know.

575
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Well, I know all about trucks,
so I'd go into trucking, I guess.

576
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,700
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not kiddin' you.

577
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm in a truck enough. And I know
how to fix motors and all that.

578
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,000
- Nobody'd buy trucks from a girl.
- I been fixin' motors a long time.

579
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
They'd buy 'em from me
'cause I know all about motors.

580
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,000
Why do you say that?

581
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,300
See, what's happenin' is, if I can't
sell trucks and I can't go...

582
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
- Nobody'd buy a truck from a girl.
- I knew this was gonna happen.

583
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,000
Don't say you saw me.

Hey, you haven't seen
my wife, have ya?

- She's sort of ordinary-lookin'.
- Uh-uh.

Are you going into town?

You're not one of them
country singers, are ya?

588
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,000
- No. Can you give me a ride?
- All right, get in.

589
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,700
You look like a guy
I was in the navy with.

590

He wouldn't bathe, so we had to pee
in his bed to get him discharged.

I'm here to sing you all a couple
of songs tonight that I wrote.

your aunt and uncle?

Oh, it's cool.
I can see them anytime.

00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,800
- He's telling about swimming class.
- Oh.

756
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,300
Did you swim today?
Did you learn anything?

757
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,300
- Huh?
- Hush! Let him tell it.

758
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,200
Then the coach said, "Ready?"
I said, "Yeah. Oh, boy."

759
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,100
Did it how I used to.

760
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,800
Then I went down
to the diving board...

761
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,600
and went... Whoo!
And touched bottom.

762
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
And I kept goin' through.
Walked on the bottom.

763
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,700
And then I come out.

764
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,500
Then I get two cards:
"Goldfish"and...

765
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,000
and "Passed the test."

766
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,000
- [Linnea Laughs]
- How about that?

767
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,700
They call you Gol...
They call you Goldfish?

768
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,500
Goldfish.
That's it.

769
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
- [Applause]
- Oh, dynamite! Dynamite!

770
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,100
Sueleen,
I'm so proud of you, baby.

771
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
- Thank you.
- You knocked 'em out up there.

772
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,600
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

773
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,100
All the people were goin'crazy!
Darlin', you're outta sight!

774
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Oh, my goodness.

775
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,800
Oh, that's beautiful. Honey,
it takes an attitude to be a star.

776
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,900
- What can I tell you?
- Do I get thejob, then?

777
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
I got you a job
while you were singin'.

778
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,400
You did? Ohh!

779
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,500
A friend of mine called.
Very heavy.

780
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,500
There's a party
Monday night.

781
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,600
The pay is not much because
it's a low-budget thing... $ 10.

782
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
I don't care about the money.

783
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,300
This must be
some sort of amateur night.

784
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,800
- You're gonna be a star.
- I gotta make a phone call.

785
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,800
I'll be right back.

786
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,800
They are good, babe.

- [Phone Rings]
- Mmm, I have to get that.

788
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
- That's all right. Go on.
- [Jimmy] Where you goin'?

789
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,300
- Telephone.
- [Ringing Continues]

790
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,000
Mmm. Hello.

791
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,000
- [Tom] Hi. Linnea?
- Mm-hmm.

792
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,400
- I'm here.
- Who is it?

793
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,400
This is Tom.

794
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,900
Just a minute.
I have something in my mouth.

795
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,900
- I was eatin' dinner.
- You haven't changed a bit.

796
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,900
- Now, who is it?
- This is Tom. Don't you remember?

797
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,900
No, I don't believe I do.

798
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,900
[Laughs] We met in the control
room at the recording studio...

799
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,900
about two months ago.

800
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,500
- Oh, yes. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

801
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I'm just fine.
What are you doin' in Nashville?

802
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm gonna do some recording.
I'm here for a couple weeks.

803
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,500
- I'd really like to see you.
- Come out to the house.

804
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,400
The children
would love to meet you.

805
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,400
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

806
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,900
Look, I find you very attractive
and I'd like to see you.

807
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,700
Well, I think it'd be fine if we had
dinner some night here at the house.

808
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,700
- You've never met my husband Del.
- I see. You can't talk now.

809
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I'll call you later. I'm going home.
I'll call you when I get there. Bye.

810
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,700
- Wh... Uh, I'd like to...
- [Receiver Clicks]

811
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,600
Um...

812
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,300
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Thank you for calling.

813
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
- He's done well in those primaries.
- He sure has.

814
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
That's the key to it.

815
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Who was it, babe?

816
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,500
Oh, down at
the recording studio.

817
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,900
I left some,
uh, music down there.

818
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,800
- What kind of a gun is it?
- A.38 Smith and Wesson special.

819
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,800
Uh, this particular gun's
a stainless steel gun.

820
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,300
Did you ever have to shoot it?

821
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,400
We had to shoot it
to qualify on the range,

822
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
but I've never had to
kill anyone with it.

823
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,100
'Course, there's been occasions
where I have had to use it to...

824
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
See ya later, alligator.

825
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,500
Am I too late?

826
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,500
Well, Esther's asleep now.

827
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
She's looking forward
to seeing you in the morning.

828
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,600
[Walker On P.A.] If the chairman
of the board of your company...

829
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,400
had been running your business...

830
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,200
the way Washington
has been running our business,

831
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,800
you'd be asking
a lot of questions,

832
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,100
and you would find out
what you already know...

833
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,500
we have some problems
that money alone won't solve.

834
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,500
Now, I know something
about money.

835
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,500
Anybody who grew up without it
knows a lot about money.

836
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,500
I know more about money
than some of the rich,

837
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,500
because I never had any
until I was 27.

838
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,000
I know something
of what money can do,

839
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,300
and more important, I know
something of what it can't do.

840
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,000
Does it make sense to let petroleum
giants increase prices at will,

841
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,500
- adding to a staggering profit...
- Watch where you're going!

842
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,600
But tell the little filling station
owner in his khakis...

843
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,600
- he can't charge one penny more?
- What's wrong with you, you dope?

844
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,800
To tax the salaries of people
on poverty-level income,

845
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,800
I don't need that shit,
you stupid...

846
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,700
then give back in food stamps
twice the amount of the tax.

[Walker Continues]
If there's any cleaning up done,

849
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,800
we're going to have to do it.

850
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,100
The Lord is not
going to do the replacing,

851
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,300
and the powers that be are certainly
not going to replace themselves.

852
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,000
That old truth remains: There is
no such thing as a free lunch.

853
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
- Hello.
- If the books are to be balanced,

- What's your name again?

858
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,000
- Kenny. Kenny Fraiser.
- All right, sir, right this way.

859
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100

with me if you want.

00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,400
- All the world is takin'sides
- I don't know why.

906
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,800
- But it don't worry me
- Certainly not the decor, was it?

907
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,900
Must have been dreaming.

908
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,000
In my empire
life is sweet

909
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,500
I was there for about a year
on a kibbutz.

910
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,200
I was feeling very romantic about
that kind of socialism at the time.

911
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,700
I thought I'd like
to have a bash at it.

912
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,000
[Ring]

913
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,600
- Hello.
- Can I talk to Linnea, please?

914
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,600
- Del, I'm on the phone.
- Okay.

915
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,600
How are you? Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call sooner, but...

916
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,400
- Who is this?
- [Chuckles] This is Tom.

917
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Tom who?

918
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Oh, come on.

919
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,500
- Who is this? Tom who?
- This is Tom. Listen...

920
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I don't know who you are,
I don't know why you're calling,

921
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
and I want you to stop it.

922
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,000
- You know you want to see me.
- I never said any such thing.

923
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,500
And I'm not foolin'.
Don't you ever call here again!

924
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
- [Click]
- What's goin' on... Hello? Linnea?

925
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Hello?

926
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,300
Who was that, babe?

927
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,300
Just some crazy person
been callin' here.

928
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,600
Next time he calls, you tell him
you're gonna get the police on him.

929
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,400
Okay.

930
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,200
- Come on. Sing
- [Singing Along]

931
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,600
Sing a song

932
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,700
Make it simple to

933
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,200
Last your whole life long

934
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,800
Just sing

935
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,700
Sing a song

936
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,700
Yeah, he watched that.

937
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,200
[Woman]
How do you get outside, please?

938
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,200
- Dial "9."
- Oh, hi, Mr. Green.

939
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,200
Look at those flowers.
Did you grow those?

940
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,200
Esther and I did, yes.

941
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,600
My niece here picked 'em.
She's from California.

942
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Oh, that's good.

943
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,500
They're so healthy.
Let me check and see if she's awake.

944
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,000
There's no reason
why I can't use the phone.

945
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,500
May I see your credentials?

946
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,600
- I'll be happy to show them to you.
- Hi.

947
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,700
- Holy dogshit! Look at that!
- What is that?

948
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,700
That must be
some friends of Buddy's.

949
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,700
[Winifred]
Uh, Little Women.

950
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,700
Little Women!

951
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,700
Ever since that Easy Rider movie,

952
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,400
that's the kind of bike
everybody's been drivin'...

953
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,400
long, low, laid back in front.

954
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,400
- They're so dangerous, aren't they?
- They are.

955
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,400
Over here at Baptist Hospital
there's a whole ward of young boys,

956
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,400
the cutest, best-lookin' boys
you'd ever want to see,

957
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
paralyzed from the waist down.

958
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Oh!
Excuse me.

959
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,300
Thank you for the ride, darling.

960
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,300
Break a leg.

961
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,300
- Have you passed the bar yet?
- Oh, yeah. [Chuckles]

962
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,800
- Not that bar.
- No, I know... Excuse me.

963
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,400
- Well, well, well. Young Hamilton.
- How are you?

964
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.

965
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Give us a kiss, love.

966
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,900
You're a shy young man,
aren't you?

967
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,000
- Is your dad around?
- Uh, yes, he is, but...

968
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,000
Do you think I could have
a little chat with him?

969
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,500
He's kinda tied up right now,
but maybe you could...

970
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,500
- Is your mom around?
- No. My mom is in Paris.

971
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,400
- [Opal] This is Bergman.
- [Buddy] I like it.

972
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,700
- It's kinda nice.
- Pure, unadulterated Bergman.

973
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,700
It's beautiful.
You live here?

974
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,700
Yeah, we do.
We've been here for quite a while.

975
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,700
Lucky you! It's so gorgeous.
I've never seen...

976
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,100
Of course, the people are all wrong
for Bergman, aren't they?

977
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,600
Well, I suppose
you're interested in horses.

978
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,600
Uh, yeah.
I like horses. Sure.

979
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,100
Honey, you should arrange for him
to visit one of our horse shows.

980
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,300
Haven breeds those famous Tennessee
Walkers you've heard about.

981
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,800
- Oh, really?
- Oh, he knows all about Walkers.

982
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,500
That is not the kind of walker
I had in mind.

983
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,500
- That's very fast.
- We have to be.

984
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Well, she had this
most horrible accident.

985
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,100
- Hi, Marie. How are you?
- How are you?

986
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,100
She got a lick on the head
gettin' into one of those tiny cars.

987
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,100
Her daughter's car.

988
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,100
This happened
almost a year ago.

989
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,100
No one had any idea this was gonna
develop into such a horrible thing.

990
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Mr., uh, Triplette,

991
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,800
I'm sorry ol' Delbert told you Haven
would appear at the political rally.

992
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,000
He knows better than that.

993
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,500
We'd never let Haven Hamilton
take sides politically.

994
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,300
Uh, you understand we give
contributions to everybody.

995
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,900
[Haven]
And they are not puny contributions.

996
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,200
Only time I ever went
hog-wild around the bend...

997
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,900
was for the Kennedy boys.

998
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,100
But they were different.

999
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Oh, yes, ma'am, they were.

1000
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
[Pearl]
That's a fact.

1001
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,200
Excuse me a minute.

1002
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,700
Thank you, Brenda.

1003
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,200
[Man] Is this party
somebody's birthday, or...

1004
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,700
[Woman] No, this is, uh...
I'm sure you've seen Haven Hamilton.

1005
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,700
No, I never heard of him.
Do we get out here?

1006
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,700
Let me, uh...

1007
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,700
Let me get that door.

1008
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,700
Listen, I wanted to ask...

1009
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
Would it be all right
if I asked Mr. Gould a question?

1010
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
You wanna ask me something?

1011
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,200
We're gonna be riding back with you.
Could we wait until then?

1012
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,700
I just wanted to know what
you were doing in Nashville.

1013
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,200
I'm just coming to a party.
What are you doing in Nashville?

1014
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,200
- Well, I'm stuck here.
- Yeah?

1015
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,200
We'll see you in a bit.

1016
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,200
Haven is singing tonight
at the Grand Ole Opry,

1017
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,200
and this is just a previous
sort of party for his friends.

1018
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,900
Right. He's got a lot
of photographers here, huh?

1019
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
What are you doing here, anyway?

1020
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I came on a date, and now
I'm goin' to the Grand Ole Opry.

1021
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,000
How you gon' go
to the Grand Ole Opry?

1022
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,000
You came with a date.
Is he gonna take you?

1023
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,600
Huh? No, he...

1024
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,600
They left.

1025
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,600
No, I'm promoting a movie,
but I'm not making one.

1026
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,600
Are you a personal friend
of Mr. Hamilton's?

1027
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,900
Yeah, we're good friends.

1028
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,900
Um, no, I'm not a singer.
I'm a businessman.

1029
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,400
I take care of
all Dad's business.

1030
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,700
- You're a businessman?
- Yeah.

1031
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,700
With that face?
[Giggles]

1032
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
You can't be a businessman.

1033
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,700
Yeah, l... I work
with, uh, Dad's company.

1034
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,800
I take care of his records.

1035
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,400
Anything that comes in
comes though me.

1036
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's great. It really is.

1037
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,100
Dad's wanted me to do that
all his life.

1038
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,200
I'd be the last guy in the world
to try and change your mind...

1039
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,400
about something
you don't want to do,

1040
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,400
but I'd like to explain
a couple things...

1041
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
about what we're trying to do
in this campaign...

1042
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,500
before you discount it altogether.

1043
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:01,400
And somehow the blood began
to drain into behind her eyeball,

1044
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,400
and the pressure caused her eye
just to bulge out.

1045
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,600
It was just awful-lookin'. Everybody
thought she was gonna lose her eye.

1046
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,100
We still don't
know how it's gon' come out.

1047
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,600
I don't know how you're gonna
feel about this, but...

1048
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,900
Walker thinks that you'd make
a fine governor in this state.

1049
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,000
He thinks the time's right.

1050
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,000
He thinks the people of Tennessee
love you. He knows they do.

1051
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,500
He knows how you feel about them.

1052
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,500
And he wants you to know that,

1053
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,000
should the time come
you want to run,

1054
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,700
he'll be there with his organization
to back you all the way.

1055
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,800
Elliot Gould,
Delbert and Linnea Reese.

1056
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,900
- Mrs. Reese.
- And Mrs. Dorster. Elliot Gould.

1057
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
You gonna be
at Opryland tonight?

1058
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,400
Well, l... I hadn't
thought I would be.

1059
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,700
Well, I'm gonna be
at Opryland tonight.

1060
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,200
Well, sure, I'll be there.

1061
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,200
Yes, I guess you will.

1062
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,200
And that's when
I'll give you my decision.

1063
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,400
Well, thank you so much
for thinking about it. Terrific.

1064
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,800
- Is Haven around?
- He's right around the corner.

1065
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,000
Would you check and see
if it's all right if we come?

1066
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,700
I see him with other people.
Thank you, Del.

1067
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,700
- Do you want to be a singer?
- Oh, l...

1068
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,700
- Look at me.
- I think everybody...

1069
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,700
Dad wouldn't hear of it.

1070
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,500
But you want to be a singer.

1071
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,500
- I know him. That's Elliot Gould.
- This guy?

1072
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,500
- He's a well-known actor.
- Oh, yes, with the curly hair.

1073
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,500
Yeah. He was married
to Barbra Streisand.

1074
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,900
- He's grossin' real big.
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

1075
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,900
No.
That girl that sang "People."

1076
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,000
I just shook the man's hand
like he was somebody off the street.

1077
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,500
- Oh, Delbert. Bring him on over.
- [Pearl Laughs]

1078
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
- Yes, sir, I'll...
- [Pearl] Oh, Delbert!

1079
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
We all walk on the street,
Delbert.

1080
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,500
- [Triplette, Pearl Laughing]
- [Haven] Oh, Delbert, Delbert.

1081
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,400
Listen, you all come over.
Haven wants to meet you right away.

1082
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,100
I didn't realize who you were
when we first were introduced here.

1083
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,100
You wrote a song?

1084
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,100
Yeah, I wrote one song
in my life.

1085
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,600
- I'd love to hear it.
- You sure?

1086
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,600
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1087
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,100
The sound of her hello

1088
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,000
Soft and tenderly

1089
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,900
The way she lights my morning

1090
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,300
With her smile

1091
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,800
And when she says I need you

1092
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,400
Oh, I really need you

1093
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,500
It makes my life so worthwhile

1094
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,700
'Cause it comes from the heart

1095
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,900
Of a gentle woman

1096
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,000
It comes from the soul

1097
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,600
Of an angel from above

1098
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,600
And I'll stay in the heart

1099
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,000
- Of a gentle...
- That's Elliot Gould!

1100
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,900
Ha!
It's Elliot Gould!

1101
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, let me meet
the movie star!

1102
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,300
- Lady Pearl, Elliot Gould.
- Howdy!

1103
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,300
- Haven Hamilton.
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Gould?

1104
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,900
It's so nice to meet you. Welcome
to Nashville and to my lovely home.

1105
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,600
- Elliot! Elliot Gould!
- What brings you here?

1106
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,600
- Oh, hello. Well, I'm just, uh...
- Hello!

1107
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,600
- You look marvelous.
- Who is this?

1108
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,600
- Another of your unexpected guests?
- I'm Opal from the BBC.

1109
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,000
Remember the Cannes Film Festival?
No, of course you wouldn't.

1110
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,500
- Is she connected with Mr. Gould?
- No, she's not.

1111
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,600
What are you doing...
What am I doing in Nashville?

1112
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,800
- Excuse me...
- I'm doing this documentary...

1113
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,800
Excuse me, but Mr. Gould
does not give interviews.

1114
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,900
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here,

1115
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,400
but I will not tolerate rudeness in
the presence of a star... two stars.

1116
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,000
- We met at the Cannes...
- Just take her, Delbert. Good-bye.

1117
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Mr. Hamilton!

1118
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,600
- It's gonna be all right. Listen...
- Who are you?

1119
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,900
- Well, that's the price of success.
- It certainly is.

1120
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,400
[Country]

1121
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,400
[Announcer] Go get a Goo Goo,
friends, and settle back...

1122
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,900
for 30 of the goodest minutes
in radio...

1123
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,900
the Goo Goo Grand Ole Opry!

1124
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's sent your way
by the makers of Goo Goo,

1125
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
the goodest candy bar
in the world,

1126
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,200
and King Leo pure stick candy,
the candy that roars with flavor.

1127
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,700
Now a big welcome,
if you please,

1128
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,700
for the Goo Goo man of the hour,
Tommy Brown!

1129
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,600
[Applause]

1130
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,400
I've been goin' down that
long lonesome road, babe

1131
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,900
And I've been doin' it
for a while, yeah

1132
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:36,500
I've been goin' down that
long lonesome road, babe

1133
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,900
Lookin' for
a special smile

1134
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,000
Now, I worked the bars

1135
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,400
New York to Frisco

1136
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,100
But I could never
make it pay

1137
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,300
You know how money goes

1138
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,200
It slips right through
your fingers

1139
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,100
One more dollar
One more day

1140
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,600
The bluebird
He has no money

1141
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,900
The bluebird
He has no kin

1142
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,400
The bluebird
He wears no time clock

1143
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,500
He answers to the wind

1144
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,600
- [Continues: Radio]
- That's as far as I can take you.

1145
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,500
- Okay, this is it, all right.
- Yeah, all right.

1146
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,000
- It's the new one!
- Yeah, I know.

1147
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,500
- It's the new one, all right.
- Have you got the time?

1148
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
Uh, yeah, it's, uh...

1149
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,700
I shoved a hundred million
quarters in that jukebox

1150
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,200
I've served a barrelful of beer

1151
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,600
Now I've listened to

1152
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,100
Some troubles in my lifetime

1153
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,600
I've seen a lot of grown men cry

1154
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,900
You know that old tune called
"Over the Rainbow"

1155
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,100
Well, if the bluebird flies
then why can't I

1156
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,200
I'm Del Reese, and I'm goin' back
to Haven Hamilton's group.

1157
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,700
- Remember me?
- This young lady's with me here.

1158
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,700
I'm being interviewed by her.

1159
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,300
And I really gotta
go to the bathroom.

1160
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,800

1161

He answers to the wind

1162
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,300
He answers

1163
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,000
To

1164
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,800
The wind

1165
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,600
Oh, yeah!
Thank you!

1166
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,300
Thank you, Tommy.
Beautiful job, as always.

1167
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,800
Say, Harold Weakly,
have you been on vacation yet?

1168
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,700
No, I've been busier than a puppy
in a room full of rubber balls.

1169
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,200
If you're like me, all that hustling
and bustling makes you want...

1170
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,300
to let the world go by while you
enjoy a Goo Goo candy cluster.

1171
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,300
Hey, Steve.
She's with me.

1172
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,500
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Oh, I'm with these people here.

1173
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,100
- Do you have a backstage pass?
- They didn't need a pass.

1174
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
You need a pass
to get backstage.

1175
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,800
- I never get enough
- Goo Goo's the perfect cluster...

1176
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,300
- I always want more and more
- when you need quick energy.

1177
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,300
- Even if we stay together
- Any time is Goo Goo time.

1178
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,100
- Our whole lifetime through
- Pack Goo Goo in your lunch box.

1179
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,600
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough

1180
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,300
I'll never get enough
of you

1181
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,300
Go get a Goo Goo,

1182
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
the South's favorite piece of candy
for 62 years.

1183
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,400
- You ready to do the song?
- Right.

1184
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,700
[Both]
Go get a Goo Goo

1185

It's good

1187
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,500
I don't know about killin' 'em.
They're already dead.

1188
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,600
[Chuckling]
They're lucky to be alive.

1189

Thank you.
Now, now.

1193
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,600
Well, I want to thank you
for that wonderful, warm welcome.

1194
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm sure you meant to share it with
Bud Hamilton, my son, who's here.

1195
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,300
Stand up, Bud!

Yes, indeed.
Yes, indeed.

God bless you, and thank you so much
for that warm welcome.

- How tall is that guy?
- Who?

1201

- Haven.
- I'd like to do a treat for you.

1202
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
- A brand-new song.
- Don't ever ask him that, John.

tell you a couple things about what

I just wanna tell you a little bit
about what we're trying to do.

1715
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,100
I know you're astute politically,

1716
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,200
and I'm certainly not here
to sell you a bill of goods.

- Don't care about politics.
- No politics? Okay, great.

1718
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,900
Well, then, I've got a problem
that could work to your advantage.

1719
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:21,700
As you know, this redneck music
is very popular right now.

1720
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,200

local yokels on the bill singing...

- Country crapola. Right.

1722
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:30,700
[Chuckles]
So I think, uh...

1723
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,000
What I'm going for
is a broader appeal.

1724

than just this Southern thing.

And I think that
a really hip group like yours...

1727
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,600
could walk off with the evening.

- Sounds good.

- Sounds inviting.
- Yeah.

And you do get a big audience
from these country guys.

1732
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,700
Is this just network, or...

1733
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,700
It's better than network.
It's syndicated.

1734
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,400
They'll be showing it

- Bumper stickers.

on this gala,

isn't he?

But I think the thing that you
should consider is your future.

1751
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,600
It would give you a great shot.

1752
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,500
But it doesn't make any difference.
We're registered Democrats.

[Laughs]
Well, I'm a registered Democrat.

1754
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
The only reason
we're registered Democrats...

1755
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,400
is because your father's
a registered Democrat...

1756
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,800
and his father's
a registered Democrat.

1757
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,800
Well, Tom's a registered Democrat,
and he wouldn't do it.

- Hi, Norman. How you doin'?

Good. I'm sure glad you called.
Is there anything I can...

01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,500
- Sit down.

Uh, no, no, I, uh...

to get some grass.

- Okay.

- Who is this?

at the restaurant.

Are you a Jehovah's Witness?

1785

[Walker On P.A.] Does it
make sense that the churches...

1786
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:37,400
should remain untaxed
on their vast holdings of land...

1787
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,400
and corporate investments?

1788
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,400
Does it make sense that
a multimillion-dollar income...

1789
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,100
should go untaxed
year after year?

1790
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,400
No, all will not be easy,

1791
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,400
but we will bask
in the satisfaction...

1792
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:56,600
of having done
what we should have done.

1793
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:59,300
And if we don't
get it done today,

1794
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,200
we may run out of tomorrows.

1795
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,400
The buses!

1796
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,400
The buses are empty...

1797
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:10,400
and look almost menacing,
threatening,

1798
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,400
as so many yellow dragons
watching me...

1799
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,400
with their hollow, vacant eyes.

1800
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,400
I wonder how many little
black and white children...

1801
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,400
have yellow nightmares,

1802
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:25,500
their own special brand of fear
for the yellow peril...

1803
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,700
[Mutters] I can't have...
I can't start...

1804
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,700
Damn it, it's got to be more...

1805
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,700
positive.

1806
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,500
No, more negative.
Start again.

1807
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,500
Yellow is the color of caution.

1808
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
No.

1809
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,200
Yellow is the color of cowardice.

1810
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,600
Yellow is the color of sunshine.

1811
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,700
And yet I see
very little sunshine...

1812
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,600
in the lives of all the little
black and white children.

1813
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,100
I see their lives, rather,
as a study in grayness,

1814
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,100
a mixture of black and...

1815
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,600

Mr. Green, you know,
my mama saved her life.

1850
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,200
They used to live next door to each
other. My mama put out the flames.

She always loved Barbara Jean
more than anything.

She's still keepin'
a scrapbook on her.

1853
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:52,600
The only thing she said to me
when I joined up was,

1854
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,600
"When you're doin' your travels,
I want you to see Barbara Jean.

01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:22,300
Let me just... I have a theory
about political assassination.

1862
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:26,100
You see, I believe
people like Madame Pearl...

1863
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:30,700
and all these people here
in this country who carry guns...

1864
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,600
are the real assassins.

1865
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,600
Because, you see,
they stimulate other people...

1866
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,600
who are perhaps innocent...

1867
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:41,600
and who eventually
are the ones who pull the trigger.

- Kenny? Where are you, Kenny?

- I was so worried.

- There's no reason to worry.
- Well, I haven't been able to sleep.

1871
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,700
I had to take some of that Ny Quil
so I could go to sleep.

Yes, it did.
Where are you staying in Nashville?

1874

- It's my mother.
- Who are you talking to, Kenny?

in the rooming house.

- A man owns the rooming house?

Well, it can't be very clean.

- I bet the sheets aren't clean.

Thank you.
Thank you.

1963
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,600
It's that careless

1964
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:20,400
Disrespect

1965
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:26,600
I can't take no more, baby

1966
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,900
It's the way

1967
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,700
That you don't love me

1968
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:37,700
When you say you do, baby

1969
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,500
It hurts so bad

1970
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,800
It gets me down, down, down

1971
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,300
I want to walk away

1972
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,900

- Huh?
- Writin'it down

1997

Kind of makes me feel better

Yes, you have.
I can tell by your face.

It keeps me away
from them blues

Thank you.

I wanna tell you all a little secret
which you might not know,

2026
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:46,300
and that is that last night
I thanked my lucky stars...

2027
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:49,100
that I could be here at all
to sing for ya.

2028
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,100
I heard on the radio...

2029
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,600
- [Stops]
- This little boy... 9 years old.

2030
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,600
Sometimes a deejay'll play a tune...

2031
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:58,600
and ask everybody to phone in
and say how they like it.

2032
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:03,000
I was listenin', and this
little nine-year-old called in.

2033
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,000
The song had voices
in the background,

2034
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,500
like the way they use
backup voices these days,

2035
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,500
soundin' like little munchkins.

2036
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,600
He called up, the deejay said,
"How old are you, son?"

2037
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,600
The boy said, "I'm nine,
and I think it's gonna be a hit."

2038
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:20,600
The deejay said, "Why?" "Because
it had those chipmunks in it."

2039
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:23,100
And I thought that was so cute,

2040
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,100
because, well, I can sing
like a munchkin myself.

2041
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,700
I'm real fond
of The Wizard of Oz.

2042
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:31,800
Plus, I live out, you know,
just a ways off of Interstate 24...

2043
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,800
on the road to Chattanooga.

2044
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,700
So you can see why
I kinda related to that.

2045
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:40,200
I think me and the boys are gonna
strike up another tune for you now.

2046
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,200

01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:52,200
seems like it's a-brewin'.

2050
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:57,700
That's what my grandaddy used to say
before he lost his hearin'.

2051
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,200
- [Stops]
- Once he got deaf,

2052
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,300
he never talked much no more.

2053
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:08,000
'Cept sometimes he'd say "Oh, gosh"
or "Durn it" or "My word!"

2054
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:11,800
My granny'd go around clickin'
her teeth to the radio all day.

2055
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:15,800
Boy, was she a lot of fun,
and cooked my favorite, roast beef.

2056
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,700
She was a sweetheart.

2057
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:20,100
She raised chickens too.
She, um...

2058
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:24,500
Did you ever hear a chicken sound?
You know how chickens go?

Here, chick, chick, chick.
Here, chick, chick, chick.

2061
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,800
Anyway, I guess we'd better strike
up this tune before it's too late.

2062
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,800
Okay, boys.

- The first job I ever really got...
- [Stops]

2066
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:55,600
Grandma... She's the one who clacked
her false teeth to the radio.

2067
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:59,200
She taught my mama how to sing,
and my mama taught me.

2068
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,700
One time she took me, 'cause we
was gonna get a new Frigidaire.

2069
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:06,700
She took me to the Frigidaire store
where the man was advertisin'.

2070
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,000
This record was goin' 'round, and
Mama told him I knew how to sing.

2071
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,800
He said, "If she learns this tune,
I'll give y'all a quarter."

2072
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,800
So Mama and I went home...

2073
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,800
And then what happened?
Let's see, I think... Uh, yeah.

2074
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:25,500
We went home and I learned both
sides of the record in half an hour.

2075
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,800
We went back and told him that
I'd learned 'em, and he said,

2076
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,900
"Let me hear," so I sang both sides
of the record instead of just one.

2077
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,900
So he gave us 50 cents, and we went
across the street and had us a soda.

2078

[Chuckles] Ever since then

01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:31,300
No paraphernalia, no literature
being circulated. You understand?

2114
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:35,600
And never, at any time, is she to be
associated with Hal Phillip Walker.

2115
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,600
- Hello?
- Hey.

2116
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:40,100
Guess who.

2117
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:42,600
- Linnea?
- Yes, it's me.

2118
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:45,600
Hi. This is Tom.

2119
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:53,700
I'm playing a gig tonight downtown.
You wanna come and meet me?

2120
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:59,800
It's at a place called
the, uh, No Exit, or the Exit.

2121
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,200
Exit Out, or somethin'.

2122
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:05,700
Anyhow, it's right across the street
from Friday's, on Church Street.

2123
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:08,200
You know where that is,
don't you?

2124
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:11,200
Anyhow, I'll be there at 8:00,
and, uh...

2125
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:14,100
Why don't you meet me there?

2126
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:16,300
- Okay?
- Um...

2127
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:19,600
Well, it's sad but true

2128
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:23,600
The pilot light of our love

2129
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:27,300
Has flickered out

2130
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:30,900
- Mary...
- Driver, may I have more champagne?

2131
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:33,100
- That's Norman.
- Oh.

2132
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,600
Norman, yes.
Norman. Of course.

2133
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,700
He doesn't like to be known
as a driver.

2134
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:40,700
Thank you so much, Norman.

2135
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,000
What used to come
from the warmest heart

2136
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,200
I have to get from a cold can

2137
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:57,400
Since my baby's cookin'in

Another man's pan

2139
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:02,100
Have you ever been
to the ladies' restroom here?

2140
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:03,600
No.

2141
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,100
I'm stuck here at the Exit Inn
with no place left to go.

2142
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,600
Well, if makin'love

Were margarine

2144
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:19,000
Then she is
the high-priced spread

2145
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
- I'll have a cider.
- Apple cider?

2146
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,500
- Yes. Thank you.
- [Wade] Put it on my bill.

2147
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,500
- Oh, no...
- Yeah.

2148
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:29,000
Uh, all right. And would you
put it in a wine glass, please?

2149
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:32,100
Put it in a wine glass
and put it on my bill.

2150
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:35,500
Traveling in cozy, close quarters,

2151
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:39,100
I mean, you sort of
have to camp in one room.

2152
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:42,400
- Well, Mary and I camp in one room.
- Obviously!

2153
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,800
- Yes, l...
- Tom camps in a lot of rooms.

2154
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:49,300
My name's Wade Coolidge.
What's yours?

2155
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,300
Um, Linnea is my name.

2156
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,900
Well, shall I say
that Tom and I, um...

2157
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,900
Oh, la-dee-dee!
[Giggles]

2158
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
So you sang together.

2159
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
No, I mean, we sort of
got to know each other, um,

2160
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
in the biblical sense,
shall we say.

2161
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,500
- You went to church?
- [Giggling] I'm sorry.

2162
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,500
No, I'm sorry.
This is dreadful.

2163
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:13,600
But he is so attractive,
I was wondering...

2164
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:16,800
I shouldn't be asking you,
I should really be asking Mary.

2165
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,300
You went to bed with him,
right?

2166
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,900
Oh, yeah.
I thought you understood that.

2167
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,900
Well, I shouldn't...
[Chuckles]

2168
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Where'd you go to bed with him?

2169
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:29,900
[Applause, Hooting]

2170
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,600
Listen, uh, we got
a special treat tonight.

2171
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:39,700
A friend of mine
is in town cuttin' an album.

2172
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,700
- Tom Frank is in the audience.
- That's you.

2173
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:44,700
[Opal]
Tom? Speak of the devil.

2174
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:47,500
He's agreed to come up
and do a couple of numbers.

2175
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:50,500
Let's make him feel at home.
Tom Frank!

Come on!

more than two minutes in three days.

2179
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,800
[Tom]
Thank you.

2180
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,100

- Used to be?

I been hidin' from 'em all week, but
it seems they found me here tonight,

2182
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,700
so we might as well have them
up here to sing too... Bill and Mary.

2183

But it don't worry me

- My favorite song.

- It don't worry me
- We don't need to sing at all.

- You guys can do it for us.
- You may say I ain't free

- [Applause, Whistling]
- Don't need my pockets stuffed

2267
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:27,700
With hundred-dollar bills

2268
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,800
Hey, you forgot your jacket.

2269
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:45,400
Excuse me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

2270
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,700
All right, if you want more
it's gonna have to be me alone,

2271
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:52,300
'cause it seems
I'vejust been deserted.

2272
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,400
I'm gonna play somethin'that, uh,

2273
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:58,100
I wrotejust recently...

2274
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:01,500
- and came here to record.
- [Man] All right!

2275
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,700
I'm gonna dedicate this to someone
special who might be here tonight.

2276
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,800
This is a song called
"I'm Easy."

2277
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:21,100
It's not my way to love you
just when no one's lookin'

2278
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:23,000
It's not my way

2279
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:27,300
To take your hand
if I'm not sure

2280
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:29,900
It's not my way
to let you see

2281
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:32,900
What's goin' on inside of me

2282
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:35,400
When it's a love
you won't be needing

2283
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,200
If you're not free

2284
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,900
Please stop pullin'
at my sleeve

2285
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,700
If you're just playin'

2286
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:48,000
If you won't take the things
you make me wanna give

2287
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:52,000
I never cared too much
for games

2288
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:55,200
And this one's drivin' me insane

2289
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:58,500
You're not half as free
to wander

2290
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,700
As you claim

2291
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:04,500
But I'm easy

2292
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:07,100
Yeah, I'm easy

2293
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:09,800
Give the word
I'll play your game

2294
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:12,400
As though
that's how it oughta be

2295
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:14,900
Because I'm easy

2296
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:20,900
Don't lead me on
if there's nowhere

2297
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,700
For you to take me

2298
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,400
If lovin'you
would have to be

2299
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:29,300
A sometime thing

2300
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:32,500
I can't put bars
on my insides

2301
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:35,300
My love is somethin'
I can't hide

2302
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,500
It still hurts

2303
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,800
When I recall
the times I've tried

2304
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,800
But I'm easy

2305
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,100
Yeah, I'm easy

2306
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:49,500
Take my hand
and pull me down

2307
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:52,100
I won't put up any fight

2308
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:54,300
Because I'm easy

2309
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:59,100
Don't do me favors

2310
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:03,100
Let me watch you
from a distance

2311
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,900
'Cause when you're near

2312
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I find it hard
to keep my head

2313
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,200
And when your eyes
throw light at mine

2314
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:15,000
It's enough to change my mind

2315
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,200
Make me leave my cautious words
and ways behind

2316
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,500
That's why I'm easy

2317
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,100
Yeah, I'm easy

2318
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:29,100
Say you want me
I'll come runnin'

2319
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:31,600
Without takin'time to think

2320
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:34,600
Because I'm easy

2321
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,600
Yeah, I'm easy

2322
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:40,400
Take my hand
and pull me down

2323
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,900
I won't put up any fight

Yeah, I'm easy

Give the word
I'll play your game

2327

As though
that's how it oughta be

2328
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,800
Because I'm easy

I'm gonna sing you all
a song Barbara Jean wrote.

2334
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:31,000
Just wanna get comfortable.

2335
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:39,000
It's called, uh,
"One, I Love You."

2336

- [Murmuring]
- Oh, you got that right, babe!

[Off-key, Off-tempo]
When I feel my life perishing

02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,900
- [Musicians Slow Down Tempo]
- I call you on the phone

2339
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:56,400
You always fix me up

2340
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,100
When I get broken

'Cause every time
that I got hurt

2342
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:08,400
And went out of control

2343
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:11,500
You knew the fears I felt

2344
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:13,900
Before I spoke 'em

2345

[Man]
Boo! Come on, now!

- Did you tell Trout what you wanted?
- Did I? It was your job.

2355
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,900
- I know.
- I assumed he knew what...

it was gonna be any problem.

- I don't understand what's goin' on.

2368
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:27,900
Didn't Trout tell you
you're supposed to strip?

I'm a singer!

and I'll set it up
so you can sing at the Parthenon.

Yeah.
How do you say "I love you"?

Well, you could say...
Shorthand for it is...

This is shorthand.

[Continues]

2400
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:34,500
Or you could say, "I,"
you could say, "love you."

- "I love you"?
- Mm-hmm.

2402
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:40,800
Or you could just say,
"I'm happy I met you."

- I'm happy I met you.

- Couldn't you stay another hour?
- No.

2420
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:48,200
I just can't.

2421
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:14,600
This is the long-distance operator.

2422
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,100
- You want this charged to your room?
- Yeah, please.

2423
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:19,200
- And your room number, please?
- 112.

[Phone Ringing]

2425
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:25,900
- [Woman] Hello.
- Hey.

2426
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:30,200
- [Tom] How you doin'?
- Oh, wow.

2427
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:33,100
Listen, I'm real sorry
I left the way I did.

- [Water Running]
- [Woman] Oh, wow.

2429
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:38,900
It's really nice to talk to you.
It's okay.

2430
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,900
It's nice to talk to you too.

2431
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,300
- What are you doing?
- [Tom] I'm thinkin'about you.

2432
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:46,700
You are? Well...
[Giggles]

2433
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,800
Listen, can you come down here?

2434
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,800
- When?
- Tonight.

2435
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:53,800
- Oh, Tom, I can't do that.
- Why not?

2436
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:58,100
We have an opening at the museum
tomorrow. I can't leave my job.

2437
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:01,100
Why don't you quit?
I'm makin'bread here.

2438
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:05,400
We tried that before.
It doesn't work. I need to be busy.

2439
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:07,700
I'll wait for you here.
When are you coming back?

2440
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:09,600
About a week.

2441
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:12,600
Okay, well, just...
just come on back.

2442
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:15,200
Move back in.
It's fine.

2443
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:17,300
[Woman]
I miss you.

2444
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,500
[Woman]
I really do.

2445
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,500
New York's really been nice.
It's missed you too.

2446
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:25,500
The weather's been terrific.

2447
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:27,500
I went sailing.

2448
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:30,500
- Yeah.
- What's that?

2449
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:32,300
That's just room service.

2450
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,400
There's 50 cents on the desk there.
Just pick it up.

2451
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:38,400
- Big tipper. [Giggles]
- Yeah, well, times are hard.

2452
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:42,800
Right, all that money. You couldn't
afford to bring me down there.

2453
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,400
- Yeah. Well, see you in a week.
- I love you, Tom.

Hey! Hey, wait just a minute.
Just hold it, will ya.

I know you don't do that
all the time, l...

You know, I'd just like to kiss you
all over, every place.

2466
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:00,100
You know what I'm telling you?

2467
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:02,100
- I think you...
- Sueleen?

2468
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:06,900
You okay?

2469
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,400
[Sighs]
Shit, man.

teach you no manners?

- Who was that?

2473
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:27,500
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you gonna talk to me?

2474
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,800
Did it go all right?

2475
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:36,300
- Oh, Wade.
- What?

2476
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:40,000
I had to do me a striptease tonight
in front of all those men...

2477
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
in order to get to sing
at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.

2478
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Oh, shit, Sueleen, l...

2479
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,400
That's dreadful!
That's terrible, girl!

2480
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,400
I mean...

2481
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:52,400
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I been meanin' to...

2482
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,600
you can't sing.

2483
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:57,200
You may as well face the fact
you cannot sing.

2484
02:15:57,400 --> 02:16:01,000
You ain't never gon' be no star.
I wish you'd give it up.

2485
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,500
They gon' kill ya. They gon' tear
your heart out if you keep on.

They gon' walk on your soul, girl.

2487
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:10,700

- You can't sing.

2488
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:13,700
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah? You wanna make a bet?

2489
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:17,100
You wanna come to the Parthenon
and watch me sing with Barbara Jean?

2490
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:20,100
- I am leavin' for Detroit Wednesday.
- You just come and watch, Wade.

2491
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:23,100
I'm leavin' for Detroit, and if
you wanna go you just come on.

2492
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:26,100
- They gonna kill you in this town.
- Well, you come and see.

2493
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:29,100
- They gon' use you. You know that.
- Bye, Wade.

2494
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:31,700
Dumb bitch.
I don't know why I stick around.

2495
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:34,900
She just makes me so goddamn mad
I could spit.

2496
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:37,400
[Man]
Little more than a year ago,

2497
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,400
a man named Hal Phillip Walker...

2498
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:41,400
excited a group of college students
with some questions:

2499
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:44,400
Have you stood
on a high and windy hill...

2500
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:47,400
and heard the acorns drop and roll?

2501
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:49,800
Have you walked in the valley
beside the brook,

2502
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,800
walked alone and remembered?

2503
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:55,200
Does Christmas
smell like oranges to you?

2504
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:58,200
In a commencement speech such
questions were fitting, perhaps,

2505
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:02,000
but hardly the material with which
to launch a presidential campaign.

2506
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:05,000
Even those who pay
close attention to politics...

2507
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:08,600
probably saw Hal Phillip Walker
and his Replacement Party...

2508
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:11,600
as a bit of frost
on the hillside...

2509
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:14,800
summer, if not late spring,
would surely do away with all that.

2510
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:16,100
Well, now that summer,

2511
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,100
along with presidential primaries,
is heavy upon us...

2512
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,100
and the frost is still there,

2513
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:22,600
perhaps we should take
a closer look.

2514
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:25,600
Hal Phillip Walker is,
in a way, a mystery man.

2515
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:29,000
Out of nowhere, with a handful
of students and scarcely any pros,

2516
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
he's managed to win
three presidential primaries...

2517
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,900
and is given a fighting chance
to take a fourth... Tennessee.

2518
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,000
A win in that state would
take on added significance,

2519
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,800
for only once in the last 50 years
has Tennessee failed to vote...

2520
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,800
for the winning
presidential candidate.

2521
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:47,900
No doubt many Americans,
especially party liners,

2522
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,900
wish that Hal Phillip Walker
would go away,

2523
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,900
disappear like the natural frost...

2524
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:55,400
and come again at
some more convenient season.

2525
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:57,400
But wherever he may be going,

2526
02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:01,400
it seems sure Hal Phillip Walker
is not going away,

2527
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:03,400
for there is genuine appeal...

2528
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:06,500
and it must be related
to the raw courage of this man...

2529
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:10,500
running for president, willing
to battle vast oil companies,

2530
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:13,000
eliminate subsidies to farmers,

2531
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,400
tax churches,
abolish the electoral college,

2532
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,300
change the national anthem...

2533
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:21,800
and remove lawyers from government,
especially from Congress.

2534
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
At this point it'd be wise to say
most of us don't know the answer...

2535
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
to Hal Phillip Walker,

2536
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,500
but to answer
one of his questions,

2537
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:35,300
as a matter of fact, Christmas has
always smelled like oranges to me.

2538

[Male Singer]
Our country cries

2539
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:46,700

- All y'all goin' the wrong way!
- Will there be sadness

2549
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:11,100
Tears or pain

This year will bring

2554
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:31,500
Down in Nashville

2555
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:33,900

- Okay, thank you.

02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:17,200
- Anybody here yet?
- Yeah, some of the people.

2572
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:21,000
- Barnett?
- He oughta be here quick.

2573
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
This building was originally here...

2574
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
It was made out of lumber
and plaster of Paris.

2575
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
- Oh, yeah?
- This whole big building...

2576
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,100
See, they built it for
a centennial celebration,

2577
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:35,100
and people liked this,
they didn't want it torn down.

2578
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:38,600
Nashville got to be called
the Athens of the South.

2579
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:41,100
- They sorta took to that.
- Because of this building?

2580
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:43,100
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, that's good.

2581
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:48,400
Then they had to rebuild it. This
was built right before I was born.

2582
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:51,000
Whoo!
Gonna be a scorcher.

2583
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:54,000
[Del]
The park police control all this.

2584
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:58,500
What's all these chairs?
We don't need all these chairs.

2585
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:01,500
- This ain't no band here, right?
- What's the matter, man?

2586
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,500
I don't...
I don't believe it!

2587
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,500
What's the matter?

2588
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:09,500
Are you guys jerkin' me around?
Do you see what I see, or am l...

2589
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:12,600
What the hell is that sign
doin' up there, Triple?

2590
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,600
We had some ground rules.

2591
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:17,100
No political signs,
no advertisements, no noth...

2592
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:20,500
What the hell are you doin', huh?
Go about your business.

2593
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:24,400
I have abided by all the ground
rules you laid down, Barnett.

2594
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:27,400
I have Walker sitting out
behind this place like an idiot!

2595
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:30,400
Well, he can sit out in the sun
and parch for all I care!

2596
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:33,900
My wife ain't well! I brought her
out of a hospital bed to be here!

2597
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,000
You gave me some truth! You're
full of it, just like your man!

2598
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,500
- I have abided by every ground rule.
- Except what?

2599
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:45,000
She ain't gonna appear here
with that sign up there!

2600
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
- I have busted my ass for you!
- I'm gonna bust your ass too!

2601
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:51,200
I am through with it!
Take your wife and take a walk!

2602
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,800
I'll tell these people
she's not going to appear again!

2603
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:58,500
- Well, go on and do it!
- Okay, take a walk, and I'll do it.

2604
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:02,000
You'd do that, huh? You'd put
a knife in my wife's back like that?

2605
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:05,900
You're putting the knife in
her back, buster. You're doing it.

2606
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:09,700
I have not got time to take the sign
down and put it back up again!

2607
02:22:09,700 --> 02:22:13,200
What are you hollerin' about?
You tryin' to embarrass me?

2608
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:15,200
I'm tryin' to be heard.

2609
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,200
Well, get these chairs off
and we'll talk about it.

2610
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:20,100
- I'll take care of it.
- Delbert... Where is that rat?

2611
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:23,000
What are you hiding for,
you little rat?

2612
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:27,000
And grant us so
to serve thee by day...

2613
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,000
that we may find
eternal fellowship with them...

2614
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:33,300
through Him who died
and rose again for us all,

2615
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:35,300
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

2616
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:37,300
Amen.

2617
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:41,800
Mr. Green, it's not over.

2618
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:44,300
- I'm going to find Martha.
- What for?

2619
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:46,500
She owes some respect to Esther.

2620
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:50,900
[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
Barbara Jean and Haven Hamilton.

2621
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:53,900
[Applause, Cheering]

2622
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,900
[Haven]
When I feel my life perishing

2623
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,400
I call you on the phone

2624
02:23:05,500 --> 02:23:07,500
[Barbara Jean]
I always fix you up

2625
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:10,000
When you get broken

2626
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,700
'Cause every time
that I got hurt

2627
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:18,100
And went out of control

2628
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:20,300
I knew the fears you felt

2629
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:23,600
Before you spoke them

2630
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,000
You tell me

2631
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:27,800
[Together]
One, I love you

2632
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:30,700

I'm thinkin' of you

2633
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:35,400

2634

Five, I wanna kiss you

2636
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:48,300
Six
I won't leave you no more

2637
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:50,500
[Barbara Jean]
When I feel my life vanishin'

2638
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:53,200
Like waves upon the sand

2639
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:56,000
[Haven]
With nothin'to replace it

2640
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:59,500
But invention

2641
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:02,000
[Barbara Jean] So I make
my rhymes and I sing my songs

2642
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:04,600
Still they don't understand

2643
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,100
- [Continues]
- You can't find her here.

2644
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:09,600
I'll find her.

2645
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:13,600
- I'd sing ya
- [Together] One, I love you

2646
02:24:13,700 --> 02:24:16,600

02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:50,800

2655
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:53,600

2657
02:24:58,700 --> 02:25:01,900
Six
I won't leave you

2658
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:04,400

2659
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:07,400
Six
I won't leave you

2660
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:13,300
No mo-o-ore

2661
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,500
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

2662
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:26,700
Mama and Daddy

2663
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,800
Raised me with lovin' care

2664
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:30,800
They sacrificed

2665
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:32,600
So I could have
a better share

2666
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:34,900
They fed me and nursed me

2667
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:36,600
And sent me to school

2668
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,800
Mama taught me how to sing

2669
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:41,900
Daddy lived the Golden Rule

2670
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:46,500
When I think of the children
alone and afraid

2671
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:50,200
Abandoned and wild
like a fatherless child

2672
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:52,700
I think of my mama

2673
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:54,400
And how she could sing

2674
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:56,800
Harmony with my daddy

2675
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:58,500
Our laughter would ring

2676
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:00,700
Down the highways

2677
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,700
On the beaches

2678
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:07,000
Just as far
as memory reaches

2679
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:11,100
I still hear Daddy
singin'his old army songs

2680
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:13,300
We'd laugh and count horses

2681
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:15,100
As we drove along

2682
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:18,600
We were young then
We were together

2683
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:21,300
We could bear floods and fire

2684
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:23,200
And bad weather

2685
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:25,600
And now that I'm older

2686
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:27,600
Grown up, on my own

2687
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,700
I still love
Mama and Daddy best

2688
02:26:29,700 --> 02:26:32,700
And my Idaho home

2689
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,700
Mama grew up

2690
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:39,700
On the prairies of Kansas

2691
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:43,200
She was tender and sweet

2692
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:47,100
The dust and tornadoes
blew 'round her

2693
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,100
But they left her
straight up on her feet

2694
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:55,400
My daddy grew up on his own
more or less

2695
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:59,100
His mama died
when he was just 11

2696
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:03,200
He had seven sisters
to raise him

2697
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:07,300
But he dreamed
of his mama in heaven

2698
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:11,700
His daddy drank whiskey
and had a sharp eye

2699
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:15,900
He sold chicken medicine
farmers would buy

2700
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,700
Together they hunted
the fields and the farms

2701
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:24,700
When his daddy died
my daddy rest in my mama's arms

2702
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,800
Down the highways

2703
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:28,800
On the beaches

2704
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:33,100
Just as far
as memory reaches

2705
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:37,100
I still hear Daddy
singin' his old army songs

2706
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:39,100
We'd laugh and count horses

2707
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:41,000
As we drove along

2708
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:43,200
We were young then

2709
02:27:43,300 --> 02:27:45,100
We were together

2710
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,200
We could bear
floods and fire

2711
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:49,200
And bad weather

2712
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:51,500
And now that I'm older

2713
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,500
Grown up, on my own

2714
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:55,600
I still love
Mama and Daddy best

2715
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,600
And my Idaho home

2716
02:27:57,700 --> 02:27:59,500
And now that I'm older

2717
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:01,500
Grown up, on my own

2718
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:03,500
I still love
my Mama and Daddy best

2719
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:08,200
And my Idaho home

2720
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:10,200
For Mama and Daddy.

2721
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,700
- [Applause, Cheering]
- Thank you.

2722
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:17,900
[Applause, Cheering Continue]

2723
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:21,600
Thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

2724
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:23,600
- Thank you.
- Wonderful! Wonderful!
