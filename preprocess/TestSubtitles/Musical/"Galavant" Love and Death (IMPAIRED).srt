00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,859
Or half-alive.

493
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:43,195
Depends on whether you're a
glass-half-dead kind of guy.

494
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,530
Either way, they're yours if you want them.

495
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,734
Please take them. They freak me out.

496
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,102
I like it.

[Soldiers growling] Back, back!

498
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,041
Have to be careful. They're... a bit bitey.
