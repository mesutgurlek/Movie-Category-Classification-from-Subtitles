to bring him back here.

1265
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:52,014
From tonight he's a liar
and a thief,

1266
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,517
and all that's bad.

1267
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:57,645
Ain't that enough for you
without beating him to death?

1268
01:52:57,729 --> 01:53:03,985
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.
Civil words.

1269
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:07,029
Oh, yes, you deserve them
from me, don't you?

1270
01:53:07,114 --> 01:53:10,074
I thieved for you
when I was half his age.

1271
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,952
And it's your dirty work
I've been doing ever since.

1272
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:14,662
Well, if you have,
it's a living, isn't it?

1273
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:17,039
He's right, Nancy.
A living is a living.

1274
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,584
Some living! Lord help me!

1275

Get to bed, I said!

1278
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:32,138
All this violence,
all these scenes,
screams, dramas!

1279
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:35,057
I'm asking you,
is it necessary?

1280
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:38,394
Not yet, Fagin.

1281
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:41,147
Not yet.

1282
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:45,651
But if this godforsaken
little good-for-nothing's
uttered one word,

1283
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:47,320
one word, mind you...

1284
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:49,989
If he has, the little devil,

1285
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:52,533
we sit down,
we talk it over,
we think it out,

1286
01:53:52,618 --> 01:53:54,869
we decide upon
a proper course of safe action,

1287
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:57,580
we stay calm!

1288
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,333
Do we?

1289
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:06,214
And while we're sitting here
thinking, and talking,
and staying calm,

1290
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:08,549
our collars get felt, don't they?

1291
01:54:08,634 --> 01:54:11,511
And it's,
"Come along with me,
if you please."

1292
01:54:12,596 --> 01:54:14,096
No, thank you very much.

1293
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:17,183
Look, you thought us
into this little lot.

1294

You can think
your way out of it.

1295

But from now on,
Bill Sikes takes the law

1300
01:54:42,668 --> 01:54:44,293
They squawks.

1301
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:49,298
Not a very pretty sound.
No, Bill.

1302
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,718
And then they dies,
don't they?

1303
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:57,098
Yes, Bill. I mean, no, Bill.

1304
01:54:57,182 --> 01:55:02,103
Then they say some
even start squawking
before that event.

1305
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:06,315
They get what you might call
a premonition.

1306
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:11,362
Now, then,
you wouldn't be
having no premonition

1307
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:13,739
of that sort by any chance,
would you?

1308
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:18,411
Not me, Bill.
The lips are sealed.

got to tell me?

His identity? His very name?

The mother was unmarried.
