The fact that we could be together

168
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,561
Here together Sharing our night

169
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Spending our time
And you are gonna choose

170
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,526
Someone else to be with

171
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,681
No, you are

172
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,841
I'm not... That's not true.

173
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,365
Yes, Jamie, that's exactly
what you're doing

174
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,000
You could be here with me
or be there with them

175
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,406
As usual guess which you pick

176
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,561
Baby, I have to go!

177
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,370
No, Jamie, you do not have to go

178
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,206
To another party with the same
20jerks you already know

179
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,250
You could stay with your wife
on her fucking birthday

180
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,721
And you could, God forbid,
even see my show

181
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,810
And I know in your soul
it must drive you crazy

182
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,849
That you won't get to play
with your little girlfriends

183
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,843
- You're being crazy!
- No, I'm not, no, I'm not!

184
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,764
And the point is, Jamie

185
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,890
That you can't spend
a single day that's not about

186
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,805
You and you and nothing but you

187
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,008
"Mahvelous" novelist, you

188
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,970
Isn't he wonderful? Just 28

189
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,044
The savior of writing

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,962
You and you and nothing but you

191
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,009
Miles and piles of you

192
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,771
Pushing through windows
and bursting through walls

193
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,609
En route to the sky

194
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,285
And I

195
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,806
I swear to God I'll never understand

196
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,006
How you can stand there
straight and tall

197
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,561
And see I'm crying

198
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,441
And not do anything at all

199
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,325

(PHONE RINGS)

201
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,843
Yeah, hello?

202
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,962
Yeah, this is Jamie Wellerstein.

203
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,808
Oh, OK.

204
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,810
Sure.

205
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,331
Wait, who? Who told you?

206
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,721
Wait, wait, you...
you read my manuscript?

207
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,490
But how did you...

208
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,889
Oh, oh, yeah, Professor Adler.

209
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,328
No, no, no, no, that's... that's great!

210
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,405
That's, uh... that's... That's really...
It's a second draft, you know.

211
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,161
It's... it's a work in progress,
it's getting there, though.

212
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,607
I'm sorry, who... Random House read it?

213
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,888
Oh, my... that's, um...

214
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,806
That's great. That's... Holy shit!

215
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,406
I'm sorry, um... that's...
no, no, no, no, no!

216
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,925
No, no. No.

217
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,044
OK. Yes. Yes.

218
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,010
Yes, I'm 23. I'm...

219
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,403
No, I didn't finish,
but whatever. That's, uh...

220
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,291
Yes, I can meet you. Uh, New York.

221
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,047
Yes, I'm in New York. Yeah, I live here.

222
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,283
OK. Yes. I mean, I can come today.

223
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,125
Great. Great. Great. Great. Great.

224
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,089
Oh, my God. Uh, OK.

225
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,686
Yes, I will see you there. I am so...

226
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,129
...so looking... looking forward
to meeting you, Ms. Whitfield.

227
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,682
OK. OK. OK, Linda.

228
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,286
(LAUGHS) We're like friends, Linda.

229
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,967
Uh, OK, great. That's... that's fine.

230
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,400
OK, bye.

231
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,688
(LAUGHS) What?!

232
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,243
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

233
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,121
Hi.

234
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,691
JAMIE: Hey, so I was thinking
about what you said.

235
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,848
- Let's move in together.
- Really?!

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,809
- Jamie, what happened?
- I'll tell you later, all right?

237
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
Just find an apartment, and I love you.

238
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,728
I... Jamie... Jamie, wait!

239
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,006
Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?

240
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,609
Did I see sirens go flying past?

241
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,401
Though I don't know
what tomorrow's bringing

242
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,767
I've got a singular impression

243
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,685
Things are moving too fast

244
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,289
I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater

245
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,889
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast

246
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,641
I just expected it ten years later

247
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,041
I've got a singular impression

248
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,282
Things are moving too fast

249
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,125
And you say "Oh, no, step on the brakes

250
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,806
Do whatever it takes,
but stop this train

251
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,964
Slow, slow, the light's turning red"

252
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,323
But I say "No, no,

253
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,609
Whatever I do I barrel on through
and I don't complain"

254
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,129
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead

255
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,366
I'm never worried to walk the wire

256
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,969
I won't do anything just half-assed

257
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,562
But with the stakes
getting somewhat higher

258
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,042
I've got a singular impression

259
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,683
That things are moving too fast

260
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,124
I found a woman I love

261
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,921
And I found an agent who loves me

262
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,320
He's like a young Jonathan Franzen.

263
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,527
Things might get bumpy

264
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,203
But some people analyze every detail

265
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,289
Some people stall
when they can't see the trail

266
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,644
Some people freeze out of fear
that they'll fail

267
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,409
But I keep rolling on

268
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,124
Some people can't find
success with their art

269
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,964
Some people never feel
love in their heart

270
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,364
Some people can't tell
the two things apart

271
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,765
But I keep rolling on

272
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,125
Oh, oh

273
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,729
Maybe I can't follow through

274
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,363
But oh, oh

275
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,809
What else am I supposed to do?

276
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,564
Ooh

277
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,362
Hey, Mike, it's Cathy.
Uh, yeah, how are you?

278
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,649
Um, yeah, no, just two quick things.

279
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,848
I'm not going
to talk your ear off. Uh...

280
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,565
I just wanted to know if you got

281
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,291
the reviews that I sent you
from last summer?

282
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,440
Thank you. Yeah, it's really exciting.

283
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,329
Um...

284
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,642
No, the second thing was just...

285
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,647
...if you have anything
you want to send me in on,

286
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,043
I'm sort of suddenly...
free this summer,

287
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,601
I'm, like, available, so...

288
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,684
Um... Yes.

289
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,526
Yeah, as soon as I'm doing something
in the city, I'll let you know.

290
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,330
Uh-huh. Uh...

291
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,241
OK. No, no, no, no, I understand.
OK, thanks.

292
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,085
That wasn't...
that wasn't too painful, was it?

293
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,330
Right. OK. Um...

294
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,682
OK. Bye, Mike.

295
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,450
MAN: OK, ladies.

296
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,730
Uh... Mariah, Taylor, Rachel,

297
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,929
Lauren and Sophia.

298
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,082
Follow me to the dance audition.

299
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,323
And everyone else, thank you very much.

300
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,567
I dreamed of writing
like the high and mighty

301
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,009
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war

302
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,524
I met my personal Aphrodite

303
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,730
I'm doing things
I never dreamed of before

304
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,602
We start to take the next step together

305
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,606
Found an apartment on 73rd

306
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,522
The Atlantic Monthly's
printing my first chapter

307
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,123
Two thousand bucks
without rewriting one word

308
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,842
I left Columbia and I don't regret it

309
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,447
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it

310
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,887
My heart's been stolen

311
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,008
My ego's swollen

312
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,121
I just keep rolling along

313
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,410
Oh

314
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
Oh, yeah

315
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,651
And I think "Well, well,
what else is in store?"

316
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,928
Got all this and more before 24

317
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,961
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control

318
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,407
Out of control

319
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,963
I'm feeling panicked
and rushed and hurried

320
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,569
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed

321
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,167
But I'm so happy I can't get worried

322
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,887
About this singular impression

323
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,721
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

324
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,927
Hi, can I help you?

325
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,043
Yes, hi. I'm looking for Alise Michaels.

326
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,531
- Mr. Wellerstein.
- Yes.

327
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,330
Hey, I'm Dade, Alise's assistant.

328
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,801
- Let me show you the way.
- Oh, great.

329
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,328
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi. Jamie.

330
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,608
- Jamie Wellerstein.
- Alise Michaels.

331
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,201
It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.

332
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,441
- Wow, this is great.
- Have a seat.

333
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,926
Would you like a glass of water?

334
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,890
Yes. Thank you so much for having me.

335
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,970
Everyone in the office
is absolutely thrilled to meet you.

336
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,044
JAMIE: Everybody has been so nice,
from just walking in the door.

337
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,009
ALISE: Everyone's a huge fan of the book.
JAMIE: This is beautiful.

338
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,484
- I've never even been this high up.
- It's a great office. Yes, thank you.

339
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,050
That's great. Thank you.

340
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,201
One day we're just like
Leave It To Beaver

341
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,651
One day it's just a typical life

342
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,806
And then he's off on
a trip to Jamie-land

343
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,410
Staring catatonic out the window

344
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,967
Barely even breathing all the while

345
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,801
And then he'll smile

346
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,483
His eyes light up
and deep within the ground

347
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,768
Without a sound

348
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,487
A moment comes to life

349
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,443
And I'm a part of that

350
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,207
I'm a part of that

351
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,282
Next day it's just like
it never happened

352
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,727
We're making dinners

353
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,326
We're making plans

354
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,089
Then he gets on the
mule train to Jamie-land

355
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:33,247
Handful after handful of Doritos

356
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,607
Circling the apartment, Logging miles

357
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,766
And then he smiles

358
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,403
His eyes light up
And how can I complain?

359
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,728
Yes, he's insane

360
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,168
But look what he can do

361
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,367
And I'm a part of that

362
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:10,246
I'm a part of that

363
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,449
And it's true

364
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,844
I tend to follow in his stride

365
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,446
Instead of side by side

366
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,810
I take his cue

367
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,406
True

368
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,764
But there's no question,
there's no doubt

369
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,605
I said I'd stick it out

370
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,721
And follow through

371
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,447
And when I do

372
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,849
Then he smiles

373
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,725
And where else can I go?

374
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,843
I didn't know

375
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,164
The rules do not apply

376
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,644
And then he smiles

377
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,406
And nothing else makes sense

378
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,887
While he invents

379
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,886
The world that's passing by

380
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,444
And I'm a part of that

381
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm a part of that

382
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,482
I'm a part of that

383
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,120
Aren't I?

384
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm a part of that

385
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,720
(DOOR UNLOCKS, OPENS)

386
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,087
JAMIE: Hey. How are you doing, babe?

387
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,091
You did...

388
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,764
Not a very good day at the bar, huh?

389
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,971
I'm sorry. Did you at least,
uh... get some good tips?

390
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,201
- Get any, uh...
- (SHATTERING)

391
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,044
- Shit!
- Oh.

392
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,088
You look really nice.

393
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,008
Hey, uh... are you working
on anything tonight?

394
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,528
- Like what?
- You know, your photos? The dress?

395
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,728
Like... Don't you have
an audition or something

396
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,245
later this week that
you need to get ready for?

397
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,164
- I'm not going.
- Why?

398
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,846
Because, I'm not going to get it.

399
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,442
Oh, come on, did you call
your agent or anything?

400
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,125
- He's on a retreat.
- Retreat?

401
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,760
What the hell is an agent retreat?

402
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,002
I don't know. They go into the woods

403
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,970
and sacrifice actresses
to breed more agents.

404
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,484
That's frightening, Cathy.

405
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,966
- (HE LAUGHS)
- I don't make them do it.

406
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,445
Hey, no, look, I have prepared
a little surprise for you

407
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,206
in the form of the story.

408
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,562
- No, baby, please.
- (LAUGHS) Come on.

409
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,451
- No, I've had such a shitty day.
- No, listen...

410
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,568
I've literally been doing this for hours,
so you're going to sit up

411
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,041
for, like, five minutes and listen, OK?

412
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,841
You know, if I had known
there were going to be this many stories,

413
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,044
- I wouldn't have ever dated a writer.
- (LAUGHS) Well, too late.

414
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,249
(LAUGHS) You're going
to like it. I promise.

415
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,767
It's a Christmas story.
You like Christmas.

416
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,567
I call it the Story of Schmuel,
the Tailor of Klimovich.

417
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,207
Schmuel would work till half-past ten

418
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
At his tailor shop in Klimovich

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,367
Get up at dawn and start again

420
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,769
With the hems and pins and twist

421
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,126
Are you going to touch my dress right now?

422
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,726
Forty-one years had come and gone

423
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,326
At his tailor shop in Klimovich

424
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,881
Watching the winters soldier on

425
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,725
There was one thing Schmuel missed

426
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,961
Are you ready for this?

427
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,891
"If I only had time" old Schmuel said

428
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,845
"I would build
the dress that's in my head

429
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,850
A dress to fire the mad desire

430
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,520
Of girls from here to Minsk

431
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,130
But I have no more hours left to sew"

432
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:38,287
Then the clock upon the wall
began to glow

433
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,401
And the clock said

434
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,523
"Na na na na, na na na

435
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,445
Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy

436
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,924
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time"

437
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,323
- It's a magical clock.
- I've never been more attracted to you.

438
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,211
"So Schmuel
Go sew and be happy"

439
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,682
But Schmuel said
"No, no, it's not my lot

440
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,448
I've gotta make do
with the time I've got

441
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,844
Oh, look at the time. It's time to go.

442
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,684
- (CLATTERING)
- Here we go.

443
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,882
Why do all my things
have to come into this?

444
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,008
Schmuel was done at half-past ten

445
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,731
And he said "Good night, old Klimovich"

446
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,281
Put on his coat to go
But then

447
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,920
The clock cried
"Wait! Not yet"

448
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,684
Pretty good, right?

449
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,161
"Even though you're not wise or rich

450
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,931
You're the finest man in Klimovich

451
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,560
Listen up, Schmuel
Make one stitch

452
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,769
And you'll see what you get"

453
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,650
But Schmuel said
"Clock, it's much too late

454
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,406
I'm at peace with life I accept my fate"

455
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,564
But the clock said "Schmuel!
One stitch and you will

456
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
Unlock the dreams you've lost"

457
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,890
So Schmuel, with reluctance,
took his thread

458
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,285
He pulled a bolt of velvet and he said

459
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,368
"I should take out my teeth
and go to bed

460
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,928
I'm sitting here with talking clocks

461
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,130
Instead"

462
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,971
And the clock said
"Na na na na, na na na

463
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,851
Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy"

464
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,001
And then they dance.

465
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,531
Na na na na, na na na

466
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,284
No. No, thank you.

467
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,001
Come on!

468
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,730
Na na na na, na na na

469
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,726
"Just do it and you can be happy"

470
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,400
So Schmuel put the thread
through the needle's eye

471
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,360
And the moon stared down
from a starless sky

472
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,965
And he pushed the thread
through the velvet black

473
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,126
And he looked, and the clock
was turning back

474
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,284
So he grabbed his shears
and he cut some lace

475
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,530
As the hands reversed
on the old clock's face

476
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,524
And his fingers flew
and the fabric swirled

477
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,163
It was 9:15 all around the world

478
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,802
Every cut and stitch was a perfect fit

479
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,043
As if God Himself were controlling it

480
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,807
And Schmuel cried
through a rush of tears

481
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,729
"Take me back

482
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,927
Take me back all 41 years"

483
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,241
(SIGHS)

484
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,005
And on it went

485
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,606
Down that silent street

486
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,047
Till Schmuel's dress

487
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,727
Was at last complete

488
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,645
And he stretched his arms

489
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,202
And he closed his eyes

490
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,284
And the morning sun

491
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,161
Finally started

492
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,245
To rise

493
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,882
And the dress he made
on that endless night

494
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,044
Was a dress that would make
any soul take flight

495
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,204
Not a swatch, not a skein
had gone to waste

496
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,728
Every ribbon and button ideally placed

497
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,566
And sewn into the seams

498
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,284
Were 41 seasons of dreams

499
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,366
Dreams that you could feel

500
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,364
Coming real

501
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,010
Come on.

502
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,968
And that very dress so the papers swore

503
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,169
Was the dress a girl in Odessa wore

504
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,449
On the day she promised forevermore

505
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,403
To love a young man named Schmuel

506
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,641
Who only one day before

507
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,284
Had knocked at her kitchen door

508
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,485
Thank you.

509
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,530
That was pretty long, but it was fun.

510
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,727
Oh, it's not over yet.

511
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,406
Plenty have hoped and dreamed and prayed

512
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,724
But they can't get out of Klimovich

513
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,764
If Schmuel had been a cute goyishe maid

514
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,282
He'd have looked a lot like you

515
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,887
- Sorry, I'm Schmuel in this story!?
- Oh, yeah.

516
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,371
I'm not the girl from Odessa?

517
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,922
Maybe it's just that
you're afraid to go out

518
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,369
On to a limb... ovich

519
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,561
Uh...

520
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,564
Maybe your heart's completely swayed

521
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,007
But your head can't follow through

522
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,170
But shouldn't I want the world to see

523
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,687
The brilliant girl who inspires me?

524
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,730
Don't you think that
now's a good time to be

525
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,043
The ambitious freak you are?

526
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,086
Say goodbye to wiping
ashtrays at the bar

527
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,401
Come on.

528
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,961
Say hello to Cathy Hiatt

529
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,729
A big-time star

530
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,881
Ah!

531
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,041
'Cause I say

532
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,770
"Na na na na, na na na na

533
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,844
Cathy, you get to be happy

534
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,325
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time

535
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,044
Na na na na na na na
Stop temping and go, go be happy"

536
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,164
Here's a headshot guy
and a new Backstage

537
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,210
Where you're right for
something on every page

538
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,250
Take a breath
Take a step

539
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,281
Take a chance

540
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,889
Take your time

541
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,845
Have I mentioned today

542
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,444
How lucky I am

543
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,082
To be in love

544
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,687
With you

545
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,121
(STRUMMING GUITAR)

546
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,209
Hi.

547
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,721
I could have a mansion on a hill

548
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,242
I could lease a villa in Seville

549
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,166
But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio

550
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,846
With a gay midget named Karl

551
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,651
Playing Tevye and Porgy

552
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,724
(LAUGHS) God... Wow.

553
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,491
I could wander Paris after dark

554
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,883
Take a carriage ride
through Central Park

555
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,487
But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio

556
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,725
Where I'm sharing a room
with a former stripper and her snake

557
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,450
- I love you.
- Wayne.

558
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,886
Oh, my God!

559
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,407
I could have a satchel

560
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,006
Full of dollar bills

561
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,083
Cures for all the nation's ills

562
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,241
Oh!

563
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,566
Pills to make a lion purr

564
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,048
I could be in line
to be the British queen

565
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,248
Look like I was 17

566
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,401
Wow.

567
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
Still I'm certain I'd prefer

568
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,130
To be going slowly batty

569
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,251
Forty miles east of Cincinnati

570
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,207
I could shove an ice pick in my eye

571
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,489
I could eat some fish from last July

572
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,201
But it wouldn't be as awful
as a summer in Ohio

573
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,249
Without cable, hot water

574
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,121
Vietnamese food or you

575
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,410
Oh, baby, I love you.

576
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,847
I saw your book at a Target

577
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,040
In Kentucky under a sign that said
"new and recommended"

578
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,682
I stole a look at your
picture on the inside sleeve

579
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,925
And then I couldn't leave

580
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,643
Richard, who was with me
got uncharacteristically quiet

581
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,282
And he said, "All things considered,
I guess you don't have to buy it"

582
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,447
So I smile like Mona Lisa
and I lay my Visa down

583
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,968
He wants me
He wants me

584
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,010
But he ain't gonna get me

585
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,161
Damn right!

586
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,891
I've found my guiding light

587
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,249
I tell the stars each night

588
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,961
Look at me
Look at him

589
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,402
Son of a bitch,
I guess I'm doing something right

590
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,202
I finally got something right

591
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,649
No, it's not Nirvana but it's on the way

592
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,327
I play Anita at the matinee

593
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,960
Then I'll get on my knees and pray

594
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,964
I can state in my next bio

595
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,081
I'm never gonna go back to Ohio

596
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,404
I could chew on tin foil for a spell

597
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,047
I could get a root canal in hell

598
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,202
But it wouldn't be as swell

599
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,321
As this summer is gonna be

600
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,848
'Cause the torture is just exquisite

601
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,163
While I'm waiting for you to visit

602
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,641
So hurry up, schmuck

603
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,249
Get unstuck and get on the scene

604
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,006
Love the midget, the stripper,

605
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,722
Wayne the snake
and Mrs. Jamie Wellerstein

606
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,927
That's me

607
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,522
JAMIE: No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld

608
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,563
That one's John Lennon there

609
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,680
No, the Dakota

610
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,930
The San Remo is up a few blocks

611
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,209
Have you been inside the museum?

612
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,601
We should go

613
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,171
Meet the dinosaurs

614
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,531
Cathy

615
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,800
Will you share your life with me

616
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,601
For the next ten minutes?

617
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,043
For the next ten minutes

618
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,841
We can handle that

619
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,368
We could watch the waves

620
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,007
We could watch the sky

621
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,801
Or just sit and wait

622
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,123
As the time ticks by

623
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,529
And if we make it till then

624
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,210
Could I ask you again

625
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,364
For another ten?

626
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,562
And if you in turn agree

627
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,287
To the next ten minutes

628
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,001
And the next ten minutes

629
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,642
Till the morning comes

630
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,486
Then just holding you

631
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,450
Might compel me to

632
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,525
Ask you for more

633
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:16,528
There are so many lives
I want to share with you

634
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,089
I will never be complete

635
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,168
Until I do

636
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,647
I am not always on time

637
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,929
Please don't expect that from me

638
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,687
I will be late
But if you can just wait

639
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,447
I will make it eventually

640
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,843
Not like it's in my control

641
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,442
Not like I'm proud of the fact

642
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,288
But anything other than
being exactly on time

643
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,727
I can do

644
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,926
I don't know why people run

645
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,801
I don't know why things fall through

646
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,965
I don't know how anybody
survives in this life

647
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,090
Without someone like you

648
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,762
I could protect and preserve

649
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,970
I could say no and goodbye

650
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,210
But why, Jamie?

651
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,364
Why?

652
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,482
I want to be your wife

653
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,847
I want to bear your child

654
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,640
I want to die, knowing I

655
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,724
Had a long, full life

656
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,887
In your arms

657
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,524
That I can do

658
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,201
- Forever, with you
- Will you share your life with me?

659
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,206
- Forever
- For the next ten lifetimes?

660
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,524
- Forever, Jamie
- For a million summers?

661
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,088
BOTH: Till the world explodes

662
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,642
Till there's no one left

663
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,807
Who has ever known us apart

664
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,010
There are so many dreams
I need to see with you

665
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,602
There are so many years
I need to be with you

666
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,321
I will never be complete

667
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,963
I will never be alive

668
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:12,127
I will never change the world

669
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,330
Until I do

670
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,480
I do

671
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,647
I

672
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,481
Do

673
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,721
(APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

674
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,486
CATHY: Is that one John Lennon?

675
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,924
That's the San Remo?

676
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,762
Isn't that the museum?

677
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,971
Can we go see the dinosaurs?

678
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,169
(UPBEAT ROCK PLAYS)

679
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,330
Thank you.

680
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,571
Are you kidding me? (LAUGHS)

681
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,330
Everyone tells you that
the minute you get married

682
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,370
Every other woman in the world
suddenly finds you attractive

683
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,170
Well, that's not true

684
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,410
It only affects the kind of women
you always wanted to sleep with

685
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,881
But they wouldn't give you
the time of day before

686
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,840
And now they're banging down your door,
and falling to their knees

687
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,368
At least that's what it feels like
because you can not touch them!

688
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,124
In fact, you can't even look at them

689
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,681
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

690
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,841
Close your eyes

691
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,571
Except you're sitting there
eating your corned beef sandwich

692
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,688
And all of a sudden,
this pair of breasts walks by

693
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,683
And smiles at you and you're like,

694
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,205
"That's not fair"

695
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,686
And in a perfect world

696
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,729
A miracle would happen

697
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,521
And every other girl would fly away

698
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,162
And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter

699
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,370
But it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, I mean, I'm happy

700
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,922
And I'm fine, I'm fine
I'm fine, it's not a problem

701
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,050
It's just a challenge
it's a challenge to resist

702
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,249
Temptation

703
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,407
And I have to say that
what exacerbates the problem

704
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,489
ls I'm at these parties
I'm the center of attention

705
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,291
I'm the grand fromage
And here she comes

706
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,563
"Let's get a cup of coffee
Will you look at my manuscript?"

707
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,645
And I'm showing her my left hand,
I'm gesticulating with my left hand

708
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,122
And then, whoa! There's Cathy!
Because she knows, they always know

709
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,884
And there's that really awkward moment

710
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,844
Where I try to show
I wasn't encouraging this

711
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,041
Which of course I was

712
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,884
And I don't want to look whipped
in front of this woman

713
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,086
Which is dumb, I shouldn't care what
she thinks since I can't touch her anyway!

714
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,887
And in a perfect world,
a miracle would happen

715
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,362
And every girl would look like Mister Ed

716
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,488
And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter

717
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,571
But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
You know I love her

718
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,406
And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
it's what I wanted

719
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,121
And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
it's not a problem

720
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,164
It's just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist

721
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,367
Temptation

722
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,641
Hi, Mr. Wellerstein.
I'll let Alise know you're here.

723
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,164
CATHY: When you come home to me

724
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,287
I'll wear a sweeter smile

725
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:13,368
And hope that, for a while, you'll stay

726
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,645
When you come home to me

727
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,168
Your hand will touch my face

728
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,367
And banish any trace of gray

729
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,763
Soon, a love will rise anew

730
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,323
Even greater than the joy I felt

731
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,485
Just missing you

732
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,726
And once again, I'll be

733
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,205
So proud to call you mine

734
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:57,321
When finally you come home

735
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,162
To me

736
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,681
- That was lovely.
- Really great.

737
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,684
- Thank you.
- Thank you. OK.

738
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,005
No, it went really, really well. Yeah.

739
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,282
No, I think I got it.

740
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,887
I mean, I hope. Yeah.
It's off Broadway, so...

741
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,321
Please, God, no more Ohio. (LAUGHS)

742
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,166
Um, I don't where I'm walking, actually.

743
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,288
- You have to come find me.
- (JAMIE LAUGHS)

744
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,126
I'll be there soon, Cathy

745
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,363
I'll finish up this chapter
and be out the door

746
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,531
I swear I'll be there soon, Cathy

747
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,287
Don't give up on me yet

748
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,530
I am so proud of you, baby

749
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,321
You're doing what you
never got to do before

750
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,121
And I will be there ripe and crawling

751
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,080
If frigging Random House stops calling

752
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,528
Don't lose faith
Don't get down

753
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,687
Don't despair

754
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,722
I'll be there

755
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,963
And in a perfect world

756
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,647
A miracle would happen

757
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,807
And that day would finally be here

758
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,280
And it'd be me and you

759
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,970
Riding it together

760
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,602
And the things we do
going like we planned

761
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,001
We're gonna make it through

762
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,366
And nothing else will matter

763
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,329
We'll be fine
We're fine

764
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,403
We're fine
We're fine

765
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:52,885
We're fine
We're fine, we're fine

766
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,765
I'll be there soon, Cathy

767
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,611
I swear I will

768
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,524
When you come home to me

769
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,682
I'll wear a sweeter smile

770
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,769
And hope that for a while you'll...

771
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,564
OK. Thank you.

772
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,050
I'm climbing uphill, Jamie

773
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,884
Climbing uphill

774
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,924
I'm up every morning at six

775
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,404
And standing in line with 200 girls

776
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,888
Who are younger and thinner than me

777
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,209
Who have already been to the gym

778
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,443
I'm waiting five hours in line

779
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,002
And watching the girls
just coming and going

780
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,401
In dresses that look just like this

781
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,681
WOMAN: Cathy Hiatt.

782
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,844
Until my number is finally called

783
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,128
When I walk in the room,
there's a table of men

784
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,602
Always men, usually gay

785
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,969
Who've been sitting like I have
and listening all day

786
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:42,082
To 200 girls belting as high as they can

787
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,483
I am a good person

788
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,008
I'm an attractive person

789
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,323
I am a talented person

790
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,487
Grant me grace

791
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,606
When you come home

792
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,683
I should have told them
I was sick last week

793
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,001
They're gonna think
this is the way I sing

794
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,605
Why is the pianist playing so loud?

795
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,888
Should I sing louder? I'll sing louder

796
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,405
Maybe I should stop and start over

797
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,164
I'm gonna stop and start over

798
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,044
Why is the director staring
at his crotch?

799
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,441
Why is that man staring at my resume?

800
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,204
Don't stare at my resume

801
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,249
I made up half of my resume
Look at me

802
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,686
Stop looking at that
Look at me

803
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,569
No, not at my shoes
Don't look at my shoes

804
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,529
I hate these stupid shoes

805
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,966
Why did I pick these shoes

806
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,451

be like when we have kids?

While Mitchell's out every night
being a heavy-metal drummer

965
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,923
They got a little cute house
on a little cute street

966
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,726
With a crucifix on the door

967
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,248
Mitchell got a job
at a record store in the mall

968
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,403
Just the typical facts of a typical life

969
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,769
In a town on the Eastern Shore

970
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,964
I thought about what I wanted

971
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,964
It wasn't like that at all

972
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,249
Made Carol Ann a cute baby sweater

973
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,370
Thinking I can do better than that

974
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,441
- Ow!
- Please just drive. Please just drive!

975
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,602
(LAUGHS)

976
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,646
In a year or so I moved to the city

977
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,804
Thinking "What have I got to lose?"

978
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,411
Got a room, got a cat
and got 20 pounds thinner

979
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:45,408
Met a guy in a class I was taking
with some very well placed tattoos

980
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,526
He wouldn't leave me alone
'less I went with him to dinner

981
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,722
And I guess he was cute
and I guess he was sweet

982
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,804
And I guess he was good in bed

983
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,809
I gave up my life
for a better part of a year

984
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,249
So I'm starting to think
that this maybe might work

985
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,722
And the second it entered my head

986
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,884
He needed to take some time off

987
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,731
Focus on his career

988
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,009
He blew me off with a heartfelt letter

989
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,164
I thought, "I can do better than that"

990
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,608
You don't have to get a haircut

991
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,724
You don't have to change your shoes

992
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,089
You don't have to like Duran Duran

993
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,321
Just one song!

994
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,090
Just love me

995
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,403
You don't have to put the seat down

996
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,769
You don't have to watch the news

997
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,685
You don't have to learn to tango

998
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,208
You don't have to eat prosciutto

999
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,647
You don't have to change a thing

1000
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:58,728
Just stay with me

1001
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,805
I want you and you and nothing but you

1002
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,241
Miles and piles of you

1003
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,370
Finally, I'll have something worthwhile

1004
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,683
To think of each morning

1005
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,208
You and you and nothing but you

1006
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,727
No substitution will do

1007
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,963
Nothing but fresh undiluted and pure

1008
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,365
Top of the line

1009
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:32,527
And totally mine

1010
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,686
I don't need any lifetime commitments

1011
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,730
I don't need to get hitched tonight

1012
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,731
I don't want you to throw up
all your walls and defenses

1013
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,087
I don't mean to put on any pressure

1014
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,244
But I know when a thing is right

1015
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,562
And I spend every day
reconfiguring my senses

1016
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,642
When we get to my house
take a look at that town

1017
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,167
Take a look at how far I've gone

1018
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,362
I will never go back
Never look back anymore

1019
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,167
And it feels like my life
led right to your side

1020
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,324
And will keep me there from now on

1021
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,848
Think about what you wanted

1022
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,771
Think about what could be

1023
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,964
Think about how I love you

1024
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,090
And say you'll move in with me

1025
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,164
Think of what's great about me and you

1026
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,085
Think of the bullshit
we've both been through

1027
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:42,247
Think of what's past
because we can do better

1028
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,530
We can do better

1029
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,687
We can do better than that

1030
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,329
We can do better than that

1031
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,008
Hey, kid

1032
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,685
Good morning

1033
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,847
You look like an angel

1034
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,604
I don't remember

1035
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,685
When we fell asleep

1036
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,647
We should get up, kid

1037
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,441
Cathy is waiting

1038
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,481
Look at us, lying here

1039
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,167
Dreaming, pretending

1040
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,364
I made a promise

1041
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,605
And I took a vow

1042
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,684
I wrote a story

1043
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,129
And we changed the ending

1044
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:32,287
Cathy, just look at me now

1045
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,045
Hold on

1046
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,488
Facts are facts

1047
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,082
Just relax

1048
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,689
Lay low

1049
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,526
All right

1050
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,890
The panic recedes

1051
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,681
Nobody needs

1052
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,210
To know

1053
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,126
Hmm

1054
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,404
Put on my armor

1055
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,243
I'm off to Ohio

1056
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,003
Back into battle

1057
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,210
Till I don't know when

1058
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,882
Swearing to her that I

1059
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,362
Never was with you

1060
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,204
And praying

1061
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:47,367
I'll hold you again

1062
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,445
Hold on

1063
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,286
Clip these wings

1064
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:01,322
Things get out of hand

1065
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,000
All right

1066
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,004
It's over It's done

1067
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:17,162
No one will understand

1068
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:27,247
No one will understand

1069
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,842
We build a tree house

1070
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,891
I keep it from shaking

1071
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:54,047
Little more glue
every time that it breaks

1072
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,123
Perfectly balanced

1073
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,841
And then I start making

1074
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,604
The conscious

1075
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:09,767
Deliberate mistakes

1076
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,323
All that I ask for

1077
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,326
ls one little corner

1078
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,051
One private room

1079
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,489
At the back of my heart

1080
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,763
Tell her I found one

1081
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,686
She sends out battalions

1082
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,211
To claim it

1083
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:42,402
And blow it apart

1084
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,483
I grip and she grips

1085
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,281
And faster we're sliding

1086
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,523
Sliding and spilling

1087
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,048
And what can I do?

1088
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,521
Come back to bed, kid

1089
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,810
Take me inside you

1090
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,962
I promise

1091
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:15,127
I won't lie to you

1092
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,171
Hold on

1093
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,847
Don't cry yet

1094
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,007
I won't let you go

1095
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,207
All right

1096
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,809
The panic recedes

1097
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,324
All right

1098
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,246
Everyone bleeds

1099
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,325
All right

1100
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:56,202
I get what I need

1101
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,760
And nobody needs

1102
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,927
To know

1103
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,960
Nobody needs

1104
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,604
To know

1105
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,727
And since I have to be
in love with someone

1106
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:40,408
Since I need to be in love with someone

1107
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:46,607
Maybe I could be in love with someone

1108
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,007
Like you

1109
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,242
Don't kiss me goodbye again

1110
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,050
Leave this night clean and quiet

1111
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,527
You want the last word

1112
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,648
You want me to laugh

1113
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:46,647
But leave it for now

1114
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,408
All you can say
All you can feel

1115
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,849
Was wrapped up inside
that one perfect kiss

1116
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,287
Leave it at that

1117
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:04,163
I'll watch you turn the corner and go

1118
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,882
And goodbye until tomorrow

1119
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,648
Goodbye until the next time you call

1120
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,280
And I will be waiting

1121
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,843
I will be waiting

1122
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:29,011
Goodbye until tomorrow

1123
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:33,848
Goodbye till I recall how to breathe

1124
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,731
And I have been waiting

1125
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,841
I have been waiting for you

1126
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,803
I stand on a precipice

1127
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,290
I struggle to keep my balance

1128
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,011
I open myself

1129
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:07,207
I open myself one stitch at a time

1130
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:12,569
Finally yes
Finally now

1131
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:17,123
Finally something takes me away

1132
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,521
Finally free

1133
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:25,727
Finally he can cut through these strings

1134
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:31,201
And open my wings

1135
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,042
So goodbye until tomorrow

1136
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,609
Goodbye until my feet touch the floor

1137
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:46,767
And I will be waiting I will be waiting

1138
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:54,284
Goodbye until tomorrow

1139
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:58,923
Goodbye until the rest of my life

1140
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,208
And I have been waiting

1141
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:07,083
I have been waiting for you

1142
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:17,048
Waiting for you

1143
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:28,251
I called Alise to help me pack my bags

1144
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,729
I went downtown
and closed the bank account

1145
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,289
It's not about another shrink

1146
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:43,048
It's not about another compromise

1147
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:53,964
I'm not the only one who's hurting here

1148
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,330
I don't know what the hell is left to do

1149
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,841
You never saw how far
the crack had opened

1150
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,408
You never knew I had run out of rope

1151
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:17,567
And I could never rescue you

1152
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,771
All you ever wanted

1153
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,926
But I could never rescue you

1154
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:33,688
No matter how I tried

1155
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,810
All I could do

1156
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,964
Was love you hard

1157
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:44,409
And let you go

1158
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,686
No matter how I tried

1159
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,491
All I could do

1160
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,762
Was love you

1161
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:15,927
God, I loved you so

1162
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:22,887
So we could fight

1163
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,524
Or we could wait

1164
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,687
- Or I could go
- Goodbye until tomorrow

1165
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:41,922
Goodbye until I crawl to your door

1166
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,402
And I will be waiting

1167
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,531
I will be waiting

1168
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:54,601
You never noticed
how the wind had changed

1169
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,685
Goodbye until tomorrow

1170
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,127
I didn't see a way we both could win

1171
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:06,486
Goodbye until I'm done thanking God

1172
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,042
And I have been waiting

1173
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:15,246
I have been waiting for you

1174
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,485
Goodbye, Cathy

1175
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,484
I have been waiting

1176
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:28,409
I have been waiting for you

1177
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,769
Goodbye

1178
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,651
I will keep waiting

1179
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,523
I will keep waiting for you

1180
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,487
Just close the gate

1181
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:59,051
I'll stand and wait

1182
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,521
Jamie

1183
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:07,130
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

1184
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,685
