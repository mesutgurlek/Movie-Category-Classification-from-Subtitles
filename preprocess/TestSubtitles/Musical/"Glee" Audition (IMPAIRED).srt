1
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,008
<i>So, here's what you missed
last season on Glee.</i>

2
00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:05,043
<i>Quinn had a baby,
Finn and Rachel are in love,</i>

3
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:06,979
<i>Sue's going easy on Will,
and even though the Glee Club</i>

4
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:08,914
<i>worked really hard to get
to Regionals, they didn't win.</i>

5
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:10,983
<i>Vocal Adrenaline!
But it's okay
to not win an award,</i>

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,185
<i>particularly when you had so
much fun getting there, right?</i>

7
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:14,619
<i>Right?</i>

8
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,088
We didn't even place.

9
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:17,990
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

10
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:21,093
Up here. Come on, focus.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,694
Okay.

12
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:26,064
<i>Hi, I'm Jacob Ben Israel
with Glee's Big Gay Summer,</i>

13
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:28,734
with all the Glee Club dish
you're dying to know.

14
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,402
Rachel, how do you
respond to rumors

15
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,337
you're incredibly difficult
to work with?

16
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,272
Well, as her boyfriend,
I can answer that.

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,474
We've been dating all summer.

18
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,942
Rachel's what you'd call

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,110
a controllist.

20
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:39,277
I-I'm controlling.

21
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:40,278
"Controllist" isn't a word.

22
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:41,546
Oh.
I'm controlling.

23
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:43,248
Performing is my life.

24
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:45,784
And yes, do I have
opinions about it?

25
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:47,819
Does my need to constantly
express those opinions

26
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:49,021
annoy my fellow Glee Clubbers?

27
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:50,789
Yes.

28
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:53,492
That was out loud, wasn't it?

29
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,228
Will Schuester, how do you
respond to a recent post

30
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:59,064
on my blog saying
your Glee Club song selections

31
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:02,234
sound like they come from
a drag queen's iPod?

32
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,403
Well, I try to do
something for everybody.

33
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,840
Uh, 25% show tunes, 25%
hip-hop, 25% classic rock...

34
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,475
100% gay.

35
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:12,010
<i>Confirm or deny the rumor</i>

36
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:14,212
that because you knocked up
Quinn Fabray,

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,549
you spent all your summer pool
cleaning money on a vasectomy.

38
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:18,984
It's true.

39
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,719
It was the responsible
thing to do.

40
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:23,722
Is it also true you're suffering
from a crippling depression

41
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,192
because you're
not over Miss Fabray?

42
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,563
How has life changed since
the birth of your bastard child?

43
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:34,166
Well, I'm happy to be
back, and I'm ready

44
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,434
to start fresh.

45
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:39,204
And... I'm a lot less hormonal,

46
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:41,039
so... so there's not
really any crying.

47
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:42,340
How was your summer?

48
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,543
My eyes are up here, JewFro.

49
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,710
And it was uneventful.

50
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,446
People thought I
went on vacation,

51
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,881
but actually I spent the
summer lost in the sewers.

52
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,083
<i>What can you say</i>

53
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,118
about the rumors
the two of you are dating?

54
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:54,119
Because we're both Asian?

55
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,187
That's racist.

56
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:56,354
Totally racist.

57
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:03,028
Did you get that?
Did you get that?

58
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:04,062
You saw it here first.

59
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:07,999
Did you know there's
a forum on my blog

60
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,236
that's begging you
to stop rapping?

61
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,505
Wait, th-the kids
don't like it when I rap?

62
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,107
<i>When will you Glee Clubbers</i>

63
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:17,242
accept the fact
that people hate you
Kiss it, Jacob.

64
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,978
And think you're nothing
but a glorified karaoke club
Go away, go away.

65
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,681
Designed to make the inventors
of AutoTune millions of dollars?

66
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:25,317
When exactly did you ink your
sponsorship with Lands' End?

67
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,518
<i>When are you slated</i>

68
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:28,954
to make your triumphant return
to the Shire?

69
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:30,622
How do you get
the white on rice?

70
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,224
What did you do with
all that breast milk?

71
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,458
You know what, Jacob?

72
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,227
It doesn't take much
courage for people

73
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:37,195
to park their cottage cheese
behinds in their Barcaloungers

74
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:38,497
and log on to the Internet

75
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:40,065
and start tearing
people down, does it?

76
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,867
But you know what does
take some courage?

77
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,369
Standing up and singing
about something.

78
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,838
So here's a message for
everyone that reads your blog.

79
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:49,141
Next time, instead of posting
an anonymous comment online,

80
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,410
say what you have
to say to my face.

81
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:55,714
Welcome back, lady!

82
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,516
Whoo!

83
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,187
I don't suppose there's
any way you could just

84
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,055
cut out that last
part, is there?

85
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,490
Mm-mm.

86
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,617
Hey, why so glum, William?

87
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,619
Cat crap in your coffee?

88
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:35,720
Or are you worried no one's

89
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:36,855
signing up for
your little club there?

90
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,023
Nah, not at all, Sue.

91
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,758
Nationals are
in New York City this year.

92
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:41,793
I think that list is
gonna be filled up in no time.

93
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,161
Well, you know what
your problem is?

94
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,529
"No tryouts,

95
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:45,830
just sign up."

96
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:47,232
Nobody wants to be

97
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
part of a club that
just anyone can join.

98
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:50,302
See this?

99
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,304
It's a court summons...
child endangerment...

100
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,005
'cause there's been a
line of would-be Cheerios!

101
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,707
Out there since late July.

102
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:58,109
I guess they lost their
humanity a little bit.

103
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:00,078
One girl ate a pigeon,
several others

104
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,114
started worshiping a possum
carcass as their lord.

105
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,650
That's how much they
want to be Cheerios!

106
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:06,985
Well, sorry, Sue.

107
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,622
Anyone who wants to join
Glee Club gets to join.

108
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,591
Oh, God, Will, let me
break it down for you.

109
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,227
High school is a dry run
for the rest of your life.

110
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,328
Not everyone can be champions.

111
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:18,663
Not everyone should
be champions.

112
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,299
We need fry cooks
and bus drivers.

113
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:24,169
Well, Sue, it's how I work,
and it's not going to change.

114
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:25,904
I like being friends
with you, Will.

115
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,372
This is fun.

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,274
You make not trying to
destroy Glee Club easy.

117
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:30,642
You know why?

118
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,677
'Cause you're doing such
a bang-up job of it

119
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,079
all by yourself.

120
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:37,249
Oh, it's time to feed my gimp.

121
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:39,718
Oh, and also,
Figgins wants to see us.

122
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,220
Ah-ah-ah! Not you!

123
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:43,388
Hands off that list.

124
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:47,125
Cut my budget?

125
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:49,527
You can't cut my budget
without written consent

126
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,696
from the President
of the Federal Reserve!

127
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:53,365
It's in my contract!

128
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:55,200
Oh, Sue, I think you can manage

129
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:58,136
a sixth national title
without two confetti cannons.

130
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,272
Do you think your kids can
manage life without their daddy?

131
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,940
We're barely surviving
on the budget we have.

132
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,074
Slashing the Glee budget

133
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,509
by ten percent,

134
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:06,011
cutting our transportation
to and from events

135
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,712
is like cutting our legs off.

136
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,514
Sacrifices must be made.

137
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:11,650
This is being mandated
at the district level, guys.

138
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:14,519
Studies show that the best way
to bring in alumni donations

139
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:16,288
is through a successful
athletic department...

140
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,056
Specifically,

141
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:19,658
a winning football team.
Who's this?

142
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,728
I'm Shannon Beiste;
I'm the new football coach.

143
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,797
Spelled B-E-I-S-T-E.

144
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,465
- It's French.
- I'm sorry,

145
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,466
what happened to Ken Tanaka?

146
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:29,634
Nervous breakdown.

147
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:31,936
Don't look at it

148
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,571
as a punishment,

149
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,441
look at it as an investment
into your clubs' futures.

150
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,876
The more money
the football program

151
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:40,245
brings in, the more I can
give back to you guys!

152
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:41,846
Coach Beiste here

153
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,915
is fresh off
her fifth consecutive

154
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,116
all-Missouri high school

155
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,618
football championship.

156
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:48,019
We're very lucky to have her!

157
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,721
What can I say?
I like a challenge.

158
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:51,923
First of all,

159
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:54,459
a female football coach,
like a male nurse...

160
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,061
Sin against nature.

161
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:59,931
Number two, I'm sure you're
used to Hillbilly parents

162
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:01,933
yelping adulation at
you as they attempt

163
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,637
to impregnate the tailpipes
of various off-road vehicles.

164
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:09,240
But you're in my
house now, Beiste.

165
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:12,577
No one comes into my
house and steals from me.

166
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:17,248
Do not get up
in a panther's business, lady.

167
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,351
You're all coffee
and no omelet.

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,520
That doesn't make any sense.

169
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:26,257
Coach, uh, Beiste, I-I think you
understand our frustration.

170
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,259
Our budgets just got
cut by ten percent.

171
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:29,427
It should have been more!

172
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,563
You think there's not
something wrong when

173
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,931
the cheerleaders' budget's
higher than the people

174
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,132
who they're cheering for?

175
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,334
Well, sure, but the
Glee Club is a...

176
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:38,336
The Glee Club?
You came in third last year

177
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:40,772
and you're asking
for more money?

178
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:44,642
That's a steer with
six teats and no oink.

179
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,315
This doesn't make any sense.

180
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:51,316
What?

181
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:53,618
These are comments

182
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:54,853
from Jacob Ben-Israel's

183
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,388
most recent Glee Club blog.

184
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,124
"Glee is a giant ball of suck."

185
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,593
We get it, Mr. Shue.
Everyone still hates us.

186
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,763
So what? So we're plankton
on the high school food chain?

187
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,965
Only difference now
is that none of us really care.

188
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,200
Kurt's right. We're a family.
They can bring it all they want.

189
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:10,535
None of it is going
to break us.

190
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:12,604
Okay, I'm really happy
that you guys have all bonded.

191
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:15,707
The problem is that
all of this negative stuff

192
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,609
is keeping other students
from auditioning.

193
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,477
Good.
Why do we need new members?

194
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:21,112
Well, since Matt transferred,

195
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,614
we only have 11 members,

196
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,815
and if we want to
go to Nationals,

197
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,049
if we want to beat
Vocal Adrenaline,

198
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,918
we have to go from
a small rebel force

199
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:28,353
to a giant wall of sound.

200
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:30,855
Yeah, Mr. Schuester's
right, you guys.

201
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:33,324
You didn't see Vocal Adrenaline
at Regionals. They were epic.

202
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:35,360
We're going to need more voices
in order to beat them.

203
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,796
Yeah. I'm with Rachel
on this one.

204
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,164
Gross.

205
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,399
You're going to have to
trust me on this, guys.

206
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,268
Now, here's the plan.

207
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,470
Nationals are in
New York this year,

208
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,673
and we are going.

209
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:50,074
Now let's go out there

210
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,709
and show the school how
cool it's going to be,

211
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,344
how cool we can be.

212
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:55,580
If they're not going to come
to us, let's go to them.

213
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:58,416
They say we only sing
show tunes and '8os pop.

214
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:01,052
Let's show them how down we are.

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,887
Let's give them the
song of the year,

216
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,923
New Directions! style.

217
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,357
Okay.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah!

218
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,430

¶¶ Bah bah bah. ¶¶.

273
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,404
Hey, Sue. Can I talk
to you for a second?

274
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:35,173
Sure, buddy. You look steamed.

275
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,208
Those kids went out and
really tried to show

276
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,309
what Glee Club was all about.

277
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,777
And how does
the school repay them?

278
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:41,679
By defacing the sign-up sheet.

279
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:43,815
"Buttface McBallnuts."

280
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,117
"Ass-braham Lin-colon."
They're not even funny!

281
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:48,419
Now, don't be rude, William. I
put a lot of thought into those.

282
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:52,256
Consider this a wakeup call.

283
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:53,791
You're worried about
getting new recruits?

284
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,494
Well, if Beiste get her way
and our budgets are slashed,

285
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,396
you'll be cutting kids
left and right.

286
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:01,899
You're right.

287
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,568
I hadn't thought about that.

288
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:08,406
Beiste needs to be stopped, and
I need your help to topple her.

289
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:09,841
You in?

290
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm in.

291
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,325
<i>I was really excited</i>

292
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:23,027
<i>about my Glee Club recruit
poster design.</i>

293
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:25,429
<i>I made it super masculine,
just like these pamphlets I saw</i>

294
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:28,032
<i>some Army guys passing out
at a daycare center.</i>

295
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,967

296
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:33,737
¶¶ We both lie silent and still
in the dead of the night ¶¶

together ¶¶

298
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:40,010
<i>¶¶ I feel like
we're miles apart... ¶¶
It was this new transfer kid.</i>

299
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,413
<i>I saw him tapping his foot
when we busted it out</i>

300
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,782
<i>in the courtyard the day
before...</i>

301
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:49,186
¶¶ Every rose has its thorn ¶¶

302
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:54,925
¶¶ Just like every night
has its dawn ¶¶

303
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:57,494
<i>I would've joined in
with a kick-ass harmony,</i>

304
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,029
<i>but the dude was naked.</i>

305
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:02,533
¶¶ Just like every cowboy sings
a sad, sad song... ¶¶.

306
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:15,846
Oh, hello!

307
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:17,748
I couldn't help
but notice you
admiring me

308
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:19,149
yesterday in
the courtyard.
Um, what?

309
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,517
Oh, you don't speak English.

310
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:22,086
You like me sing!

311
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:25,456
You like me sing very much!

312
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,858
Um, I totally speak English.

313
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,560
I even did
a little research on you.

314
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:30,761
You're a foreign exchange
student

315
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,063
named Sunshine Corazon
because you're from

316
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:34,665
the Philippines,
where it's sunny every day.

317
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,734
Except for the monsoons.
Listen, Sunshine,

318
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,068
we need chorus members;

319
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,070
People to stand behind me
and stare at me

320
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,772
with wet, moved eyes
while I sing solos.

321
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,276
So I encourage you
to audition for Glee Club!

322
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:47,845
Glee Club is fun!

323
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:51,181
Swaying in background
can be fun!

324
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:52,483
Thank you.
Okay.

325
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:59,690
¶¶ Hello, hello, baby, you
called, I can't hear a thing ¶¶

326
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:03,260
¶¶ I have got no service
in the club, you say, say? ¶¶

327
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:07,765
¶¶ Wha-wha-what did you say?
Oh, you're breaking up on me ¶¶

328
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:11,168
¶¶ Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy ¶¶

329
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,170
¶¶ K-kinda busy ¶¶

330
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,773
¶¶ K-kinda busy ¶¶

331
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,743
¶¶ Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy ¶¶

332
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,745
¶¶ Just a second,
it's my favorite song

333
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,213
¶¶ They're gonna play ¶¶

334
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:27,017
¶¶ And I cannot text you
with a drink in my hand, eh? ¶¶

335
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,086
¶¶ You shoulda made some plans
with me ¶¶

336
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,355
¶¶ You knew that I was free ¶¶

337
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:35,325
¶¶ And now you won't stop calling
me, I'm kinda busy ¶¶

338
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:39,863
¶¶ Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna think anymore! ¶¶

339
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,200
¶¶ I left my head and my heart on
the dance floor ¶¶

340

¶¶ I'm being... ¶¶.

345
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,952
Shut up!

346
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:07,491
That was fun.

347
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,926
I'd love to join your club.

348
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,494
When are auditions?

349
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,896
Let me get back
to you on that one.

350
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:14,798
Don't tell anyone
about this, okay?

351
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,233
Okay.

352
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,006
We're trying to recruit
new members for Glee Club.

353
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,477
The Panther isn't cool
with anything

354
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:30,180
except doing exactly
what she says without question.

355
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,682
That's how you win.

356
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:33,383
Now, first things first.

357
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:34,785
You're all cut.

358
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,121
Everyone starts fresh with me.

359
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:38,455
Tryouts start...

360
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:40,390
Right now.
Any questions?

361
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,327
I got 25

362
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:44,695
everything pies for a Coach...

363
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,463
Beiste?

364
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:48,932
I didn't order any pizzas.

365
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:00,644
Isn't this kind of immature?

366
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,713
No, it's downright childish.

367
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,748
But I know gals like Beiste.

368
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,484
Oh, her high school life
must have been miserable.

369
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,987
She's oversized, humorless,

370
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,356
refers to herself in the
third person as an animal.

371
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:15,759
This kind of abuse and teasing

372
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:18,162
will bring back all
those childhood memories.

373
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:20,130
She'll be shaken to her core.

374
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,465
Humiliated and devastated.

375
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,201
She'll have no choice
but to quit her job,

376
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,436
and our budgets
will be restored.

377
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:27,704
Yes!

378
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,306
The boss says, uh,

379
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:32,142
if you don't pay
for 'em, I have to.

380
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,445
Which means we have
to reuse my kid's Pampers.

381
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:37,881
For another week.

382
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,491
Hand 'em out, Wayne Newton.

383
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,493
All right, guys,
it's a pizza party.

384
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,661
Dig in.

385
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:53,163
Everybody has to eat
at least four slices.

386
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,231
Let's go!

387
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,332
And when you're done,

388
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,633
full pads out on the field.

389
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:57,968
We're doing wind sprints.

390
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,203
And the first ten

391
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,239
to puke are off the team.

392
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:11,281
Hey, guys, um, there's pizza
in there, if you want some.

393
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,216
Thank you.
Thank you.

394
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,188
I figured that if Kurt's
gay and he can do it,

395
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,590
then why can't I?

396
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:21,425
Being gay isn't
a handicap, Artie.

397
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,460
How can you play football
in a wheelchair, anyway?

398
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,561
I have to get

399
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:25,829
on that team, Finn.

400
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:28,865
Dude, what's this about?

401
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,434
Tina.

402
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,669
She dumped me for Mike Chang.

403
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:37,207
They fell in love over
the summer at... Asian Camp.

404
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,376
<i>They were counselors,
in charge of teaching</i>

405
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,346
<i>all those tech-savvy Asian kids
about the arts.</i>

406
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:46,650
¶¶ Getting to know
all about you ¶¶

407
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,920
¶¶ Getting to like you... ¶¶.

408
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,360
So, what did Tina say

409
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:58,128
when she broke up with you?

410
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,364
I think you're great, Artie,
but you're a terrible boyfriend.

411
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,832
You ignored me for
weeks this summer.

412
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:03,867
I was playing a marathon
round of Halo, woman.

413
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,469
And then when we
did get together,

414
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:08,605
<i>all you wanted to do was watch
Coming Home over and over.</i>

415
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:11,275
<i>Mike tries to be
into what I'm into.</i>

416
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:13,176
Like his abs.

417
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,014
Dude, I'm sympathetic for you;

418
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:19,583
I just don't see you
on the football team.

419
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:21,485
Imagine you were pushing me
in this big hunk of metal

420
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:22,886
down the field at full speed.

421
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:24,521
The centrifugal force
would be too much to stop.

422
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,622
I'd be like a medieval

423
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,057
battering ram.

424
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:30,594
Dude, you'd be like
a human cannonball.

425
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:31,795
That would be awesome!

426
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,697
So you'll help?

427
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,301
Sure. But you got
to help me first.

428
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,369
Hey, Sam.

429
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:41,238
My name's Finn.

430
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:42,105
This here is Artie.

431
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:43,373
Yeah, I know who you are.

432
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,309
You're the... the quarterback.

433
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:47,311
Exactly... which
makes me very cool.

434
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:49,346
And we'd like to talk
to you about Glee Club.

435
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,482
So, Sam, tell us
about yourself.

436
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,151
My name's Sam Evans.

437
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,652
I like comic books,

438
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,054
sports.

439
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,456
I'm dyslexic, so my grades
aren't that good, but...

440
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:00,791
I'm working on it.

441
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,125
Dude, your mouth is huge.

442
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,161
How many tennis balls
can you fit in there?

443
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:06,963
I don't... know. I've never
had any balls in my mouth.

444
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:07,664
Have you?

445
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,536
I like this kid.

446
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,237
I like his confidence,

447
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,572
but the Bieber cut's gotta go.

448
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,773
Mm-hmm.

449
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:18,275
So, can you sing
with that big mouth?

450
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:19,743
I've never really sung

451
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,411
in front of anybody before.

452
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,648
Dude, let me tell you,
chicks dig singers.

453
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:26,216
Well, give it a shot.

454
00:18:26,284 --> 00:18:27,617
We'll back you up, I promise.

455
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:29,319
What song you got
in your back pocket?

456
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:31,588

470
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,634
¶¶ The world better prepare ¶¶

471
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:21,705
¶¶ For when I'm a billionaire ¶¶

472
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:24,307
¶¶ Yeah, I would have
a show like Oprah ¶¶

473
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,542
¶¶ I would be the host of ¶¶

474
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,877
¶¶ Every day Christmas ¶¶

475
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:28,412
¶¶ Give Artie a wish list ¶¶

476
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,881
¶¶ I'll probably pull
a Angelina and Brad Pitt ¶¶

477
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:33,750
¶¶ And adopt a bunch of babies
that ain't never had it ¶¶

478
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:36,219
¶¶ Give away a few Mercedes
like, "Here, lady, have this" ¶¶

479
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:39,623
¶¶ And last but not least,
grant somebody their last wish ¶¶

480
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,192
¶¶ It's been a couple months
that I been single, so ¶¶

481
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,761
¶¶ You can call me Artie Claus,
minus the ho-ho ¶¶

482
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,231
¶¶ Ha-ha! Get it? I'll probably
visit where Katrina hit ¶¶

483
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,934
¶¶ And darn sure do
a lot more than FEMA did ¶¶

484
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:53,236
¶¶ Yeah, can't forget
about me, stupid ¶¶

485
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:56,106
¶¶ Everywhere I go,
I'm-a have my own theme music ¶¶

486
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:59,443
¶¶ Oh, every time
I close my eyes ¶¶

487
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,611
¶¶ Uh, what you see,
what you see, bruh? ¶¶

488
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,582
¶¶ I see my name
in shining lights ¶¶

489
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,584
¶¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh,
and what else? ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶

490
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,820
¶¶ A different city every night ¶¶

491
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:14,090
¶¶ Oh, I, I swear ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶

492
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:15,992
¶¶ World better prepare ¶¶
¶¶ For what? ¶¶

493
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,528
¶¶ For when I'm a billionaire ¶¶

494
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,897
<i>¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

495
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:22,032
¶¶ Oh! ¶¶

496
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:24,768
¶¶ When I'm a billionaire ¶¶

497
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,636
<i>¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

498
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,206
¶¶ Sing it! ¶¶
¶¶ When I'm a billionaire ¶¶

499
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:32,008
<i>¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

500
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:33,043
¶¶ Oh! ¶¶

501
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,547
¶¶ I wanna be a billionaire ¶¶

502
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:41,485
¶¶ So freakin' bad. ¶¶.

503
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:45,789
That-that was really cool!

504
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:48,058
Nice. So you think
you can come back

505
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,359
and do that
in front of everybody?

506
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:50,560
Sure.

507
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:59,433
So, is that a men's sweater?

508
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,301
Fashion has no gender.

509
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,537
Ladies, we have a problem.

510
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,305
There's a new student
at this school

511
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:08,141
named Sunshine who is a Filipino
and is shorter than me.

512
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,143
Which I didn't think
was possible and
is very unnerving.

513
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,745
Okay, so I'm gonna go now.

514
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,613
Wait!

515
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,047
And...

516
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:16,450
She has a remarkable voice.

517
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:19,052
I'm just...

518
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,454
I'm very worried.

519
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,022
You know, not-not for myself,

520
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,158
but for my lesser Glee Clubbers
who don't get as many solos.

521
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:28,261
So I've paid a hundred dollars
to Azimio and Karofsky

522
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,130
to brutally slushie us
in front of Sunshine's locker,

523
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:32,199
terrifying her and ensuring
she doesn't sign up.

524
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,968
Okay, so this is the part
where you're supposed to be

525
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,103
hugging me and thanking me.

526
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,171
That's awful. You're awful.

527
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,539
But solos! I mean...

528
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,808
Look, Rachel, Mercedes and I
are about as self-involved

529
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:43,577
as they come, but
more than anything,

530
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,379
we want to beat
Vocal Adrenaline.

531
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,981
And if there's someone
at the school that
can help us do that,

532
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:48,682
they're in.

533
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,252
You know what?

534
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,789
You're right.

535
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:56,923
It's just...

536
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:58,892
So like me to just be

537
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,862
totally blinded by my concern
for the two of you.

538
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:04,831
I'll-I'll-I'll go talk
to Sunshine now

539
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,669
and just let her know
how truly welcome she really is.

540
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,303
Thanks.

541
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,246
Hi.

542
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:21,248
So, here's the address
for the audition tomorrow

543
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,516
and helpful directions.

544
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,917
Look forward
to seeing you there.

545
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:25,819
Thanks.

546
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:34,361
Beiste is on the move.

547
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:36,430
Operation Mean Girl is a go.

548
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,467
Move. Go! Disperse.

549
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:42,669
Leave the Danish.

550
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,609
Anyone sitting here?
Yes.

551
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:52,245
These seats are currently being
occupied by my ghost friends.

552
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:53,880
I beg your pardon?

553
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:55,849
My ghost friends.

554
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,284
Hideous, lonely faculty members

555
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:58,618
who met with an early death

556
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,787
from good old-fashioned
schoolyard bullying.

557
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:02,089
And you know why?

558
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,857
They tried to cross me.

559
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,292
So why don't you
just keep on walking?

560
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:12,499
Hi, Will.

561
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,234
You... you mind
if I sit here?

562
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:15,902
Uh... sorry.

563
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,571
Taken.

564
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,339
How about there?

565
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:23,343
Actually, they're all
sort of taken.

566
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:26,113
I am, uh, meeting with some...

567
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Some science teachers.

568
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:29,416
You think it's easy being

569
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,985
a female football coach,
being different?

570
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:34,488
You think I don't get this
everywhere I go?

571
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,022
Everybody told me

572
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,458
that Sue was the school bully
and, uh...

573
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:40,560
That you were really cool.

574
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,462
I see they got that last part
wrong, huh?

575
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:04,451
So you know why Helen
Keller couldn't drive, right?

576
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,886
Why?

577
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:08,188
'Cause she was a woman.

578
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,391
Coach Beiste?

579
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,995
Are you crying?

580
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,097
Yeah.

581
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:20,400
Saw your stats from last season,
and it really hurt my feelings.

582
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,841
Hey, Coach, uh, this is Artie.

583
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:29,075
He'd like to try out

584
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:30,510
for the team.

585
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:33,013
You screwing with me?

586
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,148
No, no. Absolutely not.

587
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:37,083
Uh, see we figured that

588
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:39,686
if I push him down the field
fast enough, the centrifugal...

589
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:40,821
Centrifugal.
Centrifugal force.

590
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:41,988
You're out.

591
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,124
Wait. What?!

592
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,226
You're off the team, cut, out!

593
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:49,596
You come in here,
pushing a kid in a wheelchair,

594
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,398
making me look like
some kind of monster

595
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:53,166
because I have
to tell him he can't play?

596
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:55,068
No. No, that's not

597
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:56,970
what was going
on here. Artie?
I really want to play.

598
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,405
I want my girlfriend back,

599
00:24:58,472 --> 00:24:59,840
and I want abs.

600
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:02,375
Yeah, he's like

601
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:03,944
a human battering ram,
like, like,

602
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:05,045
Braveheart.
You know what?

603
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,280
I don't like being screwed with!

604
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:09,449
Do you understand me?
Dude, you're
totally overreacting.

605
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,084
Dude?

606
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:13,753
Get the hell out
of my locker room!

607
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,989
Go!

608
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,826
Think this is some joke?

609
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:22,162
Go!

610
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,008
Next!

611
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,680
No way. Get out.

612
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,082
Coach Sylvester,
please hear me out.

613
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,051
Nope. I trusted you,
and you let me down.

614
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,820
I don't want you
anywhere near my squad.

615
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,388
You'll deafen them
with the sound

616
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:50,357
of your stretch marks
rubbing together.

617
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,392
I understand you had your
confetti cannons taken away.

618
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,593
Well, I'll bet

619
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:55,128
there are quite a few
church groups

620
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:56,329
who would gladly give money

621
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:57,764
to a squad
who helped rehabilitate

622
00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:59,199
a girl who got pregnant

623
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,967
and now speaks out
for abstinence education

624
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:02,035
while wearing
a Cheerios! uniform.

625
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:04,871
Next!

626
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,078
Oh, my gosh, Coach.

627
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:14,147
Wait. You're serious? Finn?

628
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:16,183
My eyes are still burning.

629
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,018
I'm Finn Hudson,

630
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:20,687
and I'd like
to audition for the Cheerios!

631
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:24,991
¶¶ I've got the power ¶¶

632
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,526
¶¶ Power ¶¶

633
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,533
¶¶ I've got the power ¶¶

634
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,435
¶¶ Power ¶¶.

635
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:37,470
Am I dreaming?

636
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:39,005
¶¶ I've got the power... ¶¶.

637
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:40,207
Is this happening?

638
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,042
But... why?

639
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,480
Coach Beiste kicked me off
the football team.

640
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:49,916
I'm not the quarterback anymore,

641
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,252
which... means I'm nothing.

642
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,755
I miss being popular.

643
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,757
This is really embarrassing.

644
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,826
I have really great
leadership skills,

645
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:02,696
and, uh, I'm athletic,

646
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:04,631
so I could help
with the lifts and stuff.

647
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,469
I hope you'll consider me.

648
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:12,138
<i>Why would he get kicked off
the football team?</i>

649
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:15,408
Finn was just trying to help out
his handicapable friend!

650
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:16,977
He was insubordinate twice.

651
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:19,179
<i>I'm the captain
of the USS Kick Ass,</i>

652
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:20,714
<i>not the USS Back Talk.</i>

653
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,583
Please, Coach,
don't do this to me.

654
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:25,118
I need football. It's who I am.

655
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,888
I thought you were the Glee guy.
I mean, what with all

656
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:30,457
the sign-up sheets you put
in my locker room.
Finn is a really good kid.

657
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,425
Give him a chance to show you.

658
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:34,895
You mean don't make a
snap judgment about him?

659
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:36,563
Don't make his life miserable

660
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,832
because I assume
he's a certain way?

661
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,834
Okay, I get it.

662
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:42,335
This is about me.

663
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:43,803
I haven't been very welcoming,

664
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,573
<i>but please, please,
don't take this out on Finn.</i>

665
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,041
Am I through here,
Principal Figgins?

666
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,409
Mm-hmm.

667
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,651
A little bird told me

668
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,085
that someone spent
her summer vacation

669
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:00,854
getting a brand-new set
of melons,

670
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:02,722
even though you know
I have a very strict

671
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,958
no plastics policy in Cheerios!

672
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:06,893
Care to comment?

673
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,962
I just...

674
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,831
What would possess a person
your age to get a boob job?

675
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,534
You don't even know what
your body's going to look like.

676
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:17,704
It's an insult to nature
and completely distracting.

677
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:19,706
I can't take my eyes off them.

678
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,241
I'm actually talking to them

679
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,475
right now.

680
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:23,977
I wanted people
to notice me more.

681
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:25,645
I don't get
what the big deal is.

682
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:27,447
Well, the big deal is
that a person

683
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:29,482
who has to pump her nonnies
full of gravy

684
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,284
to feel good about herself
clearly doesn't have

685
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:32,686
the self-esteem
to be my head cheerleader.

686
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:36,790
Quinn will replace you.

687
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:37,991
What did...?

688
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,293
Oh, and Boobs McGee?

689
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,329
You're demoted
to the bottom of the pyramid,

690
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:44,864
so when it collapses,
your exploding

691
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,133
sandbags will protect the squad
from injury.

692
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,004
Now take your juicy,

693
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,173
vine-ripened chest fruit

694
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,808
and get the hell
out of my office.

695
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,604
You did this to me.

696
00:29:24,672 --> 00:29:26,673
You told Coach Sylvester
about my summer surgery!

697
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,708
You have a surgery when
you get your appendix out.

698
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,844
You got a boob job.
Yup, sure did.

699
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:32,512
You can't hit me.

700
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,081
Oh, sure I can, unless you got
yourself knocked up again, slut.

701
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:38,451
Stop the violence.

702
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:43,356
Hey, hey, what is this?!

703
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:45,225
Stop it.
What happened
to us being a family? Hey.

704
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:46,359
Oh, please.
Stop that.

705
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:47,494
She has a family.
She's a mother.

706
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:48,862
Walk away.
Hey!

707
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,197
And tighten up your pony
before you get to class!

708
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:08,320
Well, hate to break it to you,

709
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,789
but it doesn't look like
anyone's gonna be joining us,

710
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:11,290
so I think we should
just call it a day.

711
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:12,958
We said 3:00 to 5:00.
It's only 4:58.

712
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:15,094
Just wait. My buddy
Sam's gonna try out.

713
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:16,128
He totally idolizes me.

714
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,363
Oh, face it, Finn.

715
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:18,564
You're no longer
the quarterback.

716
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:20,032
You're not
the Pied Piper anymore.

717
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,500
No one's gonna
follow you around

718
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:23,035
thinking everything
you do is cool.

719
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:24,537
What about that Sunshine girl?

720
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:26,439
I thought you said
she could sing.

721
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:28,874
I guess she didn't want
to hang out with us losers.

722
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,548
Show us on the doll

723
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:38,083
where Coach Beiste touched you.

724
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:41,687
Here and here.

725
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:44,757
This is outrageous.

726
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:45,925
I'll say.

727
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:47,426
Anyone who would prey on someone

728
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,361
as sweet and simple
as poor, poor Brittany

729
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:50,896
deserves everything
that's coming to her.

730
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:54,233
I suggest immediate termination
and entry into the statewide

731
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:55,167
sex offender database.

732
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:57,636
Sorry I'm late.

733
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,572
What's going on?

734
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,474
Brittany here
has accused Coach Beiste

735
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,109
of inappropriate touching.

736
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:06,645
What?! Brittany, that's
a serious accusation.

737
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:08,747
It's very serious.

738
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:17,656
Brittany, what you're saying
could ruin somebody's life.

739
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:19,725
It's really important that
you tell the truth here.

740
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:23,762
I made it up.

741
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,265
Coach Beiste
didn't touch my boobs.

742
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,201
Actually, I really want
to touch her boobs.

743
00:31:30,337 --> 00:31:31,737
If you're all done

744
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:34,306
wasting my time,
I have a football team to coach.

745
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:35,574
Coach...

746
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:42,915
You're weak, Will!

747
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,350
- You know what, Sue?
- Mr. Shue?

748
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:45,518
Can we talk to you?

749
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:47,453
It's kind of important.

750
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:56,529
Tell me this isn't true, Rachel.

751
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:58,097
She could have died.

752
00:31:58,164 --> 00:32:01,033
<i>I didn't send her to
an active crack house.</i>

753
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,801
Besides, how did you guys
find out anyways?

754
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:04,203
The Asian
community is
very tight.

755
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:05,371
I just don't get it.

756
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:06,605
You're better than this.

757
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:07,873
No, she's an ambitious
little freak

758
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:09,408
who will do anything
to hold on to her power.

759
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:12,411
I just... I...
I love you guys so much.

760
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:14,647
I was wrong before.

761
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:15,881
I don't want any

762
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,316
new members.

763
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:19,752
I didn't want anyone coming in

764
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:21,921
and-and messing up
our group dynamic.

765
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:23,489
Tina, Mike,

766
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,157
I mean,
what if Sunshine can dance?

767
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:27,726
Then your contributions to Glee
will be even more insignificant

768
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:29,562
than they already are now.

769
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:31,096
I did this for you guys.

770
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,768
Whatever your motivations,

771
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,770
you need
to make this right, Rachel.

772
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:47,680
I'm sorry for sending you
to that crack house.

773
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:50,983
They stole my sheet music
and used it for toilet paper.

774
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,985
Look, I'll buy you a new set.

775
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,087
You can just, um,
come pick it up

776
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,922
at the auditorium
at 4:00 tomorrow.

777
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:07,733
Hi, I'm Sunshine Corazon,
and I'll be singing "Listen"

778
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:09,435
<i>from the movie Dreamgirls.</i>

779
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:11,337
Broadway show first.

780
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:12,771
Shh...
Shut up.

781
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:19,044
¶¶ Listen ¶¶

782
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:22,548
¶¶ To the song here in my heart ¶¶

783
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:26,485
¶¶ A melody I start ¶¶

784
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:30,923
¶¶ But can't complete ¶¶

785
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:33,926
¶¶ Listen ¶¶

786
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:38,263
¶¶ To the sound
from deep within ¶¶

787
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,300
¶¶ It's only beginning ¶¶

788
00:33:41,368 --> 00:33:45,471
¶¶ To find release ¶¶

789
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:48,407
¶¶ Oh, the time has come ¶¶

790
00:33:48,475 --> 00:33:51,010
¶¶ For my dreams to be heard ¶¶

791
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:54,913
¶¶ They will not be pushed aside
and turned ¶¶

792
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:56,615
¶¶ Into your own ¶¶

793
00:33:56,683 --> 00:34:02,187
¶¶ All 'cause you won't listen ¶¶

794
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:04,423
¶¶ Listen ¶¶

795
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:08,293
¶¶ I am alone at the crossroads ¶¶

796
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:11,497
¶¶ I'm not at home
in my own home ¶¶

797
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:13,432
¶¶ And I've tried and tried ¶¶

798
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,701
¶¶ To say what's on my mind ¶¶

799
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:17,970
¶¶ You should have known ¶¶

800
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:23,509
¶¶ Oh, now I'm done
believin' you ¶¶

801
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:26,178
¶¶ You don't know
what I'm feelin' ¶¶

802
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:29,081
¶¶ I'm more than what
you made of me ¶¶

803
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:33,686
¶¶ I followed the voice
you gave to me ¶¶

804
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:37,523
¶¶ But now I gotta find my own ¶¶

805
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,060
¶¶ I don't know where I belong ¶¶

806
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:45,497
¶¶ But I'll be movin' on ¶¶

807
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:49,968
¶¶ If you don't ¶¶

808
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:53,405
¶¶ If you won't ¶¶

809
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:56,575
¶¶ Listen ¶¶

810
00:34:56,643 --> 00:35:00,446
¶¶ To the song here in my heart ¶¶

811
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:03,415
¶¶ A melody I start ¶¶

812
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:07,753
¶¶ But I will complete ¶¶

813
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:10,589
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

814
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:13,559
¶¶ Now I'm done believin' you ¶¶

815
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:16,562
¶¶ You don't know
what I'm feelin' ¶¶

816
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:20,199
¶¶ I'm more than what
you made of me ¶¶

817
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:24,269
¶¶ I followed the voice
you think you gave to me ¶¶

818
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:28,273
¶¶ But now I gotta find ¶¶

819
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:31,510
¶¶ My own... ¶¶

820
00:35:31,578 --> 00:35:38,383
¶¶ My own. ¶¶.

821
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,624
Bravo!
Wow.

822
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:47,793
Um...

823
00:35:47,861 --> 00:35:49,661
Welcome to the Glee Club.

824
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:52,765
Thank you.
Amazing.

825
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:54,466
Thank you.

826
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:01,684
Do you mind if I join you?

827
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:04,954
Okay.

828
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,660
Look, I really owe you
an apology.

829
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:14,597
I guess I kicked this year off
thinking that all of us

830
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:16,165
in the Glee Club weren't
outcasts anymore,

831
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:18,667
and I thought
we'd be turning kids away.

832
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:22,838
And then when no one
signed up for the club,

833
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:26,642
I realized that we were still
at the bottom... outsiders.

834
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:30,346
And that's how I made you feel.

835
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,784
I'm sorry.

836
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:37,553
Thank you.

837
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:41,323
William, Beiste,

838
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,993
I wanted to make a peace
offering with a batch of

839
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,395
warm, homemade cookies.

840
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:49,198
Oh, those smell like dog poop.

841
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:51,133
Are those dog poop cookies?

842
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:54,036
No, that's the flaxseed oil
you're smelling.

843
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:55,905
These are heart-healthy
cookies for some of our

844
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:57,273
burlier Americans.

845
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,476
Sue, we're not going
to do this anymore.

846
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:05,047
Are you turning on me in public?

847
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:09,251
The two of you are making a
very serious mistake today,

848
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:11,854
the likes of which have not been
seen since the Mexican Indians

849
00:37:11,922 --> 00:37:13,789
sold Manhattan
to George Washington

850
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,458
for an upskirt photo
of Betsy Ross.

851
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:26,502
Hey, man, uh,
why didn't you show

852
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,070
at the audition?

853
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:32,408
I wanted to, I did, but after
what Coach Beiste did to you...

854
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:36,245
Do you know how everybody talks
about you Glee guys?

855
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:38,214
Oh, yeah, you get used
to all that.

856
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,282
Finn, I'm, I'm the new guy.

857
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,852
That means I'm already on
the outside looking in.

858
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:45,020
I don't want to start off
three touchdowns behind.

859
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,690
I got to go.

860
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:49,425
Coach Beiste makes us
do a hundred push-ups

861
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:51,660
for every minute
we're late, so...

862
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:55,731
Yeah, you made the
team, that's cool.

863
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:56,699
Uh, what position?

864
00:37:56,766 --> 00:37:58,601
Quarterback.

865
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:06,008
Excuse me, Sunshine.

866
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,176
Hi, I'd like to officially

867
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,477
welcome you aboard

868
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:09,979
and give you our Glee Club
fall rehearsal schedule.

869
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:12,615
She won't be joining
your Glee Club.

870
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:14,550
Oh, are you her dad?

871
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:16,285
Her director.

872
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:17,386
Dustin Goolsby,

873
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:20,122
new coach of Vocal Adrenaline.

874
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,625
Oh, and they gave me and my
mom a condo and a green card.

875
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,262
- How did you even
find out about her?
- Hey, Will,

876
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:27,830
I went ahead and made
that phone call.

877
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:29,598
Should have gone along
with the poop cookies.

878
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:32,034
I actually would have
stayed here, but I think

879
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,036
Rachel would have made
my life a living hell.

880
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,439
I just didn't trust her after
she sent me to a crack house.

881
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:38,741
Not cool.

882
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:40,042
It was nice to meet you.

883
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:01,764
What did they say?

884
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:05,367
Well, I talked 'em out
of giving you a "code red."

885
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:08,037
They were pissed,
and they had the right to be.

886
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:09,872
What you did was bad, Rachel.

887
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,074
We could have used Sunshine
to beat Vocal Adrenaline,

888
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,009
and now they're just
that much stronger.

889
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:16,512
Just do it already.
What?

890
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,147
Break up with me.

891
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:19,982
Okay, we both knew it was
just a matter of time.

892
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,519
I think you're forgetting I'm
not the quarterback anymore.

893
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:26,388
I'm just another Glee loser now.

894
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:28,257
Fact is, you should be
breaking up with me.

895
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:34,730
I'll never break up with you.

896
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,867
Me, neither.

897
00:39:47,777 --> 00:39:50,245
I did it for the
team, you know.

898
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:53,215
I just, I-I love
everybody so much,

899
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:55,617
I didn't want anyone else
coming in and interfering.

900
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,919
You got to stop
saying that, Rachel.

901
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,322
I care about you
and everything,

902
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,057
but you got to admit the truth.

903
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,460
You didn't do this
because you love Glee Club.

904
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,729
You did it because you love
yourself more.

905
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:10,132
Okay.

906
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,234
I didn't want anyone else
hogging my spotlight.

907
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:15,671
Okay, I love it too much
to let it go that easy.

908
00:40:19,342 --> 00:40:20,976
Do you think that
they'll ever forgive me?

909
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,911
They'll come around.

910
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:26,815
I think apologizing
would be a good start.

911
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:32,588
Where are you going?

912
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:34,223
The auditorium.

913
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:38,594
I just need
some alone time first.

914
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,601
¶¶ Kiss today good-bye ¶¶

915
00:40:47,637 --> 00:40:52,841
¶¶ The sweetness and the sorrow ¶¶

916
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:56,178
¶¶ Wish me luck ¶¶

917
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,846
¶¶ The same to you ¶¶

918
00:41:04,788 --> 00:41:08,023
¶¶ But I can't regret ¶¶

919
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,460
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶

920
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:16,799
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶

921
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:20,969
¶¶ Look, my eyes ¶¶

922
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:24,540
¶¶ Are dry ¶¶

923
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,142
¶¶ The gift was ours ¶¶

924
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,747
¶¶ To borrow ¶¶

925
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:36,385
¶¶ Oh, it's as if we always ¶¶

926
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:40,856
¶¶ Knew ¶¶

927
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:44,359
¶¶ And I won't forget ¶¶

928
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:46,962
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶

929
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:54,336
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶

930
00:41:54,404 --> 00:41:58,540
¶¶ Gone ¶¶

931
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,375
¶¶ Love is ¶¶

932
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:05,013
¶¶ Never gone ¶¶

933
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:07,182
¶¶ As we travel ¶¶

934
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,653
¶¶ On ¶¶

935
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:17,726
¶¶ Love's what we'll remember ¶¶

936
00:42:17,794 --> 00:42:20,195
¶¶ Kiss today ¶¶

937
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:24,066
¶¶ Good-bye ¶¶

938
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:26,235
¶¶ And point me toward ¶¶

939
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:29,972
¶¶ Tomorrow ¶¶

940
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,974
¶¶ Oh, we did what ¶¶

941
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:38,981
¶¶ We had to do... ¶¶

942
00:42:39,048 --> 00:42:44,219
¶¶ Oh, won't forget,
can't regret ¶¶

943
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:47,956
¶¶ What I did for ¶¶

944
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,493
¶¶ Love ¶¶
