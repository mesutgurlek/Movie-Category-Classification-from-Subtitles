<i>Quinn and Puck want their baby back,
but then Puck kissed Shelby,</i>

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:04,630
<i>so now he doesn't know
what side he's on.</i>

4
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,722
Do you want
our baby back or not?

<i>Santana and Brittany have</i>

6

to join the Trouble Tones.</i>

8
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,081
Awesome! More backup for me.

9
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:13,835
<i>because they're both
running for Congress.</i>

10
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,880
I'm too late to get
on the ballot, but I can still

11
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,672
<i>run as a write-in candidate.
And Kurt and Rachel and Brittany</i>

12
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,000

at each other because</i>

13

14
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:20,997
I will see you at the debate.

<i>It's crazy.
No, you're crazy!</i>

17
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,337
Did you airbrush out your jowls?

18
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,479
I can't work with her!

19
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,678
I thought I smelled blue collar.

20
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,984
Stop!
Would you turn that thing off?

21
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,374

an assignment to work on this.

89
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,710
You just did it.

90
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,852
Mr. Schuester, while
the performance was excellent...

91
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:48,257
particularly the drumming...

92
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,379
don't you think
that the subject matter

93
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,501
is a little inappropriate?

94
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,637
Well, that depends on

95
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,599
what Puck's intent was
when he chose this song.

96
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,314
I guess I just,
uh, dig Van Halen.

97
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:02,553
All right!

98
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,949
Rock on!

<i>He might have had

Burt Hummel

116

Okay. Will, breathe deep,
breathe deep, breathe deep.

123

We have to play nice.

124

Because if you win by fighting
dirty, it's not really winning.

That's what we

What you're doing is appalling.

00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,841
Do you know
20% of all voters think

my dad actually has
a baboon heart.

132
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,502
It's not personal,
Porcelain, it's politics.

133
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,549
And politics are

134
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,008
all about playing dirty.

135
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,002
You should know.

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,358
Your squeaky-clean campaign

Yo, fellow Americans.

00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:17,134
Okay, listen.

140
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:18,680
A vote for Brittany

root beer water fountains
and robot teachers.

142
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:21,605
Did you say "robot teachers"?

143
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,599
Yep.
Radical!

144
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:23,608
I've always wanted one.

145
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,930
And also, listen.

146
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:28,316
Rachel Berry is still on MySpace
and thus unfit to lead.

147
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,623
That's ridiculous.

148
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,401
Brittany's making promises
shcan't deliver on.

149
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:34,034
It's lying! And no one is even
on MySpace, not even Rachel!

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,045
It doesn't matter.

151
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,382
Brittany's got their attention.

152
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,419
And you're playing all nice,
campaigning for

153
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,208
a salad bar in the cafeteria.

154
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,664
It's boring, it's tired, it's
not going to get you elected.

155
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:44,410
Well, obesity is a huge problem
at this school.

156
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,625
Especially in the Gleelub.

157
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,171
Have a seat, Yasser.

158
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,550
You know why I fight dirty?

159
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,002
Because I'm fighting

160
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:51,145
for something.

161
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,792
I have a cause,
several actually.

162
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,448
I hate the arts...

163
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,906
and a bunch of other stuff.

164
00:05:56,952 --> 00:06:00,622
If you want to win, find
yourself a cause, my friend.

165
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:02,426
Then start flinging poo.

166
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,077
Winning is really about
poo flinging.

167
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,571
I refuse to believe that.

168
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,393
I agree that perhaps
I need a better cause,

169
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,706
but I'm going to win this thing
without having to fling

170
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,103
a single stinky nugget.

171
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,828
Well, good luck with that, son
of Burt "Baboon Heart" Hummel.

172
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,876
It's not personal.

173
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,853
(school bell ringing)

174
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:21,475
Hey, Shelby, what's up?

175
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:22,615
We haven't talked since

176
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,713
Mercedes and Santana
and Brittany

177
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,176
left New Directions.

178
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,460
I hope you know, I kept my word.

179
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,637
I know.

180
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,633
You didn't recruit anyone.

181
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,938
It was, it was me.

182
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,098
They left because of me.

183
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,679
No, no, it's not your fault.

184
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,514
They're talented.
They just want a chance

185
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,146
to take center stage
during their senior year.

186
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,135
(sighs)

187
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,403
Did you get your letter today?

188
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:41,895
About Sectionals? Yeah.

189
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,400
Figures we'd be up against you.

190
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,288
Don't forget
the Dulcet Dazzlers.

191
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:46,267
(laughs)

192
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:47,356
So lame.

193
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,800
You know, we may get
along, but the kids won't.

194
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:55,414
I mean, it's going to
get ugly around here.

195
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,921
It's the last year for a lot
of them and they want to win.

196
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,684
Well, maybe competition will
bring out the best in them.

197
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:01,252
Or maybe it'll turn
into World War Glee.

198
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:04,725
We usually do mash-ups
around this time.

199
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,046
It's always my favorite.

200
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:08,059
Everyone's so happy.

201
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,602
So, you can still do it.

202
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,501
You know, maybe there's a way

203
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,634
to work with
all this fighting spirit.

204
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:17,886
Get the kids to channel it
into something great.

205
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,135
Talk to me.

206
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,063
(school bell ringing)

207
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,138
What are you doing here?

208
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,838
Shelby told us she had
something to show us.

209
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:25,878
What are you doing here?

210
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,557
Mr. Shue said the same thing.

211
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:30,605
Let me guess, he wants to
combine choirs for Sectionals.

212
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,515
Well, it's not gonna happen.

213
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:32,898
The Trouble Tones
are here to stay.

214
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,236
So why don't you shuffle

215
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,829
your busted choir
off our stage.

216
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,454
Look, you guys, we can compete
without being enemies.

217
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,911
All right?
We don't have to get vicious.

218
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,702
Oh, I think we do, Soft Serve.

219
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:44,448
See, the Trouble Tones are 3F:
fierce, femme, phenomenal.

220
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,778
Oh, and, guys, hurry up,
go get some moist towels.

221
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,083
We have to keep Finn wet before
we can roll him back in the sea.

222
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:51,697
Okay, you know what, Santana,
Finn is in great shape,

223
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,072
and your meanness
only highlights

224
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,417
your own personal insecurities.

225
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,075
And, Rachel,
your mustache is thicker

226
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,424
than a Middle Eastern
dictator's.

227
00:07:57,463 --> 00:08:01,523
(playing mid-tempo intro)

228
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:04,470
¶ It's been a long time since
I came around ¶

229
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:08,097
¶ It's been a long time
but I'm backn town ¶

230
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,316
¶ This time, I'm not leaving
without you ¶

231
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:15,137
Is this what having a stroke
feels like?

232
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,617
Because I like it.

233
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:19,936
¶ Just you and I

234
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:23,782
¶ Sharing our love together

235
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:26,454
¶ And I know in time

236
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:30,442
¶ We'll build the dreams
we treasure ¶

237
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,873
¶ We'll be all right,
just you and I ¶

238
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,336
¶ Something, something
about this place ¶

239
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:40,830
¶ Just you and, just you and I

240
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,973
¶ Something 'bout
lonely nights ¶

241
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,173
¶ And my lipstick on your face

242
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,087
¶ Just you and I

243
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,642
¶ Something, somethg about

244
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:53,566
¶ My cool Nebraska guy

245
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:54,511
¶ You and I

246
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,484
¶ Yeah, something about

247
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,491
¶ Baby, you and I

248
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:03,437
¶ Oh, you and I

249
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:07,077
¶ Remember our first embrace

250
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:11,244
¶ The smile
that was on your face ¶

251
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:14,448
¶ The promises that we made

252
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,752
¶ Ooh

253
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:21,177
¶ And now your love
is my reward ¶

254
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:24,874
¶ And I love you even more

255
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,265
¶ Than I ever did before

256
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:31,351
¶ Something, something
about this place ¶

257
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:34,937
¶ Just you and, just you and I

258
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,613
¶ Something 'bout
lonely nights ¶

259
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,941
¶ And my lipstick on your face

260
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:42,119
¶ Just you and I

261
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,656
¶ Something, something about

262
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,489
¶ My cool Nebraska guy
¶ I love you, you and I

263
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,866
¶ Put your drinks up

264
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,909
¶ For Nebraska ¶ For Nebraska

265
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,409
¶ For Nebraska, Nebraska

266
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:54,659
¶ I love you

267
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,992
¶ You and I

268
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:00,793
¶ You, you and I

269
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:01,913
¶ Nebraska

270
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,923
¶ I'd rather die

271
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:09,976
¶ Without you and I

272
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,709
¶ We made it

273
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:16,982
¶ You and I.

274
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,811
(cheering, applause)

275
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,902
Mr. Shue, Shelby, I
think we can all admit

276
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,193
that that was weirdly amazing.

277
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:25,867
Buwhat exactly was the point?

278
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:29,442
That sometimes bringing
together two conflicting things

279
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,119
can create something
totally unexpected.

280
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,791
We're not combining
Glee Clubs, Mr. Shue.

281
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,206
That's not what
I'm talking about.

282
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,865
Shelby and I agree
that with Sectionals

283
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,790
coming up for both of us,
it's time we all got serious

284
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,582
with some friendly competition.

285
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,700
SHELBY:
Each group's going to

286
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,187
put together their own mash-up

287
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,174
to perform head-to-head.

288
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,222
WILL:
For the first annual

289
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:47,123
McKinley High Mash-Off.
Mash-Off.

290
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:48,679
Yeah!
Come on, now.

291
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,462
(cheering)

292
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:52,433
Get you some!
Let's do this!

293
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:53,889
That's pretty good, right?

294
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:55,949
(school bell ringing)

295
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,271
¶

296
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,698
They were out of apples in
the cafeteria.

297
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:10,006
Thank you.

298
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,865
I want you.

299
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,917
(scoffs) I'm your teacher.

300
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,917
You're my sub.

301
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,419
You can't deny the chemistry.

302
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,338
I'm not some kid. I'm 18.

303
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,509
I've already been
with a lot of older women.

304
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:24,045
(sighs) Look, Noah, you
are very charming

305
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,299
and surprisingly set.

306
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,370
The kiss was a mistake.

307
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:29,344
Well, that mistake meant
something to me.

308
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,795
I felt something
I've never felt before.

309
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,378
I'm in love with you.

310
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,296
Oh, God.

311
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:35,712
Wait. I made a list

312
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:37,211
of the reasons
we should be together.

313
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,858
Number one: you're hot.

314
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,285
Number two: I'm hot.

315
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,804
Number three: Beth needs a dad.

316
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:47,124
And why shouldn't it
be her actual dad?

317
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,123
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't feel something, too.

318
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,576
You want a mash-up?

319
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,470
We're the ultimate mash-up;

320
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,759
two things that maybe shouldn't
work together but do.

321
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,446
I would lose my job.

322
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,006
Only if I told,
and I never would.

323
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,090
You have a crush.

324
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:02,494
It's sweet and it's normal

325
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,003
and you're gonna get over it.

326
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,727
I dream about us
being together.

327
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,661
A real family.
Taking stupid pictures

328
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,008
for our Hanukkah cards,

329
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,109
renting an RV and all of us
hitting Coachella.

330
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,200
(laughs) What's up with
that crib you ordered?

331
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,604
Is it still in pieces all over
your living room floor? Yes.

332
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:19,100
See? You need me. I can help you
with stuff like that.

333
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,499
Let me take care of it
this week.

334
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:23,239
No, that's not gonna happen.
Why?

335
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,980
Because you're afraid you won't
be able to resist me?

336
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,447
I know that's why
you haven't had me

337
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,015
back to babysit
since we made out.

338
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,988
(mutters)

339
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,753
You know this is gonna happen.

340
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,749
(school bell rings)

341
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,773
Okay, guys, we have our work cut out
for us this week with this mash-off.

342
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,848
And The Trouble Tones have a
lot of powerful voices,

343
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:44,359
so song selection is key
here. Any suggestions?

344
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,862
What about The Clash?
Uh, The Police?

345
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:46,944
REM!
No.

346
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:47,807
Spice Girls.
Jonas Brothers.

347
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,136
Guys, no, no, we can't use

348
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,164
any of those bands.

349
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:51,209
The only thing
they have in common

350
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,972
is that they all broke up,

351
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,677
and right now the New Directions
need to feel united.

352
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:57,050
I like what you're saying, Finn.

353
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,600
It's not just about the music,
but where it comes from.

354
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,101
Who do you think we should use?

355
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,629
How about this?
People think Hall and Oates are

356
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,295
famous for their
cool, puffy hair

357
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,257
and that dude's banging 'stache.
Awesome.

358
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,418
But also they're awesome

359
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:09,200
for staying together
over the long haul.

360
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:12,453
Just like us, despite
all their differences.

361
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:15,361
I think we should give
the solo to the new guy.

362
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,939
Get him prepared
for what's in store

363
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,109
when the stakes get high.

364
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,348
Rory, I think
you'll do a good job.

365
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:24,768
Thanks, Finn, but I don't think I'm
ready for that honor just yet.

366
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,031
Come on.
You're totally ready, Rory.

367
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:30,703
You'll kill it.
We'll all help you.

368
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,404
It's a great idea, Finn.

369
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,486
Thanks.

370
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:35,681
I'm losing patience.

371
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,496
Why hasn't Child Protective
Services done anything

372
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,697
to Shelby yet?
I don't know.

373
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,540
Wait. Did you do something
to screw this up already?

374
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,529
You have to be
extra nice to Shelby

375
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,747
so that we can babysit more

376
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,162
because we've hardly
been over there,

377
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,861
and we need to spend
as much time bonding

378
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,225
with our baby as we can
so that when I get her,

379
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,704
she doesn't freak out
when I hold her.

380
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:51,930
I'm being really nice
to her, believe me.

381
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,999
Look, this isn't a game, okay?

382
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,770
I know Shelby's
threatened by me.

383
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:58,123
But I am willing to do whatever
it takes to get closer to her

384
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,954
because closer to
her is closer to Beth.

385
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,275
I would like
to join the Trouble Tones.

386
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:12,777
I have to think about that.

387
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,947
<i>RORY:
Thanks a million, Finn.</i>

388
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,024
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

389
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,079
I have your back.

390
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:19,896
Like when that girl
with the lips was saying

391
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:22,679
you look like a whale, I wanted to
tell her that I think you look fine.

392
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:23,879
I'm just sick of her

393
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:25,458
talking smack
about me, you know?

394
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,759
Have you ever heard
of the term "trash talk"?

395
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:29,588
Is that when you discuss trash?

396
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,078
No. In sports, it's when
one player insults another

397
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,849
to try and get them off
their game.

398
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,210
And Santana's trying
to demean us

399
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,930
to get inside of our heads
so that we remain losers.

400
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,132
Well, it's time to start
getting inside of hers.

401
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:41,889
Hey there, Orca.

402
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,540
Hey, Santana, you look
like an ass-less J.Lo.

403
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:47,921
You're skinny
like all the crops

404
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,149
failed on your family's farm.

405
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,424
That is the lamest
thing I didn't

406
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,233
understand a word of.
Not one word.

407
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,287
Is that really all that
you can come up with?

408
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,152
You seriously think that
you can out-insult me?

409
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,283
I'm from Lima Heights.
I was raised on insults.

410
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:01,243
<i>It's how mi abuela put
me to sleep at night,</i>

411
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,406
and she is not a nice lady.

412
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,263
You know, she tried
to sell me once?

413
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:05,795
And it wasn't till I got
to kindergarten

414
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,335
that I learned my name
wasn't "Garbage Face."

415
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:09,319
Then we'll have
to settle this another way.

416
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:11,737
Uh, today, after school.

417
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,175
Bring your Trouble Tones.

418
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:15,648
Are you suggesting
what I think you are?

419
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:16,603
Yeah, I am.

420
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:17,989
Dodgeball.

421
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:18,839
(bell rings)

422
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:21,159
(piano plays soft notes)

423
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,659
Hey, Rachel.

424
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:27,850
Hi.

425
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,794
As you might have heard,

426
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:31,659
I'm applying to the New York
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

427
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,658
Ugh! All the girls who
beat me out in the auditions

428
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:35,488
when I was in New York,
they all graduated from there.

429
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:36,650
Well, my grades are perfect,

430
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,276
and I was the
lead in the school musical

431
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,196
and I plan on winning
the election

432
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,600
for student class president,

433
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:44,740
so I just need a letter, a
killer letter of recommendation.

434
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,296
Wait. You're asking me
to write it?

435
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,878
Actually, I've, I've
already written it,

436
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,855
so all you would have to do is
just sign, and my resumé's

437
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,378
in there as well
with the letter, so...

438
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,555
I thought that, you know,
your pedigree

439
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,240
as a National Champion
show-choir coach

440
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:01,054
would just make some noise with
the admissions committee.

441
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,182
Makes sense.

442
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,097
Okay.

443
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:08,110
Okay. Bye.

444
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,397
I'm so proud of you.

445
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,409
You are truly a star, Rachel.

446
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:21,225
And it's all stillut
there in front of you.

447
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:22,870
I'm not going to be
the first person

448
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,155
to be a little jealous
of all the amazing things

449
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,753
you have lying ahead.

450
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:31,093
I'm just going to be the only
one who's also cheering you on.

451
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,843
Maybe you could come
to my Broadway debut.

452
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:40,072
Ooh, don't try to stop me.
(both laugh)

453
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,250
Maybe you could write your own
version of the letter.

454
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,535
It's such an impressive resumé.

455
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:02,294
You have the musical and all
the clubs and... maybe even

456
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,715
Student Council president.

457
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:07,267
I feel bad for all the kids
that don't have these

458
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,590
big-ticket items in their CVs.

459
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,943
They don't have a chance in
hell of getting into NYADA.

460
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,210
This could be deadly.
I mean, facing our foes head-on

461
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:20,007
without any adult supervision?

462
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:26,000
So, uh, you know that our NYADA
applications are due next week.

463
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,968
I only need one more letter
of recommendation.

464
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:30,160
I wrote to Patti
LuPone on her Web site,

465
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,173
but I haven't heard
from her yet, so...

466
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,952
I-I really, I... I really miss
you, Kurt.

467
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,099
And I just...

468
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,036
I just... I really want
to be your friend again.

469
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,662
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

470
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,980
before you walked all over me

471
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,487
in your borderline-sociopathic
climb to the top.

472
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,375
(whistle blows)

473
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,505
Let's roadhouse!

474
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,465
Oh, it's on,
Pillsbury Dough Turd.

475
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,861
RORY:
Excuse me.

476
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,428
I've never heard of this game
of dodging balls before.

477
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:02,891
What's the rules?
Don't die.

478
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,359
Let's do this.

479
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:10,556
(Pat Benatar's "Hit Me
with Your Best Shot" plays)

480
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:16,120
¶ Hit me with your best shot

481
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,514
¶ Why don't you hit me
with your best shot? ¶

482
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,688

¶ Hit me with your best shot

484
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,689
¶ Fire away

485
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,156
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,

486
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,545
¶ One way or another,
I'm gonna find ya ¶

¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,

488
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:38,705
¶ One way or another
I'm gonna win ya ¶

489
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,646
¶ I'll getcha, I'll getcha

490
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,473
¶ You're a real tough cookie
with a long history ¶

491
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:46,711
¶ Of breaking little hearts
like the one in me ¶

492
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:50,992
¶ That's okay, let's see
how you do it ¶

493
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,984
¶ Put up your dukes,
let's get down to it ¶

494
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,359
¶ Hit me with your best shot

00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,707
(girls cheer)

510
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,330
Okay. Good game.

511
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:51,785
Boy, oh, boy,
that was a cracker!

512
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,416
What?

513
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,505
Whoa!

514
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:55,638
(girls yell)

515
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,421
Stop it! Stop it!

516
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:01,951
For God's sakes, he's bleeding!

517
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:03,848
Maybe that's how the others
treat us around here,

518
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,759
but we don't do this
to each other!

519
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,014
We're better than this!

520
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,891
God, calm down, Grandma.

521
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:09,685
The game's over!

522
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:13,158
GIRL:
We still won.

523
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:17,570
(school bell rings)

524
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,102
(all spluttering)

525
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,783
Ladies,
vocal warm-ups can wait.

526
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,807
Now, I was up half the night
thinking

527
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,165
about our mash-up
for the mash-off,

528
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,159
and it came to me... Adele.

529
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,580
I sound just like her.

530
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:30,112
Dude, I love her.
She sounds like

531
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,918
what banana cream pie sounds
like when it sings.

532
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,306
I think it's a great idea,
Mercedes.

533
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,872
I think that we could really
kill with that stuff.

534
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,984
Agreed. And now with that
decision out of the way,

535
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,821
I can stay focused on
my one-sided battle

536
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,124
of wits with
the knuckle-dragger.

537
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,023
Santana, the dodgeball thing was
fun, until the end, but enough.

538
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:44,856
No, honey, I'm
just getting started.

539
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:47,058
I'm the leader of this group
and I'm telling you

540
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,193
lay off those guys.

541
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:49,773
I'm sorry.
The leader?

542
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,722
Who died and
made you queen, Aretha?

543
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:53,942
I brought you guys in

544
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:56,283
and I came up with the
idea for our mash-up

545
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,139
while you were wasting time
trying to figure out how

546
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,408
to make Finn Hudson cry.

547
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,527
So I nominate myself as
President of the Trouble Tones.

548
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,490
All in favor?

549
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,464
I'm not impressed
by your campaign.

550
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:07,664
You didn't put any posters up.

551
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,994
Four in favor means
Mercedes gets elected.

552
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,875
And she's right.
We should all be focusg

553
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,322
on winning because
we're better, not meaner.

554
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,170
Mr. Shue and I both agreed on
the ground rules.

555
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,717
We play fair.

556
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:19,296
I just don't have time
for this kind of thinking.

557
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:20,750
Well, make time.

558
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,916
Because you are a star member
of this group

559
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,926
and you need to represent.

560
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,550
¶ Stop the violence.

561
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,672
(both snicker)

562
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,707
Come on.
Okay. God, okay.

563
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,152
Look, I'll play fair.

564
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,389
From now on, I will be so nice

565
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:39,034
that cotton candy won't
melt in my mouth.

566
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:40,739
That's really nice.
That's really nice.

567
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:42,017
(bell ringing)

568
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,659
Hey, Tubs, can I talk
to you for a second?

569
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:45,699
Hey, listen here.

570
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,202
You can't make fun
of Finn anymore.

571
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,543
Shut your potato hole.
I'm here to apologize.

572
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,919
Rachel's right.
I haven't been fair to you.

573
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:53,883
You're not fat.

574
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,382
I should know, I slept with you.
I mean, at some point,

575
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,345
I must have liked that
you look like a taco addict

576
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:02,018
who's had one-too-many
back-alley liposuctions. Whoa.

577
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,134
Please stick a sock in it

578
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,526
or ship yourself
back to Scotland.

579
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,019
I'm trying to apologize
to Lumps the Clown.

580
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,062
I am sorry, Finn.

581
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:09,552
I mean, really, I'm-I'm sorry

582
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,553
that the New Directions
are going to get cshed

583
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:13,241
by the Trouble Tones.

584
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,255
I'm so sorry
that you have no talent.

585
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,782
I'm sorry that you sing
like you're getting

586
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,562
your prostate checked
and you dance like you've been

587
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:23,127
asleep for years
and someone just woke you up.

588
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,461
Have fun riding on
Rachel's coattails

589
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:25,878
for the rest of your life.

590
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:28,114
Although, you know what,
I would just watch out for her

591
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,446
come holiday time,
if I were him,

592
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:30,915
because if I were her, I'd stick

593
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,479
a stent in one of those boobs
and let the Finn blubber

594
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,667
light the Hanukkah lamp
for eight magical nights.

595
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,458
Hey, Santana.

596
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:42,830
Why don't u just
come out of the closet?

597
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,919
You know, I think I know why

598
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:47,665
you're so good at
tearing everybody else down.

599
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,003
It's because you're constantly

600
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,143
tearing yourself down,
because you can't admit

601
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,921
to everybody that
you're in love with Brittany

602
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,643
and she might not love you back.

603
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,571
That must hurt,
to not be able to

604
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:59,979
admit to everyone
how you really feel.

605
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:02,246
You know what I think you are?

606
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:06,031
A coward.

607
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:08,029
See you at the mash-off.

608
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:11,030
(school bell ringing)

609
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:14,237
<i>Burt Hummel claims he doesn't
have a baboon heart.</i>

610
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,141
<i>He also claims he isn't married
to a donkey.</i>

611
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,521
Well, which is it, Burt Hummel?

612
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,891
<i>Baboon heart or donkey bride?</i>

613
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:22,041
Donkeys have no place
in politics.

614
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:25,210
They bite off children's fingers
and pee absolutely anywhere.

615
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,062
Do we really need
another Washington politician

616
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,620
married to a pack animal?

617
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:31,250
Don't let Burt Hummel
make an ass out of you, Ohio.

618
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,715
I'm Sue Sylvester,
and it's not personal.

619
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,831
Will, you are my
campaign manager.

620
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:38,043
You have got to do
something about this!

621
00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:39,417
She's killing us!

622
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,629
You are on the right side of
the issues voters care about.

623
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:43,640
You know what it's like
to run a small business.

624
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:45,381
When the recession hit,
you took a pay cut

625
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,164
so you didn't have to fire
a single employee.

626
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,804
Will, if you don't start
fighting fire with fire,

627
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,168
we are both going to lose.

628
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,172
I'm going to lose the race,

629
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,109
you're going to lose your job.

630
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:55,770
Put your thinking cap on.

631
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,708
PUCK:
Oh, who's got your nose?

632
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,444
Where'd it go?

633
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:01,490
Huh?

634
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:02,719
There it is!

635
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,915
It's magic!

636
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:06,811
Yeah.

637
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,811
Sorry, I should probably
be helping more.

638
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,215
I didn't know the directions
were gonna be the foreign kind

639
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,591
with weird pictures
instead of English.

640
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:16,118
It's okay.

641
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:20,049
She likes you.
You're good with her.

642
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,501
That's 'cause she's the best
little girl in the whole world.

643
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:24,692
Whoa!

644
00:24:24,726 --> 00:24:26,991
Oh, where'd it go?

645
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,856
(whistles)

646
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,306
Isn't that right, Monkeyface?

647
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,797
(chuckles)

648
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:33,947
Can I have her for a sec?

649
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:34,936
Sure.

650
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,332
Go see Mama.

651
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,672
Hi. Hi.
That's a good girl.

652
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:41,116
Want to play here
and give Mommy a little break?

653
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:43,247
I got to come clean
about something.

654
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:46,522
When Quinn and I
babysat for you,

655
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,353
she put a bunch of stuff
around here

656
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,255
to make you look like
an unfit mother.

657
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:53,811
And then she called
Child Protective Services.

658
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,602
But I came
and got rid of it all.

659
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,848
Why would she do that to me?

660
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,130
Because she wants
to get Beth back again.

661
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,260
I did, too.

662
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:01,334
I thought we'd be,

663
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:02,824
you know, good parents.

664
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:05,575
It was wrong and stupid
and totally selfish.

665
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,583
I'm really, really sorry.

666
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,669
I...

667
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,845
(Beth cooing)

668
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,910
I always thought of Beth
as an accident.

669
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:20,409
But she's no accident.

670
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,908
Quinn and I gave her life...

671
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:31,661
but somehow God or nature
or whatever

672
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,872
meant for you and her
to be together.

673
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:37,589
You were always
meant to be her mother.

674
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,303
And I'd like to be
part of her life, too.

675
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,164
Hi.

676
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:55,409
Welcome, everyone, to day one
of the first annual

677
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,518
McKinley High Mash-Off!

678
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,819
(cheering, excited chatter)

679
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,974
Okay, a couple of ground rules.

680
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:03,603
Everyone, therwill be

681
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,272
no heckling of any kind, okay?

682
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,478
Ms. Corcoran, the Trouble Tones
are all fired up.

683
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,541
Fine, fine.

684
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,402
Don't worry, I can do it.

685
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,452
I'm gonna hit
that F below middle C,

686
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:14,558
just like Adele.

687
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:16,094
WILL:
All right, here we go.

688
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,600
Finn will represent
the New Directions;

689
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,482
Santana, the Trouble Tones
for the rock-paper-scissor

690
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,322
face-off to see who will
perform first, all right?

691
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:25,537
Let's get it going!

692
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,219
Let's do this.

693
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,051
SANTANA and FINN:
One, two, three!

694
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,917
Yeah! Yeah!

695
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:31,967
Okay, paper covers rock.

696
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,386
New Directions, take the stage!

697
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,956
A kiss for the winner.

698
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:38,844
(Hall & Oates' "You Make
My Dreams Come True" playing)

699
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:41,089
¶ What I want, you've got

700
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,073
¶ It might be hard to handle

701
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,511
¶ Like the flame
that burns the candle ¶

702
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,896
¶ The candle feeds the flame

703
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:50,136
<i>¶ Eh, eh ¶</i>

704
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:51,849
¶ What I've got's full stock

705
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,105
¶ Of thoughts and dreams
that scatter ¶

706
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,772
¶ You pull them all together

707
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:59,283
¶ And how I can't explain

708
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,162
¶ Oh, yeah, well, well, you

709
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,575
¶ I can't go for that

710
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,362
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>

711
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,832
¶ You make my dreams come true

712
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:10,034
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

713
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,503
¶ Well, well, well, you

714
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,623
¶ I can't go for that

715
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,592
¶ Oh, yeah, you make my dreams
come true ¶

716
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:20,601
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

717
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:25,048
¶ On a night when bad dreams
become a screamer ¶

718
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,765
¶ When they're messing
with the dreamer ¶

719
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:31,474
¶ I can laugh it in the face

720
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:33,388
¶ Twist and shout my way out

721
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,606
¶ And wrap yourself around me

722
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:38,646
¶ 'Cause I ain't the way
you found me ¶

723
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,395
¶ And I'll never be the same

724
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,849
¶ Oh, yeah, well, 'cause you

725
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,874
<i>¶ I can't go for that
¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>

¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

728
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:55,413
¶ Oh...

729
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,888
¶ I'm down on my daydream

730
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:00,919
¶ But that sleepwalk
should be over by now ¶

731
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,217
¶ I know

732
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:03,968
¶ Yeah, you

733
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:05,719
¶ Ah

734
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,183
¶ I'll do anything
that you want me to ¶

735
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:10,759
¶ Yeah, I

736
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,176
¶ Do almost anything

737
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,348
¶ You make my dreams come true

738
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:16,013
¶ I can't go for that

739
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:18,738
¶ Oh, you make my dreams
come true ¶

740
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,243
¶ I can't go for that

741
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,779
¶ You make my dreams
come true. ¶

742
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:26,946
(applause)

743
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:38,900
Burt.

744
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:40,223
Hey, I was worried you
weren't going to make it.

745
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,032
Are you kidding?

746
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:43,152
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

747
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,368
Polls have you in first place.

748
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,072
Almost everyone
loves the new ad.

749
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,643
Almost everyone?

750
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:49,871
Well, that ad was bulletproof.

751
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,925
I accused Burt Hummel
of using his tire shop

752
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:53,874
to sexually assault automobiles.

753
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,296
What's not to like about that?

754
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,749
Hey, Ms. C.

755
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:59,390
Quiet, please, children.

756
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:01,224
Welcome one and all

757
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,566
to McKinley High's senior class
presidential debate.

758
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,123
Such a magnificent
turnout reflects

759
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:09,451
this school's passion
for democracy.

760
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:12,735
And also, a reminder:
it is against school policy

761
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:16,268
to pass gas into jars
to be sold in the cafeteria.

762
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:21,691
And now, our first candidate,
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

763
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:23,856
(cheering, boys chanting)

764
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,940
Stick! Stick! Stick! Stick!

765
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,514
So, I was talking to my dad,

766
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,842
who says that since he pays
taxes and stuff,

767
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:34,286
like, for teachers, which pretty
much means that we're your boss.

768
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,117
So I think it's time

769
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,222
that the teachers started
doing what we say.

770
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:40,602
And how about you stop talking
in class, Mrs. Janicek?

771
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:42,458
Everything you have to say
is boring!

772
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:43,630
(cheering, chanting)

773
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,287
Vote Rick the Stick!

774
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:49,264
Tornadoes are nature's
most destructive force.

775
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,225
These violent storms
have ravaged America,

776
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:53,489
crippling communities
all across our land.

777
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,793
Isn't it time we take a stand?

778
00:29:55,874 --> 00:29:57,948
If you honor me with being
your next class president,

779
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:00,119
I will make tornadoes
illegal at McKinley,

780
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:01,949
keeping you and your families
at our school

781
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:04,006
safe from
their murderous rampages.

782
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:08,163
Also, on Tuesdays, uh,
I pledge to go topless.

783
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:10,129
(cheering)

784
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:14,382
Whoo!

785
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,168
(scattered applause)

786
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:25,860
Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel.

787
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,264
Um, the past few weeks,

788
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,266
I've tried to address
the real problem

789
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,040
of obesity at this school.

790
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:39,310
But my opponents chose empty
promises and smear tactics.

791
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:42,439
Although she knows it to be
untrue, my opponent Brittany

792
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,618
stated that my face
was used as a template

793
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:48,625
for Hasbro's successful line
of My Little Ponies.

794
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,692
Well, I refuse to be bullied.

795
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:56,155
In fact, I refuse
to let anyone be bullied.

796
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,552
Today, I want to take it
one step further.

797
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:03,546
I would like to hereby pledge
to ban dodgeball

798
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,453
at McKinley High.

799
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:14,554
Since its invention in 1831
by Silas W. Mangold,

800
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,202
dodgeball has been used as

801
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:18,566
a schoolyard instrument
of suppression.

802
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,040
It's violent, it's painful,
it's humiliating,

803
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:23,182
and I believe
that it's an equivalent

804
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:24,415
to modern-day stoning.

805
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,853
Let's end dodgeball
at Minley High

806
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:32,962
and send a strong message
that violence isn't okay.

807
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,479
Hello, I'm Rachel Berry,

808
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:41,187
and I have campaigned
for president on a crusade

809
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:43,185
for school book covers,

810
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,426
a plan to save the school
thousands of dollars.

811
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,759
(boys catcalling)

812
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:47,893
Knock it off!

813
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,394
While I still consider this plan

814
00:31:51,428 --> 00:31:53,841
an inspired stroke
of political genius,

815
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,765
I hereby withdraw my candidacy

816
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,595
and urge you all to vote
for Kurt Hummel.

817
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,584
He's the only candidate

818
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,082
here today who never
went negative.

819
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:09,284
He-He's the one who deserves
to be president.

820
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:14,369
That's why I-I'm casting my vote
for Kurt Hummel.

821
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,669
Vote Hummel, McKinley.

822
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,504
Vote for Kurt.

823
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:30,747
(school bell ringing)

824
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:36,116
Why'd you do it?

825
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:38,817
I should have
withdrawn from the race

826
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:40,578
when I got the lead
in the musical.

827
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,168
You needed the resumé boost

828
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,126
to get into NYADA.

829
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,344
You're already so spectacular.

830
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:51,534
But being senior class president
will just put you over the top.

831
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:55,151
Only Rachel Berrcould perk up
an old boring high school debate

832
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,579
with such a riveting twist.

833
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:58,659
Drama queen. I know.

834
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:02,569
But I just... I-I hated
you hating me.

835
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,464
Me, too. Scowling gives
you forehead lines,

836
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:08,553
and I'm way too
young for Botox.

837
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,642
I guess I was just, you know,
focusing on my dream

838
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:13,930
of going to New York and
getting into NYADA, but...

839
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:17,600
then realized that part of that
dream is going there with you.

840
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:20,241
So, now I am all
about helping you win.

841
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:22,489
Consider me your
campaign slave.

842
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:27,240
I'm gonna hug you now, okay?
Okay.

843
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:28,356
Okay!

844
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,334
(sighs) Thank you!

845
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:37,861
So, about the
whole pastie thing...

846
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,164
Let's just quit while
we're ahead, doll.

847
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,000
Hey. I was... I was in
the neighborhood,

848
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,650
so I thought I'd drop this off
for Beth.

849
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,235
- I just got her down so...
- I left a bunch

850
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,863
of voicemails trying to find a
good time to come by.

851
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,804
And you never gave me
a straight answer

852
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,207
about when I can join
the Trouble Tones.

853
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,231
I don't think it's
a very good idea.

854
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:01,034
Well, Mr. Schuester
won't miss me.

855
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:04,592
I reached out to you.

856
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,353
I came back here so that you

857
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:07,857
and my daughter could
have a relationship.

858
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:11,051
Oh, please, I know all about
the hot sauce and the book

859
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,635
and everything else
you planted here.

860
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,812
You think they were just gonna
come here and find those things

861
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:17,249
- and hand my baby over to you?
- She's my baby.

862
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:19,384
You have no idea what it means
to be a mother.

863
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:21,594
It's not about whose
body she comes out of;

864
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:24,762
it's about accepting the fact
that you don'tatter anymore...

865
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,680
that your feelings, and that
your life and that your body

866
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:32,147
they all come second to making sure
that that child is happy and safe.

867
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:33,691
Is that why you gave yours up
for money?

868
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:35,790
At least I did what I
thought was best for my baby.

869
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:38,270
You were just a cash whore!

870
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,577
I don't feel comfortable with
you being around Beth anymore.

871
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,766
Is Puck going to
get to see her?

872
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,556
Was he the one who told you?
We're done here.

873
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:56,761
I hope you this as a
wake-up call.

874
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,795
Just because you take out
your nose ring

875
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:02,638
and dye your hair blonde again
doesn't make you any less lost.

876
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:06,602
I think you need to stop making
fun of Finn.

877
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,800
You're being really harsh.

878
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,884
Manatees have
really thick skin.

879
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:13,363
Santana, Coach Sue needs you in
her office right away.

880
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,087
(school bell rings)

881
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:17,310
What's going on?

882
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,864
Have a seat, Santana.

883
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:27,716
I'm afraid we have
some bad news,

884
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:30,625
and I think I
might be to blame.

885
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:32,741
Oh, you think?
Watch your blood pressure, Bubbles.

886
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:35,576
In my campaign to become
Ohio's newest congresswoman,

887
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,649
I've said some things
that are not true,

888
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,021
and I don't feel good about it.

889
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:44,308
I set the tone for this
campaign,

890
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:47,064
and now I'm afraid
my slanderous chickens

891
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:49,294
have come home to roost.

892
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:50,806
Santana, you should know
that I have the phone number

893
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,632
of a counselor who
specializes in this.

894
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:55,122
It's something that, uh, I've
been through first-hand,

895
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:57,240
and I'd be willing to talk your
family through it.

896
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:58,987
What are you... What
are you talking about?

897
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:01,538
Reggie "the Sauce"
Salazar sent me

898
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,245
an advance copy of his latest
campaign ad.

899
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,944
It turns out he has a niece
who goes to this school,

900
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:08,953
and she overheard a conversati

901
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:11,710
a couple of days ago
between you and Finn Hudson.

902
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,570
<i>OMINOUS VOICE: Sue Sylvester
wants to represent Ohio.</i>

903
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:19,145
<i>She says she shares your
values.</i>

904
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,255
<i>If that's true, boy do we have
some questions...</i>

905
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,385
<i>If you're so into family
values, why did you promote</i>

906
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,034
<i>a lesbian student to be
your head cheerleader?</i>

907
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,294
<i>And when did you plan on
telling Ohio families?</i>

908
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:29,967
<i>Here's another question: Why
don't you have a husband, Sue?</i>

909
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,769
<i>Is there something you're not
telling us?</i>

910
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:34,016
<i>Sue Sylvester.
So many questions.</i>

911
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:37,487
(sobbing): I can't believe this
is happening.

912
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:38,556
I'm so sorry.

913
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,476
I haven't even told
my parents yet.

914
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:47,649
(Adele's "Rumor Has It" plays)

915
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,162
<i>¶ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ¶</i>

916
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:58,293
¶ She, she ain't real

917

you want? ¶

920

(music pauses)

921
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:20,020
¶ Bless your soul, you've got
your head in the clouds ¶

922
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:22,219
¶ You made a fool out of you

923

¶ And, boy, she's bringing
you down ¶

924
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:28,692
¶ She made your heart melt,
but you're cold to the core ¶

925
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,415
¶ Now rumor has it she ain't got
your love anymore ¶

926
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:33,195
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

¶ That you settled down
