00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:02,697
(school bell ringing)

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:04,048
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>I know this is a sad day</i>

3
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:05,582
<i>for McKinley</i>
<i>and that we've come back</i>

4
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:07,785
<i>to reflect on everything</i>
<i>the glee club has meant to us.</i>

5
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:10,754
MERCEDES: <i>But still, I figured they'd
at least put up a poster saying</i>

6
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,389
<i>"Welcome back, Mercedes."</i>

7
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,258
RACHEL:
<i>I mean, look, no confetti.</i>

8
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:16,694
MERCEDES: <i>No red carpet
even though I called.</i>

9
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:18,128
<i>I'm the biggest Broadway Star I'm
the biggest recording artist</i>

10
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:19,396
BOTH:
<i>this school's ever produced!</i>

11
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,798
- <i>What the hell?!</i>
- <i>What happened?!</i>

12
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:22,266
- I would be so excited.
- I'm excited.

13
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,467
- Are you nervous?
- I mean, like, a little.

14
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,468
Of course she is!

15
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:25,736
- It's your Broadway debut!
- I know!

16
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,005
(all clamoring) UNIQUE: Oh, my God.
I can't wait

17
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,640
for that album to drop.
Thank you.

18
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:31,408
RACHEL: <i>I mean, come on. She
wrote a couple of songs.</i>

19
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:32,476
<i>Big whoop.</i>

20
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,844
MERCEDES:
<i>So what? She got cast</i>

21
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:35,579
<i>in a play</i>
<i>as an annoying Jewish girl.</i>

22
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:36,680
<i>What a surprise.</i>

23
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,182
RACHEL:
<i>There's only one way</i>

24
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,184
<i>to assert</i>
<i>my God-given superiority.</i>

25
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:42,753
MERCEDES: <i>Sit front and
center in the Rachel chair.</i>

26
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,491
Greet each other.

27
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:49,593
Hello, Rachel.

28
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:51,261
I am so happy to hear

29
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,397
about all of your success.

30
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,932
Oh, thank you so much, Mercedes.

31
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,233
And you are looking well.

32
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,434
Thank you.

33
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,003
Now, if you'll excuse me,

34
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:01,238
I'll make my way
to the back of the bus.

35
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:03,540
100 lessons.

36
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,110
Hey, can I get Finn's plaque
when we clear this place out?

37
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:07,611
No, the plaque stays here.

38
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,046
Lillian and Finn

39
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,315
belong here at McKinley.

40
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,987
It means so much to me

41
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:19,423
that so many of you came
back on such short notice

42
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:22,893
to celebrate the
past few years.

43
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,962
To sit in this room
one last time

44
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:26,563
and sing.

45
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,766
Your assignment is to sing

46
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,100
one of the songs
we sang in here,

47
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,436
but reinvented in some way.

48
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,705
Way back in the old days
when I started the glee club,

49
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,580
I would give an assignment,
and then I would...

50
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:37,741
I would give
a little demonstration

51
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,209
of what I was looking for.

52
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:40,711
ALL:
Yeah!

53
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:41,945
See, you all cheer now,

54
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,714
but just wait
till he starts rapping.

55
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:45,282
Okay, no hip-hop today, Santana.

56
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:48,452
However, I have asked a very
special person to come join me.

57
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,054
And it seemed appropriate
since her contributions

58
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,422
helped save the glee club,

59
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:54,091
or at least the auditorium
way back when.

60
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,993
Please welcome, all the
way from Broadway,

61
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,528
Miss April Rhodes!

62
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:58,829
Hey, y'all!

63
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,264
(all cheering, whooping)

64
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:01,965
(laughs)

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,667
You know, she once taught
me how to shoplift meat

66
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,269
- in my vagina.
- Ew.

67
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:06,970
Right?

68
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:09,978

69
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,875
So, Mr. Moneybags says
to me, he says,

70
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,244
"April Rhodes,
you sing like an angel

71
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,879
"and make love like a tiger.

72
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:17,915
"But the old ball and chain's
got your number.

73
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,317
So I'm afraid
I gots to set you loose."

74
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,187
So, you know what he did?

75
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,122
He bought me an island!

76
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,757
(laughs) That's right.

77
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,425
I own my own island

78
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,361
in the Caribbean called
Santa Abrilrodeo.

79
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:34,098
It's not war-torn
or filled with landslides

80
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:35,933
or got destitute locals in it.

81
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,368
Just me
and my manservant Kadeem.

82
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,704
With long, sensuous nights

83
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:42,539
full of home-brewed poi

84
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:43,974
and intimate massage...

85
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,143
Okay, thank you, April,
for that...

86
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:48,445
wonderful lesson
in female empowerment.

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,446
Amen!

88
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,648
ARTIE:
Amen, but...

89
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,750
why are we all holding
these plastic champagne flutes?

90
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,687
'Cause we are about to pop
the cork with some bubbly.

91
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:59,790
But don't worry,
this Spumante is virgin.

92
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:01,024
Probably like you will be

93
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:03,227
for a long time.
(laughs)

94
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:04,328
Anyways...

95
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:06,296
(grunts) Will and I want you

96
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,631
to raise your glass

97
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,067
to celebrate the
glee club by singing

98
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,569
hands down the best song
New Directions! ever did.

99
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,004
Wait a second, the New
Directions! never sang

100
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,806
"Raise Your Glass."
The Warblers did that.

101
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,274
I was wondering
why it didn't annoy me

102
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:18,809
every time I heard it
in my head.

103
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:21,078
I always have had
a soft spot in my heart

104
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:23,046
for you prep school boys.

105
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,548
Well...
Honk!

106
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,184
Hit it, boys.

107

160
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:48,025
<i>Set my sights on a chick?</i>
<i>Sawed her.</i>

161
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,761
<i>It would've been like a horror</i>
<i>movie if I wasn't so awesome.</i>

162
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:52,262
<i>But that guy's gone now.</i>

163
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:53,797
<i>I have a purpose.</i>

164
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,767
<i>To defend our great country</i>
<i>with my superior airpower.</i>

165
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,201
<i>I don't look back.</i>

166
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:00,237
<i>The past is dead to me.</i>

167
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,475
<i>Except for maybe</i>
<i>just one thing.</i>

168
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:10,047
Hey, Puck.

169
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,282
Hey.

170
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:15,218
So, uh, have you noticed
how hot I look in my uniform?

171
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:16,820
It does look a little bit itchy.

172
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,021
Are you serious or...?

173
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,189
I'm just kidding.

174
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:20,490
You look really handsome.

175
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:22,893
It's not just
the uniform, either.

176
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,595
You've got this newfound
confidence about you.

177
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,364
So, um,

178
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,679
do you know what song you're
gonna sing for the glee club?

179
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:30,667
I'm not sure.

180
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,502
Maybe we could go to Breadstix.

181
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:34,071
Mull some potentials.

182
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:36,239
(shrieks)
You know it's my tickle spot!

183
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,308
(laughs) Hi.
Hi.

184
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,444
(groans) I got bored
sitting at the hotel.

185
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:41,645
Who's this?

186
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:43,747
Puck, this is my boyfriend.

187
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,382
Biff Macintosh.

188
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,650
Like the Apple?

189
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:47,984
Yeah, exactly like it.

190
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,986
My family planted the first
Macintosh apple orchard

191
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,154
in Pennsylvania.

192
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,090
So, every time you have
one of our apples,

193
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,524
we get a nickel.
(laughs)

194
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:57,027
QUINN:
This is my very old,

195
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:00,263
dear, dear friend
Noah Puckerman.

196
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:03,266
Puck, Puckerman.
Is that Jewish?

197
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,368
She never told you about me?

198
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,869
How long you been going out?

199
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,270
About three months.
Well, you know,

200
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,225
Quinn doesn't really like
to talk about her past,

201
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,941
which is why I insisted
on coming back

202
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,409
too see it for
myself, as boring

203
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,564
as you said it might be.
Mmm.

204
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:14,678
I said, "If you want
to meet Mother,

205
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:16,713
I have to really get
to know you first."

206
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,915
Wait, you call your mother
"Mother"?

207
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,550
I need to show Biff
the auditorium.

208
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:22,452
Thank you so much.

209
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:23,720
It's been great
talking to you, Puck.

210
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,355
It was good to meet you.
Nice uniform.

211
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,057
Looks a little itchy, though.

212
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,594
(school bell rings)

213
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,331
Hey. I've been looking
for you everywhere.

214
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,333
(door closes)
What are you doing?

215
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,102
I'm trying to prove
the Reimann hypothesis.

216
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:40,237
Who's forcing you to do this?

217
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:41,605
My colleagues at M.I.T.

218
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,274
They said I had the most
gifted mind in a generation.

219
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:47,210
Miss Pierce?

220
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,880
What's five billion,
752 million,

221
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,984
divided by 958 million,

222
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:57,354
715,548?

223
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:58,989
I don't know. Six?
(bell dings)

224
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,491
(all clapping)

225
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:04,828
I just wish that I could have
my old life back,

226
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:07,164
where I wasn't a
mathematical genius

227
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:09,232
and all I wanted to do
was to scissor you

228
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:11,134
and to talk to my cat.
Well,

229
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,003
what do you say you and I

230
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,972
reunite a little threesome

231
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,841
called the Unholy Trinity?

What did you think,
Mr. Preppy McDimplebutt?

274
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,574
Oh, I thought it was, um,

275
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,442
very energetic.

276
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,878
Dude, you were texting
the whole time.

277
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,079
Yeah, well, he's very busy.

278
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:37,981
He's, um, president of a...
of a secret society

No, I wasn't.

Mercedes Jones
and Rachel Berry.

303
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,428
Question, Rachel:
Yes.

304
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:26,496
You're currently rehearsing for

305
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,797
the lead role
in a Broadway musical.

306
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,699
You're also working full-time

307
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,635
as a singing waitress at a diner

308
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,137
and enrolled full-time
as a student at NYADA.

309
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,472
That's correct.

310
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:36,840
Would you agree that it's

311
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:39,009

314
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,513
Uh, no, I-I just...

315
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,348
When are the lies going to stop?

316
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,783
You don't even live in New York.

317
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,551
I'm not even sure
you've been to New York.

318
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,819
Brittany, we went
to New York together.

00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,054
Don't change the subject.

320
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,123
Are your cats making out?

321
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,858
(meowing, slurping)

322
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:56,393
Yes, they are.

323
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:59,396
Mercedes, how would you
respond to the rumors

324
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,231
that you're a really
good dancer... Ha!

325
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:03,199
But you hid the fact
the entire time

326
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,868
you were in Glee Club
so Mr. Shue

327
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,002
would allow you to, quote,

328
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,704
"Park and Bark"?
No comment.

329
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:09,706
Good. Last question.

330
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,641
Do you know what song
you're going to sing

331
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:13,143
for Mr. Shue's last assignment?

332
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:14,511
MERCEDES and RACHEL:
Yes. "Defying Gravity."

333
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:16,413
What?!
No, you can't sing that song.

334
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,581
Kurt and I are singing it,
but we're switching parts

335
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:21,251
so that I can belt out
the high note at the end.

336
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:23,205
That's not reinventing a song.
You can't do that.

337
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,421
You know what, Mercedes?

338
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:26,156
Why don't we settle this
the old-fashioned way?

339
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,290
A diva-off?

340
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,659
Oh, hell to the yes.

341
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:31,027
It's on.

342
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,545
I've never really noticed
because I haven't spent

343
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,728
that much time around them,

344
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,999
but poor people are
generally less attractive

345
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,299
than rich ones.
(chuckles)

346
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,001
It means so much to me
that you came back here.

347
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:46,704
You know, it makes us
feel so much more real.

348
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,806
Yeah, well, we are very real.

349
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,475
I love you, Quinn,
and I want to

350
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,642
really get to know <i>you.</i>

351
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:52,917
Well, what do you want to know?

352
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,545
I can tell you so many things,

353
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,114
like the time that I...

354
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:57,448
Oh, no, not you.

355
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:59,283
Hey, guys.
Come here. Yeah, you.

356
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,985
(laughs) Come on.

357
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,355
Hey, guys.

358
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,125
Hi. Santana Lopez.

359
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,260
Word on the street is
that you're old money.

360
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:11,195
I'm a lesbian, but I'm
totally into that.

361
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,530
(chuckles)

362
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:13,765
Mike Chang, Asian dancer.

363
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,566
And I'm Artie Abrams.
I may look like

364
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:17,668
a dweeb in a wheelchair, but
my girlfriend's a cheerleader.

365
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,637
So, what about Quinn?
How would you describe her

366
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:20,638
in one sentence?

367
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:21,973
She's constantly surprising you.

368
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,475
Like, one year, she showed up
to school in the fall

369
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,144
and decided she wanted
to be a skank.

370
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:29,280
She dyed her hair pink, she
got a Ryan Seacrest tattoo,

371
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,649
and then lit a purple
piano on fire.

372
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:34,552
(laughs) BIFF: Hold
on one second.

373
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,120
Piano?

374
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:38,089
They're-They're messing
with you. Honey, I forgot

375
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:40,358
my purse in the car,
and I'd really love

376
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:41,826
(whispers): my lipstick
and some lady things.

377
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,294
Oh, absolutely.
I'll go get it

378
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,096
for you, sweetheart.
No worries.

379
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,002
What the hell was that?

380
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:53,304
I am trying to present myself
in a particular way.

381
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,072
Biff's family is Philadelphia
Main Line society,

382
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:57,742
and if I get in with that,
then my life is set.

383
00:13:57,776 --> 00:14:00,678
How do you cover up the tattoo, you know?
Like, what? Magic?

384
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:04,348
I pay my roommate to apply
three coats of cover-up makeup

385
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:06,017
to my lower back
before I see him.

386
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,518
Does he know about us?
About Beth?

387
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,854
I will tell him everything
when I'm ready.

388
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:12,824
(school bell rings)

389
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,625
APRIL: The agreement
clearly states

390
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,460
that the provider of the funds,

391
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,530
in this case, the April Rhodes
Charitable Foundation...

392
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:23,434
independent LLC...
is, quote, "solely responsible

393
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,169
"for the maintenance and
operation of this facility

394
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:27,471
until such funds
are no longer provided."

395
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:28,506
Which means?

396
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,707
Which means, as long

397
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,209
as I'm paying
for that auditorium,

398
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,678
I gets to say
who performs there.

399
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:35,546
If you'd like
to start paying for it...

400
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:36,581
We can't do that.

401
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:38,015
School doesn't have the money.

402
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,117
Then it sounds to me
like the glee club is saved

403
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,552
and that we're moving full-time
to the auditorium.

404
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:44,021
I will have my team review this
and get back to you tomorrow.

405
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,724
Uh, and let's hold off on
any official announcements

406
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,860
until then. Agreed?

407
00:14:48,894 --> 00:14:50,027
(laughs)

408
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:51,629
Let's get some box wine
to celebrate!

409
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:52,797
Wow!

410
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,099
(laughs)

411
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,133
Becky.

412
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:58,946
There's something fishy going on
around here.

413
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,705
We're gonna get
to the bottom of it.

414
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,007
All right, everybody,

415
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,243
I wish I could say
that this week isn't about

416
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:06,510
competing against each other,

417
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,179
but time for
one last diva-off!

418
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,614
And apparently, the only song

419
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:12,049
we can sing in a diva-off
is "Defying Gravity."

420
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:15,319
Wait. So we have to listen
to Kurt shred that note again?

421
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,321
For the millionth time,
I did it on purpose.

422
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:19,490
RACHEL: And after we're
done singing the song,

423
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,892
there will be a secret ballot

424
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,127
where you guys can finally
answer the age-old question:

425
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:26,998
Who is the true star
of the glee club,

426
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:28,733
me or Mercedes?

427
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:33,404
<i>All I've ever wanted in here</i>
<i>was to feel chosen.</i>

428
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:34,639
MERCEDES:
<i>It's funny, even now,</i>

429
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,374
<i>all of the success</i>
<i>in the outside world</i>

430
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:37,909
<i>doesn't feel as important.</i>

The song should be
on the Broadway.

475
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:52,543
MERCEDES:
All right, let's stop

476
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:53,811
playing around.
It's time to vote.

477
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,646
Actually, let's just
take a beat and...

478
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,715
and just enjoy how amazing

479
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,450
those performances were.
We'll sleep on it

480
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:01,045
and vote tomorrow.
But today, right now,

481
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:03,220
you are all winners.

482
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:10,527
Knight takes pawn.

483
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,434
Kiki, your move.

484
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:20,837
KIKI:
Pawn to A6.

485
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:24,574
Clever, for a pinko Communist.

486
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,777
- Knight to C3.
- Brittany,

487
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,912
what the hell is this?

488
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:31,882
The chess club is
helping me re-create

489
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,252
the historic 1972
World Championship

490
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,054
between Bobby Fischer
and Boris Spassky.

491
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:40,123
And it's the only
creative outlet I have

492
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:43,060
now that my life is one
never-ending math equation.

493
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:45,429
This is freaking me out.

494
00:18:45,463 --> 00:18:47,464
This is not you.

495
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:49,032
You love to dance.

496
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,902
And I know that you think that
you're a little rusty right now,

497
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,570
but you'll get it back.

498
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,806
I'll prove it to you.

499
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,874
Let's do a number together.

500
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,577
No. Those days are over.

501
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,045
This is my life now.

502
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,815
Bishop to E3.

503
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,384
MERCEDES:
It all comes down

504
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:08,719
to how cool you are.

505
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:10,687
Rachel Berry, she
represents Broadway,

506
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:11,922
the past.

507
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:14,758
I'm the future. A pop diva.

508
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,426
I mean, she may be a pop diva,

509
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,795
but the fact is that
this song is a hit

510
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,897
from one of the longest-running
Broadway musicals of all time.

511
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:23,100
Question: Why do they
call it Broadway

512
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,969
when most of the theaters
are actually not on Broadway?

513
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:27,738
MERCEDES: You know, this
vote asks the question,

514
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:28,972
what is Glee Club?

515
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,408
I mean, is it a training ground
for-for theme park

516
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,877
and cruise ship performers
who can't wait to get on

517
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:36,847
some outdoor stage
and belt out <i>Pippin,</i>

518
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,915
or is it a place
where stars are born?

519
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,885
You know, the kind of stars that
you actually hear on the radio.

520
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,421
I beat Kurt singing this song
in our first diva-off.

521
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,722
I am better than her.

522
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:47,657
I've always been better
than her.

523
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,326
Just vote for me.

524
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,562
And let's settle this
once and for all time.

525
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:53,897
Amen.

526
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,332
(school bell rings)

527
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,501
So, you two
are getting hitched?

528
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:58,969
When's the happy occasion?

529
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,670
Well, we don't know just yet.

530
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,306
We were gonna wait later
in the year to set a date.

531
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:04,975
We're enjoying
a long engagement.

532
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,610
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

533
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:08,979
If I've said it once,
I've said it a million times:

534
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:13,050
The one thing this country
needs more of is teen marriage.

535
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,552
I got you a wedding present.

536
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:16,920
It's a little hooch.

537
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,422
Oh.
Oh.

538
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:19,990
It'll help dull
the excruciating pain

539
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,626
of your wedding night sodomy
and the inevitable divorce

540
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,162
that you're careening towards
a couple months later.

541
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:26,730
Okay, guys, we're having
our secret ballot

542
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:27,998
at the end of class,

543
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,699
but before we get to that,
Puckerman

544
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,201
has asked to do a number.

545
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,404
Actually, Mr. Shue, I was hoping
for this number that...

546
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:35,872
Hold up, hold up,
Private Puckerman.

547
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:37,174
I'm gonna let you finish,

548
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,309
but first, I would like
to uphold the tradition

549
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:42,846
of hijacking this glee club
and making everyone

550
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,548
sit through what is
basically an intervention.

551
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:47,217
Mr. Shue, you said
that we could redo

552
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,518
some of our favorite
numbers, right?

553
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,553
Well, then I want to do
a dance duet with Brittany.

554
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:52,355
(cheering)

555
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,057
Hit it.

(crying)

648
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:30,300
(sighs)

649
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,702
I guess I can still
saw your heart.

650
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:34,070
(sniffles)

651
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,005
I loved the song,

652
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,008
but I'm not crying over you.

653
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,411
I'm crying because

654
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,580
until you sang that song,

655
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:45,882
I had actually
forgotten about it.

656
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,752
In a couple years...

657
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:50,420
we'll forget all of this.

658
00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:52,822
Well, that's why you gotta
keep holding on to your past.

659
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:54,524
And not be ashamed of it.

660
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,192
I'd rather look forward.

661
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:58,261
We all love you for who you are.

662
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,430
And I'm in love with Biff.

663
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,305
(school bell ringing)
All right, everybody!

664
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,630
No more drama.
Time to vote

665
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:13,532
for either Rachel or Mercedes.

666
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,633
Excuse me, Schuester.

667
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:16,435
Before we cast
another pointless vote

668
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,671
in a meaningless contest

669
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:21,607
that has absolutely no practical
ramifications whatsoever,

670
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:22,808
I would like to say

671
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,602
some words about
my good friend Rachel Berry.

672
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:29,381
Rachel Berry is the most

673
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,883
horrible human being
on the planet.

674
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,818
- What?
- Can it, troll.

675
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,386
Santana... SANTANA:
You have sold

676
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:36,255
half the people in this room
down the river

677
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:37,590
more times than I can count

678
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:40,192
so that you can get a solo
or the lead in a musical,

679
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:42,194
and I'm pretty sure
that you don't know the names

680
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:43,562
of the other half of the people.

681
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:44,697
That's not true.

682
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:46,432
All right, what is his name?

683
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,266
Rick.

684
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,381
SANTANA:
Exactly. Thank you.

685
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:50,235
See, you've all
met Rachel, okay?

686
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,537
But I've... I live with her.

687
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:54,073
Let me tell you what it's like

688
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:55,407
to share a bathroom with this

689
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:57,343
stubby, undergrown
little cretin.

690
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:59,511
Someone in that apartment

691
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:00,846
shaves their face

692
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,348
and leaves their stubble
in the sink,

693
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,550
and we all know it ain't
Kurt, so do the math.

694
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:06,385
That's a lie. SANTANA: You
know what else is a lie?

695
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,920
When you won Prom Queen.

696
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,234
What? SANTANA: Yeah,
that's right.

697
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,556
You didn't win, okay?

698
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,324
Everybody just felt
really bad for you,

699
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,799
and the two people
that you hate most

700
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:15,060
in this whole world,
Quinn and I,

701
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:17,062
stuffed the ballot box
so that you would win.

702
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:19,965
You're so cruel, Santana.

703
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,967
I mean, you're only
doing this to me

704
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:23,502
because I'm the lead
of <i>Funny Girl</i>

705
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:25,270
and you're just
the lowly understudy.

706
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:28,507
You want to make me feel bad
because I'm better than you.

707
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,542
And you're an awful person.

708
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,712
Oh! I feel so much better.
Let's vote.

709
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:35,414
(school bell ringing)

710
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:51,063
Well, that Santana rant
really brought me back.

711
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,199
(crying):
You don't even know

712
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,501
what it's like in New York.

713
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,269
I mean, Santana and I

714
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:58,604
were close for like a minute,

715
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:00,305
but now it's like
every single day

716
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,607
is exactly like that.

717
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,443
And now it's like
no matter where I go

718
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:07,279
or what I do, I'm just back
in high school again.

719
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,314
(sobs)

720
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,316
(exhales)

721
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:12,484
(sniffs)

722
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,819
You know, every time a producer

723
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,287
or an agent tells me that

724
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,321
I'm not good enough

725
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,490
or that I'm not ready...

726
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:21,126
God, it's like
Santana is saying it.

727
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:23,028
Or Puck or Quinn

728
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:24,630
or anybody that's been here

729
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:26,665
that's ever made me feel small.

730
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:29,868
Sometimes it's even you.

731
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:32,438
I'm one of your
high school ghosts?

732
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:33,439
(sniffs)

733
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,274
It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

734
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:37,376
I just use all of that stuff,

735
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,478
and I let it motivate me.

736
00:28:39,512 --> 00:28:41,780
It just makes me sad
that you would think

737
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:43,282
that I'm one of
your tormentors.

738
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,350
I guess I just...

739
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:47,186
I don't know, I had this

740
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,987
feeling that it was
always me and you

741
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:50,456
against everyone else.

742
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,491
You were never like them.

743
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,127
You were just always

744
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,196
the best damn singer
that I've ever heard.

745
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:00,866
You know, and I want you
to be all big

746
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,701
and rich and famous.

747
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,036
I just want to be richer...

748
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,604
(laughs) and bigger...

749
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:07,573
and more famous.

750
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:08,574
(laughs)

751
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:09,975
Oh, don't you think that

752
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,044
Beyoncé and Barbra
feel that way?

753
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:14,480
Girl, I don't know. Ask me
when I get my first gold record.

754
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:16,148
(laughs) Okay?

755
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:17,916
(laughing) Well, I mean,

756
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:19,251
I will have won

757
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:20,686
my first Tony by then, so...
Oh...

758
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,555
Come here.
(laughs)

759
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,824
Oh...

760
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,260
After the unpleasantness
of our last encounter,

761
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:30,662
I decided to do
some deep background

762
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:32,865
to investigate your claims,

763
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,667
conducted in an intensive
Wikipedia search

764
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,170
that took all of 25 seconds.

765
00:29:38,204 --> 00:29:40,305
You, April Rhodes,

766
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,707
were the mistress of

767
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,342
local strip-mall magnate
Buddy Leibowitz,

768
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:46,011
whose wife offered
you $2 million

769
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,646
to keep the affair quiet

770
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,548
after her husband's
untimely demise.

771
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,717
It was that money
that you placed into an annuity

772
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:54,653
to fund the auditorium
in perpetuity.

773
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,255
That's right.

774
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:57,589
Well, it didn't last.

775
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:00,292
In fact, that money
ran out six weeks ago.

776
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:01,393
How?

777
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,662
Will Schuester's
profligate spending

778
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:07,232
and his penchant for staging
elaborate private bacchanalia

779
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,536
replete with extravagant
scenery and costumes

780
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,871
not seen since
the reign of Caligula.

781
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,907
I have here
a line-item budget

782
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:16,809
of the jungle set
you constructed

783
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:18,177
onstage a few weeks back

784
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:19,912
so the glee club could perform

785
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:21,079
a Katy Perry song

786
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:23,615
literally for just you.

787
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,384
Whoa, whoa, hold-hold on.
Let-let me see that.

788
00:30:25,418 --> 00:30:27,286
I don't know what
the problem is,

789
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,221
but whatever money
the glee club needs,

790
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:30,355
I'm good for it.

791
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,690
April Rhodes is rich!

792
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:33,926
No, April Rhodes
is under indictment

793
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,594
from the Securities
and Exchange Commission

794
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:38,597
and in violation of
her $3 million bail

795
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,099
that forbids her from leaving
the state of New York.

796
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,467
Oh, snap!

797
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:43,702
Wait, what?

798
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:45,370
Well, what April may have
neglected to mention

799
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:47,172
is that her most recent john

800
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,942
was none other than
the disgraced financier

801
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,443
Bernie Madoff.

802
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:53,312
All of April's assets,

803
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:54,546
including her private island,

804
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:55,647
have been frozen.

805
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,416
April, is this true?

806
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,450
Gulp.

807
00:30:58,484 --> 00:30:59,885
Sure sounds true, doesn't it?

808
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,886
I'm sorry, Will.

809
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,454
It does appear that

810
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,890
the glee club is indeed over.

811
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:05,757
(gasps dramatically)

812
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,527
APRIL:
Will, wait! Wait!

813
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:09,561
This is yours.
Yes.

814
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:10,796
Will, wait!
I can explain...

815
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,564
Explain what, April?

816
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,765
That's you're a
pathological liar

817
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,033
whom I never should
have trusted?

818
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:16,635
Yes, exactly.

819
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,337
You did the worst thing

820
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:20,672
you possibly could've done.

821
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,140
You gave me hope.

822
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:28,685
What are you talking
about? A tattoo?

823
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,387
It's not that bad.
I mean, it was...

824
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,742
On your lower back?
Ryan Seacrest?

825
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:32,889
I could get it removed.

826
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,124
There's not a laser big enough.

827
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,258
It's the size of Texas.

828
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,693
You should've told
me this weeks ago.

829
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,228
We're in the 20th century.
That doesn't make sense.

830
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:39,496
The 21st, almost.
Is there a problem here?

831
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,731
Puck, go away.
Okay? We're...

832
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,366
Was she always this
big of a liar?

833
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,867
QUINN:
I'm coming clean now.

834
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,302
Doesn't that mean something?

835
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,503
Wh... a baby?

836
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,505
I mean, what happens
if we got married

837
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,273
and this kid shows up
looking for money?

838
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,475
Are you crazy?

839
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,310
Was this the loser
who knocked you up?

840
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,911
Yes, yes. Puck is the father.
Yeah.

841
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,413
I am looking for
acceptance here, okay?

842
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,547
This is how I love.

843
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,116
That may be how you

844
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,283
and your loser friends love,

845
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,418
but where I come from,

846
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,819
you carry your past with you.

847
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,188
You are the worst
kind of hypocrite.

848
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,590
You walk around
like you're some

849
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,691
Snow frickin' White,
but you're really

850
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,059
just a dirty little slutbag.

851
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,894
Ow, ow, ow, ow! You
shouldn't have said that.

852
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:11,895
Let go of my nose!

853
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,663
Ow, God, let go!
Am I bleeding?

854
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:14,898
Not yet.

855
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,166
(grunting)

856
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,267
You're hurting him! Stop!

857
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:18,268
PUCK:
Kind of the point!

858
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,269
QUINN:
Knock it off!

859
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,504
Stop!

860
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,779
Help me get him out of here.

861
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:29,880
Do you have any idea

862
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,048
how much better you are
than this guy?

863
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,516
Look, you can crawl
into the trash

864
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,683
and help him out,

865
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,352
or you can come be
with your real friends

866
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,987
in the choir room.

867
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,255
I'll be waiting.

868
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,393
(school bell ringing)

869
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,108
WILL: All right, everybody.
It's time to get

870
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,530
this voting nonsense
out of the way

871
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,232
so that we can continue on
with what you all came here for:

872
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,700
the music.

873
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,336
Y'all can use your left hand
for anonymity.

874
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,371
But I'm left-handed.

875
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,939
Then use a foot.
Okay.

876
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,507
♪

877
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,913
Dude, who you putting on?

878
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,081
Well, I'm torn.

879
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,615
One is black and one is Jewish.

880
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,586
Okay, that's everybody.

881
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,659
So, um,

882
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,395
sorry about that
outburst earlier.

883
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,564
Mercedes and I
have been talking.

884
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:24,034
And we both realize that
asking you guys to vote

885
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,636
for who's more talented is just,
it's completely ridiculous,

886
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,704
unproductive

887
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,906
and narcissistic. I mean,

888
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,475
how could we ask you guys

889
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,777
to choose between two
beautiful queen divas?

890
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,132
Well, funny enough,
they did vote,

891
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,313
and they did choose.

892
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,348
And guess what.

893
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:40,684
You're both equally talented
in their eyes.

894
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,819
And mine.
(both laugh)

895
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,121
(applause)

896
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,591
Excuse me, excuse me.

897
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,259
I'd like to apologize.

898
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,294
It's not the first time I've
raised someone's hopes

899
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,197
and then left them
on the rocky shores

900
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,266
of disappointment and regret.

901
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,935
Just ask all of my A.A.
sponsors. April?

902
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,404
We just want to spend the rest
of the week singing in peace.

903
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,340
But I did do was use
the last few hours

904
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,674
of my NetJets account

905
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,776
to bring in someone
whose infectious happiness

906
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,446
surely will make the next
few days that much brighter.

907
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,982
Ladies and gentlemen...

908
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,617
(cheering)

909
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,355
<i>Hola, clase.</i>

910
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,357
April, thank you for
buttering the floor for me.

911
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,692
You know I like
to make an entrance.

912
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,693
Wait, I'm-I'm sorry.

913
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,562
How-how do you two
know each other?

914
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,963
Oh, because there's
a whole Facebook page

915
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,365
for people who were
guests of Glee Club.

916
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,499
I'm on it, April...

917
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,334
Blaine's brother, Rachel's mom,

918
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,435
that Mexican guy.

919
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,436
(laughs):
Holly...

920
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,038
This is amazing.

921
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,139
Where have you been?

922
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,741
Oh, I've been everywhere.

923
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,409
I quit being a
substitute teacher

924
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:41,344
because I couldn't
stand being tied down.

925
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,547
I like teaching a room
full of kids if I know

926
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,781
I'm never gonna see them again,

927
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,516
but then, if you're
any good at it,

928
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,617
they keep asking you back,

929
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,586
which kind of
defeats the purpose.

930
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,488
So, I started my trademark

931
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,723
Holly Holliday Teachin' Pop-Ups.

932
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,258
I just show up at a classroom

933
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,093
unannounced, teach a lesson

934
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,628
and get the hell out of there.

935
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,664
(old-timey voice):
Hello!

936
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,401
I'm William Henry Harrison,
America's worst president.

937
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,537
I exterminated a nation
of Native Americans,

938
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,872
and it got me elected.

939
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,641
But I refused to wear a coat
to my inauguration,

940
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,810
so I caught a cold
and died a month later.

941
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,845
I accomplished nothing!
(footsteps approaching)

942
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,913
WOMAN:
There she is!

943
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,582
She just showed up,
and she took

944
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,816
over my class!

945
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,618
Tippy-canoe!

946
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,687
But when I heard
Glee Club was ending,

947
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,256
I ripped off my Pol Pot uniform,

948
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,625
hopped on that first flight
out of Buenos Aires

949
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,627
and came to pay my respects.

950
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,828
Uh, Holly, you know
that we're singing

951
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:32,929
our favorite Glee Club songs

952
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,431
we've already sung before.

953
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,099
That's a terrible idea!

954
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,268
Listen, that might be
fine for you nerds,

955
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,470
but when Holly Holliday
is in town,

956
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:43,173
this hot bitch is not looking
in the rearview mirror;

957
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,874
she's looking forward.

958
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:45,976

1011
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,040
He forgave us for
what we did, right?

1012
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:31,013
A long time ago.

1013
00:38:31,048 --> 00:38:33,015
And we saved him.

1014
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,851
Rachel was his soul mate.

1015
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:36,419
Who's yours?

1016
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,854
Biff?

1017
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:40,423
He's going back to Yale.

1018
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:41,958
Alone.

1019
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:43,526
SANTANA:
<i>This is so not cool.</i>

1020
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,995
Okay, they can't just
chain you to a calculator

1021
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:47,763
and keep you as
their math monkey.

1022
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,532
Wait, do those actually exist?

1023
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,801
You need to be having a life.

1024
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:53,436
You need to be out in the world

1025
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,538
going to restaurants
and concerts and...

1026
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:58,107
and dating.

1027
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:01,344
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
blow this place, too.

1028
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:05,281
Unless there's a reason
for me to stay.

1029
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:07,984
'Cause I know who
my soul mate is.

1030
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:19,829
Okay, um...

1031
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:23,799
it's a bad idea.

1032
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:26,269
You don't want me.
I'm terrible at having

1033
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:29,138
a relationship that involves
any level of honesty.

1034
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:31,807
I love you.

1035
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:34,410
Just tell me to stay.

1036
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:36,412
'Cause the truth is
there's only one guy

1037
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:39,248
that you were ever
really honest with.

1038
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:42,285
It feels really good
to be around you.

1039
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,587
You make me feel
like a girl again.

1040
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:46,122
Like, my body wakes up.

1041
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:49,592
Please don't do this, okay?

1042
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:52,461
I have worked my ass
off to get over you.

1043
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:57,800
I really want
to be with you, Santana.

1044
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,870
I've seen the world,
and I'm sure now more than ever

1045
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:02,805
that I belong with you.

1046
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:05,041
And I'm sure
your girlfriend's great,

1047
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:07,109
but you can't re-create

1048
00:40:07,144 --> 00:40:09,345
what you and I have.

1049
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:11,647
Just tell me to stay.

1050
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:13,449
Please.

1051
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:18,020
So, it's your choice.

1052
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:22,124
If you want me, I'm here.

1053
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:44,480
♪

1054
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,768
Stay.

1055
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:14,643
I want to show you
guys something.

1056
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:16,812
All of you that were together
from the very beginning

1057
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:18,514
when the glee club
was just a dream.

1058
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:26,088
(sighs)

1059
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:29,392
Their new and final
resting places.

1060
00:41:29,426 --> 00:41:31,727
For as long
as McKinley's around,

1061
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:34,797
all the students who travel
through this auditorium

1062
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:36,899
are gonna see these.

1063
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:39,335
And have absolutely no idea
who they are.

1064
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:40,736
You know what? This is crazy.

1065
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:42,972
Because I could really give
two poops about this place,

1066
00:41:43,006 --> 00:41:45,207
but this is
really getting to me.

1067
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:47,777
I know. Why is that?

1068
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,512
WILL: We were all raised
by different parents.

1069
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:51,914
But we grew up together
in the glee club.

1070
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:53,849
It's a part of all of us.

1071
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:55,418
Of course you're sad about it.

1072
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:57,253
I don't know, Mr. Schue.

1073
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,588
With this and Finn,

1074
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:02,458
it's kind of hard
to believe that anything lasts.

1075
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:04,660
I don't have any more pep talks.

1076
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:06,962
I just have you guys.

1077
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:09,465
And the memory
of the people on this wall.

1078
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:13,235
My friends.

1079
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:17,206
I mean, we share
this special bond.

1080
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,375
We're the only ones
in the world who-who know

1081
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:20,910
what this glee club
meant to us.

1082
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:23,145
What it felt like
to sing together.

1083
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,749
To be... to be together.

1084
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:30,119
And what it feels like
to say good-bye to it.

1085
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:32,388
I didn't come here
to cheer you up.

1086
00:42:32,422 --> 00:42:33,923
Just to thank you.

1087
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:38,194
(crying): To thank you for
going on this ride with me.

1088
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:50,606
All right, come on.

1089
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,008
We've still got
a few days until, uh,

1090
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:55,644
Sue shuts the lights out
on the choir room, so...

1091
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,613
let's make the most of them.

1092
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:04,520
I mean, I know we got to
finish our wine first.

1093
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:07,156
Mmm.
But when we do, we cannot let

1094
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,325
that glee club go
the way of the dodo.

1095
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,827
Oh, couldn't have said it
better myself.

1096
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:14,330
Holly Holliday...

1097
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:17,479
we're going to save
that glee club.
