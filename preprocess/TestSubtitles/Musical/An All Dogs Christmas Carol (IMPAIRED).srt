about three ghosts,
two bad dogs, and an evil witch.

- Ghosts?

No. No, no, no. It's all true.

20

In fact, the witch was my evil cousin,

Belladonna.

Yes.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,559
This is how my two best guardian angels
tried to stop her from ruining Christmas.

25

- Meet Charles Barkin and ltchy ltchiford.

Well, I'll start at the beginning

She can't hear you. This is the past.

334

- Yeah, but Mom still loved me.

This was my first human family.

01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,796
Snow, snow.

782
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,118
Hey. Hey, Mr Reindeer, look.

783
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,028
You made it snow after all. Thanks.

784
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,113
Whoa. Charlie, what does this mean?

785
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,800
It means our plan worked.

786
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,674
We convinced Carface to save Christmas.

787
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,475
Actually, Charlie,
the final decision belonged to Carface.

788
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,319
<i>Yes, and he chose correctly.</i>

789
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,673
See? I told you all along
we could trust him.

790
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,999
<i>Well, congratulations</i>
<i>on your most important mission.</i>

<i>This will be a story to repeat</i>
<i>for years to come.</i>

792
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,712
I just feel so bad for those pups because
we don't have any p-r-e-s... um, gifts left.

793
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,274
- You know?
- Ho, ho, ho!

794
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,516
Merry Christmas!

795
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,710
Merry Christmas!

796
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,715
It's easy for him to be jolly.

797
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,757
He's not pulling this darned thing. Ow!

798
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,917
Here you go, kids. Here you are.

<i>(cheering)</i>

800
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,471
Really noble, Carface,
bringin' back the gifts you stole.

801
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,990
Hey, you kiddin'?
I added lots of new stuff, too.

802
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,512
No foolin'? Hey, nice goin'.

803
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,835
Ain't I a little Dickens?

804
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,759
Hey, I want you to meet my new pal.

805
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,835
Timmy!

806
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,157
Look, Charlie,
Uncle Carface filled it up full.

807
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,989
Uncle? I never thought I'd hear myself
bark these words,

808
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,556
but... you did the right thing for once.

809
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,836
Don't expect it to last long.
I've still got a business to run, you know.

810
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,789
- At least you were sweet for a day.
- Aw, this calls for a song.

811
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,154
- OK, now, go... now?
- Now!

812
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,272
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... Now?

818
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,360
Why don't you stick around
for the party, big boy?

819
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,756
I'd love to, but I'm gonna go visit my mom.

820
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,678
It's been a long time.

821
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,998
- Mush!
- Yeow! Ow! Easy on the pelt.

822
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,839
Merry Christmas.

823
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,436
God bless!

824
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,398
Yep. God bless us, every one.

<i>(* "Joy to the World")</i>

And all I can add to that
is Merry Christmas.

827
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,759
And that goes double for us.
