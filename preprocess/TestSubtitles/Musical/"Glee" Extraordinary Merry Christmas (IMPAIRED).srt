1
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:12,948
 I don't want a lot for Christmas 

2
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:17,377
 There is just one thing I need 

3
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:21,498
 I don't care about the presents 

4
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:24,974
 Underneath the Christmas tree 

5
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:30,712
 Make my wish come true

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:36,873
 All I want for Christmas

7
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:40,483
 Is

8
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:43,753
 You...

9
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:52,568
 I don't want a lot for Christmas 

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,820
 There is just one thing I need 

11
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:58,559
 Don't care about the presents 

12
00:00:58,577 --> 00:01:01,501
 Underneath the Christmas tree 

13
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:05,831
 I don't need to hang my stocking 

14
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,234
 There upon the fireplace

15
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,738
 Santa Claus won't make me happy 

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,009
 With a toy on Christmas Day

17
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,259
 I just want you for my own

18
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:21,295
 More than you could ever know 

19
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,179
 Make my wish come true

20
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:29,302
 Baby, all I want for Christmas 

21
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:34,598
 Is you...

22
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,264
<i> Baby </i>

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,698
<i> Oh...
 All I want for Christmas </i>

24
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,953
<i> Is you   Oh...</i>

25
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,284
<i> Baby </i>

26
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:47,153
<i> All I want for Christmas </i>

27
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:50,939
<i> Is you   All I want for Christmas</i>

28
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:55,558
 Is you.

29
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,554
(students cheering)

30
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:02,167
Best Christmas ever.

==DIFUNDE LA PALABRA==

33
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:07,815
(school bell ringing) Here's my list.

34
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,148
I thought we agreed the "things
did wrong this week" list

35
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:11,735
- was hurting more than helping.
- My Christmas list.

36
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:14,130
I heard you were having
a little trouble figuring out

37
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:14,987
what to get me.

38
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:16,742
I'm freaking out.
I have no idea

39
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:17,940
what to get Rachel for Christmas.

40
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,235
When in doubt, go with socks.

41
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,266
- A wok is always good.
- What about soil?

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,936
I agree with Artie about the socks.

43
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,292
PUCK:
You see?

44
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:25,957
This is why I don't have
a high-maintenance girlfriend.

45
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:28,039
Or any girlfriend, for that matter.

46
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:31,859
Who told you? Kurt?

47
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,018
- No. (gasps)
- Yes.

48
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:35,732
- But I can't afford all this stuff.
- Oh, no, silly. No, no.

49
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:38,261
I just put 15 things on the
list, and you can pick out five.

50
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:41,310
Look, in a... in a few weeks,
I'm going to find out if I'm

51
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,806
a finalist for NYADA or not, and,

52
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:46,456
well, I just... I'd really love
to have a little Yuletide bauble

53
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,064
as a good-luck charm
for my audition.

54
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,545
Spray tan?
Teeth whitening? I mean...

55
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,345
I'm just trying
to make it easier for you.

56
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:53,533
If you'd like, you can make
a list for me also.

57
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:56,322
Well, like the song says, "All
I want for Christmas is you."

58
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:58,506
Aw. All I want for Christmas
is you, too.

59
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,603
And five things on that list.

60
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:06,770
I love you.

61
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,176
Holy crap, I'm dating Kim Kardashian.

62
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,643
Wheels, Porcelain, Other Gay,

63
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:22,942
the Yuletide is upon us,
and everyone knows

64
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,021
that Cistmas is a time
for forgiveness,

65
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,811
so I have decided to forgive
you for having no talent

66
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,121
and ruining the American songbook

67
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:31,607
one mash-up at a time.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,759
I've also forgiven you for forcing me

69
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,831
to run in and promptly lose

70
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,523
an humiliating statewide election.

71
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:41,589
We... accept your forgiveness?

72
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:42,993
Now, Christmas isn't just a time

73
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:45,510
when Jewish kids get
slightly uncomfortable

74
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,708
and dwarves get jobs
as Santa's helpers

75
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,434
in demeaning nonunion commercials

76
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,382
that make them quietly die inside.

77
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,226
No, Christmas is also
a time to give back.

78
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,696
Which is why, this Friday,
I am volunteering

79
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,431
at the Lima Homeless Shelter.

80
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,355
And I thought maybe you and
your fellow glee clubbers

81
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:04,270
might want to pitch in by
giving the gift of song.

82
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,515
Coach Sylvester, I've heard you
say on several occasions

83
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,619
that you don't believe
in homelessness.

84
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:11,198
You said you considered
homeless people

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,529
urban campers.

86
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:13,706
Can I be honest with you,

87
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,460
Stumbles, Gelfling,
young Burt Reynolds?

88
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,244
(Sue sighs)

89
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:21,084
I lost my sister this past year,

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,547
and this will be my first
Christmas without her.

91
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,886
And honestly, I'm just trying
to keep myself occupie

92
00:04:27,926 --> 00:04:30,412
I... I made plans
to shoot reindeer

93
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:32,747
from a helicopter with
Sarah Palin, but she canceled.

94
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,382
Apparently,

95
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,231
Todd gets fussy when she misses

96
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:37,218
his ballet recitals.

97
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:40,805
We'd be happy to help.

98
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:42,808
Oh, that's fantastic.

99
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:45,105
And now, in the spirit of Christmas,

100
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:47,038
get the hell out of my office.
(bell ringing)

101
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,311
RAEL: We might have spent
r entire decorating budget

102
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,517
for the whole year,
but with something that looks

103
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,487
as absolutely fabulous as this,

104
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:56,530
I have to say,
brav-ho-ho-ho.

105
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,940
(bell ringing)

106
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:01,169
Hey, everybody,
listen up. My man,

107
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,610
Rory Flanagan here,
wants to say a few.

108
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,944
Thanks, Finn Hudson.

109
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:06,580
So, guys, my mummy
was going to come visit

110
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:08,907
for the holidays,
but plane tickets are expensive,

111
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,792
so it's my first Christmas
without any family.

112
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,419
I'd like to cheer myself up

113
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,420
by dedicating this song
to them... and to the King.

114
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:16,773
Jesus?

115
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,750
(Elvis Presley's
"Blue Christmas" begins)

116
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:30,688
 I'll have a blue

117
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,445
 Christmas

118
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,111
 Without you

119
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:42,239
 I'll be so blue

120
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:45,039
 Just thinking

121
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,002
 About you

122
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:57,127
 You'll be doing all right

123
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:02,974
 With your Christmas of white

124
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,898
 But I'll

125
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,500
 Have a blue

126
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:12,180
 Blue, blue, blue Christmas

127
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:18,137
 I'll have a blue

128
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:22,410
<i> Christmas  Ooh, ooh </i>

129
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,206
 That's certain

130
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,454
 And when the blue

131
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:35,000
 Heartache stops hurting

132
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,009
<i> Ooh, ooh </i>

133
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:45,096
 You'll be doing all right

134
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:53,744
 With your Christmas of white

135
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:59,699
 But I'll

136
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:03,291
 Have a blue

137
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,707
 Blue

138
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:12,240
 Christmas

139
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,143
<i> Ooh </i>

140
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:19,595
 Ooh...

141
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,690
Gosh, that song was so depressing.

142
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,653
I may actually be dead right now.

143
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,064
I-I think, what Santana
means is, although that...

144
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:31,577
that was mournfully beautiful,

145
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,890
now that the whole glee club
is back together,

146
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,070
I think that we should focus
on the more joyous

147
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:38,244
and the pageant aspect
of this holiday season.

148
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,324
Rachel's right.

149
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,685
Last Christmas was super sad.

150
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:41,829
Kurt was at another school,

151
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:45,108
Coach Sylvester trashed everything,
and Artie got a pair of magic legs

152
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,174
that broke the next day.

153
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,192
We were the island of misfit toys.

154
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:49,695
This year is going to be...

155
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,578
This year, it's a whole new
sprig of mistletoe.

156
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:53,107
Guess who's not getting coal

157
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:56,039
in their stockings
foonce... us.

158
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,240
Rory, have a seat.

159
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,087
just got off the phone
with Don Borowski,

160
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,455
the local station manager
at Lima's PBS affiliate.

161
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,580
Turns out that their annual broadcast

162
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,587
of the Yule log burning
has been canceled.

163
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,588
The hell? Yeah, they can't afford
the licensing fees anymore.

164
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,393
But thank you,
Scrooges who own that copyright,

165
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,639
because Don came to Sectionals,
he loved what we did

166
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,937
and he is offering us...
RACHEL: A Christmas special featuring all of us?

167
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,281
Okay, please say you said yes.

168
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Not only did I say yes,
but when Don said

169
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:20,962
that they were looking
for a director for the special,

170
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:22,775
I nominated you, Artie.

171
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,496
- Me?
- Yeah.

172
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,340
<i>He saw West Side Story,
loved your work,</i>

173
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:27,498
and he wants to take a meeting.

174
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,990
But I...

175
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,660
I swore I would never sell out
and do television.

176
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,807
I'm really going to have
to think about this, Mr. Shue.

177
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,791
(bell ringing)

178
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,390
I'll have to show you my
locker stacking secrets

179
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,006
so that never happens again.

180
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:46,400
Is that your family?

181
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,812
The whole Flanagan clan.
It's hard, isn't it?

182
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,948
Being away from them.

183
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:53,542
It's so hard.

184
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:55,554
It's harder than I ever imagined.

185
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:57,302
I know the feeling.

186
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,395
I'm only a few hours
away from my family,

187
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:00,530
and I miss them like crazy.

188
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:03,044
What are you going to do
for Christmas this year?

189
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:05,392
I'm even not sure.
Brittany and her family

190
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,459
are going on a trip
to see a gay Santa.

191
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:09,259
Something about Santa Fe.

192
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,525
Why don't you spend the
holiday with, uh, my family?

193
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,767
I-I need help staying awake on the
drive, plus, this whole week,

194
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:16,946
I'll be your Christmas sponsor.

195
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,592
Really show you what the holiday
spirit's about in the USA.

196
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:20,866
That'd be so awesome, Sam.

197
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,592
BOROWSKI:
I am absolutely delighted

198
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,500
that our channel's Christmas special

199
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:31,664
is being directed
by a teenage disabled boy.

200
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:34,218
You're like a modern day Tiny Tim.

201
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,386
Oh. I am sorry.

202
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,513
Tiny Tim could walk.

203
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:41,673
In the spirit of Christmas, I'm going

204
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:42,703
to pretend you never said that.

205
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,743
Here's the dealio,
Mr. Borowski.

206
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:46,789
I have two ironclad demands.

207
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:49,566
The first one came to me
last night in a dream.

208
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,057
(growling)

209
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,299
The Wookiee was right.

210
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,931
The best Christmas show of all time is

211
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:58,591
<i>The Star Wars Holiday Special,
shown only once</i>

212
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,079
in 1978, then locked away
in the Lucasfilm vault

213
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,875
like the precious jewel it is.

214
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:04,580
Every fanboy in the galaxy knows

215
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,136
it's completely awesome.

216
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,708
<i>Therefore, Star Wars must be
a part of our Christmas special.</i>

217
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,227
And I also want to shoot
it in black and white.

218
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,644
Black and white?

219
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:15,673
It will be an homage to the
second best special of all time,

220
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,642
the Judy Garland Christmas show.

221
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:20,951
You know, some s Judy was high
on pills and booze, but...

222
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,113
I say she was high
on excitement and Baby Jesus.

223
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:26,756
Kid, you can shoot the thing
in 3-D,

224
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,127
starring a flock of pigeons,

225
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:32,265
as long as you can produce
it for under 800 bucks.

226
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,973
I can do it, sir. I know I can.

227
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:41,550
(Joni Mitchell's "River" begins)

228
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:50,133
 It's coming on Christmas

229
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:52,297
 They're cutting down trees

230
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,777
 They're putting up reindeer

231
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,574
 And singing songs of joy and peace 

232
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:00,318
 Oh, I wish I had a river

233
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:06,628
 I could skate away on

234
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:10,735
 I wish I had a river so long

235
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:13,252
 I would teach my feet

236
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,286
 To fly

237
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,599
 Oh, I wish I had a river

238
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:29,571
 I could skate away on

239
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:34,990
 I made my baby cry

240
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,250
 He tried hard to help me

241
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,258
 You know, he t me at ease

242
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:52,679
 He loved me so naughty

243
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,543
 Made me weak in the knees

244
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,761
 Oh, I wish I had a river

245
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:03,687
 I could skate away on.

246
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,271
(applause)

247
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,863
(whispers):
Yeah.

248
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,370
Rachel, could you come see me?

249
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:22,022
Yes, Artie, of course.

250
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,490
And if this is about my ears,

251
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,381
I know that they're
a little naked right now,

252
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,582
but that's just because I'm
waiting for something special.

253
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:29,806
Something that's really
gonna sparkle and, you know,

254
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,826
catch the light.
So what's up?

255
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,349
It's not about your ears,
it's about your song.

256
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:34,755
It makes me want to kill myself.

257
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:38,331
I'm sorry, Joni Mitchell is
not depressing, she's emotional.

258
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,519
It doesn't fit my vision
for our Christmas spectacular.

259
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,552
And what is that exactly?

260
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,147
We begin in the Swiss Alps,
in the village of Gstaad,

261
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,815
in the perfely-appointed
living room of Kurt Hummel

262
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,481
and Blaine Anderson's
chic swank chalet.

263
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,483
The tree towering and opulent.

264
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,821
The fireplace draped in garlands.

265
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:57,445
The stockings bejeweled.

266
00:12:57,497 --> 00:12:58,779
Kurt and Blaine,

267
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:01,168
the perfect hosts have invited
their friends to drop in

268
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,357
for an evening of Noel
Coward-esque banter

269
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,520
and fun, happy,
cheer-filled songs.

270
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:08,062
Are you telling me I'm not invited
to Kurt and Blaine's for Christmas?

271
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:09,585
Not unless you pick a happier song.

272
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,697
The evenins festivities
conclude with Rory,

273
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,293
dressed as the Christmas elf Itchy,

274
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:14,892
reciting "Frosty
the Snowman."

275
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,336
Start with fun, end with fun.

276
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,425
That's how you do it, kids.

277
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,317
The Frosty story isn't fun.

278
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,275
At the end, he melts and dies.

279
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,526
I'm rebooting Frosty.

280
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,191
In my version, he doesn't melt.

281
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,398
He...

282
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,237
Well, new pages forthcoming.

283
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,663
What's wrong with a story
that's a little sad

284
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,288
or a song that's a little depressing?

285
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,029
I mean, that's part
of Christmas, too, right?

286
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,242
It's the sad things

287
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,861
that make you remember
what's really important.

288
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:43,141
Sorry, Sam, but the phrase is "Merry
Christmas," not "morose Christmas."

289
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:44,457
That's the vision.

290
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:46,005
That's what you have to buy into.

291
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,241
Well, sorry, Artie,
I'm not buying into it.

292
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,918
I'm gonna go downtown, see if I can ring one
of those Salvation Army bells. Come on, Rory.

293
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,278
I'll give you a ride.

294
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,162
I should memorize my part, Sam.

295
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:08,050
(Bell ringing)

296
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,251
Hey.

297
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,583
Bummer about Artie going all
Scrooge on your song.

298
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:13,321
I'm getting a song
in that Christmas special.

299
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:16,075
Christmas is all about giving,
and Artie certainly wouldn't be

300
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,364
in the Christmas spirit if
he didn't let me give my talents

301
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,547
to the people of Western Ohio.

302
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,910
At least, the ones
who don't have cable.

303
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:24,708
Speaking of giving, don't you
think it would be a shame

304
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:27,420
for me to sing on television
for the first time without me

305
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:30,855
sparkling in the glow
of one of your generous gifts?

306
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,630
Oh, you want me to give
you your present early?

307
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,772
I hadn't even thought about
that, but what a sweet idea.

308
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,141
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.

309
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:38,970
All right.

310
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,511
Okay. Usually it comes
in a box, but...

311
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:47,616
Okay.

312
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,215
Where's my bling?

313
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:54,186
Well, that was a little
out of my-my price range,

314
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:57,349
but-but then I saw this commercial for
these African sow pigs you can adopt.

315
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,553
You pay, like, two bucks a
month to fatten them up for

316
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,809
a whole year, and then they feed
a family for, like, a month.

317
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,019
You gave me a dead pig for Christmas?

318
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,835
No, no, it's not dead yet;
you got to get it fat first.

319
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,142
- I'm a vegan.
- Look, I thought

320
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,205
Christmas was about giving, okay?

321
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,616
Which is why I gave you
a super specific list.

322
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:14,470
Look... it's very sweet
that you gave me a pig...

323
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,522
It's an African sow pig.

324
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,717
Whatever it is, I...
I appreciate it.

325
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,096
But I made you a list
so that you wouldn't

326
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:22,084
embarrass yourself like this.

327
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,271
I'm not asking for much.

328
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:26,191
All I want is what's coming to me.

329
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,117
All I want is my fair share.

330
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:30,694
Guess I'll give the sow pig
to my mom or something.

331
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,400
That is such a great idea.

332
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,432
It's gonna be the best Chrtmas ever.

333
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,120

(playing "Extraordinary
Merry Christmas")

335
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:50,887
 He came into my dreams last night 

336
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:54,636
 A great, big man in red and white 

337
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:58,647
 He told me that it's gonna be 

338
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,131
 A special year for you and me 

339
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:05,564
 Underneath the mistletoe

340
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,834
 Hold me tight and kiss me slow 

341
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:12,737
 The snow is high, so come inside 

342
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:17,828
 I want to hear you say to me

343
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:23,339
 It's a very, very,
merry, merry Christmas 

344
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,773
<i> Even better than the one before </i>

345
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:29,676
 Gonna party on
till Santa grants my wishes

<i> Think he's knocking
on my front door </i>

348

 It's who I'm with

349
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:45,351
 It's an extraordinary
merry Christmas 

350
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:51,339
 Won't you meet me
by the tree? 

351
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,678
 Slip away so secretly

352
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:58,710
 Can't you see
how this could be? 

353
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,902
 The greatest gift of all

354
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:06,366
 It's a very, very,

<i> Even better than the one before </i>

Gold! That's what
I'm talking about!

368
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:56,470
I see Cheerios behind you,
kind of a dancing Santa thing.

369
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,006
Just as long as they don't upstage us.

370
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,092
Yeah, as long as they
don't upstage us.

371
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,602
Good.

372
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:05,641
Look at you do-gooders.

373
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,138
Hard at work.

374
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,976
Coach Sylvester, we're in
the middle of rehearsal.

375
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,520
Yeah, and I think it's great
you're working so hard on

376
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:11,447
your performance.
And I'll tell you what.

377
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,472
Everyone at the homeless shelter

378
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:13,821
is really looking forward to the show.

379
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,187
I just wanted to confirm

380
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:17,208
with you, Artie,
that we're on for Friday night.

381
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,788
Oh, Friday.

382
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,070
It's a no-can-do on Friday.

383
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:22,128
We're taping our Christmas special

384
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,325
for the Lima PBS.

385
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:24,657
You told me you were in.

386
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,527
This is a huge opportunity for us.

387
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,292
Can we just do it another night?

388
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:29,596
Homeless will be homeless for a while.

389
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,277
That's sort of the problem.

390
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,329
I promised them.

391
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,875
You don't want to disappoint
these kids.

392
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:37,884
Hmm, like your behavior
has disappointed us for years?

393
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,785
Last Christmas, you cut down our tree,

394
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,911
you stole our presents and you made
Becky dress up like a reindeer.

395
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,666
So you're gonna walk away
from people who have nothing?

396
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,724
No, not at all.
We're just gonna distract them

397
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,237
from their plight
and the smell of urine

398
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,934
and make them happy with
our glamorous Christmas cheer.

399
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,163
The homeless don't have TVs.

400
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,777
So you're all agreed on this?

401
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:57,935
Fine.

402
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,161
Merry Christmas.

403
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,033
Let's take it from the top, guys.

404
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:07,082
And remember, smile.

Welcome to our bachelor chalet.

474
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,800
We've also asked a few

475
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,587
of our other special friends to dp by.

476
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,708
But I hope they can make
it over the mountains

477
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,646
and through the woods
in this dreary weather.

Oh, come on, now, Kurt.
You know if they get stuck in the snow,

479
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,208
they can always hitch
a ride on Santa's sleigh.

00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:55,595
Hey, it's true.

483
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:57,401
Oh! (scoffs)

484
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:59,521
Oh, I'm terribly sorry for keeping yo

485
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:01,150
standing outside,
shivering on the porch.

486
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,327
Please, come in.
Please, come in.

487
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:04,748
Watch your step. Come on now.

488
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,416
Don't be shy.
Please, come, come.

489
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:08,781
Come right on in.
Make yourself at home.

490
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,294
Blaine, please offer our guests
some holiday libations.

491
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,868
I apologize,
but I must check my bid on

492
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:16,916
the Elizabeth Taylor Christie's
jewelry auction online.

493
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,965
(laughter) Kurt.

494
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:22,921
Oh, no!

495
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:24,204
Oh, what happened?

496
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:26,882
Did Mariah outbid you
on that necklace you wanted?

497
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:30,235
That I could take.

498
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,654
The Internet is down because
of this inclement weather.

499
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,924
I didn't get to put my bid in on time.

500
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:36,090
Christmas is canceled!

501
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,702
(doorbell rings)

502
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:40,109
Who could that be?

503
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,815
The door's open.
Come on in.

504
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,343
(applause) Oh, sorry, we're late.

505
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,487
Hope there's still eggnog.

506
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,942
For you two, always.

507
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:49,907
Oh, Kurt, how are you?
You look great.

508
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,269
I love what you've done
with the place.

509
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,421
Just a splash of color.

510
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:54,583
May me take your sweater? Blaine.

511
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:55,753
Oh, forgive me.

512
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:57,617
Everyone, these are
our very good friends,

513
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,588
Rachel Berry, Mercedes Jones.

514
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:00,969
(applause)

515
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:04,618
at's going on, boys?

516
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,006
Well, we're on television.

517
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:08,343
Oh, television?
Us, too?

518
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,336
Hello.

519
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,222
This is for you, Kurt.

520
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:12,924
For me?
May I open it?

521
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,037
Oh, I wish you would.

522
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,444
Oh, my dear.
Oh, what is in here?

523
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:20,668
- Here we go.
- Ooh.

524
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:23,912
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my dears!

525
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,441
How did you know?

526
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:27,660
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you can believe it,

527
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,431
from the Elizabeth Taylor auction,

528
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,103
ladies and gentlemen,
it's Miss Taylor's

529
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,075
diamond and emerald necklace
and pendant.

530
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:33,825
(audience exclaims) Oh!

531
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:34,979
(applause)

532
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,666
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

533
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:39,635
I cannot believe it.

534
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,369
It is truly a Christmas miracle.

535
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,090
Truly a Christmas knockoff.

536
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:44,819
(audience laughter) (gasps)

537
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:46,671
Mercedes, don't give
away all of our secrets.

538
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:48,599
Blaine, this is for you.

539
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,935
Oh, why, thank you so much, Rachel.

540
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,407
It's a bow tie with little
Christmas trees on it.

541
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,768
Oh, would you look at that?

542
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,070
Would you look at that?

543
00:24:57,105 --> 00:24:59,270
(applause)

544
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,213
And there's a little surprise

545
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,685
under the wrapping paper.

546
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:06,656
Why, they're candy cane striped
Capri pants.

547
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:09,200
You know what the best part is?

548
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,735
I actually don't already own a pair.

549
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:12,707
If you can believe that.

550
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:13,755
(laughter)

551
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,011
Oh, jewels and short pants

552
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:17,726
and bow ties and good friends.

553
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,554
Truly, this is an ideal evening.

554
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:21,882
But, Blaine, you know
what's really needed now.

555
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:23,376
Oh, I think I do.

556
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,636
Rachel, Mercedes?

557
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:28,589
Oh, we couldn't possibly.

558
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,393
We're not prepared!

559
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:31,750
Oh, come now.
The piano's just sitting there,

560
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:32,973
its ivories waiting to be tickle

561
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:34,942
Well, there is a little something

562
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,185
that we've been working on.

563
00:25:36,223 --> 00:25:37,396
(applause) I'm in if you are.

564
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:39,866
Well, it is Christmas, after all.

565
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,489
- That's just grand.
- Come on. Let's go.

566
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:44,600
Oh, Kurt, Mercedes, Blaine,
you know, I've realized

567
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,596
that there's some favorite things

568
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:49,138
that can't be bought
line or in a store

569
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,338
or even in a catalog.

570
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:53,492
They're right here
in front of my nose.

571
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:55,240
For instance...

572
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:58,732
Raindrops and roses
and whiskers on kittens

573
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,198
 Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens 

574
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:06,173
 Brown paper packages
tied up with strings 

575
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,735
 These are a few
of my favorite things 

576
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:15,575
 Cream-colored ponies
and crisp apple strudels 

577
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:18,721
 Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with noodles 

578
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:22,061
 Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their wings 

579
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:25,883
 These are a few
of my favorite things 

580
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,218
 Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes 

581
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,717
 Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes 

582
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:37,185
 Silver white winters
that melt into springs 

583
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:40,847
 These are a few
of my favorite things 

584
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:44,280
 When the dog bites,
when the bee stings 

585
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:47,113
 When I'm feeling sad

586
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:50,327
 I simply remember
my favorite things 

587
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:53,962
 And then I don't feel...

588
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:57,452
 So bad

589
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:02,598


590
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:11,078
 Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens 

591
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,417
 Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens 

592
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:17,315
 Brown paper packages
tied up with strings 

593
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:20,616
 These are a few
of my favorite things 

594
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:26,597
 Cream-colored ponies
and crisp apple strudels 

595
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:29,765
 Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with ndles 

596
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:32,914
 Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their wings 

597
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:36,446
 These are a few
of my favorite things 

598
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:42,418
 Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes 

599
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,959
 Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes 

600
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,800
 Silver white winters
that melt into spring 

601
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:52,141
 These are a few
of my favorite things 

602
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:55,625
 When the dog bites,
when the bee stings 

603
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:58,662
 When I'm feeling sad

604
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:02,149
 I simply remember
my favorite things 

605
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,984
 And then I don't feel...

606
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:09,192
 So bad.

607
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,680
(applause)

608
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,546
(indistinct conversation)

609
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,756
Say, when's Christmas dinner?

610
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:26,990
Oh, no, you guys!

611
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:28,659
With all the guests and the songs,

612
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:30,200
I forgot to turn on the oven.

613
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,051
OTHERS:
Kurt!

614
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:33,519
(audience laughter)

615
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,049
Oh, great.

616
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,858
Whatever else could go wrong?

617
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,602
I suppose we'll have to find out...

618
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,010
after these messages
from our sponsors.

619
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:48,674
KURT: And then I said to Justin
Timberlake, "That's not eggnog!"

620
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,806
(laughter)

621
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:54,243
Gee whiz, you guys, it's really
coming down out there.

622
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,544
Blaine is right, you guys.

623
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:57,603
Global climate change
is no laughing matter.

624
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,657
Our overreliance
on fossil fuels is causing

625
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:01,265
erratic weather patterns
like this one.

626
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,787
I think these are the end times.

627
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,571
(laughter)

628
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,852
Well, if there's one thing
we can all agree on

629
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:10,693
is that if it keeps snowing like this,

630
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:13,023
Santa Claus won't be able
to bring us our presents.

631
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,521
(bells jingling in distance)

632
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:17,360
Wait! Did you hear that?

633
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:18,798
Jingle bells?

634
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:20,240
(doorbell rings)

635
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,754
Sorry, guys. Just us.

636
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:26,366
(applause)

637
00:29:26,385 --> 00:29:28,398
Hello.

638
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,704
Oh! How rude of me.

639
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,934
Ladies and gentlemen,

640
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,771
Finn Hudson and Noah Puckerman!

641
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:37,375
(applause)

642
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:39,042
(thud) Ooh!

643
00:29:39,063 --> 00:29:43,482
Say, are you dressed like
Luke Skywalker and Han Solo?

644

(audience laughter)

648
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,113
Hey, guys, why the long faces?

649
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,447
It's Christmas Eve or something.

650
00:29:58,499 --> 00:29:59,662
We thought we heard Santa Claus,

651
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,062
but with the climate change
and end times,

652
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:03,752
we just don't think
Santa Claus is coming to town.

653
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:06,739
Well, that's not what we heard.

654
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,921
 Oh, you better watch out

655
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:16,438
 You better not cry

656
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:20,482
 You better not pout,
I'm telling you why 

657
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,256
 Santa Claus is coming to town 

658
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,065
 Santa Claus is coming to town 

659
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,599
 Santa Claus is coming

660
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:34,773
 To town

661
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:40,413
 He's making a list,
he's checking it twice 

662
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,746
 He'gonna find out
who's naughty or nice 

663
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,160
 Santa Claus is coming to town 

664
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:51,806
 Santa Claus is coming to tow

665
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,252
 Santa Claus is coming

666
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,290
 To town

667
00:30:58,307 --> 00:30:59,484
(tempo increases)

668
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,345
 Oh, you better watch out

669
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,324
 You better not cry

670
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,982
 You better not pout,
I'm telling you why 

671
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:09,971
 Santa Claus is coming to town 

672
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,815
 Santa Clause is coming to town 

673
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:19,170
 Santa Claus is coming to town 

674
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,483
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

675
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:23,283
(harmonica playing)

676
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,998
(applause)

677
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:31,037
 You'd better watch out,
you'd better not cry 

678
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:34,797
 You better not pout,
I'm telling you why 

679
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:37,000
 Santa Claus is coming to town 

680
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:38,346
 Yeah

681
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:41,170
 Santa Clause is coming to town 

682
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:44,550
 Santa Claus is coming to 

683
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:52,482
 Santa Claus is coming
to town. 

684
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:55,853
(song ends, applause)

685
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,288
(quiet chatter)

686
00:31:59,427 --> 00:32:01,006
oorbell rings)

687
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,663
Oh, my stars.
More guests?

688
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:04,872
I hope it's carolers!

689
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:06,825
(laughter)

690
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,215


691
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,253
 "Bah, humbug!"
No, that's too strong 

692
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:23,046
 'Cause it is my favorite holiday 

693
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,567
 But all this year's been
a busy blur 

694
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:27,686
 Don't think
I have the energy to add 

695
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,382
 To my already mad rush

696
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,889
 Just 'cause it's 'tis the season 

697
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,602
 The perfect gift for me would be 

698
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:36,906
 Completions and connections
left from last year 

699
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,080
 Ski shop,
encounter most interesting 

700
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:42,192
 Had his number, but never the time 

701
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,040
 Most of '81 passed
along those lines 

702
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:45,898
 So deck those halls,
trim those trees 

703
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,738
 Raise up cups of Christmas cheer 

704
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:50,500
 I just need to catch my breath 

705
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:52,586
 Christmas by myself this year 

706
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,962
(instrumental interlude)

707
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,939
 Merry Christmas, Merry Christs 

708
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,251
 Couldn't miss this one this year 

709
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,524
 Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 

710
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,481
 Couldn't miss this one this year 

711
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:13,648
 Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 

712
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:15,360
 Couldn't miss this one this year 

713
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,099
 Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 

714
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,903
 Couldn't miss
this one this year. 

715
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:21,947
(applause)

716
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,710
All my Christmas wishes came true.

717
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,495
All except for one.

718
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:28,997
(bell ringing, Rachel gasps)

719
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:31,463
RACHEL; Oh, my goodness, could it be?

720
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:32,799
Could it be?

721
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,140
ALL:
Itchy the Holiday Elf.

722
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,472
We asked our friend Itchy
to stop by and read us

723
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:39,505
a lighthearted, heartwarming,
upbeat, happy Christmas tale,

724
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:40,795
"Frosty the Snowman."

725
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,393
Actually, I was going
to read that, but...

726
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:43,643
I searched my heart,

727
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,030
and I'm going to read one
from a different book.

728
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,386
I think it's something that's
going to remind people

729
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,525
what the true spirit of
Christmas really is.

730
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:53,286
Are you sure you don't
want to read "Frosty"?

731
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:55,621
We all really want
to hear "Frosty."

732
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:57,078
Lights, please.

733
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,732
"And there were in the same country

734
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,851
"shepherds abiding in the field,

735
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:07,065
"keeping watch over
their flock by night.

736
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,395
"And lo, the angel of
the Lord came upon them,

737
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,425
"and the glory of the
Lord "shone around them.

738
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,180
"And the angel said
unto them, 'Fear not.

744

(piano playing "Jingle Bells")

750
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:08,848
What?

751
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:12,953
Everyone's just been telling me you've been having
a rough year, but you seem pretty od to me.

752
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:14,893
I'm better.

753
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,069
Think I was just stuck focusing
on everything I didn't have

754
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:21,879
and none of the stuff that was good.

755
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:23,441
Stuff in the future.

756
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,993
I'm glad you turned it around.

757
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,850
You deserve good things, Quinn.

758
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:32,175
I'm trying.

759
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:33,468
SUE:
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

760
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:35,138
Portion control, Bee Sting.

761
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,670
Come on.

762
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:39,230
Guess you're just not
used to being on this side

763
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:40,652
of the serving line.

764
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:43,211
Seriously though, I don't think we
have enough food for everybody.

765
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:43,893
Yeah.

766
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:47,506
Economy gets bad, people give less.

767
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:48,411
Hey!

768
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:56,565
I know we're late, but we were all
hoping there's still time to help.

769
00:35:56,585 --> 00:35:59,293
We brought the turkey from the
special with all the fixings.

770
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:00,781
Yeah, it's a prop but it's real.

771
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,616
Why don't you put it
on the table over there, kiddo.

772
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:04,757
You guys finally me around.

773
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:06,973
Well, you can thank Rory
for helping us see the light.

774
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:09,449
I was just following
my Christmas sponsor's lead.

775
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:12,665
Would it be weird
if I made myself a plate?

776
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,360
We have a song, too.
We were gonna perform it

777
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,064
as our final number
for our Christmas special,

778
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,714
but we lost the final
ten minutes of airtime

779
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,489
when the station reached
a last-second agreement

780
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,293
with those Yule log people.

781
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:23,645
As long as it's not
"Jingle Bells."

782
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:27,033
It seems it's the only song our janitor knows
how to play, and I'm bleeding from the ears.

783
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,430
If you'd be so kind.

784
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:30,398
- Sure.
- Love your "Jingle Bells" though.

785
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,367
("Dohey Know It's Christmas?"
playing)

786
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:39,324
 It's Christmastime

787
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:42,994
 There's no need to be afraid

788
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,534
 At Christmastime

789
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:51,869
 We let in light
and we banish shade 

790
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:56,209
 And in our world of plenty

791
00:36:56,254 --> 00:37:01,180
 We can spread a smile of joy

792
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:08,672
턧row your arms around
the world at Christmastime 

793
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,017
 But say a prayer

794
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,181
 Pray for the other one

795
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:20,341
 Oh, at Christmastime, it's hard 

796
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:25,035
 But when you're having fun

797
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:29,735
 There's a world
outside your window 

798
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:33,404
 And it's a world of dread and fear 

799
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:37,970
 Where the only water flowing

800
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:41,892
 Is the bitter sting of tears

801
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:47,046
 And the Christmas bells that ring 

802
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,210
 Are the clanging chimes of doom 

803
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,984
 Well, tonight thank God it's them 

804
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:57,260
 Instead of you

805
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:04,573
 And there w't be snow
in Africa this Christmastime 

806
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:07,828
This Christmastime, no 

807
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:13,065
 The greatest gift
they'll get this year is life 

808
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,281
 Is life

809
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,903
 Where nothing ever grows

810
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:19,540
 Nothing ever grows

811
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:24,420
 No rain or rivers flow

812
00:38:24,464 --> 00:38:30,429
 Do they know
it's Christmastime at all? 

813
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,434
 Yeah

814
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:40,803
 Feed the world

815
00:38:40,857 --> 00:38:44,766
 Let them know it's Christmastime 

816
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:48,649
 Feed the world

817
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:52,989
 Let them know it's Christmastime 

818
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,553
 Feed the world

819
00:38:56,572 --> 00:39:00,998
 Let them know it's Christmastime 

820
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:05,308
 Feed the world

821
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:12,062
 Let them know
it's Christmastime again. 

822
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,450
(school bell ringing)

823
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,604
Just the guy I was looking for.

824
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:20,057
Hi.

825
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:23,141
I wanted you to know
that I named my pig.

826
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,701
The African sow pig?

827
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:26,762
Yep. Come here.

828
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:32,632
Her name is Barbra.

829
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,684
(laughs) After my hero.

830
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,951
I mean, I'm assuming
that she's a girl.

831
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:39,884
But I just hope that pig Barbra
inspires all of the children

832
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:42,085
who eat her as much as the
real Barbra inspired me.

833
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:44,123
So it's a kosher sow pig?

834
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:44,602
Yeah.

835
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:49,517
Look, the important thing is, is that I just
want you to know that I'm really sorry.

836
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,780
Okay, I-I love her and I love you, and
that's all that matters to me on Christmas.

837
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:55,453
Okay?

838
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:58,090
Well, I-I'm glad
you like the pig...

839
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:58,639
Barbra.

840
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:01,700
Barbra.
But, uh, then I realized

841
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:03,749
that once they kill and eat Barbra,

842
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:06,401
you're not gonna have anything to
show for this year's Christmas.

843
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:08,558
So I got you something else.

844
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:10,608
You ready?

845
00:40:10,664 --> 00:40:11,385
Yes.

846
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:17,073
It's your own star.

847
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,265
You named a star after me?

848
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,687
Well, no.
I, uh, I thought about that,

849
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,964
but then I named it Finn Hudson.

850
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:28,579
Because there's already
a star named Rachel Berry.

851
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,380
And she's right here on earth and she's
brighter than any of those stars up there.

852
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:35,355
So I just wanted to make sure
that whenever she feels lonely,

853
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:38,396
she can look up in theky,
and no matter where I am,

854
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:40,112
she can know
that I'm looking down on her.

855
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,854
When it's nighttime.

856
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:46,855
I love this.

857
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:48,919
I'm gonna put it up right over here.

858
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:53,823
And, uh, just in case
it's-it's cloudy

859
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:58,207
or, uh, the middle of the
daytime or the star explodes

860
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,712
in some massive supernova...

861
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,332
(chuckles)

862
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,066
these should shine just as bright.

863
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:16,676
- It's too much.
- No, no, it's okay.

864
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:19,507
I-I hawked my letterman jacket
on eBay, so...

865
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:20,087
No, no.

866
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:23,480
It's too much wonderful for one girl.

867
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,520
I mean, I get the-the guy
and the stars and...

868
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,516
The pig.

869
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:32,093
I think it's time
that I start giving back.

870
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:36,022
Come on.

871
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:37,045
Let's go get our coats.

872
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:40,730
(bell ringing)

873
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,965
(bell jingling)

874
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,197
These bells make me homesick.

875
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,170
You mean, like church bells and stuff?

876
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:47,412
No.

877
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:49,346
My brother Shamus gets
lost all the time,

878
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:51,478
so my dad made him wear
a bell around his neck

879
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,625
so we could always find him.

880
00:41:52,649 --> 00:41:54,784
Smart.

881
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:56,156
Merry Christmas.

882
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,327
Sam, I was wondering if maybe

883
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:01,123
you'd like to be my Valentine's
Day sponsor as well.

884
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:04,539
I mean, you did such a good
job being a Christmas sponsor,

885
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:05,789
I figured you'd have no problem

886
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,660
helping me land a snog
or two by February.

887
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,378
Deal. But you have to help me

888
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,015
learn to perfect my Sean Connery.

889
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,804
I'm telling you,
impressions are the best way

890
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,053
to get a chick.

891
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,167
(grunts)

892
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,928
Whoa!
(laughs)

893
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:18,697
So how's business, guys?

894
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:20,845
Uh, a little slow.

895
00:42:21,056 --> 00:42:22,270
But the revival house
across the street

896
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:23,436
<i>is showing It's a Wonderful Life,</i>

897
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:25,253
so pretty sure we'll clean up
when it gets out.

898
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,619
Well, just in case, we wanted to make

899
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,436
our own little contribution
to the cause.

900
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:31,605
Sure you want to do this, Rachel?

901
00:42:31,744 --> 00:42:33,871
Yes. I already got
my Christmas present.

902
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,343
All right, guys.

903
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,188
Whoa, did you guys knock off
a liquor store or something?

904
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:40,468
(laughs)

905
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:43,437
No, we just finally realized
what really matters.

906
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:46,069
Yeah, we returned the earrings
that Finn got me for Christmas

907
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,690
and the iPod that I bought him.

908
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,908
We decided we wanted to do

909
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,412
something special this year
for Christmas.

910
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:54,034
We've got a couple of extra
bells if you want to join in.

911
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:57,037
We'd love to.

912
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,034
(bells jingling)

913
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:04,209
Best Christmas ever.

914
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:07,071
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

915
00:43:07,263 --> 00:43:08,092
Happy Hanukkah.

916
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,178
(imitating Sean Connery):
Happy holidays.

917
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,181
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
