1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:02,478
<i>So, Here is what you missed on
Glee: Quinn's got a new look,</i>

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,096
<i>and a new crowd of Skanks.
Kurt got Blaine to join</i>

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,431
<i>the New Directions, which is
good, because Santana got</i>

4
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,517
<i>kicked out, and Sugar Motta
wasn't good enough to get in.
Who cares what you think?</i>

5
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:10,235
<i>McKinley's doing West Side
Story, and Kurt and Rachel</i>

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,687
<i>need the leads
so they can get into NYADA.</i>

7
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:13,155
<i>Sue's using her
run for Congress</i>

8
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,523
<i>to come after the arts.
Believe it or not,</i>

9
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:15,991
<i>still not
a big fan of the Glee Club.</i>

10
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,693
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,329
(school bell ringing)

12
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,470
I really like your outfit.

13
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:30,205
And I think you're,
like, fabulous,

14
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,807
and I just love
everything that you do.

15
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:33,809
Why, thank you, Brit.

16
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:35,877
Okay, I really want to run
your campaign for president.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,648
Out of all the kids at the
school, I think that you

18
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:40,932
are the biggest unicorn.
I'm sorry?

19
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:43,318
Well, when a pony does
a good deed, he gets a horn,

20
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,987
and he, he becomes a unicorn,
and he poops out cotton candy,

21
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,056
until he forgets he's magical.

22
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,442
And then his horn falls off.

23
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:52,160
And black unicorns,
they becomes zebras.

24
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:54,696
Oh, that's... that's
a terrifying story.

25
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:55,780
No, it's not.

26
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,282
No, okay. No.

27
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,734
The point is, is that...

28
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:02,403
a unicorn is sebody who
knows they're magical,

29
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,089
and isn't afraid to show it.

30
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:05,457
You went through
hell last year,

31
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,293
and you never forgot
how special you were.

32
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,962
And I've slept with a lot of
people, and am really popular,

33
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,081
so I think I could
get you mega votes.

34
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,883
Then why don't
you just run?

35
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,417
I'm not smart enough.

36
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,220
What's the capital of Ohio?

37
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,971
Brittany.
O.

38
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:21,256
MRS. HAGBERG:
What?

39
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,557
Do you even know who
the president is?

40
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,109
Will.i.am.

41
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:25,894
(laughing)

42
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:29,264
Well, Brit, I have to say
that I'm, I'm flattered.

43
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,766
And really excited.

44
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,702
Cool. Okay, I'll come
over after school,

45
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,103
and we'll work on
your campaign posters.

46
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,655
I got a lot of great ideas.

47
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,439
Great. Great, uh...
I'll see you then.

48
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:39,508
Sweet.

49
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,839

50
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,579
(school bell ringing)
All right, New Directions!

51
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,165
Big news. As you all know,

52
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,117
Vocal Adrenaline came in
second last year at Nationals.

53
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:50,835
The only good thing to come
out of that lost weekend.

54
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:53,889
Besides us getting
back together.

55
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,623
Well, the boosters at Carmel

56
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:57,309
don't donate tens of
thousands of dollars

57
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,643
every year to come in second.

58
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:01,179
So they fired Dustin Goolsby--
So handsome.

59
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:03,565
and they're having trouble
finding a new coach.

60
00:02:03,632 --> 00:02:05,267
Seems that no one wants to
take on that pressure cooker.

61
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:06,768
That means they're vulnerable.

62
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,187
Yes. And if we work hard
enough, we can beat them.

63
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:11,106
Which is why I've
realized that, um...

64
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:13,474
I can't direct the
musical this year.

65
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,493
But, Mr. Shue, you can't
cancel the musical.

66
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:16,978
My New York dreams
depend on it.

67
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm not cancelling it,
I'm just not directing it.

68
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,448
My sole focus has
to be in here.

69
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,367
Nationals,
Nationals, Nationals.

70
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,169
And it's not just me
that's going to have to

71
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,204
focus harder this year.
I've been too easy on you.

72
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:28,656
So every day
after choir practice

73
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,344
I'm instituting a mandatory
"Booty Camp,"

74
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:34,296
so that we can work
on our dancing.

75
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,331
Now, it's not for all of you--
just the people that

76
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,166
I think need help. Like...

77
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,834
Finn.
How did you know?

78
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:42,053
And Puckerman, Hummel.
I must protest.

79
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:44,306
You kind of have one move, Kurt.
It's like this...

80
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:46,524
sashay,
and it's super distracting.

81
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,643
Jones.
What?

82
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,680
Hell to the nizzy-no.
You told me once
you were Beyonce.

83
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:54,649
You don't think she spends
extra time in the dance studio?

84
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,735
Mike Chang has offered
to be my assistant.

85
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,455
And we start tomorrow and yes,
Puckerman, it is mandatory.

86
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:03,358
Mr. Schuester, would you mind if
I dropped by for a little bit?

87
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,460
I really need to catch
up with you guys.
RACHEL:
Okay, Mr. Shue, I'm glad

88
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:07,028
that you're so concerned with
our special needs members,

89
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,331
but what about me? Okay? Who's
going to direct the musical?

90
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:12,167
Ladies and gentleman--
your co-musical directors,

91
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:13,969
Ms. Pillsbury and
Coach Beiste.

92
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:17,138
Now, Ms. Pillsbury did such
a good job helping me out

93
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,590
with Rocky Horror
last year that

94
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,008
I knew she could
handle the job.

95
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,010
And I'm here to keep the
football guys in line.

96
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,179
I've also talked them
into playing the "Jets."

97
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,847
Mr. Shue, with all due
respect to Ms. Pillsbury

98
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,149
and Coach Beiste, this is crazy.
They have absolutely

99
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,885
zero experience in
directing a musical.
Not true.

100
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,821
<i>In college, I was in
A Funny Thing Happened</i>

101
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,722
<i>on the Way to the Forum.
I played the Forum.</i>

102
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:36,191
The teachers at this school

103
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,558
are already overworked and

104
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,394
unfortunately a lot of them
agree with Sue that

105
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,363
the arts are a waste of time.

106
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,748
Besides, they are going
to have some help.

107
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,785
I've decided to include a
student director this year.

108
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:48,736
Mr. Shue, I'm honored,
but Barbra was 40

109
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,339
<i>when she directed herself
in Yentl, so it's just,</i>

110
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:52,957
it's too soon.
I hate you.

111
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,543
I was actually hoping that
Artie would take the job.

112
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:57,095
Me?

113
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:00,015
I've developed my whole persona
around conflict avoidance.

114
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,182
Come on, Artie,
you've made short films,

115
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,934
directing is your dream.
You can do it.

116
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,773
I'm in.

117
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:10,591
(cheering, clapping)
All right.

118
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,728
(school bell ringing)

119
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,989
You still make
a mean cup of coffee?

120
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,659
Shelby.

121
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,244
What are you--
what are you doing here?

122
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,445
It's the teachers'
lounge, isn't it?

123
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,549
It's where all the
teachers hang out.

124
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,384
Yeah...

125
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,420
I'm a teacher here now.

126
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,921
Well, part-time.

127
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:41,956
You ever hear of this
guy named Al Motta?

128
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,459
Mr. Motta, just so I'm clear,

129
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,010
in exchange for this
very generous donation

130
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,813
all I have to do is hire Ms.
Corcoran to start a second

131
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:51,099
show choir at McKinley which
features your daughter?

132
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,735
For which I will cover
any and all expenses.

133
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:57,355
My Sugar's
a Super Nova, Figgy.

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,524
You have a deal.
Mrs. Denny-Brown!

135
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:02,277
Mr. Motta has just ended
our toilet paper shortage

136
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:03,978
with this enormous check!

137
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,530
Wipe away!

138
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:08,583
They actually sent a headhunter
to track me down in New York.

139
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,321
Apparently I am the best show
choir director money can buy.

140
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:17,008
Don't worry, I'm not going
to poach any of your kids.

141
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,210
I'm less worried about that
than about the fact that

142
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:22,663
you being here is going to
be really hard on Rachel.

143
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:23,664
I appreciate that.

144
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,850
I plan on reaching out to her.

145
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:29,471
What about Puck and Quinn?

146
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:31,639
Lima's where I made
a series of mistakes

147
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,391
that defined me
for 16 years.

148
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:35,727
Lima's where I... I have to
make things right again.

149
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,064
I know that seems impossible,
but I have to try.

150
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,734
Okay.

151
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:44,202
I will take you at your word.

152
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:47,038
But as for your
little Glee Club...

153
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,125
...the more arts at this
school the better.

154
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:53,861
So, may the best
Glee Club win.

155
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,549
We will.

156
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:05,056
Give us your lunch money.

157
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:07,041
We're hungry. We need
something to barf back up.

158
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,593
Don't test me.

159
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:12,063
I was a foster kid, which means
I'm used to stabbing people.

160
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,050
You're so mean...

161
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,553
That's right. It's what
passed for love in my house.

162
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:28,112
Skanks, I've got to
talk to that lady alone.

163
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:34,085
First of all, smoking kills.

164
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,904
Second, it really does make
you look cooler, doesn't it?

165
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:39,257
Sorry, Coach,

166
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:40,908
but you have no
power over me anymore,

167
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,877
'cause I've got
nothing left to lose.

168
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,548
Oh, Q, I look at you
and I'm stunned.

169
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,434
You've never looked worse.

170
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,136
You've lost your child,
your boyfriend, your rep,

171
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,939
and worse, your high pony.
You know who I blame?

172
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:56,924
The Glee Club.

173
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,226
You know, when you
were in my grasp,

174
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,594
you were at the
top of the pyramid.

175
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:02,313
But then you joined the
Glee Club, and became lost,

176
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,566
forced to sway
in the background.

177
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:07,368
Will Schuester never did
appreciate the gentle tremble

178
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,786
of your thin,
forgettable alto.

179
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,538
Thanks.

180
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:12,773
What if I were to
offer you the chance

181
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:15,376
to get revenge on the Glee
Club and become a star?

182
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:18,213
My Congressional campaign
is producing a video:

183
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,083
a day in the life of a girl from
whom the arts stole everything.

184
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:25,620
And I think I've found my girl.

185
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,340
First, a few demands.

186
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,460
I need thrift store couches
under the bleachers.

187
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,811
I've realized that
after smoking all day,

188
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:34,929
it hurts to stand.

189
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,147
Fair enough.

190
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:38,132
Quinn Fabray,
you have a deal.

191
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,991
Okay. We're going to make
100,000 copies

192
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,077
of each poster.
And then...

193
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,579
We'll ve each student
a swag bag full of this:

194
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:55,950
We're going to call it "Kurt
Hummel's Bulging Pink Fun Sack."

195
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,705
Well, I... you know,
I don't know what to say.

196
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,340
That happens to me all the time.

197
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,709
My lips move, but
only dust comes out.

198
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:07,378
You know, I appreciate
the enthusiasm.

199
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:10,098
But... you know,
it's just all wrong.

200
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,216
I think it's just,
you know, a tad too...

201
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,885
Unicorn?
Gay.

202
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,770
I feel like I might
as well have a big

203
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:17,889
neon sign above my head
that says, you know,

204
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,108
"GAY-DIDDY-GAY, GAY
GAY-GAY-GAY!"
I mean, you'll
need a long extension cord,

205
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,893
but I love it.
I'm joking.

206
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:24,178
Well, next time
you make a joke,

207
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,180
nudge me in the ribs or, like,
honk a horn or something.

208
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:28,700
Look, I don't just want
to be known as, you know,

209
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,702
"Kurt Hummel, Homo."

210
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,019
What's wrong with that?

211
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,039
Look, 99% of
the kids at the school

212
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,374
are either freaks,
or closet freaks.

213
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,544
The captain of the football
squad, he gets the job,

214
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:40,745
but he doesn't
represent the people.

215
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:42,196
That's why we
need a unicorn.

216
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,198
And I agree with the sentiment,

217
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:46,584
I just want something,
you know, toned down a tad.

218
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,053
I came up with a
campaign poster, too.

219
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,421
Okay?
Okay.

220
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,210
Ta-da! Hmm?

221
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,045
It's understated,
yet elegant.

222
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:01,399
Inspired, of course, by the
classic Blackglama fur coat ads.

223
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:03,685
Rumor has it that
Judy Garland--

224
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,770
down on her luck and
thin as a baby bird--

225
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:09,273
stole her Blackglama mink coat
after her photo shoot.

226
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,326
And it wasn't
even lined yet.

227
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,028
You should tell that story
during your campaign speech.

228
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,080
It's like... so unicorn.

229
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,734
I don't have time for this.

230
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:21,169
Gotta meet the
Skanks on the roof.

231
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,339
Gonna throw ketchup-covered
tampons at the marching band.

232
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,964
You're back.
Yeah, I went to New York.

233
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,266
Thought I'd do it all,
the whole working mother thing.

234
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:39,771
But when I was in rehearsal,
even... even performing,

235
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,106
I couldn't stop
thinking about Beth.

236
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:45,560
How I could miss her
milestones, you know?

237
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:48,279
Her first steps,
first words...

238
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:49,981
first arabesque.
I get it.

239
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:56,070
So when I got this job offer,
I couldn't refuse.

240
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,772
I've missed so many
firsts in Rachel's life.

241
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,490
I was not about to
do that with Beth.

242
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,792
Neat story,

243
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,877
but I'm late for
a meeting on the roof.

244
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,579
Quinn, just listen to her.
Hey. Look.

245
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,465
Since the day that I gave
Rachel up for adoption,

246
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,250
I have been walking through life

247
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,003
searching for her face
everywhere I go.

248
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,889
Imagining what she's doing,
what she may be like...

249
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:16,974
I don't want you to go
through what I went through.

250
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,177
Part of me is-is
back here because...

251
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,812
because I want you
to get to know Beth.

252
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,064
I want you to be
a part of her life.

253
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,367
When do I get to see her?

254
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:28,803
Are you okay?
What's going on with you?

255
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,188
Are you even in Glee anymore?

256
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:31,489
Did you come here
just to torment me

257
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:32,857
with the idea of
seeing my child?

258
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,943
Look. I want you to be
a part of Beth's life.

259
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,995
But not like this.

260
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,914
If you're really
serious about Beth,

261
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:42,533
clean up your act.
You think you can
tell me what to do?

262
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,535
Just cause you signed
a couple of papers?

263
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,671
You're not her mom!
I'm her mom!

264
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:47,988
Quinn...
Me! So...

265
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,325
You can pretend
all you want,

266
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:54,558
but that is something you
are never going to be.

267
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:01,927
+

268
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,344
MERCEDES: Listen, Mr. Shue,
I'm all for participating,

269
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:15,012
but Shay says I'm more
of a park and bark

270
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:16,547
and I tend to agree.

271
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:17,848
A what and what?

272
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:19,967
Park and bark--
I stand center stage

273
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,518
singing the notes
no one else can

274
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:23,170
while all of you guys
dance around me.

275
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,389
Booty Camp is about
all of you dancing, Mercedes.

276
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:26,523
In unison.

277
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:27,941
I mean, look at
Vocal Adrenaline.

278
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:30,110
When they're in synch--
one big terrifying machine,

279
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,196
they're unstoppable.

280
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,281
Mike, do your thing.
Let's go.

281
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,817
The jazz square, the grapevine,
step-touch,

282
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:39,403
the kick ball change,
and pivot.

283
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:42,156
We perfect these basics,
we'll win Nationals.

284
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,540
Grapevine to
the right.

285
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,825
Five, six, seven, eight.

286
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:46,526
Keep it going.

287
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:48,712
I-- am-- in-- hell.

288
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,497
I'm going to put
my light under a bushel,

289
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:52,249
if only to shine brighter
for the auditions tomorrow.

290
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,468
BLAINE:
I'm still trying to decide

291
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,919
between "Maria"
and "Something's Coming."

292
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,705
Those are Tony songs. Are you
auditioning for Tony, too?

293
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:00,891
Would that be weird?
No, no, not at all.

294
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,375
You'd be a great Tony.

295
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,344
Be the perfect Tony actually,
in some respects.

296
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:07,264
MIKE: Finn, you look like
you're stepping on bees.

297
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:08,399
Come on,
Mercedes, blend.

298
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:11,402
Well, except I'm a junior.

299
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:13,153
Tony's the lead.

300
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:15,489
Which means that a senior should
probably play that part.

301
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,825
Yeah, that is kind
of how it works, huh?

302
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,576
I'd be fine with Bernardo
or Officer Krupke.

303
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:21,995
as long as it was
opposite your Tony.

304
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:23,914
Kurt, jazz hands.
Fine.

305
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,734
(bell ringing)

306
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:31,338
(singing scales)
# La-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah # 

307
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:33,707
(singing higher scale)
# La-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah # 

308
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:34,758
♪ La-ah... ♪ 

309
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:39,596
Your range is better.

310
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:41,765
It was impressive
a year and a half ago,

311
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,767
but it's even
better now.

312
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,686
This is a private rehearsal.

313
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,188
What song are you
auditioning with?

314
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,390
That's none of your business,
okay? If you've come here

315
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,976
to ask me to join your little
group, the answer is no.

316
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,561
My loyalty is
to the New Directions.

317
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:56,029
They're my family,

318
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:58,615
and family means something--
at least to me.

319
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,985
Rachel, like we talked
about before I'm your
birth mother.

320
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,603
Yeah, but not my mother.
I know, okay?

321
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:05,438
I almost had to go to
therapy because of you.
Rachel...

322
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,041
Look, I-I'll be polite, okay?
Don't worry, if I see you

323
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,610
in the halls Il make
eye contact and I'll nod.

324
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,546
Now if you'll excuse me,

325
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,915
I have to get back
to my rehearsal.

326
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,418
"Somewhere
there's a place for us."

327
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,839
I just said that there wasn't.
I'm talking about the song.

328
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,290
I played Maria 18 times.

329
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:24,925
"Somewhere" is the perfect
audition song for you.

330
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:25,976
You should do it.

331
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,797
Well, I was considering it.

332
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:33,016
But it's a very
challenging song so...

333
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:35,068
I was just going to do
"I Feel Pretty,"

334
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,687
which I'm actually
amazing at.

335
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:38,939
You will never become
a star or get the lead

336
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,657
if you play it safe.

337
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:45,045
Try it.

338
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,336

Awesome.
(applause continues)

363
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:37,817
(chuckles)

364
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:39,870
(film projector clicking)

365
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,922
<i>SUE:
Quinn Fabray used to be
on top of the world.</i>

366
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:43,874
<i>She had it all.</i>

367
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,995
<i>But now she walks the hallways
of McKinley High broken, alone.</i>

368
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:51,965
<i>What happened, Quinn Fabray?</i>

369
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:54,434
I got involved in the arts.

370
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:58,505
SUE: And now after a long
day of snorting Splenda
and cutting class,

371
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:01,775
she kills the pain the
only way she knows how--

372
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:04,277
smoking corn starch.

373
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,646
Wait, what?

374
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:09,483
Cut. The dummy could not
remember her lines, Coach.

375
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,619
Now remember, just like
we rehearsed it.

376
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:15,489
Mr. Schuester, I came here to
give you a piece of my mind.

377
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,873
What's going on here?

378
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,208
Rolling.
I used to have everything.

379
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,327
Dated the quarterback
of the football team,

380
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:22,496
was the captain of the Cheerios!

381
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:24,464
I was the prettiest, most
popular girl at this school

382
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:26,833
until I joined Glee Club,
and then it all went to hell.

383
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:30,137
SUE:
This is campaign dynamite.
I just want you to know

384
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:34,424
that I am never coming back
to Glee Club-- ever.

385
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,709
Do you understand?
I hope you're happy.

386
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,011
Ms. Fabray,

387
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,763
wait.

388
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,714
You know, there's only one
person in this world

389
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,150
that you care about
and that's yourself.

390
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:44,935
You have no idea...
I'm not finished!

391
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,070
Whoa.
You're not a little girl
anymore, Quinn.

392
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:49,740
How long do you plan
on playing the victim card?

393
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:52,192
Since day one, you've done
nothing but sabotage

394
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:55,612
the same Glee Club that
has been there for you
over and over again.

395
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,998
When you got pregnant,
when your parents
kicked you out,

396
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:59,783
Mercedes even let
you live at her house.

397
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,285
And I don't recall ever hearing
so much as a thank you.

398
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,422
So now you're a train wreck.
Well, congratulations.

399
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:08,908
But you stride into my office
and tell me that it's my fault?

400
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,178
Well, then,

401
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,096
I have something
to say to you.

402
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,681
Grow up.

403
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,419
Would you turn that thing off?

404
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,438
And... cut.

405
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,273
Fantastic. I got...

406
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:25,225
Oh, no, damn it.

407
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,694
My finger was over the thingie.
I didn't get any of that.

408
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,595
Come on, Becky.

409
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:29,813
That was really sexy.

410
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,284
(doorbell ringing)

411
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:46,913
(doorbell ringing)

412
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,721
Hey.

413
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,474
I hope it's okay that
I just stopped by.

414
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:00,093
How do you know
where I live?

415
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:04,797
Um, I have friends
in law enforcement.

416
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,967
Noah, I told you, I want you
to be a part of Beth's life,

417
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,821
but on my terms. You can't
just barge in on me like this.

418
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:12,155
Here's a drug test.

419
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,241
See? Totally clean.

420
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,110
I also haven't had
a drink since we
talked-- besides beer.

421
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,913
I even did some homework.
Turns out Napoleon,

422
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,315
not just a dessert--
he was a real dude.

423
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:23,667
Well, that is great.

424
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:26,986
I'm-- honestly I'm
truly impressed.

425
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,207
But having a relationship
with a child isn't about
little bursts of energy.

426
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,175
This is a long-term commitment.

427
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
(Beth crying)

428
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:34,845
Crap, she's awake.

429
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,213
Hi, sweetie.

430
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:38,348
Come here.

431
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:41,718
Oh, that's it.
(sighs)

432
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:45,305
Okay. It's okay.

433
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,907
It's okay.

434
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,062
My God, she
looks like Quinn.

435
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,864
And you.

436
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,699
She has that same
dopey smile.

437
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,734
Can you say hi?

438
00:19:57,818 --> 00:19:59,486
(laughing)

439
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,821
I was happy, you know,

440
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,991
that she was with you,
and it made it easier.

441
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,576
I drew her a picture.

442
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,714
It was supposed to be a clown,

443
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,666
but it kind of turned out
like a pig,

444
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:14,668
so I call it
a clown pig.

445
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,336
It's kind of my own
made-up animal.

446
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,037
Look what he drew us.
Huh?

447
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,206
Thought it might
make her think of me.

448
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:21,675
(chuckles)

449
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,543
You don't think it will
scare her, do you?

450
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:25,395
No. She'll be okay.

451
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,147
She's tough.

452
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,684
Do you want to hold her?

453
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:36,022
Can he hold you?

454
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,224
If he takes your blankie,
can he hold you?

455
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,993
I don't want
to freak her out.

456
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,395
We'll work up to it.

457
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:44,397
I'll do anything--

458
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:48,668
anything to prove to you
that I can be in her life.

459
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:51,004
Please just give
me that chance.

460
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:56,740
+

461
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,752
Here you go, buddy.

462
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,387
Thanks, Coach.

463
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,172
She's like my own
private Jim Henson.

464
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:05,340
Next.

465
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:08,793
Hello. I'm Kurt Hummel.

466
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,846
And I'll be auditioning
for the role of Tony.

467
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,980
The male lead.

468
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:13,315
That's great, Kurt.

469
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,851
I'll be performing the seminal,
and in my case,

Isn't that a Streisand song?

473
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,191
I know what you're thinking,
but I got written permission

from the woman herself.
Ms. Rachel Berry.

475

Cassius from my dad's tire shop

Really, skank?
You can't be in here.

534
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:39,521
It's the girls' bathroom.

535
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,940
I'm always here;
the stalls are cleaner.

536
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:45,193
Hey, you need to lose the
skank act and get it together.

537
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:46,844
Look, everyone needs
to leave me alone,

538
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,363
because this is who I am.

539
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,031
You look like a Real
Housewife of Reno.

540
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:52,117
I saw Beth.

541
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,851
So?

542
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:54,852
She's perfect.

543
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:57,188
She looks
just like you.

544
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,239
Well, the old you.

545
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:59,741
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

546
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:01,376
We're not parent material.

547
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,694
We can be.

548
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:04,028
We're never
going to be together.

549
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,081
I don't care about
you, I care about her.

550
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:08,166
I don't want her having
questions or being messed up.

551
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:09,968
She needs you
in her life.

552
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,305
(school bell ringing)

553
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:14,673
Okay, Marias.

554
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,224
For me,
it's Rachel Berry.

555
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:17,926
I'm just a huge fan.

556
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,145
She's got the eye of the tiger,
which I like.

557
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:21,813
She's Jewish,
but I think that helps

558
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,481
with the whole
Puerto Rican thing.

559
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:25,100
But we do have Mercedes
Jones coming in.

560
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:27,435
For my money, she has the most
soulful voice here at McKinley.

561
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,221
Yeah, she's not white, either,
which I like for Maria.

562
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:32,073
So we'll keep an open mind.

563
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:34,025
Okey-doke.

564
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,076
Um, Kurt Hummel
for Tony.

565
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:36,328
I mean, let's
talk about

566
00:25:36,395 --> 00:25:37,996
star quality, shall we?
Kurt was awesome.

567
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:39,664
No question.

568
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:42,367
He owned that song like
it was his prison bitch.

569
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:45,570
My thing is, Tony's supposed
to be from the streets.

570
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:46,904
He's the leader
of the Jets,

571
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:48,673
an alpha gang member.

572
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:51,126
I look at Kurt,
and I don't believe it.

573
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,012
EMMA:
Well, respectfully, Coach,
Tony's retired from the Jets.

574
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,513
He's a poet of
the urban jungle.

575
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,933
There is a delicate
wholesomeness to Kurt

576
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:01,636
that's unexpected, but
not unwelcome, for Tony.

577
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,438
I mean, if I were Maria,
I'd love to be held

578
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,457
in Kurt's toothpick
arms on my fire escape.

579
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,108
BEISTE:
Listen, I
love the kid,

580
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:10,094
but I want a Tony
that excites my lady parts.

581
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:13,064
Hummel's too much of a lady.

582
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:14,199
EMMA:
Well, Artie, you
know him best.

583
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,900
Could Kurt, you
know, could he pass?

584
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,101
ARTIE:
I'm a firm believer

585
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:19,621
in color-blind,
non-traditional casting.

586
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,873
For instance, I hope
to play Porgy one day.

587
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,875
And we should definitely
see who else comes in.

588
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,478
But, yeah, I'm a
little worried that

589
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:29,881
Kurt may be a little
delicate for Tony.

This is not the poster

The poster that you wanted
gave me crippling depression.

595
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,824
I wanted something toned down!

596
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:04,742
This is toned down.

597
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:05,659
In the original,

598
00:27:05,744 --> 00:27:06,910
the unicorn was riding you.

I don't know why
you're so upset.

You're special; you
need to embrace it.

This is who you are.
I'm not gonna win.

602
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,801
Rachel, Rachel!
I need you.

603
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,803
I need you to come with me
to the auditorium right now

604
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,137
and help me audition
for Tony again.

605

Last-minute emergency
audition? Say no more.

606
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:20,341
And stop putting
up those posters!

607
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:25,962
I failed my precious unicorn.

608
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:27,398
No.

Really?

Completely. And if
he doesn't get it,

612
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:35,639
then he doesn't deserve to have
you as his campaign manager.

613
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,658
There's no one like you.

614

You're a genius, Brittany.

615

You are the unicorn.

Are we seeing more
ethnic Marias today?

I thought you two
auditioned already.

You heard me sing,
but I wanted to show you

623
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:04,017
the pure masculine power and
intensity I would bring to Tony

624

you graced me with the part.

Sorry. Sorry.

627
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,676
I've asked your
obvious Maria-elect

628
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:14,228
to do a cold reading
with me,

629
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:15,946
<i>not from West Side Story,</i>

630
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:18,031
but from the play
it's originally based on,

631
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:20,234
<i>William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet.</i>

632
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:22,352
And might I just add that I only
read through the scene once

633
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:23,537
ten minutes ago
and I'm already off book.

634
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,289
So you're playing Romeo, Kurt?

635
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:27,357
Picture, if you will,

636
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,376
Juliet's boudoir.

637
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:30,377
Post coitus.

638
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:36,633
Wilt thou be gone?

639
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:37,918
It is not yet
near day.

640
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:39,720
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

641
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:42,172
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

642
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,708
Nightly she sings on
yon pomegranate tree.

643
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,895
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.

644
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,181
'Tis the lark, the herald
of the morn, no nightingale.

645
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:53,684
Look, love,
what envious streaks do lace

646
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:56,219
the severing clouds
in yonder east.

647
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:59,222
Night candles are burnt out,
and jocund day stands tiptoe

648
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:01,191
on the misty mountain tops.

649
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:03,560
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.

650
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:05,696
RACHEL:
Thou light is not daylight,
I know it, I.

651
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:07,164
It is some meteor

652
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:09,900
that the sun exhal'd, to
be to thee a torch bearer,

653
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:12,286
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

654
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,906
Therefore stay yet;
thou need'st not be gone.

655
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:18,292
Let me be ta'en, let
me be put to death;

656
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:20,093
for I am content,
thou wilt have it so.

657
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:22,078
I'll say

658
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,414
that yon grey is not
the morning eye.

659
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,850
'Tis but the pale reflex
of Cynthia's brow...

660
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:27,434
(laughs)

661
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:33,190
Nor-Nor that is
not the lark,

662
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:36,026
whose notes do beat the vaulty
heaven so high above our heads.

663
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:38,094
I have more care to stay
than will to go:

664
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,980
home, death, welcome!

665
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:41,431
For Juliet wills it so...

666
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,450
(snickers)

667
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:45,235
(laughter)

668
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:47,037
No, it's-- kiss me.
It's fine, you can kiss me.

669
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:48,622
I don't...
We can keep going.

670
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:49,656
Kurt.

671
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:52,159
Kurt, I'm so sorry. Kurt.

672
00:29:57,949 --> 00:29:59,166
(clears throat)

673
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,302
(school bell ringing)

674
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:05,138
SUGAR (off-key):
# I am a shining star # 

675
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:09,960
♪ I am a shining star,
I am a shining... ♪ 

676
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:12,062
Okay, stop, stop. Stop!

677
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:15,232
(in tune): # I am a shining
star, I am a shining star # 

678
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,650
Do you hear the difference?

679
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:17,901
Yeah, I sound good.

680
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:18,802
You know,

681
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:20,437
why don't you take the day off?

682
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:22,773
<i>I need to catch up on
My Strange Addiction episodes,</i>

683
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:24,608
and you kind of have this
irritating nasally quality

684
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,577
that I can only take so much of.

685
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:28,028
Sorry, Asperger's.

686
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:29,997
(squeals)

687
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:35,419
She's hopeless, you know.

688
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:36,420
Nobody's hopeless.

689
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,372
What happened to you, Quinn?

690
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:39,840
Sorry.

691
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:41,091
I know what happened to you.

692
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:42,209
Same thing happened to me

693
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:43,293
when I gave up Rachel.

694
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,545
I went with
a Regis Philbin tattoo

695
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:46,263
and the Sinead O'Connor
haircut.

696
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,632
Must have looked like crap.

697
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,183
It was a disaster.

698
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:52,519
(laughs)

699
00:30:52,604 --> 00:30:54,221
But eventually,
I realized

700
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:56,306
that no matter
how much it hurt me...

701
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:58,141
(sighs softly)

702
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,727
I did right by my daughter.

703
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:03,397
That's the real measure
of motherhood:

704
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:06,400
how much of yourself
will you give up for them?

705
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:08,018
King Solomon and all that.

706
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:09,820
Yeah, well, I'm not going back
to being that girl.

707
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:11,538
Little miss
blonde perfect.

708
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:12,956
Quinn...
(chuckles)

709
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:15,042
were you ever really that girl?

710
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,627
I mean,
would that kind of girl

711
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:18,194
even get pregnant
in the first place?

712
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:20,964
Do you seriously expect me to
think that this is the real you?

713
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:22,499
Yeah.

714
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,500
Yeah, sure.

715
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:25,052
Something like this.

716
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:26,503
You're 18.
You're graduating high school.

717
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,721
This is the time,

718
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:30,257
this is the time
when you should find yourself.

719
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:33,010
First step
to becoming an adult:

720
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:34,561
stop punishing yourself

721
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:36,430
for things you did
when you were a child.

722
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:41,685
Can I see her?

723
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,353
I know Puck got to.

724
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:44,855
Not yet.

725
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,691
How about a photo?

726
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:48,692
Please?

727
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:59,202
You want to know
who you really are?

728
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:02,122
Look at that sweet,
special little face.

729
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:03,707
She looks just like you.

730
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,959
You can be a part of
this family, too, Quinn.

731
00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:08,712
I really want you to be.

732
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:09,746
It's all up to you.

733
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:21,257
(sobbing)

734
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,280
+

735
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,783
Lug nut.

736
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:28,034
Wrench.

737
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:31,871
You're really good at
that, whatever it is

738
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:33,773
that you're doing over there.

739
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:36,125
Thanks for helping me out.
Yeah, well,

740
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,161
I need the distraction. I'm
gonna be in emotional DEFCON 1

741
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:40,296
until they post the audition
results for the musical,

742
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:42,948
which means I'm gonna be even
more self-centered than usual,

743
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,751
just so you know.
Why? You know you're gonna
get the lead.

744
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:46,386
I know I am, but, I mean,

745
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:47,887
you don't really know
until you know.

746
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:49,338
You can still try out.

747
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:51,174
I mean, the field for Tony
is wide open.

748
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:52,508
Well, I mean, between
football and school,

749
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:53,843
I don't really have time.

750
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:55,395
And I got to go to
this Booty Camp thing.

751
00:32:55,462 --> 00:32:58,464
My dancing has got to get better
or it's gonna cost us Nationals.

752
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,400
Plus, Burt pays me good here.

753
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,468
I'm saving up
for college and stuff.

754
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,736
I just... I don't want you
to give up

755
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:04,937
on what makes you most special.

756
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,773
You know, you're
really talented.

757
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:09,859
Talented enough to get
into NYADA if you applied.

758
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,911
What if I don't want to?
I mean, and not saying

759
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:14,113
that I don't,
but if I stay here,

760
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,449
work for Burt, I mean,
would that be so bad?

761
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,752
No, not if it made you happy.

762
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,337
But I don't
think it would.

763
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:22,855
You're better than that.

764
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:25,558
You may not know
it, but I do.

765
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:27,710
You're the best girlfriend ever.

766
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,596
No, you have grease
on your nose.

767
00:33:30,664 --> 00:33:32,465
Oh. Sorry.

768
00:33:32,516 --> 00:33:33,466
What the heck?

769
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:34,684
(chuckles)

770
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:36,886
BURT:
Quit making out
in the shop.

771
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,138
What do you want?
Nothing.

772
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:41,057
Is Finn the only son
that can help out around here?

773
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:42,692
Uh, no, but you only
volunteer to help

774
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:44,894
when you want money or you want
to talk about something.

775
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:46,062
What's going on?

776
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:48,114
I made a list.

777
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:49,565
These are the only musicals

778
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,234
that I am a shoo-in to
play the lead role in.

779
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,902
<i>Number one: La Cage aux Folles.</i>

780
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:54,704
<i>Number two: Falsettos.</i>

781
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,490
<i>Number three: Miss Saigon,
as Miss Saigon.</i>

782
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:00,660
But that's off the list when
and if I ever start shaving.

783
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:01,694
Du, you're gay.

784
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:03,195
Excuse me?
You're gay.

785
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:05,331
And you're not like Rock Hudson
gay; you're really gay.

786
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:06,666
You sing
like Diana Ross,

787
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:08,634
and you dress like you own
a magic chocolate factory.

788
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:09,702
Okay, why are
you being

789
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:10,920
so mean to me?
What is wrong

790
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:12,221
with any of that?
It's who you are.

791
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,223
And I'm not saying that
I'm ashamed of it.

792
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:16,259
The problem is that if I want
to be an actor,

793
00:34:16,343 --> 00:34:18,478
I have to pass as straight
to get the great romantic roles.

794
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:21,314
And I want those roles.
Every actor does.

795
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:25,318
But to not get a shot at it--
I mean, it kills me.

796
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:27,219
I don't know if you've
noticed, but no one's

797
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:28,771
really looking for
a Kurt Hummel type

798
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:31,056
to play opposite Kate
Hudson in a rom com.

799
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:33,058
Kurt, I say, if they're
not writing movies

800
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,610
and plays for
performers like you,

801
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:36,496
then you got to start
writing your own.

802
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:38,247
I mean, you're awesome.

803
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:39,565
Change the rules.
Write your own history.

804
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:42,067
I'm just tired
of being a unicorn, Dad.

805
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,954
You know what they call
a unicorn without a horn?

806
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:46,756
A freaking horse.

807
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:52,011
(sighs)

808
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:06,392
That's it.

809
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:07,760
All right, Finn.

810
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:10,029
You got this, buddy.
Come on.

811
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:12,031
Ha ha roo-ha ha.

812
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:14,650
(piano begins playing)

813
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,775
You okay?
(sighs)
I can't do this.

814
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:24,493
You can.
I can't.

815
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:26,329
Hey, who knows more
about dancing-- you or me?

816
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,713
You.

817
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,448
That's right.

818
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:30,917
Look, I know
you can do this.

819
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:32,284
And I believe in you.

820
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,720
One more time.

821
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:35,972
That's right.

822
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:39,258
WILL:
Here we go.

823
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:40,977
(clapping rhythmically)

824
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:42,929
(piano begins playing)

825
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:50,937
There you go.

826
00:35:58,311 --> 00:36:01,163
(cheering)

827
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:04,784
Good job, buddy.

828
00:36:04,835 --> 00:36:07,253
That's great.

829
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Can I help
you, Quinn?

830
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,842
I heard this was for people
who needed a little help

831
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:15,160
with their dance moves
and want to win Nationals.

832
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:17,763
That's right.
So, I'm a little rusty.

833
00:36:17,831 --> 00:36:21,767
And, uh... would it be cool
if I joined in?

834
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:24,520
Absolutely.

835
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:26,555
Welcome back.
MERCEDES:
Get in here, girl.

836
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,673
You've been missed.

837
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:30,359
All right.
Oh, I've missed you.

838
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:31,677
All right, let's line it up.

839
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:33,946
Enough, enough. All right,
let's get in lines.

840
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:35,481
Booty Camp, here we go.
Line it up.

841
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:36,849
Oh, Kurt, um...

842
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:39,452
I'm proud of you.

843
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:44,189
I have to get her back.

844
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:45,574
If that takes dying
my hair blonde

845
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,526
and pretending that
I think I'm special,

846
00:36:47,577 --> 00:36:48,861
that's something
I'm willing to do.

847
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:50,496
We're going to
get full custody.

848
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,500
(Will clapping rhythmically)

849
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:55,602
+

850
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,828
Do you eat a whole chicken
every day?

851
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:02,579
I eat a whole chicken
at every meal.

852
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:04,665
Well, hello, She-Hulk,

853
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:07,117
Weepy the Vestclown.
Good one.

854
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:08,652
And Little Miss Golden Marmoset.

855
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:10,838
It's a Brazilian
monkey,

856
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:12,589
and seriously, it's
your spitting image.

857
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:14,174
I'm going to send
you a photo.

858
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:16,326
Are you still at
FreakishBonyGinger@gmail?

859
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:18,095
Oh hey, Sue,
you hear the good news?

860
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:19,596
Quinn is back
in Glee Club,

861
00:37:19,664 --> 00:37:20,881
which sort of throws a wrench

862
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:21,932
in your whole
campaign commercial.

863
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,267
Well, actually,
Butt Chin,

864
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,102
couldn't have written
it any better myself.

865
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:27,838
In fact, it gives my campaign
a whole new narrative.

866
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,339
Quinn Fabray is an addict,

867
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,108
and she's relapsed

868
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:32,810
back into her
Glee Club addiction.

869
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:34,278
Mmm.
You see, the arts

870
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,864
are like crack, William,
but much more addictive

871
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:38,365
and not nearly
as glamorous.

872
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,284
And my new spot
airs tomorrow.

873
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:41,401
Sorry, Sue.

874
00:37:41,486 --> 00:37:43,403
Your scare tactics
are not going to work.

875
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:45,456
Well, they're already
working, William.

876
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:47,875
You see, I've made hating
the arts into a brand.

877
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,743
People are hurting,
unemployment is up,

878
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:51,662
the dollar is weak,
and the arts smack

879
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,747
of elitism and
self-absorption,

880
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:55,916
indulgence and
privilege.
(cell phone buzzing)

881
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,634
When times are tough,
that's something

882
00:37:57,702 --> 00:37:59,837
that Americans
cannot stomach.

883
00:37:59,888 --> 00:38:01,338
Well, I just
got a text

884
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:04,258
from Becky, replete with
hilarious auto-corrects.

885
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:06,126
Polling has me
nine points up

886
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:09,045
on my Republican challenger/
pizza magnate,

887
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,098
Reggie "The Sauce" Salazar.
You know what that means?

888
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,151
It means, today,
I am in first place.

889
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,103
So I'm going to have
a seat over there

890
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:17,187
at the first
place table.

891
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:18,722
Hey, you're free
to join me--

892
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:21,325
if any of you have ever
come in first place.

893
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:23,911
Recently.

894
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:25,946
What are we going to do?
We cannot let her win.

895
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,447
Then we got to
find someone

896
00:38:27,532 --> 00:38:28,999
with credibility to
run against her.

897
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:30,901
I mean, the anti-Sue.

898
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,404
(school bell ringing)

899
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:52,306
Brittany, hey, hey.
Look. Huh?

900
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,107
You were absolutely right.

901
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:56,143
I need to celebrate
who I am.

902
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:57,761
And I am unicorn.

903
00:38:57,812 --> 00:39:00,531
Oh, I love my happy,
happy unicorn.

904
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:01,899
(grunts) Thank you.

905
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,567
I'm so proud of you.

906
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,369
So what do you say you come
to my place after school

907
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:07,487
and, uh, we'll give
each other oatmeal facials

908
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:09,206
<i>and... and watch
Project Runway</i>

909
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:11,742
and, you know, talk
campaign strategy

910
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:13,961
while, uh, sampling
some of my zero-cal

911
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:15,796
loganberry pumpkin torte.
Huh? Huh?
Thanks, um, but I can't.

912
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,798
Santana and I are working
on campaign posters.

913
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,583
Oh, um, I...
I already have them.

914
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,385
No, for my campaign.

915
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:23,003
I decided to run, too.
'Cause, you know,

916
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,555
the last six senior
class presidents,

917
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:26,790
they've all been guys, and
look where that's got us--

918
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:28,458
you know, teetering on
a double-dip recession.

919
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:31,127
Besides, I'm
also a unicorn.

920
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:33,347
Maybe a bi-corn.

921
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,799
Either way, I'm starting
to believe in my own magic.

922
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,968
Good luck, Kurt.

923
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:39,236
I will see you at
the debate, okay?

924
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:41,989
(school bell ringing)

925
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:43,574
Blaine Anderson.

926
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:47,277
Hi, guys.
Greetings.

927
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:49,446
Uh, what song will you
be singing today?

928
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:51,147
Uh, "Something's Coming."

929
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,368
