1
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,235
The leader's Danny O'Neil.

2
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,589
Do you know him?

3
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,757
Oh, sure he's the best trumpet
player this college has ever had.

4
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,756
Let's get closer.

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,233
I thought you'd like the music.

6
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,154
Great, wasn't it, Ellen?

7
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,233
Hi, Stu.
Where've you been?

8
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,236
Oh, I've been around.

9
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,397
Funny I was just saying the other day
I ought to see more of old Stu.

10
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,079
Well, er, we'd better go
and sit down or something Ellen.

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,235
See you later.

12
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,588
Your playing
was wonderful.

13
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,310
Thanks.

14
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,153
You don't think she
meant you, do you?

15
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,599
You don't think
she meant you, do you?

16
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,156
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,829
You don't think she'd fall for that
station house music of yours?

18
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,236
It's not so much
my music, it's my personality.

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,077
I'll show you.

20
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,597
Hello Stu.

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,316
Oh, Mr. O'Neill,
won't you join us?

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,677
Oh, thank you.
See you later son.

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,312
Well Stu.
Do you want something?

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,952
Me? Oh, no, no.

25
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,429
I've been wanting
to meet you for some time Mr. O'Neil.

26
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,155
That's wonderful!
You mean you like the band?

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,239
Oh I didn't mean I wanted
to meet the band exactly,

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,636
although I thought
they did back you up rather well.

29
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,079
Thanks. Is there any special
number you'd like to hear?

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,029
I would like to hear the
Call-Me-Up-and-Call-me-down blues.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,437
The what?

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,034
The Call-Me-Up-
and-Call-Me-Down blues.

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,356
I know what you mean.
I'm afraid I haven't got the number.

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,837
Oh, I'm sure you'll be
able to get hold of it.

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,035
Why don't you go back
to the bandstand and look for it?

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,469
No hurry Stu.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,469
It's such a long time since we got
together. I want to make the most of it.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,558
It's heartwarming
that's what it is.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,396
Nothing like old college friends,
I always say.

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,237
All for one
and all for one. Ha, Ha.

41
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,794
Yes sir, I think I'd better
be getting back. So long Stu.

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,836
So long.

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,439
Alright let's play
number nine.

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,154
Why can't you
go on a picnic?

45
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,038
Mr. Dunn is inside,
Mr. Taylor.

46
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,430
Mr. Dunn?
He wouldn't be any fun on a picnic.

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,875
This is a collection agency.
Not an escort bureau.

48
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,393
Now will you please
get of my desk?

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,834
Is this fellow annoying you
Miss Miller?

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,713
Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,196
I was just seeing Miss Miller here
about the encyclopedias.

52
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,477
I figure
I can take care of the details.

53
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,631
As Miss Miller was kind enough
to serve me with the summons,

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,955
I'll explain the details.

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,115
What is there to explain?

56
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,196
Seven years ago,
you bought a set of encyclopedias

57
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,309
for which you've never paid.

58
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,396
But I didn't buy them.

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,709
Please,
you're wasting my time.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,552
See,
you're wasting Miss Miller's time.

61
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,794
As I was saying seven years ago,
I must have broken a mirror

62
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,916
because that walked in
and became my roommate.

63
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,237
I was only a simple
freshman at the time.

64
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,478
What are you now?
A simple sophomore?

65
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,879
Oh, Miss Miller
you're being a bit unkind.

66
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,156
After all, we've worked hard
to stay in college this long.

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,348
It's not easy for a couple of bright guys
like us to go on flunking year after year.

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,758
What in the world
are you talking about?

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,597
Well, it's like this.

70
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,157
As long as we can stay in college,
the band makes us a comfortable living.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,833
That's right five,
six thousand dollars a year.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,718
That's more than
you can make on Wall Street.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,912
Besides, it's a nice life.
Cultural, relaxing, gay.

74
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,599
Getting back
to the subject.

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,679
This roommate whom I trusted ordered
a set of encyclopedias in my name.

76
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,835
That's gratitude.

77
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,196
It was a birthday present.
You were crazy about them.

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,152
I was crazy about them
till I got the bill.

79
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,830
(Mr. Dunn)
Miss Miller.

80
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,110
What's this?

81
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,669
Mr. O'Neill,
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Dunn.

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,399
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes! Step right in.

83
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,713
Now look Mr. Dunn.
Here's the situation:

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,029
we're temporarily embarrassed.

85
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,390
You see we're working
our way through college.

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,553
You've been working your way
through college for the last seven years.

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,755
Well, takes time.

88
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,989
Specially when you're struggling.

89
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,311
Boys you don't pull any wool over me.
You ain't broke, you ain't struggling.

90
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,589
You mean you
doubt our word?

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,597
You said it. I've got your number.
You're businessmen.

92
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,791
Now pay up or go to jail.
That's final!

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,190
Final, Eh?

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,071
Final.

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,076
Final!

96
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,197
Well, maybe we ought to ask
for an extension, hit it.

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,911
(Overlapping dialogue)
Ok. Dunnsy boy we do make money.

98
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,718
We haven't got any
right now just give us one month.

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,678
Just one month's extension.
- OK Dunnsy.

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,471
I won't listen.

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,909
(Overlapping dialogue continues)
I'll be around in a -

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,950
What do you think we are?
- Fly-by-nights?

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,513
My word is
good enough, isn't it?

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,117
Everybody in town can-

105
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,959
Have that money here tomorrow
or I'll see you in court.

106
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,311
No!

107
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,190
No.

108
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,033
That's a sordid little fella, isn't he?
Sordid little place.

109
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,956
Must be a sordid
life for such a lovely girl.

110
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,759
Oh, there's nothing
so sordid about it.

111
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,719
Except the people
we deal with.

112
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,872
It's a pity we can't
take Miss Miller out of this.

113
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,195
Yes.
How'd you like some fresh air?

114
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,591
Sorry, I have work to do.

115
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,029
She's very businesslike,
isn't she?

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,717
Yes.

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,914
I like that in a secretary.

118
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,798
In fact, I'd like to have
a secretary like that.

119
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,191
You know, there's an
awful lot of work running a band.

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,470
Come to think of it,
we do need a secretary.

121
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,309
But I don't need a job.

122
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,908
So she doesn't
need a job.

123
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,950
Whatever it is I won't do it.
Now, I want to tell you.

124
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,432
Ssh!

125
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,276
Now look Mr. Dunn
I want to do the right thing.

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,391
We don't care anything about
the encyclopedia company.

127
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,715
No, we care
about you.

128
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,873
Oh yeah - er, well maybe
I said a few hasty words, boys.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,230
Let bygones
be bygones, eh?

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,714
Two dollars?
But the bill's a hundred and ten.

131
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,393
That's for you
to fix things up.

132
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,475
What are you
talking about?

133
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,359
Are you asking me
to take a bribe?

134
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,195
A two dollar bribe?

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,159
Oh, come on, Dunn. We're all
men of the world, you know.

136
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,713
We'll keep it under our hats.
Don't worry about it.

137
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,632
Sure, you can depend on us.
She'll tell you.

138
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,590
She? Who?

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,995
Miss Miller.

140
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,632
Miss Miller.

141
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,672
Miss Miller!
Come in here please.

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,794
Did you intimate to these men
that I could be bribed?

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,956
She didn't say your could be bribed,
she said you could be fixed.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,037
Well Mr. Dunn,
I didn't say any such thing.

145
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,230
(Overlapping dialogue)
Oh get her.

146
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,793
Oh yes you did,
she didn't want us to tell you.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,871
Don't believe him
Mr. Dunn,

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,638
I heard her myself.
Didn't you hear her?

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,716
Wait a minute!

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,276
I'll have you deadbeats
put in jail,

151
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,277
and as for you Miss Miller
you're fired!

152
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,477
Oh!

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,148
Thanks a lot
old man.

154
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,990
Thanks old boy.

155
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,274
Miss Miller,
Miss Miller,

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,155
wait a minute!

157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,311
Haven't you rover boys
caused enough trouble already?

158
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,595
It was really
a kindly gesture.

159
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,876
A very kindly gesture.
Now I haven't even a reference.

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,830
But I don't demand
a reference.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,830
We know you
for what you are.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,432
Yes.

163
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,233
You mean you
really want me to work for you?

164
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,355
Sure,
Wouldn't you like it?

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,157
What's your salary?

166
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,752
Eighteen a week.

167
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,670
He'll double it.

168
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,199
Yeah - er - Yeah!

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,311
Well.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,398
Hit it.

171
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,312
(overlapping dialogue) Let me tell you,
here's the chance of a lifetime:

172
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,476
we’re going all the way to the
- You can't go wrong if...

173
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,598
Alright I'll take it.

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,232
Good.

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,997
When do I start?

176
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,916
Right now.

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,029
Well now that I'm
working for you,

178
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,036
I'll tell you something.

179
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,236
Dunn can be bought
but his price isn't two dollars,

180
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,156
It's ten!

181
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,469
Here you want
to take care of the details

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,391
Hey!

183
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,954
Well, here we are.

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,558
You can have half of that desk, a quarter
of that rack and just - go to work.

185
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,678
There's only one detail
that you've omitted.

186
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,676
What are my duties?

187
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,395
Oh, you type a little.
- Telephone a little.

188
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,795
Keep the leader happy.

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,519
Keep your eye
on the brass section.

190
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,074
I thought you said
this was a job.

191
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,391
Lining up good
engagements is no cinch.

192
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,029
What's so difficult about it?

193
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,271
Operator get me
The Riverdale Country Club.

194
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,874
Oh no, we've already tried.

195
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,559
Who's in charge there?

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,910
Mr. Bent, isn't it?

197
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,349
Bent real sourpuss.

198
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,789
Hello Mr. Bent?

199
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,038
This is Mr. O'Neill 's
Secretary

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,830
No Danny O'Neill,
the orchestra leader.

201
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,589
I read in the paper that
you're planning a Halloween dance...

202
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,712
Hob Harvey's
Cornell Clippers oh,

203
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,319
but we entertain too

204
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,032
Do we entertain?

205
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,996
No but we can
dream up something.

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
Oh but our entertainment's terrific.
That's our strongpoint.

207
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,112
Mr. Benn until you've seen
the Perennials you haven't lived.

208
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,118
It isn't
that I don't admire Emil Colman,

209
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,151
but isn't his music...
shall we say rowdy?

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,278
Now, Mr. O'Neill 's salon ensemble
play everything gently but with a lilt.

211
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,472
And all his boys
are from such nice families.

212
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,076
Very well, we'll expect
them at seven-thirty.

213
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,311
Thank you.

214
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,591
Believe me, bud, my outfit are killers.
Just what you need for one-nighters.

215
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,271
Can they pack 'em in like Dorsey?
- Solid Jack!

216
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,710
Murder!

217
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,315
Furthermore, I could come
down the day before the dance

218
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,714
and help you with
the decorations.

219
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,473
That is, of course,
if you want me to.

220
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,550
(Shouts of approval)

221
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,831
Wait a minute men,
we took a poll on the campus

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,956
and almost everybody
voted for Artie Shaw's band.

223
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,072
Artie Shaw?
Who's Artie Shaw?

224
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,798
(Shouts of approval)

225
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,994
(Both agents together)
You were terrific, Chief.

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,872
Yeah, yeah -
glass of water please.

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,991
What about that prom,
is it set?

228
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,876
Not exactly, chief.

229
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,435
They hired that college band.
- Danny O'Neill's Perennials.

230
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,636
O'Neill again, Huh?

231
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,513
This is the fourth time
we've run into them on college dates.

232
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,031
Either they've got a
great band or a fine manager.

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,631
I gotta go up
and hear them sometime.

234
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,670
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about them.

235
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,233
They'll be graduating
in another week.

236
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,839
Hmm!
Not The Perennials.

237
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,509
OK, boys. No graduation this year.
I flunked three courses.

238
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,671
(Cries of congratulations)

239
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,757
Alright, boys,
break it up break it up.

240
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,748
Oh, Danny you're wonderful.

241
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,111
Well Danny old boy,
we made it again, Huh?

242
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,832
Er...

243
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,997
What's the matter?

244
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,833
Well Hank,
I don't quite know how to tell you.

245
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,555
What do you mean
I passed?

246
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,598
Oh, I couldn't graduate -
not with my marks.

247
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,916
What are you kiddin' me?

248
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,396
Oh, listen there must
be some mistake.

249
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,992
I'm not gonna
take this lyin' down.

250
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,829
I'm gonna see
the Dean about it.

251
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,149
They can't do this to me.

252
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,235
Oh, Danny.

253
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,033
Poor old Hank
he got careless.

254
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,192
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

255
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,990
Why Ellen!

256
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,469
Of course - a little peace and quiet
won't hurt either of us.

257
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,029
But poor Hank.

258
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,036
You still have me.

259
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,912
I guess we'll have to carry on as good
old Hank would have wanted us to.

260
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,679
It seems to me.

261
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,229
It seems to you?

262
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,799
I said it seems to me.

263
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,758
You said it seems to you.

264
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,150
It seems to me
I smell a mouse.

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,237
Somewhere about the house.

266
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,312
(Tempo)
It seems to me.

267
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,550
It seems to you.

268
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,715
I said it seems to me.

269
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,029
You said it seems to you.

270
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,512
That such embarrassing situation
calls for concentration.

271
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,630
Do you dig me Jack?

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,194
(Unison)
We dig you Jack.

273
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,396
Can you think of a plan?

274
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,629
We solid can.

275
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,829
To get me out
of this mess?

276
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,354
Er- yes, yes, yes.

277
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,715
(Unison) We'll start the music
and play it back.

278
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,310
Solid, Jack.

279
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,430
(Unison)
Solid Jack.

280
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,350
Can ya sing and dance?
- I'll take a chance.

281
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,028
Are your boots on right?
- I got 'em laced up tight.

282
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,589
Is Miss Miller a killer?
- From Spanish villa.

283
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,268
Is her dancin' mellow?
- Why mello as a cello.

284
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,159
(Unison)
Then it seems to me ob-vious-ly.

285
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,550
Why not go right
into your terpischore?

286
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,870
What will it be?

287
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,310
Don't look at me.

288
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,913
Now, let me see
what will it be?

289
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,952
I never could do
the Conga

290
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,032
Could never get
thru' the Conga.

291
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,471
But if you say
'do the Conga'

292
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,154
I ain't hep to that step.
but I'll dig it.

293
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,357
I never could
see Mazurkas

294
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,397
There poison to me
Mazurkas

295
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,638
But if it's to be
Mazurkas

296
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,640
I ain’t hep to that step
but I'll dig it

297
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,077
(Unison) When they invented
the Charleston

298
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,514
He was a total flop.

299
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,679
Right! But say -
if you want to Charleston

300
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,836
I'll never stop
or dance till I drop.

301
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,878
I never could
dig the polka.

302
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,158
The corniest jig,
the polka.

303
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,711
But if you say
dig the polka.

304
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,236
I ain't hep to
that step but I'll dig it.

305
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,151
Hi Hank.

306
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,436
Hello there.

307
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,909
Did you get anywhere
with the Dean?

308
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,829
No, it seems that the article I wrote
on the decline of the harpsichord

309
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,231
and her sister instruments
is what really put me across.

310
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,831
Is that so?

311
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,992
Yeah, funny I don't even
remember writing that article.

312
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,118
Yet the Dean said it was so good, he
couldn't possibly think of flunking me.

313
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,597
Tough luck.

314
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,392
Yeah.

315
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,153
Cheer up boy it's probably
all for the best.

316
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,790
What have you
got there?

317
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,236
Encyclopedia.

318
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,070
Think of it Hank.

319
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,476
You'll go into your father's textile
business, a cog in a great industry.

320
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,515
Stamping you personality
on miles and miles of tweed

321
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,668
making the wheels turn.

322
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,752
Punching the clock -
listening to the song of the looms -

323
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,028
what volume is that?

324
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,272
It's... Ham to Ilk.
Why?

325
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,109
Oh, nothing.
Music wasn't for you, Hank.

326
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,629
You could never have got anywhere
with that beat-up trumpet of yours.

327
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,959
Your medium is textiles.

328
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,998
Your father was a textile man -
so was his father before him.

329
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,669
Why, you've got wool
in your blood Hank.

330
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,313
What's the bookmark for?

331
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,035
Oh, it's an article there -
rather interested the Dean.

332
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,957
You know, funny thing
about that article.

333
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,758
It's almost identical
with my thesis.

334
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,835
Interesting coincidence.

335
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,399
Yes, that's what
the Dean thought.

336
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,393
I had quite a time persuading him
that the marginal notes weren't mine.

337
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,909
As a matter of fact, I tried to convince
him that the handwriting wasn't yours.

338
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,151
Yeah?

339
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,918
Yeah.

340
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,950
What did he say?

341
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,709
He said you were fired.

342
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,757
You dog!

343
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,836
Now, take it easy,
Danny.

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,433
You low,
conniving dog!

345
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,272
You too will have
to face the world.

346
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,959
Fall right into your
father's concrete.

347
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,388
You'll be a cog
within a cog.

348
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,152
You can't get away
from it, Danny my boy.

349
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,719
You've got concrete
in your bones.

350
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,429
(Ellen) Danny, hey! Hurry!
Wonderful news!

351
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,195
A telegram!

352
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,713
"Will be in town Saturday. Would like
to look over your outfit." Artie Shaw.

353
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,989
Well, what do you know?

354
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,799
Hey, well there it is.
Shaw wants to look me over.

355
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,393
Look you over?
Look us over.

356
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,791
Alright, us. Hmm, seems to be
in a kind of a rush about it.

357
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,679
I wonder how soon
he wants me to start.

358
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,711
Hey, it didn't take him long
to find out I'd be available, did it?

359
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,473
You'll be available indefinitely,
I'm afraid.

360
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,236
Yeah. Now then, first thing tomorrow,
I must find Ellen a new job.

361
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,914
Don't bother.
As soon as I get set, I'll send for you.

362
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,349
Oh, that's very kind of you.

363
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,834
Alright. Let's get organized.

364
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,036
Call the boys and tell them
to be there early. Summer uniforms.

365
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,158
And you - you go home
and run your scales. Come on!

366
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,116
Look, fella. Don't bury it.
I'll be out in a few minutes.

367
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,915
Artie Shaw!

368
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,955
Artie Shaw, he's here!

369
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,916
Good, thanks.

370
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,152
Hey, what about
the buck you promised me?

371
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,478
Alright, alright beat it.

372
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,237
OK, gang. Sweet Sue.

373
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,150
Hank!
Shaw, he's coming in now!

374
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,917
Swell. Thanks, pal.

375
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,310
Come on, give out.

376
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,675
I'll bring you
some change.

377
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,671
Now, a nice and easy background
on this one, boys.

378
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,713
Hey, Danny.
Why don't you lay out on this one?

379
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,393
Save your lip till Shaw comes.
I'll take the lead.

380
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,310
Are you kiddin'?

381
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,799
I'm OK, I've been
in the woodshed.

382
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,476
You've been in the cornfield.
Alright, boys. One-two.

383
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,439
(Band plays "Sweet Sue")

384
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,950
Say, that's quite a little
shindig you're pitchin' in there.

385
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,674
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Shaw.

386
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,193
Band on straight
salary or percentage?

387
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,316
Oh, percentage.

388
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,277
Oh smart, uh!

389
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,715
Thanks again, Mr. Shaw.

390
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,796
Where's Mr. Miller?

391
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,796
Mr. Miller?

392
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,955
Yeah,
the manager of the band.

393
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,797
Oh, that Mr. Miller...
There she is.

394
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,790
This is Mr. Shaw, Mr. Miller -
I mean, er...

395
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,190
We've been expecting you,
Mr. Shaw.

396
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,352
Swell. If you're not too busy, I'd like
to talk to you for a few minutes.

397
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,311
Fine.

398
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,879
Won't you stay
and hear the band, Mr. Shaw?

399
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,475
I'd like to but I'm on my way
down to Trenton to play a date.

400
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,068
Anyway, it was nice
talking to you.

401
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,673
Thanks and goodnight.
- Goodnight.

402
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,310
Thanks.

403
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,395
No trouble.

404
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,635
Where is he?

405
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,630
He's gone.

406
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,357
Gone?

407
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,436
Where's Shaw? What did he say?
- He's gone. You ruined it.

408
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,717
What are you talkin' about?
I was terrific. When do I start?

409
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,676
Oh, take ten, son.

410
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,275
What was his proposition?

411
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,590
Well, his proposition
rather surprised me.

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,557
Oh!

413
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,510
Quibbled about salary?

414
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,999
Wait a minute,
I don't work on Sundays.

415
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,316
Look, Ellen,
what gives? When do I start?

416
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,631
You don't.

417
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,752
What?
Well, then what did he want?

418
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,393
Me.

419
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,629
Ellen!
- Oh, Danny!

420
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,835
I brought you this!

421
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,036
Oh, I guess I'm a little late.

422
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,636
Oh, Danny. How darling of you.
Hank's inside getting a ticket.

423
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,630
Is he?

424
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,111
Gosh, Ellen,
I hate to see you go.

425
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,438
Oh, I hate to go,
Danny.

426
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,471
I - I kinda
hoped that...

427
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,550
What Danny?

428
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,639
Oh, nothing. I guess
it was just silly, that's all.

429
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,159
No, it wasn't.
What was it?

430
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,311
Excuse me.
You're sprouting.

431
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,279
Here's some popcorn. Sonny, hold this
for the lady. Here's your ticket, Ellen.

432
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,955
Come on, I'll tell the conductor
when to let you off.

433
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,554
Now, be a good girl
and don't talk to any strange men.

434
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,034
I won't.
I'll see you in New York?

435
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,389
(Over-lapping) - I hope so.
- Yes.

436
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,274
Well, I don't know.
Portland's a long way from New York

437
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,078
and concrete
kinda holds a man down.

438
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,551
Well,
you'll be there, Hank?

439
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,988
No. I've gotta pay a lot of attention
to those mills in Fall River.

440
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,590
Well, I won't be seeing
either of you?

441
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,431
No.

442
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,356
Well, I'm afraid not.

443
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,239
(Conductor)
All aboard!

444
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,910
Well, goodbye, you idiots.
- Goodbye. Look after her orchids.

445
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,789
Goodbye!

446
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,796
Bye!

447
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,956
When do you start for Portland?
- Tonight.

448
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,678
When do you leave for Fall River?
- Oh, about an hour.

449
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,069
I'll see you off.

450
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,753
No, don't bother.
You've got to pack.

451
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,159
Yeah. Well, this is it.

452
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,833
Right. So long, Danny.

453
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,272
So long, kid. It's been a lot of fun.
- You bet it has. Take care of yourself.

454
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,549
I'll drop you a line.
- Do that.

455
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,878
A college band?
Whoever heard of a good college band?

456
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,110
Oh, we were under the impression
that this was an important affair.

457
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,155
Oh, it is.

458
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,515
Oh well in that case,
I know you'll want Mr. Shaw.

459
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,033
That's fine. Thank you.

460
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,469
A couple of relatives.

461
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,789
Well, what's cookin', Ellen?

462
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,076
We close the Atlantic City job
on our own terms.

463
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,270
That's swell.

464
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,749
And the intercollegiate prom.

465
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,590
Not a bad two day's work. Looks like
my hunch about you was pretty good.

466
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,469
I'm glad. Mr. Shaw, I...
I wonder if I could ask you a favor.

467
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,351
Of course.

468
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,397
It's - it's about
a couple of trumpet players.

469
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,078
Oh, well, you see I always pick
my own men, Ellen and I don't...

470
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,271
Of course, but all I want you to do
is hear these boys.

471
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,556
They're marvelous.
- Where are they? Around town?

472
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,676
Practically. One's in Portland
and the other's in Fall River.

473
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,870
But they could be here in a jiffy.

474
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,439
Isn't that a lot
of travelin' just for an audition?

475
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,670
But they wouldn't mind. And once you
hear them, you'll know what I mean.

476
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,792
If you think they're that good,
I'll listen to them.

477
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,394
Thank you.
- Not at all.

478
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,154
Call the Western Union boy to pick up
two telegrams. Thank you.

479
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,238
What floor is Artie Shaw on?
- (In unison) Seventeenth.

480
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,077
Going up.

481
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,111
Hold it, buddy.

482
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,229
What floor is Artie Shaw on?
- (Unison) Seventeenth.

483
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,189
Aren't you going
to Fall River the hard way?

484
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,272
I suppose this elevator
stops at Portland.

485
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,511
No, sir.
Last stop is the 22nd floor.

486
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,715
So you were going
to give a lot of time to the mills.

487
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,308
Listen, I've got as much right
here as you have.

488
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,075
Why don't you face facts, Hank?
Ellen's not even established yet.

489
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,553
She can't possibly
get us both in the band.

490
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,874
I'm going to get
a try-out with Artie Shaw

491
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,031
if I have to tear down
this building floor by floor.

492
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,559
17th floor next.

493
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,433
Here's a present
for you, Sam.

494
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,835
Have one on me, Sam.

495
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,874
Oh, excuse me.

496
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,190
Where's Artie Shaw's office, please?
- Right that way.

497
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,997
Oh, thanks.

498
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,033
(Overlapping dialogue)
Mr... Mr. Taylor to see Miss Miller.

499
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,354
Miss Miller's very busy
right now.

500
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,432
(Overlapping) She'll see me,
we went to college together.

501
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,274
Hey, is that 34 or 54
Highcroft Road?

502
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,437
34. Hey, wait a minute.
What have you got there?

503
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,196
Why, this is for me!

504
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,110
Yeah.

505
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,513
Hank, Shaw's
sending for me.

506
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,074
Me too. You know, I knew he'd
get around to that sooner or later.

507
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,315
Any answers?

508
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,391
We'll take care of the answers, bud.
Here.

509
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,390
Thanks.

510
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,232
It's alright.

511
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,715
What do you make of this?
- Look at that, Fall River.

512
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,831
Say! Excuse me...

513
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,948
Something phony about this.

514
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,830
Yeah.

515
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,678
He walked out on us
at the Prom, didn't he?

516
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,550
Yeah.

517
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,076
You don't suppose it was deliberate?
- Why would he?

518
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,312
You mean he'd want us to cool
for a while so we'd work for peanuts.

519
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,959
Listen, we're not that hard
to get.

520
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,997
No. But then he got Ellen
down here as a decoy,

521
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,792
thinking we'd work for nothing
on account of her.

522
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,916
That's it.
How do ya like it?

523
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,116
I don't like it.
He can't treat a friend of ours like that.

524
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,110
No, sir!

525
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,234
I'll fix him. Just for that, I'm gonna
ask for 25 dollars a week more.

526
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,196
Fifty!

527
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,631
Young lady, you can tell Shaw
that we'll see him.

528
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,710
Mr. Shaw is very busy.

529
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,393
Never mind, we'll tell him.
Thanks. Come on, Hank.

530
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,875
Hey, wait a minute.

531
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,197
Hi, Shaw.

532
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,237
Now, just a minute, fellas.
You'll have to wait outside.

533
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,913
I'm the new trumpet player
you just sent for.

534
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,798
And me too.
We've just got your wire.

535
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,509
What the?

536
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,268
Oh, yeah-well, you certainly
took your time getting here.

537
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,197
Well, we had a couple
of other offers to consider.

538
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,992
Alright, boys,
I tell you what you do.

539
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,276
Drop down to the hotel tonight and
play a couple of tunes for the band.

540
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,034
That'll be swell.
- Love to.

541
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,112
See you then,
I'm sorry, I'm pretty busy now.

542
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,310
Well, that's alright.
Which is Miss Miler's office?

543
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,430
Right across the hall.

544
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,269
Oh, thanks. Think I'll have
a little talk with her.

545
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,513
OK, Artie -
ha, ha, ha.

546
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,110
Ellen!

547
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,353
Danny! I can't believe
my eyes.

548
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,391
It's so good
to see you.

549
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,388
Kinda surprised you,
huh?

550
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,794
Kinda surprised you,
huh?

551
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,478
And Hank,
wherever did you come from?

552
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,470
Artie Shaw's office.

553
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,550
We were just talking
a little business.

554
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,916
But Portland?

555
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,554
Portland's loss
is your gain.

556
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,550
And Fall River?

557
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,908
Fall River will have
to suffer too.

558
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,799
Did Artie say anything
about giving you a try-out?

559
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,710
Oh, sure.

560
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,359
Oh, darlings,
that's wonderful!

561
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,039
Yes, but we haven't
promised him anything yet.

562
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,270
Straight ahead.

563
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,029
Hey, there!

564
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,916
Good evening, Cap.

565
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,913
I'm the new trumpet
player with Artie Shaw.

566
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,388
I ain't never seen
you before.

567
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,751
It's alright, you're going
to see plenty of me from now on.

568
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,313
Oh, by the way. If my brother
happens to drop around here tonight,

569
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,074
tell him that Shaw's not giving
any more auditions, see.

570
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,755
If he makes a fuss,
just throw him out.

571
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,552
You know how these little
family jealousies are. Thanks.

572
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,795
What's your name?

573
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,999
Danny O...
O' Taylor.

574
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,717
Danny, I'm so glad
you got here early.

575
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,314
I was lonesome. I haven't seen you
since late this afternoon.

576
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,993
Not a bad house.
How long are we booked here for?

577
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,959
You're only booked
for one number.

578
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,589
This audition?
Mere formality.

579
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,631
Where's Hank?

580
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,397
Hank?

581
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,995
How do I know?
Am I my brother's keeper?

582
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,599
I thought he was coming
with you.

583
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,954
He probably got
cold feet.

584
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,196
Couldn't face the humiliation
of being turned down.

585
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,076
Poor boy, I wish I could
do something to help him.

586
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,670
Oh, yes.

587
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,710
Ah, now, Ellen.
I'm very fond of Hank.

588
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,393
After all, he did bring
us together.

589
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,199
If it hadn't been
for those encyclopedias

590
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,588
I might never have met you.

591
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,717
I'll always be grateful
to him for that.

592
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,029
Won't you?

593
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,036
Danny, this is no time.
- Yes, it is. This is just the time.

594
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,675
Yesterday, what was I?
A carefree schoolboy.

595
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,360
Today what?
A man with his career assured,

596
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,511
a man with plans
for the future.

597
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,556
Danny, don't you think
you ought to be warming up?

598
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,591
I've been warmed up
a long time.

599
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,430
Ellen...

600
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,397
Shall I take
the vocal?

601
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,635
(Starts singing) Would you like to be
the love of my life

602
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,435
for always.

603
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,073
And always watch over me.

604
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,594
To square my blunders
and share my dreams.

605
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,434
One day with caviar.

606
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,439
Next day a chocolate bar.

607
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,750
Would you like
to take the merry-go-round,

608
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,909
I'll lead you

609
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,791
I need you - just wait
till you see.

610
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,797
I hope in your horoscope

611
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,754
There is room
for a dope who adores you.

612
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,230
That would make the only
dream of my life...

613
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,319
come true.

614
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,112
For the love
of my life...

615
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,114
is you.

616
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,430
Ellen.

617
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,433
So, I'm your brother,
huh?

618
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,999
I was afraid you
wouldn't make it.

619
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,190
You shouldn't worry about me,
brother Danny.

620
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,395
Ellen, I think
you'd better leave.

621
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,555
No, no, stick around.

622
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,470
What happened, Hank?

623
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,397
Brother Danny here
framed me with the doorman.

624
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,198
All I wanted was to be
alone with you for once.

625
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,713
See that?
He admits the whole thing.

626
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,956
Oh, now wait a minute.
- That doorman hit me in the lip.

627
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,876
He did?
- Yeah.

628
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,672
Oh, that's too bad.
- How'd you like to even it up, huh?

629
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,717
Oh no, boys, please.
You have to go on in a minute.

630
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,353
You're putting me
in an awful position.

631
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,717
Now, come on, let's forget it. I'll tell
Artie you're here. Good luck, darlings.

632
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,990
Yeah, darlings.

633
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,918
You haven't forgotten
the two trumpet players?

634
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,029
No, I'll be right with you.

635
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,118
(Applause)

636
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,712
Quick, let's go.

637
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,358
I'll put your boys on, but first give me
a hand with that character over there.

638
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,915
He's been here ten nights in a row.
He's an awful ear bend.

639
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,309
Well, well.

640
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,879
Mr. Chisholm,
this is Miss Miller.

641
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,836
How do you do,
Miss Miller?

642
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,956
Well, sir, did that last number
jump for you?

643
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,872
Oh, very peppy.
Very peppy indeed.

644
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,673
By the way,
what chord did we finish on?

645
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,190
Er, B flat.

646
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,999
Shaw, I missed it again.

647
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,269
Won't you two join me?

648
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,197
I'm sorry, I've got to get back
and play the next number.

649
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,878
But Miss Miller
can tell you all about the band.

650
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,998
Is Miss Miller hep as you boys say?
- Hep as they come.

651
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,192
Fascinating, swing jargon.
I'm becoming hep to it myself.

652
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,789
Well, see you later, Mr. Chisholm.
- So long, gate.

653
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,033
That's short for alligator.
Please be seated.

654
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,833
Are you a musician,
Mr. Chisholm?

655
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,150
Oh, I should have been
but I was forced to give it up.

656
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,189
I said music and father said
bottle caps. Father won.

657
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,159
Oh, what a pity. I take it
that the banjo is your instrument.

658
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,193
Oh, no, the mandolin.
The flat-back mandolin.

659
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,870
Alright, you're on.
What do you want to play?

660
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,592
How about
"I'm Yours"?

661
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,711
That's a tough
arrangement to play at sight.

662
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,632
I'll play anything
that's on the paper.

663
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,075
OK. How about you?

664
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,435
Pick one.

665
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,754
Alright, I'll leave the book with you.
Look 'em over.

666
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,993
Artie! On the question of who plays first,
may I suggest alphabetical order -

667
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,553
in the interest of fairness?

668
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,439
Sure, OK. Alright,
we're on in about three minutes.

669
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,872
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to look over your parts?

670
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,472
I couldn't hit a bad note
if I tried. Not tonight.

671
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,868
Why is tonight
an exception?

672
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,393
Oh, I don't know.

673
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,070
It makes all the difference when you
know someone's depending on you.

674
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,310
What?

675
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,918
Oh, nothing, nothing
nothing at all

676
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,669
Who's depending
on you?

677
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,715
Nobody. Forget it, Hank,
forget it.

678
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,237
Say, you were alone here
with Ellen when I came in.

679
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,351
For almost the first time
since I've known her.

680
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,068
Yeah? Well, what happened?
What did you say to her?

681
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,675
Look, Hank.
Ellen and I...

682
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,233
I don't suppose it's
any concern of yours,

683
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,069
but when I get set with Shaw,
Ellen and I...

684
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,754
You proposed to her.
What did she say?

685
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,749
She just looked at me and gave her
tender unspoken yes.

686
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,916
How do you know
it wasn't an unspoken no?

687
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,829
A fella can tell.

688
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,317
One of those rare occasions when
silence was more eloquent than words.

689
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,872
Yeah?

690
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,032
Yeah.

691
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,993
Alright. That's the way it is. I wish
you all the happiness in the world.

692
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,357
Have me over
for dinner sometime.

693
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,398
Thanks, Hank.
- Alright.

694
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,398
I'm glad you're not gonna
let this come between us.

695
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,596
OK. Here we go.

696
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,116
Here we are, Danny. You know
what I wish you, Danny boy.

697
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,757
Yeah.

698
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,231
(Out of tune)

699
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,675
Fascinating music.

700
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,754
I can't understand it.

701
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,838
(High-pitched note)

702
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,994
Well, that was just dandy.
I'll be sure and call you.

703
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,316
In the meanwhile, if anything
else comes up, take it!

704
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,039
You sure you know
what you're doing?

705
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,916
Say the word.

706
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,519
OK, fellas.
Here we go - one, two.

707
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,871
See what I mean?
I've even got music in my feet.

708
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,031
(Noise of fighting)

709
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,996
Excuse me.

710
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,271
(Arguing)

711
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,275
Well, have you finished, the both
of you? You've ruined everything.

712
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,716
After all you've pretended
to think of me.

713
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,195
After I've tried so hard.
After Artie went...

714
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,875
Please, I never want to see
either of you again.

715
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,518
Danny O'Neill?
Who have you played with?

716
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,114
Er - O'Neill's Perennials.

717
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,316
Never heard of them.

718
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,269
Have you heard of
Artie Shaw?

719
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,714
Oh, were you associated
with him?

720
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,790
Associated with him?

721
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,509
I made a deeper impression on him
than any trumpet player he ever heard.

722
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,229
One moment please.

723
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,596
Artie, there was one thing about
last night. Maybe I shouldn't bring it up.

724
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,755
Now, wait a minute.
If it's about those...

725
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,759
No, no, no. It's about Mr. Chisholm.
No, I mean it.

726
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,875
(Phone buzzes)

727
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,077
Yeah? Who? Him? Are you kiddin'?
Well, throw him out.

728
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,230
Anything serious?

729
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,590
Naw!

730
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,433
Out!
- Alright.

731
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,434
Hello. Tell Tommy that
Hank Taylor's here, will you?

732
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,159
Get off the desk.

733
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,753
Uh? Alright.

734
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,240
Of course, Mr. Chisholm
talks a lot but he's sweet.

735
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,557
He says he has the soul of an artist
but that his money's stifling it.

736
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,637
Now, you've always wanted
to give a concert.

737
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,432
I know I can get him
to back you.

738
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,715
How do I know he's different from those
crunchy, crinkle breakfast food guys?

739
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,069
They've all got some angle.

740
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,510
Alright, I'll guarantee to get him
without one string attached.

741
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,750
No musts about what I should play?
- None.

742
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,876
No bottle cap ads?
- Honor bright.

743
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,749
OK. Sounds swell if you can do it.
- Good. I'll get to work on it right away.

744
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,435
(Phone buzzes)

745
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,550
Yeah? What? Him?
Throw him out.

746
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,472
Alright. Now wait a minute, I've got
offers from Miller, Duchin, Goodman.

747
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,479
I got plenty of jobs.
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

748
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,109
I think I'll put a small wager
on Magic Melody.

749
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,434
Lester, you're wonderful.

750
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,312
Always willing to back
something musical.

751
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,919
Artists need a man
like you.

752
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,195
You think so?

753
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,870
(Trumpet playing "Hunting song"
in a jazzy fashion)

754
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,798
Old English hunting song,
I believe.

755
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,359
My dear, are you choking?

756
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,594
(Russian-sounding music)

757
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,112
This place was one of my finds.

758
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,548
They're all real musicians.

759
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,119
Too bad they're not
better known.

760
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,189
Ellen, you remember what you said -
I might be able to help?

761
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,274
Why can't I give
these musicians to the world?

762
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,755
Oh, but your first duty
is to the American artists.

763
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,353
Oh, yes. So it is.

764
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,551
Look at him. Centuries of Slavic
balance have gone into that dance.

765
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,791
Vos goot!

766
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,355
Vos goot? Vos perfect!

767
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,753
(Sings "Love Of My Life"
in pseudo-Russian gobbledygook)

768
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,115
He's miles away. Perhaps dreaming
of a little girl on the Steppes of Russia.

769
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,640
You can tell by his face
he's loved and suffered.

770
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,075
Oh, please take me home,
I can't stand any more of this.

771
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,952
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you letting me back this concert.

772
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,389
Not at all, not at all.

773
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,873
And how grateful I am
to you, Ellen.

774
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,079
To think, after all these years,
I'm back in my true medium.

775
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,876
By the way, how much
did you say I should arrange for?

776
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,834
Er, roughly fifteen thousand.

777
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,439
Oh, wouldn't you say
that twenty would be safer?

778
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,632
After all, J. Lester Chisholm
must stand for nothing but the best.

779
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,554
There she goes, there she goes -
always thinking of me.

780
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,189
I can't tell you what a jewel
you have in this little girl.

781
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,799
I'm finding out every day.

782
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,473
And what an inspiration.

783
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,110
Mother thinks that every girl
who's attracted to me

784
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,468
is after the
Chisholm money.

785
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,910
(Door buzzer)

786
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,073
Come in. Oh, Lester.

787
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,234
Stay where you are.

788
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,116
Don't move.

789
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,474
You don't know what a picture
you make in the candlelight.

790
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,953
Lester, you've brought
your mandolin.

791
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,032
For you.

792
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,595
Oh, you shouldn't have.

793
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,115
Why not? Tonight's
our night to celebrate, isn't it?

794
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,391
I thought we might have
a quiet evening of music.

795
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,993
Just you and I.

796
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,192
I always say there's nothing
like duets to make a home a home.

797
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,717
Can I use your house phone, please?
- Certainly.

798
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,759
Who do you wish to speak to?
- Miss Miller.

799
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,872
Who's calling?
- Mr. er... Dunn.

800
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,115
Oh, Mr. Dunn.

801
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,276
Hello.

802
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,913
Hello, Ellen. It's me, Danny.

803
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,793
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

804
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,712
I'm downstairs.
And I thought maybe I could...

805
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,193
No, I can't see you tonight.
No, I'm not being vindictive.

806
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,831
I just can't see you.
Of course, Hank isn't here.

807
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,236
Look, Danny,
I'll have to talk to you tomorrow.

808
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,799
No, he isn't.

809
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,913
Ellen, wait a minute.

810
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,715
Goodnight, Mr. Dunn.

811
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,595
Er, goodnight.

812
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,316
Mr. Dunn...

813
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,511
That was just an old college friend
I was talking to.

814
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,278
We won't be disturbed again,
Lester.

815
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,277
Shall we continue while
we're in the groove?

816
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,150
(Chisholm singing)

817
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,351
(Singing badly) Beautiful Dreamer,
queen of my song.

818
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,355
List while I woo thee
with soft melody.

819
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,876
What was that?
B-flat.

820
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,230
No, I heard a noise.
Is there someone in there?

821
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,793
Hardly. That's my bedroom.

822
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,469
Now, don't be nervous.

823
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,669
I'm not a bit nervous.

824
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,879
See, just as I told you,
it's your imagination.

825
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,156
(Door shuts)

826
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,629
(Like a dog) Grrr...

827
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,474
Yes boy, yes boy.

828
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,359
(Sniffing, then howling)

829
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,237
Sport, shut up.

830
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,710
Ouch!

831
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:23,792
Hank!

832
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,550
What do you hear
from the gang in college?

833
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,713
What do you think
you're doing under this bed?

834
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,794
Looking for a collar button.

835
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,232
I've got as much right
under here as you have.

836
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,077
Say, if you're in here,
I wonder who's out there?

837
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,390
That's right.
I thought it was you.

838
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,549
Better investigate.

839
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,797
No, wait a minute. We don't want
to upset Ellen - today of all days.

840
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,753
That's right.
Not today.

841
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,959
So that's why you came up.
I thought so.

842
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,075
What are you
talkin' about?

843
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,915
Well, you just happened to call on the
day Shaw announced his concert.

844
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,556
Well, I read something
about the concert in the paper.

845
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,750
But I'm much too
busy to help Artie out.

846
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,639
I'm working like a horse.

847
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,676
You're working?

848
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,357
Sure.

849
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,316
Not with Dorsey.

850
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,757
No. He wouldn't change his style
to suit me.

851
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,348
I've got a little engagement
just out of town.

852
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,192
I never had such
a big audience.

853
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,716
Fourth trumpet, huh?

854
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,950
No sir, boy.
Strictly solo stuff.

855
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,989
Why? Is the concert
the reason for your visit?

856
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,429
Who, me?
- Yeah.

857
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,911
I'm much too busy for that.
- Doin' what?

858
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,595
After I quit Whiteman.
- You quit Whiteman?

859
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,432
Sure, too big a
band for me.

860
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,676
If I'd stayed with him,
I'd have lost my individuality.

861
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,279
Same thing happened
to Bix.

862
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,119
So you're unemployed,
huh?

863
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,437
No, not at all. I've just hooked up
with a terrific European outfit.

864
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,630
I never dreamed such
things could be done to music.

865
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,591
I wonder what's going on
out there?

866
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,797
Sounds as if she's giving
somebody an audition.

867
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,874
I never heard of Shaw with
a mandolin section.

868
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,868
What about a breather?
- That's a wonderful idea!

869
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,236
Sometimes it's a little tiring.
- Yes.

870
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,399
Let's have a toast
to the concert.

871
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,074
(Chisholm off screen) Ellen, you've
made me feel like a boy again.

872
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,110
(Ellen off screen) Really?

873
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,192
(Chisholm) You've made me believe
that money really isn't a handicap.

874
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,752
(Cork popping)

875
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,279
(Ellen) That's what I want you
to believe, Lester.

876
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,753
(Chisholm) To think,
after all these years,

877
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,108
I've something to look forward to.

878
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,274
Well, to our big night.
- To our big night.

879
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,833
She's being
taken advantage of.

880
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,158
She seems to be liking it.

881
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,116
I've seen that fella before.
Where was it?

882
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,514
At the Russian restaurant -
The Little Bear.

883
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,077
The Little Wolf. I saw him
with her at the racetrack.

884
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,039
We've got to get her out of this.
- What are we waitin' for?

885
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,234
Would you have another glass?
- I don't think I should.

886
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,236
Well, you know best.

887
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,798
That's what I admire
about you, Ellen.

888
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,229
You're so different
from the other girls in this town.

889
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,271
Oh. I can hardly
believe that, Lester.

890
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,628
You wouldn't.
You're so innocent.

891
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,557
You wouldn't believe
the carryings-on.

892
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,399
Oh, I've been told things.

893
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,358
(Sound of bucket
being kicked over)

894
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,879
What's that?
Somebody out there.

895
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,712
You're just imagining
things again.

896
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,790
No, look.

897
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,236
(Whistle sound)

898
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,275
What in the world?

899
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,476
(Danny off-screen) He's not home,
is he, Ellen?

900
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,756
Who is it?

901
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,275
Danny!

902
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,520
Oh, er, it's just a neighbor.

903
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,076
He always wants to borrow the lawn-
mower or something. Excuse me.

904
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,191
Danny, Danny, is it you?

905
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,998
Is that guy here again?
Pardon me, Mr...

906
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,036
Chisholm.

907
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,749
Oh, Chisholm, yes.
Ellen told me about you.

908
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,915
Yeah, I guess she's
getting rid of him.

909
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,750
Well, she'd better.

910
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,198
You know, I told her flatly -
I said it's either him or me.

911
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,396
You know, I used to
trust that guy.

912
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,394
I went to college with him. I shared
my room, my tie, my troubles.

913
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,273
But I won't share Ellen.

914
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,072
You don't blame me,
do you?

915
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,311
I didn't know.
I think I'd better be going.

916
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,271
No, I didn't mean you.
Stick around.

917
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,269
Make yourself at home.
Do you need anything?

918
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:17,912
No.

919
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,399
Glad to have met you.

920
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,073
Oh, mercy!

921
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,752
Danny,
how dare you come up here?

922
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,109
I'm glad I came up.

923
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,673
Well, I'm not.
Get off this roof this instant.

924
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,028
You need me, Ellen.

925
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:31,757
What?

926
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,108
Oh, I'm not blaming you
for one moment, but.

927
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,235
What are you
talking about?

928
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,429
He's not the kind of person
to be around you.

929
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,953
You don't know
what you're getting into.

930
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,589
Of course, it's not your fault.
Hank and I both realize that.

931
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,994
Hank? Is he here
too?

932
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,872
Yes, he's inside
taking care of the details.

933
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,109
Good heavens!

934
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,230
Oh, dear.

935
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,590
Lester! Lester, wait a minute -
Lester.

936
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,999
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

937
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,269
But I'm not married.

938
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,276
Then who's that man?

939
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,555
Oh, that was just Hank.

940
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,672
Ellen, I can't believe it.
You of all people.

941
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,593
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

942
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,835
Well, you mustn't
be so upset.

943
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,949
I'll send him away.

944
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,394
Now, don't make
it worse, Ellen.

945
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,232
I can't stand it.
I can't stand it.

946
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,152
I'm leaving for Cincinnatti
in the morning.

947
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,396
Cinncinnatti?
Well, what about the concert?

948
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,878
Well, you can tell Mr. Shaw how much
I appreciate the chance he gave me.

949
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,798
Under the circumstances
I can't accept it.

950
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,117
Oh, but Lester you can't throw away
your whole musical career.

951
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,956
My musical career is over.
Here, I'll never touch it again.

952
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,517
Oh, he said "I didn't know."

953
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,273
Poor Mr. Chisholm.
- Poor Mr. Chisholm

954
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,912
Poor Mr. Chisholm
played on the mandolin

955
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,358
But he couldn't win
Cos he tried to swing

956
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,438
And he broke a string
every time.

957
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,836
Oh, he says -
"I'd better be going."

958
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:56,358
Poor Mr. Chisholm.
Just couldn't dig the jive.

959
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,478
When he did arrive
at the proper note - he...

960
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,355
Now look Ellen.

961
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,230
Now, this is all
for the best

962
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,753
What we did may have
been a little drastic.

963
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,114
Yes, it may seem
a little brutal at first.

964
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,956
But you'll thank us
for it later.

965
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,033
So I'll thank you for it.

966
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,037
I suppose that Artie'll
thank you for it too.

967
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,999
Artie?
What do you mean, Artie?

968
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,513
What's Artie got to do
with Mr. Chisholm?

969
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,033
Nothing.
Nothing in the world.

970
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,997
He was only the backer
of the concert.

971
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,716
Concert?

972
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,795
Oh!

973
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,835
Alright, let's go again.
Shh!

974
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,069
Ellen, you've got
to listen to me.

975
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,389
There's only one thing
I've got to do.

976
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:44,792
Tell Artie the concert is off. Then
leave town by the first train I can get.

977
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,428
Ellen, you can't. I'm awfully
sorry about all this trouble.

978
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,512
I wouldn't hurt you for the world.
You know how I feel about you.

979
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,910
Remember the other night,
when I took the vocal?

980
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,430
I wasn't kidding.

981
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,758
There's one part I remember -
the merry-go-round I'll lead you.

982
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,833
You weren't kidding.
- That's over, the merry-go-round is out.

983
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,473
No, Danny. It's too late.
- No, it isn't.

984
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,591
Go back in and act
as if nothing's happened -

985
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,750
I'll have Chisholm
back here in an hour.

986
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,670
What can you do?

987
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,553
Don't worry. Just don't say anything
to Shaw until I get back.

988
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,590
What can I say?

989
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,836
You can do it. Give me an hour.

990
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,231
Alright, Danny.
One hour.

991
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,510
That's right.

992
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,517
Hurry up,
he's checking out.

993
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,553
What 20,000?

994
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,073
Oh, that 20,000.

995
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,434
Send it back
to Cinncinnatta.

996
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,709
I'm going back
there myself.

997
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,315
On second thought,
Joe, you just leave it where it is.

998
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,718
You bounder.
Leave this room immediately.

999
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,558
Mr. Chisholm, I brought
you your mandolin.

1000
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,039
I won't listen.
Leave this room.

1001
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,191
Take it easy. You're going to listen
whether you want to or not.

1002
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,839
We've come
to clear Ellen's name.

1003
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,991
I won't hear her name
mentioned in my presence.

1004
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,599
Oh, now don't
say that, Mr. Chisholm.

1005
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,470
Who are you?

1006
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,477
I'm a man who
wants to see justice done.

1007
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,673
Alright, talk.
- No, I can't.

1008
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,399
Come clean.
- Alright.

1009
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,476
Mr. Chisholm,
I have a confession to make.

1010
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,077
I've never done this before
in my life. I lied to you.

1011
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,389
Go on.
- Alright.

1012
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,869
Ellen is innocent.

1013
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,956
Innocent?
I saw with my own eyes.

1014
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,433
He framed her deliberately.

1015
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,438
Impulsively.
I am not Ellen's husband.

1016
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,074
I know that.
Who are you?

1017
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,315
Me?

1018
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,398
He's her -
her brother, Hank.

1019
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,154
Brother?
Aren't you ashamed?

1020
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,430
Yes.

1021
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,388
Why did you endeavor
to create this false impression?

1022
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,871
I - I - I was trying
to protect her.

1023
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,597
Hit it.

1024
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,792
(Rapid dialogue)
We didn't know who you were.

1025
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,989
And how much
you meant to her.

1026
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,236
You're just about
the most important man in her life.

1027
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,318
Oh, I didn't realize.
Oh, what have I done?

1028
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,550
You've acted shabbily.

1029
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,438
You have misjudged
a wonderful girl.

1030
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,953
Jumped to brutal
conclusions.

1031
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,429
Oh, dear. Do you think
she'll ever forgive me?

1032
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,670
Well, there's a chance -
if you go about it in the right way.

1033
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,592
Yes, if you crawl back
to her on your hands and knees.

1034
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,113
And beg her
to forgive and forget.

1035
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,472
Oh, I will. Do you think this will interfere
with letting me back the concert?

1036
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,434
Well, I don't think so.

1037
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,028
No. Ellen isn't small.
But you'd better hurry.

1038
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,674
Oh, I will. I'll get my hat
and gloves.

1039
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,633
Er, you make yourselves
at home.

1040
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,479
Poor Mr. Chisholm.

1041
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,830
Well, we've finally
done right by our Ellen.

1042
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,750
It's about time.

1043
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,315
Yeah. Makes you
feel good, doesn't it?

1044
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,076
You know, self-sacrifice,
doing unto others.

1045
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:21,911
That's the life.

1046
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,798
Yeah, but a little self-sacrifice
goes a long way.

1047
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,798
We ought to think of our
own careers for a change.

1048
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,473
After all, we are the intimate friends
of Shaw's backer.

1049
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,396
No, we mustn't use Chisholm.

1050
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,990
We owe it to Ellen not to
take any more chances.

1051
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,799
Oh, no. Ellen won't respect
a couple of failures.

1052
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,228
It's true if it wasn't for us
the concert would be off.

1053
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,994
Certainly.
He owes us a break.

1054
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,000
Here I go. Boys, if there's ever
anything I can do.

1055
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,236
Nonsense, Mr. Chisholm.
We're glad to do a good turn.

1056
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,759
If there's anything
we can do for you.

1057
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,313
Oh, you've already
done enough.

1058
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,273
Oh, I mean helping you
select numbers for the concert

1059
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,150
and that sort of thing.

1060
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,271
You see, I don't select
the numbers for the concert.

1061
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,192
Why, I hardly dare
venture an opinion.

1062
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,196
But you should.

1063
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,078
After all,
I'm only the backer.

1064
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,036
Only the backer?

1065
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,156
Why, Mr. Chisholm,
you're the impresario.

1066
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,555
The most important man
in the entire organization.

1067
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,233
You've got to be
the guiding hand.

1068
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,116
Choose the music.

1069
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:19,911
Pick the men.

1070
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,597
It's your duty.

1071
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,318
Think of the other backers.
You're letting them down.

1072
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,316
You're letting Shaw down.

1073
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,439
This is terrible. Why didn't anyone
ever tell me this before?

1074
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,750
Why, I would have been
delighted to do it.

1075
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,677
It's not too late.
- Not if you work fast.

1076
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,155
I don't know which way to start.
What would you suggest?

1077
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,912
First of all,
line up a number.

1078
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,588
That's a good idea,
but off-hand I can't think.

1079
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,352
Oh, sure you remember the...

1080
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,556
rolling-back-to-mammy-
on-the-big-river blues.

1081
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,036
Rolling back to mammy
on the big river blues.

1082
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,077
That's it, he's got it.
- He's got it.

1083
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,156
Now, don't be too hasty.

1084
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,992
Perhaps I can think
of something better.

1085
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,315
What about
a folk song?

1086
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,316
A folk song.

1087
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,999
I've got just the
number for you.

1088
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,155
Listen to this.

1089
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,869
Oh, you're gonna
like this Chis.

1090
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,077
This is back to the good earth,
full of sweep - play that, Danny.

1091
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,673
I like that.
What's it called?

1092
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,313
"Hoe-down the bayou."

1093
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,671
Do you hear that?
That's New Orleans.

1094
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,239
I visited there.
Three weeks.

1095
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,676
I don't recognize it.

1096
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,551
You don't?

1097
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,954
Well, that's the spirit
of New Orleans.

1098
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,309
I can almost smell
the Delta.

1099
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,589
I can smell the Delta.

1100
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,029
Can't you smell
the Delta?

1101
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,714
I have a slight cold.

1102
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,598
Well, nothing that
your mandolin won't cure.

1103
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,350
Now you pick this up,
Chis. Pick it up, boy.

1104
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,718
Yeah, yeah, come on, son.
The train won't wait.

1105
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,350
That's it.
Now, we're sailin' up that river

1106
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,592
on the Memphis, Chattanooga.
Hold on, Chis.

1107
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,749
Hear them steamboat whistles blowin.'
Tote that barge, pull that bale.

1108
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,238
There's a cabin in the cotton,
Solid South, solid North, solid Jack.

1109
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,351
Solid Jack.

1110
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,988
Right, wagon wheels-a-creakin'
Westward.

1111
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,869
Now, we're rollin' past that junction
on to Kansas, Cincinnatti.

1112
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,473
Cincinnatti, my home town.

1113
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,872
His hometown, your hometown,
everybody's hometown. Cincinatti!

1114
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,237
Boys, words fail me.
I must see Shaw at once.

1115
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,635
That's the spirit, Chisholm.
Don't let America down.

1116
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,794
You sure it's my duty
as a backer?

1117
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,636
You can do anything.

1118
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,158
Anything?

1119
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:11,877
Certainly.

1120
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,390
Alright. I'll not only see that this
epic-making number of yours

1121
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,398
is given the finest presentation
in the world, but I'll go further.

1122
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,394
I'll play in it myself -
on my mandolin.

1123
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,717
What?

1124
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,478
A rhythm in letter B.
I'll set the tempo at C.

1125
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,036
Trombones make a definite entrance.
Saxes come in good and strong,

1126
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,474
and strings pick it up
from there.

1127
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,274
Ellen, can you ever forgive me?
- Oh Lester.

1128
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,551
I know I don't deserve it. I've let you
down in more ways than one.

1129
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,797
But I'm going to make up
for it right now.

1130
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,798
Shaw, can I see you
a minute.

1131
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,031
Hi!
Take ten, fellas.

1132
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,352
Hello Mr. Chisholm
glad you dropped in.

1133
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,790
I didn't just drop in Mr. Shaw.
Sit down please. And you Ellen.

1134
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,152
I realized I've shirked my duties
but I've got something to make up for it.

1135
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,356
A folk song for the concert,
it'll kill you.

1136
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,436
Folk song?

1137
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,556
It's got everything.
The sweep of the prairies,

1138
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,597
creaking of wagons,
the Mississippi.

1139
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,517
Sounds peachy.

1140
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,069
It goes like this.

1141
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,117
Da da da da da.

1142
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,909
Hoe down the bayou.

1143
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,195
Can't you smell the delta?

1144
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,557
(Whistles)

1145
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,114
Chattanooga, Louisiana,
solid North, solid South.

1146
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,519
Hoe down boy, hoo!
That's the steamboat whistle.

1147
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,873
That's my home town, your home
town, everybody's home town.

1148
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,955
Cincinatta!

1149
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,036
Are you kidding?

1150
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,115
It'll sweep the country.

1151
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,912
I insist that you play it
at the concert.

1152
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,679
(Overlapping)
If that's the way you feel about...

1153
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,673
Prairies, wagons, steamboat whistles.
- That's its sweep.

1154
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,268
Listen Artie I've heard part of it.
It's not a bad song.

1155
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,439
How can I tell from that?
Get me someone who can play it.

1156
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,154
I'll get you the composer himself.
He's right outside, right away.

1157
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,676
I fixed it.

1158
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,352
Good boy Chis.

1159
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,077
You've done
a great job.

1160
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,389
Go in there and give 'em
all you've got.

1161
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,358
Maybe we'd better explain
about our secret.

1162
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,835
I could back you up
on the mandolin.

1163
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,995
No, no, no. Save it.

1164
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,479
You don't want to give
away the big surprise.

1165
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,675
No practice comes first.

1166
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,159
Besides you're no
song plugger.

1167
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,754
Would Heifetz go around
selling songs to band leaders?

1168
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,753
That's fine I'll stand by
and explain it as you play it.

1169
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,716
Er...

1170
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,952
We'd better stay out here, too many
people might make Shaw nervous.

1171
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,559
Well I might be needed.

1172
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,230
Come on down the lobby,
I'll buy you a cigar.

1173
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,110
I don't like cigars.

1174
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,998
Don't you worry about it
I'll smoke it myself.

1175
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,799
Artie he'll be here
in a minute.

1176
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,712
I know but I'm holding up
a whole rehearsal Ellen.

1177
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,750
Hello Mr. Shaw.

1178
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,832
Oh, it's you again,
huh?

1179
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,428
I guess so.

1180
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,474
You aren't going
to let something that's over

1181
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,511
stand in the way
of a good song?

1182
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,799
OK. Let's hear it, this better be good.
- Yes sir.

1183
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,348
Poor Mr. Chisholm played
on the mandolin.

1184
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,231
But he couldn't win.

1185
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,349
'Cos he tried to swing
and he broke a string, every time.

1186
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,437
Poor Mr. Chisholm
just couldn't dig the jive.

1187
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,635
When he did arrive
at the proper note,

1188
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,598
he arrived by boat,
every time.

1189
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,790
He tried to jazz up
his mandolin.

1190
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,351
But never could
quite control it.

1191
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,515
He always brought
Bach and Handel in.

1192
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,276
When he took a lick,
he always broke a pick.

1193
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,590
Poor Mr. Chisholm
you're quite a gay old blade

1194
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,359
with your serenade.

1195
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,198
But you're corny Jack,

1196
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,557
better truck on back
to the buke.

1197
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,394
Get a uke.

1198
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,909
You disgraced your kin
on the mandolin, every time.

1199
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,470
Did you like the tune Artie?
- Kinda cute.

1200
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,951
Make an arrangement of it
and maybe we can find a spot for it.

1201
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,189
But remember
no trouble this time.

1202
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,992
Don't worry Mr. Shaw.
And thanks a lot.

1203
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,795
Mr. Chisholm playing a mandolin,
that'll really be something.

1204
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,077
Alright Ben,
call the boys.

1205
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,911
I'm within the hour.
Chilsholm is back.

1206
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,429
I'm making an arrangement.
You see Ellen I've settled down.

1207
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,635
The merry-go-round's out.

1208
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,553
Out nothing, you just happen
to get the brass ring.

1209
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,476
This is your big chance, Danny.
- I hope.

1210
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,991
Did he understand it?
- Did he go for it?

1211
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,554
Hook, line and Cincinatti.
- Nice going boy!

1212
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,278
Wonderful!
Calls for a celebration.

1213
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,549
Attaboy Danny.

1214
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,668
Fellow artists, I give you the concert.
- We accept it.

1215
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,199
Lester we're proud
of you.

1216
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,675
Oh Ellen,
I'm only the backer.

1217
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,393
That's a very important
role Lester.

1218
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,630
It's not as though
I was a real contributor,

1219
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,631
as though I was one
of the performers.

1220
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,036
Well, now look...
We just about killed this bottle.

1221
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,957
What kind of a host are you?
How about a refill?

1222
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,036
Oh excuse me,
of course, of course.

1223
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,434
Oh, you won't tell her
while I'm gone?

1224
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,193
Not a chance.
- Don't worry about it.

1225
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,435
Lester, wait a minute,
tell me what?

1226
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,988
It's just a little surprise. Let's tell her.
I'm gonna play in the concert.

1227
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,675
Lester you're not.

1228
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,796
Well I am,
I knew you'd be delighted.

1229
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,076
What am I standing here for?
Wine is what we need, wine.

1230
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,116
So the merry-go-round
is still on?

1231
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,316
We couldn't help it,
all we did was flatter him a bit.

1232
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,078
If we disillusioned him,
he'd call the whole thing off.

1233
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,555
What do you suppose Shaw will do?
- Shaw will never find out.

1234
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,954
Hank's going to keep
Chisholm away from him.

1235
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,638
Me? Oh no!

1236
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,869
But I'll be busy
with my arrangement.

1237
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,072
Alright I'll make a bargain
with you.

1238
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,509
You get me a job with Shaw
with a nice fat trumpet part

1239
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,749
and I'll look after
Chisholm.

1240
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,273
Oh sure.
I'll do my best.

1241
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,670
You'll do better
than that or else.

1242
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,598
(Applause)

1243
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,116
That'll get 'em Artie.
- Oh, it was wonderful.

1244
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,355
Glad you like it.

1245
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,469
Here's my
arrangement.

1246
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,477
Oh fine. You make all the
changes we talked about.

1247
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,750
Yeah, but I don't know
how good it'll sound after that.

1248
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,155
Artie, there's one little favor
I want to ask you.

1249
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,550
You're gonna use some extra
trumpets. I know a fella that...

1250
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,552
Not that partner of yours,

1251
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,989
that guy can't get through number
without falling off the stand.

1252
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,789
Nothin' doin', period.
We'll run over this in the morning.

1253
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,196
Danny, what are we going to do
about poor Hank?

1254
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,117
It's going to be tough
but we'll keep on trying.

1255
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,157
Ninety-six, two, three, seven...
Two, three... ninety-eight...

1256
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:13,389
Two, three, ninety-nine... Two, three
and one hundred and stop.

1257
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,313
One hundred times
without a slip.

1258
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,996
No, no. You were pretty fuzzy
on thirty-seven.

1259
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,039
You were a quarter
beat off on seventy-six.

1260
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,755
Now you take one more
hundred and we'll turn in.

1261
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,911
No, now it's just two days
before the concert.

1262
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,632
I'd better go down
and tell Artie our secret.

1263
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,753
No not yet.
It's too late tonight anyhow.

1264
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,115
It isn't, the band's
staying late to rehearse.

1265
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,958
You haven't
practiced enough.

1266
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,953
I've practiced for ten days,
twelve hours a day,

1267
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,634
six hours a night.
I'll go stale.

1268
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,875
Are you ready?

1269
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,356
One... Two...

1270
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,155
Tonight at 8:30,

1271
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,352
Artie Shaw will present an interesting
newcomer to the musical world.

1272
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,790
Interesting newcomer
that must mean me.

1273
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,675
What?
Yes sure, sure, sure.

1274
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,236
Henry, are you worried
about the rehearsal?

1275
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,432
Me no.
Is it worrying you?

1276
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,275
Not at all. There are few troubles
that a good nights sleep won't cure.

1277
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,158
Look you watch
your own health,

1278
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,555
I've got insomnia.

1279
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,310
Insomnia, that's too bad
you should er...

1280
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,316
(Knock on door)

1281
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,151
Come in.

1282
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,149
Good afternoon
Mr. Chisholm.

1283
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,197
Hello,
well what about a drink?

1284
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:29,877
Good idea.

1285
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,560
I'll be right back.
I just want to spruce up a bit.

1286
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,753
Hello. Give me
the Majestic Theatre, will you?

1287
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,268
It's better so...

1288
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,236
What? What's that?
What about her?

1289
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,631
Yeah. Wait a minute, excuse me Chis,
this is a personal matter.

1290
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,352
Say Danny you wouldn't lie to me
at a time like this, would you?

1291
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,194
It's all set, you're in!
You gotta' get down here right away.

1292
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,119
Well this makes up for
a lot of things Danny.

1293
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,753
What Chisholm?

1294
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,915
Wait a minute don't you worry
about Chisholm.

1295
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,437
I just got a plan
to keep him here.

1296
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,034
You bet, so long.

1297
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,670
Good news?
- It depends on your point of view.

1298
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,512
One man's drink is
another man's poison.

1299
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,070
Yeah... Well Henry everything
happens for the best.

1300
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,114
You know it's always
darkest just before dawn.

1301
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,077
S'right.

1302
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,959
The lad worthwhile is the lad
who can smile

1303
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,315
when the rest of the word's
gone wrong.

1304
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,873
Right, right as rain.

1305
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,119
We'll have it over here.

1306
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,797
Henry if ever anything
comes between us,

1307
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,354
always remember I had your
best interest at heart.

1308
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,959
That cuts both ways
partner.

1309
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,715
Well happy days.
- Happy dreams.

1310
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,319
Bottoms up.

1311
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,870
Bottoms up.

1312
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,278
There must be
some answer.

1313
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,835
Well never mind.

1314
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,559
I can't raise Hank anywhere.

1315
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,274
He'll never believe
I didn't have anything to do with this.

1316
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,074
Last week I'd been sure
you had, but this week no.

1317
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,475
You know you're improving
so amazingly Danny

1318
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,557
I think I'll make you
my manager.

1319
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,796
Thank you.

1320
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,716
Ladies and gentlemen
we have a little blues number,

1321
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,116
which recently came to my attention
bearing the somewhat ambiguous title,

1322
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,799
"Hoedown the Bayou".

1323
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,431
Since then it has grown up and been
transformed into something special.

1324
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,592
Before playing it, I'd like to introduce
the man who wrote it: Danny O'Neil.

1325
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,517
Go on.

1326
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,591
How do you feel?

1327
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:46,631
Alright.

1328
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,917
OK. It's all yours.

1329
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,750
Danny you were
wonderful.

1330
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,030
Nice work Danny!
I'm gonna' have to hire you after all.

1331
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:40,718
Thanks Artie.

1332
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,633
Only because I don't want
to lose a good secretary.

1333
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,434
(Crowd)
Artie Shaw, Artie Shaw!

1334
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,755
Nobody.

1335
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:03,558
Ninety-nine... One hundred...
Take it again.

1336
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,994
I hope in your horoscope
there is room for a dope,

1337
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,315
who adores you.

1338
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,714
Vas goot!

1339
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,792
Vas perfect!
