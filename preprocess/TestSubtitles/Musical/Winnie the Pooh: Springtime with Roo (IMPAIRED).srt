[CHUCKLES] Hello, Roo.

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,806
Are you gonna tell a story
about Winnie the Pooh?

Oh, then who's it about?

I'm going to Rabbit's
for the Easter egg hunt, Mama.

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,411
It certainly is a
beautiful day for it.

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,003
Me and Tigger are gonna find every
egg in the Hundred Acre Wood.

I'm sure you will, dear, but
first come and eat your breakfast.

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,520
If I find any pink eggs,
I'm giving them to Piglet.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,568
The pink ones are his favorite.

You're gonna make him very happy.

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,446
I sure hope so. And I'm
gonna bring you a blue one,

Well, you better eat up then.

You can't hunt eggs
on an empty stomach.

That's what
Winnie the Pooh says, too.

And he's exactly right.

Just a little something
to help you find Eastery eggs.

60
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,529
First a compass, so you'll
know where you are.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,443
A backpack for Eastery eggs.

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,488
Rope for whatnots,
and in case you don't need a knot.

And my lovely Easter honey pot.

Wouldn't be Easter without
my super stripety Eastery egg.

Your detailed list of chores and

But, Rabbit, today's the day that
I always get my very special...

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,529
Mop and bucket,
that's right, Pooh.

123

Now, step lively, everyone.
Can't afford to dilly-dally.

- Now, we can go celebrate...
- Enough chit-chat, Roo. [LAUGHS]

- No, no.
- But it's such a pretty day outside.

Yes, and it will be
just as pretty inside.

As long as you all do exactly

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,686
as I say.

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,246
Oh, pay attention now, everyone.

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,891
The theme for this year is,

"Spic and Span for Spring."

Kinda catchy,

Now, if you'd all direct your attention
to this scale model I've created.

Oh, please excuse
the rudimentary workmanship.

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,610
I just threw it together
at the last minute.

139

When I give the signal,

140

you will disperse to your
assigned cleaning stations.

141

Tigger, Piglet, Pooh.

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,163
You'll dust, sweep, mop and scrub.
And don't spare the soap.

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,163
You can never be too clean,
you know.

On the floor, go with the grain.
Always...

this could be a honey pot?

Do you?

147
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,366
No, Pooh, I don't suppose.

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,484
Empty. Not even a smackerel.

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,122
And Eeyore, your job is to sweep
all the soot out of the chimney.

Yes. What is it, Pooh?

153
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,162
Well, this honey pot appears
to be rather, um,

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,046

You can't possibly do
these things out of order.

627
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,768
I don't mind if
it's not decorated.

628
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,729
No! No! No!

629
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,009
Perhaps I should explain to our new
guest how we do things around here.

630
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,164
<i>For our yearly Easter fun
We use the checklist, number one</i>

631
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,881
<i>We get the eggs, then we lay them out
Like so, number two</i>

632
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,089
<i>We color them and dye them
Then we take them out and dry them</i>

633
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,363
<i>And we line them up precisely
In a row</i>

634
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,603
<i>Next we stack them and we pack them
Make a list so we can track them</i>

635
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,444
<i>Tie the ribbons,
stuff the baskets</i>

636
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,851
<i>When it's done</i>

637
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,208
<i>Then we count them out precisely
And we decorate them nicely</i>

638
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,523
<i>And when all of that is finished
We'll have fun</i>

639
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,400
<i>'Cause that's the way
It must be done, see</i>

640
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,051
<i>From step one, see,
that's how we win</i>

641
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,761
<i>We have to be aware to
Start to prepare to</i>

642
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,650
<i>Commence to get ready to begin!</i>

643
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,803
Oh, dear.
Now, shall we get to work?

644
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,927
Me, first.

645
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,287
I have all the jobs
assigned here on my clipboard.

646
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,164
- I'll take this one.
- I'll do the basket.

647
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,480
Wait a minute.

648
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,289
<i>- I'll paint this red!
- No, blue!</i>

649
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,771
<i>- I'll take this egg!
- No, that's for Pooh.</i>

650
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,520
<i>- I'll use this brush.
- That's not for you.</i>

651
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,403
<i>- I'll tie the bow.
- No, that's for Roo.</i>

652
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,811
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

653
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,325
<i>You take the scissors
and the glue</i>

654
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,131
<i>How 'bout we paint this something
new, like maybe stripes!</i>

655
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,202
<i>- Me, too!
- No, no, no, no!</i>

656
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,169
<i>Stop having fun!</i>

657
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,562
<i>We have to systemize, prioritize
Coordinate and organize</i>

658
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,881
<i>Or else we'll never
ever get this done!</i>

659
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,049
<i>We need order, concentration</i>

660
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,010
<i>This situation needs
focus, control</i>

661
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,163
<i>We're painting and drying
And packing and tying</i>

662
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,084
<i>Get together or we'll
never reach the goal!</i>

663
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,049
<i>- I'll paint this red
- We need order</i>

664
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,804
<i>- Or maybe blue
- Concentration</i>

665
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,850
<i>- I'll stuff the baskets!
- I'll dry these two</i>

666
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,649
<i>- I'll tie the ribbon
- Painting, drying</i>

667
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,324
<i>- I'll write the card
- Packing, tying</i>

668
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,607
<i>- We can do it, nothing to it
- Look at us</i>

669
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,842
<i>We're almost through it</i>

670
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,405
- I got the baskets.
- Stripes.

671
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,970
You're not doing it right!

672
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,087
Hold on.

673
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,721
Stop!

674
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,925
There! Do you see
what you were doing?

675
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,721
Well, ain't it oblivious?
Everybody was havin' fun!

676
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,643
Humph. Is that so?

677
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,768
Oh, I see your point.

678
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,730
- Everybody was havin' fun but you.
- [GASPS]

679
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,882
But there was plenty
of fun to go around.

680
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,724
What did you have to stop us for?

681
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,327
[STAMMERS]
Well, I didn't have a choice.

682
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,323
It was complete and utter chaos.

683
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,562
A disaster in the making.

684
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,769
Yes, yes, that's it.

685
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,525
You were completely
out of control.

686
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,570
That's why I had
to put my foot down.

687
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,884
I think you all need a remedial
lesson on the rules of Easter!

688
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,930
There certainly are
an awful lot of rules, Rabbit.

689
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,562
I'm sorry. But I'm the Easter bunny,
so I make the rules!

690
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,887
And rule number one is,

691
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,887
the Easter egg hunt does not begin
until the Easter bunny says so!

692
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,362
That, of course, would be, uh...

693
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,051
Me.

694
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,806
Where did they get off to now?

695
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,206
- Found another!
- Good boy!

696
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,285
Oh, how pretty.

697
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,807
[ROO] Hey, look! Here's some more.
[EEYORE] Prettiest egg I ever saw.

698
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,770
[TIGGER] Boy, you're a good Eastery
egg finder. Watch this, guys!

699
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,366
[HUMMING]

700
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,522
Nice catch there, Roo boy.

701
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,250
Just lucky, I guess!

702
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,687
Luck had nothing to do with it.

703
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,047
Just look at all them eggsies.
[LAUGHS]

704
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,090
Roo boy, you are a natural.

705
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,322
I did it just like you taught me.

706
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,449
First, you sneak up on 'em,

707
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,284
and then you bounce!

708
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,045
Just like I taught him.

709
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,326
[SOBS]

710
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,842
[ROO] Look, look! Another one!
[EEYORE] I think I found another one.

711
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,127
[PIGLET] Come on, Roo!
[ROO] Over there.

712
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,204
[TIGGER] Here, I found one, too.
[ROO] Here's some more.

713
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,725
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

714
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,444
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Here's some more!

715
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,170
So many eggs!

716
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,884
Mm, yes, and so much honey!
[CHUCKLES]

717
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,247
Kinda tickles.

718
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,087
Roo boy, I think you're just about
the bestest Eastery egg hunter, ever!

719
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,687
And you gave me
the greatest Easter, Tigger!

720
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,481
So, I guess that makes you
the best Easter bunny ever.

721
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,609
- But what about me?
- [ROO] Hooray for Tigger!

722
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,251
I'm the Easter bunny!

723
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,967
You're bunny number one.

724
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,324
[EEYORE] Hooray.

725
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,930
How could they have Easter

726
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,564
without me?

727
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,722
[TIGGER]
Well, anybody could have done it.

728
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,643
[ROO] Three cheers for Tigger.

729
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,604
[GRUNTING]

730
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,002
Every spring,

731
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,044
I look forward to
one thing most of all.

732
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,204
Being the Easter bunny.

733
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,690
You took that away from me.

734
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,081
Well, we... We never
meant to hurt you, Rabbit.

735
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,528
We were just trying to
give Roo a happy Easter.

736
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,406
I mean, didn't you want to
give him a happy Easter, too?

737
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,608
Go away, Tigger.

738
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,523
I want to be alone.

739
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,208
Well, I guess I better
tell Roo the bad news.

740
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,247
We're never going to have
another Eastery egg hunt...

741
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,760
[GULPS]

742
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,651
Again.

743
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,882
<i>- [NARRATOR] Rabbit.</i>
- What?

744
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,009
Why are you following me?
What do you want?

745
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,844
<i>Would you like to see more?</i>

746
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,402
No, I've seen enough.
I want to go home.

747
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,881
<i>Very well, Rabbit. Go on then.</i>

748
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,647
<i>While Rabbit makes his way home,</i>

749
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,691
<i>perhaps we should also return
to the present day.</i>

750
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,206
<i>It seems that while
we were away,</i>

751
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,409
<i>Roo and the gang
have been hard at work!</i>

752
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,642
- [KANGA] Roo, dear.
- Hi, Mama.

753
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,041
I thought you might like a break.

754
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,487
What exactly are you doing?

755
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,166
- We're getting ready for Easter!
- [GRUNTING]

756
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,322
Is that a rock?

757
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,607
Well, we were all out of eggs.

758
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,160
So we're hunting for
Easter rocks instead!

759
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,607
My goodness,
you've certainly been busy!

760
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,682
We're practicing,
so when Tigger gets back,

761
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,206
we'll be ready to go
on our Easter egg hunt.

762
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,563
Guess you could call
it spring training.

763
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,247
Look, Mama!
We even made new decorations.

764
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,642
The old decorations kinda
got broken by Rabbit.

765
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,004
Oh. So, when does
the official celebration begin?

766
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,526
As soon as Tigger gets back
from Rabbit's.

767
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,649
[GASPS] There he is! Tigger!

768
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,801
Oof!

769
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,723
Did you talk to him? Did ya?

770
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,406
Yeah, we kinda sorta talked.

771
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,370
So, we're gonna have Easter now.

772
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,488
Right, Tigger?

773
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,721
Tigger?

774
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,407
Well, it's probably best
to get right to the point

775
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,805
in the most briefest and
directificated manner possible, so...

776
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,770
Um, the answer is no.

777
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,760
Does that mean
Rabbit's still not happy?

778
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,364
But, Why?

779

We're sorry we ruined your Eas...

Um, Springity Cleanin' Day.

heard him say "Eas."

Now, what could he possibly
have meant by that?

You can't have
Easter without all this!

Why, it wouldn't be Easter
without your stripedy egg, Tigger.

1016
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,369
Or your honey pot, Pooh.

1017
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,291
And I believe this is your
lovely basket, Piglet.

1018
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,288
And Eeyore, here are
your fluffy bunny ears.

1019
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,729
And I even made you a tail to match!

And Roo! Didn't think
I'd forgotten you, did you?

1022
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,444
I believe I owe you

1023

an Easter egg hunt!

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,402
No way.

Easter! That's what!

1032
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,365
Now Tigger, [CLEARS THROAT]

1033
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,207
I thought perhaps you might
like to lead the Easter egg hunt!

1034
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,250
- But, Rabbit...
- No buts! I'm the Easter bunny,

1035
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,608

Rule number one is...

00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,682

You can't have Easter!

00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,809
What I mean is...

1041
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,643
You can't have Easter

1042
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,643

1043
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,971
Is that my Easter bunny hat?

1044
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,809
For our one and only Easter bunny!

Hooray for Ra-Ra!

00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,521
I came here this morning to
give you a very special Easter.

1048
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,681
But,

1049
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,926
you've given me
the grandest Easter ever!

1050
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,086
Now, what do you say
we go hunt some Easter eggs?

1051
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,845
- Think you can teach me?
- Yeah! Come on!

1052
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,207
First you sneak up on 'em,

1053
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,686
and then you bounce!

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,650
Well, I would like to explain.

But I can't.

1059
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,769
You see, Rabbit isn't who he was
on the holiday that wasn't,

1060
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,401
and he is who he wasn't
on the holiday that was.

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,801
So there you have it,
