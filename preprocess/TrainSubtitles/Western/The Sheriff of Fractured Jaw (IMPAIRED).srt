-l have a pair, Mr. Mayor.

594
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,713
-All right, you bet.
-Me to bet. Uh. . . .

595
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,156
Two, uh. . . .

596
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,157
More? All right.

597
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,912
Four. Thanks, partner.

598
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,799
Four, l raise you four, gentlemen.
Four silver dollars.

599
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,111
-Four dollars and you in?
-l'm in.

600
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,392
What do you say, boys?
What do you say?

601
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,034
Raise you five.

602
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,559
Man raises you five.

603
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,673
l'll raise you five, sir.

604
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,199
-Are you done betting?
-Yeah.

605
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,430
All right, hold it, coming out.

606
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,517
A nine.

607
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,717
A seven.

608
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,871
-Have it out between you.
-l'm to bet, l'm--

609
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,431
-A pair of deuces are still high.
-l think l'll go, um--

610
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,439
Six. Six, l raise you six.

611
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,234
Man bets $6. He sees you.

612
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,271
-Okay, what have you got?
-Pair of sixes.

613
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,158
A pair of sixes.

614
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,557
Three twos. And, gentlemen,
l think the pot is mine.

615
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,312
Take it away, sheriff, it's yours.

616
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,909
Thank you, partner.
Well done, indeed.

617
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,350
-A double snort, Chick.
-Right.

618
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,950
Hey. You see that fella over there?

619
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,879
-That's Bud Wilkins, Lazy S gunslinger.
-What?

620
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,593
Yeah, he's wearing a gun.

621
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,797
-Well, obviously if he's a slinger.
-Well, go take it off him.

622
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,191
Maybe he ain't heard
we got us a sheriff now.

623
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,155
Oh, well, l'll advise him.
That's the least l can do.

624
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,157
Your pardon, gentlemen.

625
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,230
-So you're the new sheriff.
-New, indeed.

626
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,630
l heard you ain't allowing guns
in Fractured Jaw.

627
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,837
The ruling isn't mine,
l'm merely the custodian of the law.

628
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,312
You're gonna take away
a man's gun?

629
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,274
Let's just say a chap hands it over when
he's advised of the regulations, eh?

630
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,552
l heard about you,
so maybe you heard about me.

631
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,711
l'm Wilkins.
l come to have you take my gun.

632
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,598
Well, how do you do?
Tibbs is my name.

633
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,751
All right.
You got the drop on me this time.

634
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,031
But l'm coming back.

635
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,908
And next time, l won't be alone.

636
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,232
Mr. Bud, don't forget your gun.

637
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,512
There's no law against wearing it
if you're leaving town.

638
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,394
That's the stuff, sheriff.

639
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,830
lt's remarkable, the effect this has.

640
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,950
See? How do you do?

641
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,918
That's the quickest draw l've seen
in 50 years.

642
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,190
Sheriff, the way
you handled that derringer...

643
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,033
...would make my old grandpappy
turn over in his grave.

644
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,912
l say, do you think so?

645
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,190
-lt does work well, doesn't it?
-lt sure does.

646
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,272
Say, how about you coming
into my office? l want to talk to you.

647
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,590
Oh, with pleasure.

648
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,195
Boys, l never thought
l'd live to see the day. . .

649
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,112
. . .when Bud Wilkins gives up his gun.

650
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,671
You sure are fast on the draw with
that gun, mister. How do you work it?

651
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,593
lt's on a spring. And when
l straighten my arm, it pops out.

652
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,150
Well, it should pop out into my hand.
lt must need some adjust-- There.

653
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,198
Say, you know,
l'd like to have one of them.

654
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,436
To wear on my garter.

655
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,311
Great Scott. l say.

656
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,353
Of course, you could have mine,
but wearing it on that limb. . .

657
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,954
. . .you'd be obliged to pull the trigger
with your toe.

658
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,078
You let me worry about that.
How much you take for it?

659
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,276
l'd be honored if you'd
accept it as a gift.

660
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,193
-No. l couldn't take your gun.
-No, really, l've got others.

661
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,316
-This is just a sample.
-No, no.

662
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,071
-There we are.
-Well, thank you, thank you.

663
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,669
You know,
you're not a bad sort of fellow.

664
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,351
Well, you needn't worry about accidents.
lt isn't loaded, of course.

665
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,630
What? You mean to tell me. . .

666
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,712
. . .you went up against Bud Wilkins
with an empty gun?

667
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,871
You think
l'd go around with a bullet in it?

668
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,635
The silly thing popped out in my hand.
l didn't mean to frighten Wilkins. . .

669
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,519
...although l imagine
it did have that effect.

670
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,117
Tell me, are you tired of living,
or just plain stupid?

671
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,038
Oh, now really, Miss Kate.

672
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,151
-Take it back.
-No, l wouldn't dream of it.

673
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,912
l made you a present.

674
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,270
Well, one of us must be crazy.

675
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,040
What happens
if some gunslinger draws on you?

676
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,312
Well, why should they?
l've no quarrel with anyone.

677
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,552
Only with the Lazy S, because
Wilkins will get them all riled up.

678
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,474
And with the Box T outfit, because
you got mixed up in Keeno's killing.

679
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,716
Oh, l do think you're exaggerating.

680
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,230
That chap Wilkins offered me
his gun before he saw the derringer.

681
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,399
And as for that poor fellow who got shot
last night, we were the best of friends. . .

682
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,154
. . .drinking together
and all that sort of thing.

683
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,388
l've seen some strange characters
in my time, but you take the prize.

684
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,354
You know, l've never met
anyone like you either.

685
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,951
l hope you won't mind if l say it,
but l find you simply enchanting.

686
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,148
Well, let's say
l find you different, anyway.

687
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,152
Well, that's a beginning, isn't it?

688
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,313
Say, what are you doing
in Fractured Jaw?

689
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,156
l represent the firm of Tibbs & Company,
gunsmiths, St. James's, London.

690
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,713
l'm here to sell firearms.

691
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,110
At least you should know
how to handle a gun.

692
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,510
That could keep you alive
for a little while.

693
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,709
Hm.

694
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,270
Well, l don't see why skill with a gun
should be so frightfully important.

695
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,954
But if it is to you,
l suppose l could learn.

696
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,199
-Tibbs, l just decided something.
-Oh?

697
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,795
l'm gonna teach you to shoot.

698
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,593
lt won't do any good, but at least l
won't be blaming myself at your funeral.

699
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,030
Now, listen to me
and try to understand.

700
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,231
l wouldn't give two cents
for your chances...

701
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,153
. . .of living to be one day older
than you are right now.

702
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,875
But l always had a soft spot in my heart
for a barefoot tenderfoot.

703
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,469
So l'll do what l can to help you.

704
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,717
l never thought l'd appreciate
being taught how to handle a gun.

705
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,077
-But it's wonderful of you to offer.
-l'm not asking for your thanks.

706
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,596
Personally, l think l'm weak in the head
to even bother. Now, come on.

707
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,314
-Shall l bring one of my own guns?
-No.

708
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,552
-ls there a target range nearby?
-lf there was, we wouldn't use it.

709
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,315
Nobody should know you can't shoot or
you won't live long enough for a lesson.

710
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,948
-Can you ride?
-l don't know, l've never really tried.

711
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,712
But l can handle a pair of horses.

712
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,555
lf it's any help, l asked that porter
to load my gun cases onto a carriage. . .

713
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,631
. . .so l can call on the trade
this morning.

714
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,513
KATE:
Well, that'll do.

715
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,792
-Morning, Miss Kate.
-Good morning.

716
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,234
Good morning, sir.

717
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,879
WOMAN 1 : Morning, sheriff.
-Good morning.

718
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,838
-Allow me, my lady.
-Well.

719
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,274
There we are.

720
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,237
MAN 1 : Morning, ma'am, sheriff.
-Good morning.

721
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,595
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sheriff.

722
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,109
How do you do, sir,
how do you do?

723
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,797
WOMAN 2: Good morning, sheriff.
-Morning, ma'am.

724
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,155
WOMAN 3: Good morning, sheriff.
MAN 2: Good morning, sheriff.

725
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,511
-Good morning.
MAN 3: Howdy, sheriff.

726
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,029
They're a friendly lot, aren't they?

727
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,471
They're happy.
They think they've got a sheriff.

728
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,355
You know, at first, l didn't take this
sheriff business too seriously. But now--

729
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,670
MAN 4: Hi, sheriff.
-Good morning.

730
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,717
You know, it's rather a nice feeling.

731
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,793
lt makes one feel good,
even a bit important.

732
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,716
Oh, you'll probably draw one of
the biggest crowds we ever had.

733
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,030
ln there.

734
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,068
Whoa.

735
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,191
Well, this looks purty good.

736
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,989
[KATE CHUCKLES]

737
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,795
-We're here to teach you to shoot.
-Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

738
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,238
Well.

739
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,592
See that?

740
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,674
See?

Mister, that's just about
the lowest thing a white man ever done.

1191
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,319
You ain't no better
than a skunk.

1192

in your head.

1193

-Why shouldn't l?

1200

a blood brother.

1201

not to use guns against white men.

1202
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,516
-You can't believe them.
-Oh, there's no need to feel disturbed.

1203
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,676
l'm on very familiar terms
with these men.

1204
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,479
Good heavens, we--
We call each other by our first names.

1205

''Good morning, Running Deer. ''

1206
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,190
''Cheerio, Fleet lron Hat. ''
l'm Fleet lron Hat.

1207
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,870
-Renegade.
-Oh, shut up!

1208
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,952
Don't you understand?
You've done the one unforgivable thing.

1209
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,839
Any man in the territory will
shoot you down on sight.

1210
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,157
Unless a bunch of them
get to you first and string you up.

1211
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,832
Oh. Oh.

1212
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,877
Well, l really seem to have let the cat
among the pigeons.

1213

-Doc, l hear tell they're on the way.
-lndians?

Worse. The Box T.
All of them riding toward town.

-lt's the Lazy S day.
-Great balls of fire.

1216

This town will be more full of holes
than a woodpecker's nest.

What on earth is happening?

1218
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,120
They'll start shooting
the minute they see each other.

1219
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,669
The only good thing is,
you might be in the middle.

1220
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,440
As for me, l'm hightailing it
for the hills.

-All right, we're leaving.
-We are?

1222
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,955
Give me a few minutes to throw
some things in a bag. You get packed.

1223
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,111
l'm not sure
l care about this running away.

1224
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,998
You stay, and you'll be carried away.

1225
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,675
Well, cowboys should be willing to listen
to reason the same as anyone else.

1226
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,072
Look, Jonathan. lt's me, Kate.
Not mad, no temper.

1227
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,430
For the first time in my life
l'm scared.

-Really?
-Scared for you.

You know, l always wanted to live
in Chicago or New York or even London.

1230
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,790
Now l don't care where we go,
just so long as it's away from here, fast.

1231

or England or even at the North Pole. . .

1234

Go on, fill her up, Chick.
Fill her up.

1235
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,755
When that fighting starts there won't be
a drop of liquor left in Fractured Jaw.

lt's a cinch there ain't gonna
be none where l'm heading.

-Yeah.

Well, Mister Sheriff, you sure
put your foot in it this time.

1240
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,114
This here town's apt to get
wiped off the map.

1241

And l've got to go out
and protect the innocent citizens.

And that, my friend,
is gonna take a heap of courage.

Run for your lives, take cover.

both coming to town at the same time.

-Hank!
-Yeah?

Better hitch up
that hearse of yours again.

a dead sheriff for sure.

but l got my doubts about that.

from being shot?

l don't know. Pretty handy with a gun.
Could've filled me full of holes.

1279
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,078
He had a message. Used a lot of words,
but he got it across.

1280
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,708
He says the Lazy S
is heading for trouble.

1281

He ain't the first lawman
who tried to throw his weight around.

He ain't the first lawman
to get killed neither. Nor the last.

-Boys riding into town today?
-We usually do on Saturday.

-Sure, boss.
-When we hit town, l'll get him.

When he starts, there will be
enough of us to see he don't finish.

Fractured Jaw ain't gonna have
a sheriff for long.
