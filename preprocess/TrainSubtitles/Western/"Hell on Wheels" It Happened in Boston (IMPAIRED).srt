out of the weather.

Glad you run off
from my railroad now?

496
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:06,682
Well, reckon it's better
than cholera.

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,820
No whiskey, not even no coffee.
What kind of folks is that?

500
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,355
I can't be seen talking to you,

501
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:15,190
but I need you back, all right?

502
00:30:15,224 --> 00:30:18,994
Rumor is they'll shoot us
if we try to run away.

503

I ain't seen it yet,
but just look yonder.

Yeah.

00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:27,870
Yeah.

506
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:29,605
It's about to get
a whole lot worse.

507
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:32,458
All kinds of shit's
about to get heaped on you, son.

508
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:34,126
You there!

00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:35,844

[Guns cock]

511
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:44,603
Oh, I found this mute boy
out on the prairie.

00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:47,055
Trying to get rid of him.
He one of yours?

513
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:48,690
- Has he papers?
- No.

514
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:50,109
Mostly he's got fleas
and rickets.

515
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:55,147
What's your name, stranger?

516
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:58,650
This ain't about me.
It's about the boy.

517
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:00,903
Yeah, well, there's something
about you I don't like.

518
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:02,788
Hell, there's something
about me

a lot of people don't like.

Didn't I tell you not to pull
that knife on church folk?

524
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,250
Sorry about that.

525
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:18,720

Good day to you.

Come on, Dutch.
Be brave.

They can't shoot all of you
at once.

528
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,729
If they don't shoot me
in the back,

I can't live like this anymore.

533
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,929
Malone sent a telegram
to Boston about me.

534

I've been running
my whole life, Mickey.

I don't wanna do it anymore.

I'm gonna do what's right.

538
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,700
I'm gonna confess myself

to Ruth in the church

540
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:29,190
and then turn myself in
to police for all I've done.

541
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:41,887
You turn yourself in
for what you done,

542
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:45,807
and you're turning me in
for what we done.

I don't care.

You've denied me too.

00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:55,150
You're as dead to me
as I am to you.

546
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:04,860
You'll hang, Sean.

547
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,614
I don't care anymore.

Hello, Ruth.

551
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:27,349
I've come to give confession.

552
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:34,806
You're a baptized
congregationalist now.

553
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:37,859
You should pray to God, not me.

554
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:44,700
Do you believe
a person can change, Ruth?

555
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:48,370
Make amends for the things
they've done?

556
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:56,578
I don't think

557
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:58,964
I've ever told you

558

about my mother.

I remember the day

561
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:17,349
she put us aboard the boat
in Cork,

562
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,769
my brother and me,

563
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:23,071
how she made me promise
to take care of him.

564
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:24,906
Why are you telling me this?

that Metcalf fellow.

589

I told him he should make
his confession to God

and turn himself in
to the police.

seeing him come this way.

And wh I got here,
he had his hands all over her.

to the murder of Metcalf,

has left.

for any reason,

When and if I choose
my hand to fall on you,

638

it will reach through the veil
of your incomprehension

not in some dark alley
