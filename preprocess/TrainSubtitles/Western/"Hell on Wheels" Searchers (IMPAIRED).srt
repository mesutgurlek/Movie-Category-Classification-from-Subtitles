No, sir.

I do know Mr. Durant
is about to leave town

163

on the noon coach...

Yeah.

Business elsewhere demands
my immediate attention,

I'm afraid.

00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:36,323
I trust the search will continue
in my absence.

173
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:39,376
That baby didn't go missing
till you got here.

[Scoffs]
Surely you're not suggesting

175
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,265
I had anything to do
with the child's abduction.

176
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,002
Never was one for coincidence.

177
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:52,473
Perhaps you'd like
to search my bag.

Our personal enmity aside,

180
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,513
my offer of the reward
is sincere.

181
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,017
If the child is found,
I will make good on the gold.

182
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:07,071
Mr. Bohannon, come quick.
It's, um--it's about the baby.

183
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,490
This here's
railroad property, Durant.

184

You come back, I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

Don't be surprised
if someday soon,

I return the favor.

he knows.

He as much as said so.

00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,384
Sean, if he knew,

191
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:41,688
you would have a hole
in your head right there.

and embrace it.

and then they was gone.

- Two horses all they took?
- And the tack.

199
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,579
Hell, the tack's worth
more than the horses.

they went straight south.

- but hell, he's half blind.
- Horse thieves.

out in broad daylight.

He's right. It doesn't sound
like rustling to me.

What I'm saying is, what would
horse thieves want with a baby?

need horses, sure.

- Drop my reins.

who these people are, Elam,
