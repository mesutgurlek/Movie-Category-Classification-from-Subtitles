00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,080
It just doesn't make any sense.

165
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,717
Why would anyone want
to shoot your papa?

166
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,421
To steal his money.

167
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,624
All Papa's savings were gone.

168
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,523
Are you sure?

169
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,503
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,005
I looked in Papa's hiding place.

171
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,907
There wasn't nothing in it
but an empty can.

172
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,380
Did you see anyone
or hear anything at your place?

173
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,307
I didn't stay to look.

174
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,511
I picked up Harge,

175
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:45,251
and I got out of there as fast
as I could get my things.

176
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,556
Well, you did the right thing.

177
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,960
I'll fix you a bite to eat.

178
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,560
When your uncle gets home,
we'll send for the sheriff.

179
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:04,236
Thank you, ma'am,
but I ain't hungry.

180
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,545
It's enough for you
to take care of Harge.

181
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,675
Old man Anderson
offered me a job last week.

182
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,576
With both my mama
and my papa dead...

183
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,086
I could take care of myself.

184
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,594
Your ma would be proud to hear
you talking like that.

185
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,089
Mama would understand.

186
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,972
If it doesn't work out
with Mr. Anderson,

187
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,205
you know that my sister's boy's
always welcome here.

188
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,102
I'll remember that.

189

Tell Uncle Calvin not to worry
about the funeral expenses.

190
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,620
I'll take care of it
out of my pay.

191
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,608
Take the spyglass.
You always wanted one.

192
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,111
Your uncle and I never use it.

193
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,126
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

194
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,151
Thank you very much.

195

MAN: Kalig!
They're on their way!

200
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,166
Kalig! The rest of Harge's men
are coming from the north.

201
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,509
MYRTLE, VOICE-OVER:
The Andersons,

202
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,514
taken in by Kalig's deception,

203
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,516
treated him like a son.

204
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,179
And Harge?
He grew up idolizing Kalig.

205
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,713
They were close.
Kalig took good care of Harge.

206
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,194
But later, Kalig entered
upon a career of crime,

207
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,026
taking Harge,
still a child, with him.

208
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:43,194
Always the memory of his mother
preyed upon Kalig's mind.

209
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,693
As Harge grew into manhood,
he organized his own gang...

210
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,707
during one of the many periods
Kalig was in prison.

211
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:54,201
It is my belief that during
those intervals of imprisonment,

212
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,148
Kalig began to brood
and nurse his revenge...

213
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,708
until he became obsessed with
making Harge suffer...

214
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,720
and pay for
their mother's death.

215
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,222
Although it became
apparent to others,

216
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,715
Harge was unable to see
Kalig for what he was:

217
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,254
A demented man enjoying
cruelty and destruction.

218
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,789

The room is empty without you.

Why is Harge making
such a fuss over this baby?

his mama when he was born.

Kind of a warm feeling, huh?

325
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,221
I have something to tell you.

326
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,986
- Where's the doctor?
- Out of town. Harge...

327
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,687
- Till when?
- Three, four days, maybe a week.

328
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:47,630
- Eva can't wait that long.
- Kids are born every day.

329
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,429
- Not my kid.
- I saw someone in Isleta.

330
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,095
- Who?
- The man you been looking for.

331
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,039
So he is. Kalig was right.

332
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,339
- You sure?
- It was him. I'm positive.

333
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,644
Well, get him!

334
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,620
- Harge?
- You bring him here to me.

335
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,215
Take Doud and Bassett.

336
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,767
- You should be resting.
- You must eat.

337
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,779
- How do you feel?
- Well, mi hijo.

338
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,943
Eva, there's not going to be
any doctor.

339
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,486
I can manage.

340
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,615
You're a good wife, Eva.
Sit down.

341
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,184
- What's for supper?
- Chilis rellenos.

342
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,098
I saw the men ride out.

343
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,428
It's not your brother Kalig
again, is it?

344
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,702
Something for me.

345
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,903
To seek revenge
on the Virginian, that's why.

346
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:09,811
What I do, I do, and I told you
that when I married you.

347
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:15,786
Kalig could be wrong. What if
the Virginian didn't set you up?

348
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,052
- Soon, huh?
- Very soon.

349
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,160
- I'm sorry about the doctor.
- It is all right.

350
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,132
Hey, what's that?

351
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,070
Feels like a fist.

352
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,701
By golly, I think it is a fist.

353
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,613
Feel it. It is a fist.

354
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,049
I can feel it.

355

You want that, don't you?

357
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,528
I want... whatever you have.

Yes. But you hope for a boy.

You remember talking to me
about the bank in San Antonio?

I told you we were gonna rob it.

424
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,264
I even told you when.

425

I asked you to join us,

426
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,972
but you'd already signed up
for a cattle drive...

and were leaving the next day.

428

I remember I also tried
to talk you out of it.

I thought I had.

That's the last I saw you.

The next day we hit that bank...
round about closing time.

What's wrong with right now?

445
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,692
I got a wife and kid at stake.

I need that girl.
I need her help.

I'm making sure I get it.

You'll get it.

00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,845
BASSETT: Keep him alive,
she'll take care of Eva.

450
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,617
He's gonna wait for the baby
and then kill him.

451
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,091
Just like that.

452
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,624
You can't let
your husband kill him.

453
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,329
Won't you even try to stop him?

454
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,335
It is not up to me.

455
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,133
It's my husband's business.

456
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,149
All right, get them started.

457
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,021
Kalig?

458
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:49,970
GARTH: Kalig?
I sentenced you to 10 years.

459
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,298
I only served three months.

460
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,377
Why don't you write that note?

461
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,514
Answer's still the same.

462
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,465
Just creased him.

463
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,107
The next one's
gonna shatter the bone.

464
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,696
LIZ: Does that help?

465
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,530
EVA: Yes.

466
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,540
HARGE: Wish I could
make it easier for you.

467
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,375
HARGE: What happened?
VIRGINIAN: I had some visitors.

468
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,344
Which one did it?

469
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,007
Not important.

470
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,780
What is important
is what you're going to do.

471
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,087
We've been over that ground
once and for all.

472
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:30,332
If it's that final,
what can I do for you?

473
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,062
I need someone to talk to.

474
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,836
Talk to your boys.

475
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:44,043
Because I'm worried
about my wife and son.

476
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:49,845
The boys... some things
they don't understand about.

477
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:54,588
Maybe you ought to be more
careful who you ride with.

478
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,118
We were friends.

479
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,857
You and me.

480
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,427
No matter what you believe,
I didn't tell that sheriff.

481
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,496
Let me finish.

482
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,201
Help you to pass the time.

483
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,140
Think back, Harge.

484
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,741
Think back seven years.

485
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,182
One of your own men tipped off
that sheriff.

486
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:31,761
Now, why would a member
of your gang do that?

487
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,659
The obvious answer is money.

488
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,991
Sheriff must have paid
for that information.

489
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,798
Not much, but something.

490
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:50,435
Who would chose a few safe
dollars from the sheriff...

491
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,975
rather than the couple thousand
he'd get for robbing the bank?

492
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,845
You know your men, Harge.

493
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,689
Think it over.

494
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,655
[Baby crying]

495
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,906
Isn't he beautiful?

496
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:25,043
EVA: Boys are not beautiful.
HARGE: This one is.

497
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,607
If you say so, Harge.

498
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,819
So, that's how it is?

499
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:41,826
If it were not for Elizabeth,
you would not be holding him.

500
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,832
Here. You get some sleep.

501
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,251
You must be tired.

502
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,527
You go rest.
At sunup, I'll take you back.

503
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,997
I won't go alone.
You know that, don't you?

504
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,398
You don't have a choice.

505
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,737
Then you'll kill him?

506
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,035
You think that excuses it...
waiting till I've gone?

507
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,525
HARGE: Thanks for what you did.

508
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,408
To Harge II.

509
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,949
To Harge III.

510
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,258
To both.

511
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,305
Well, uh...

512
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,807
It's none of my business.

513
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,615
If you're gonna do something,
you ought to do it.

514
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,159
You like to get on
with things, don't you?

515
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,354
I like to get 'em
out of the way.

516
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,461
What would you do if you had
more than one thing...

517
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,229
to take care of at a time?

518
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:37,035
- I'd take 'em one by one.
- In what order?

519
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,668
- First things first.
- Well...

520
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,375
That's what I do.

521
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:55,791
How do you do it, hmm?

522
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,291
How do you get drunk
so fast, huh?

523
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,600
I'm breaking out my last bottle.
That look like I'm holding out?

524
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:13,902
That's far enough. Let's go.

525
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,228
- Harge!
- Two horses missing.

526
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,434
He's gone.
He's got Keeler's gun.

527
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,932
Bassett, get the horses.
Doud, take care of them.

528
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:03,851
Yahee!

529
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,124
GARTH, VOICE-OVER:
Follow instructions.

530
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,719
Don't let the law
suspect your part.

531
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:42,595
Proof of my well-being
will be tendered before payment.

532
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:46,159
Lose no time taking my letter
of authorization to the bank.

533
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,829
Judge Henry Garth.

534
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,097
MAN: Who gave you this?

535
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,339
Oh, uh... I think
I better go along with you.

536
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,209
The judge doesn't
want it that way.

537
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:00,579
Now, the only way I'm going
to turn over $100,000 in cash...

538
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,379
is to make sure he gets it.

539
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,852
There's the receipt.

540
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,070
Here's your man, Harge.

541
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,513
[Gunfire]

542
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,258
We'll go around.

543
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:25,927
[Gunshot]

544
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,875
That's far enough, Harge.
Hold it right there.

545
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,482
I'm going to take you with me.

546
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:51,619
I hear you got a son now, Harge.
He won't care if I'm dead.

547
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,059
He'll care a whole lot
if you are.

548
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,833
For his sake,
will you listen to me?

549
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:02,395
HARGE: I heard you out.
You didn't prove a thing.

550
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,839
You have the proof, Harge.

551
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,366
Think back what happened
after the bank.

552
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,708
Nothing happened.

553
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,313
- We hid out for four months.
- What was left of us.

554
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,344
- All of you?
- That's right.

555
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,989
If one of mine did it,
why would he stay?

556
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,226
Well, they didn't
want you to suspect.

557
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,560
They'd have to cover
their tracks.

558
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,931
The sheriff's money was burning
a hole in someone's pocket.

559
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,073
Did anyone leave
during those months?

560
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:44,772
- We can take him, Harge.
- You just give us the word.

561
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,750
Did anyone leave, Harge?

562
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:08,333
- Yeah. One did.
- Which one?

563
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:16,608
- Bassett?
- I got word my sister was sick.

564
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,546
I had to leave. What of it?

565
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,549
Can you prove
you even have a sister?

566
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,848
He took the lousy $500
and sold us out.

567
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:26,821
VIRGINIAN: How much? How much
did you say they gave you?

568
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,087
[Gunfire]

569
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,300
For seven years,
I had that man in my sight,

570
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,000
even in my house.

571
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,572
Yeah, I'm sorry.

572
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,018
I can't understand why
that man would come back.

573
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,117
VIRGINIAN: He needed you,
Harge. They all do.

574
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,323
But you don't need them.
You got everything you need.

575
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,031
There's riders coming, Harge.
We got to leave.

576
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,631
That ranch of yours
could be made into something.

577
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:24,110
- Nah, it's too late.
- It's never too late.

KEELER: Harge, let's go!

KALIG: I'll take that.

580
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,777
VIRGINIAN: I wouldn't use it
to stop you. It's empty.

581
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,185
Big gamble with an empty gun.

582
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,820
If it hadn't been empty,
I wouldn't have been gambling.

01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,523
PREBLE: Harge, let's go!

584
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,198
Preble? Preble.

585
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,306
Listen. Listen.

586
01:06:55,711 --> 01:07:00,648
It... it weren't the sheriff
who gave me the $500.

587
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,949
It was... Kali...

588
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,284
Kalig.

589
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,456
You... tell that to Harge.

590
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:04,139
That's far enough.
Don't try turning around again.

591
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:07,315
- Is this all the money?
- Where's Garth?

592
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,384
I'll count it.

593
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,669
- It's here.
- Can we get going now?

594
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,195
Garth isn't going back with you.

595
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,070
[Cocks gun]

596
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,195
- Judge has been kidnapped.
- The whole town knows.

597
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,336
- Why'd they let you ride off?
- My job is to stop the sheriff.

598
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,869
They've dumped Garth's life
in our laps... ours and the law's.

599
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,576
As long as they're not chased,
he'll stay alive.

600
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:15,777
Eddie, give me your carbine.

601
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,718
- What'll you do?
- What do you think?

602
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,823
- I'm going, too.
- Not you, Eddie.

603
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,325
You hightail it back to town
and tell the sheriff.

604
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,384
Yeah, boss, but...

605
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:28,555
If he doesn't keep out of it,
the judge will die.

606
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,595
Come on.

607
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:52,247
You ride like a cavalryman.

608
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,449
I deserted from the cavalry...

609
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,357
after absconding
with the colonel's wallet.

610
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,328
And his watch, too?

611
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,498
"To Henry Garth,
the man on the horse..."

612
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,867
"from one who envies you."

613
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,406
"Joseph..."

"Pulitzer." Is that it?

615
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:20,743
Pulitzer.

616
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:26,545
What did you get this
in exchange for?

617
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,750
A stock market tip on beef?

618
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,555
I asked you a question.

619
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,661
What did he envy you?

01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,668
Your money?

621
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,672
He was in the cavalry, too.

622
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:51,809
Loved horses,
wanted to be a cowboy.

623
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,008
[Kalig laughing]

624
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,641
I wanted to be a marine.

625
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:58,785
So I enlisted
under an assumed name,

626
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:02,052
and I wound up in Korea
fighting in 1871.

627
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:06,227
After I busted out of
the prison you put me in...

628
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:11,365
I proved myself on the field of
honor by killing a leatherneck.

629
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,533
The sum depressed me...
a measly $400.

630
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:19,137
Two hours before I was due
to be executed...

631
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,735
...I succeeded in crushing
the skull of a sergeant.

632
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,512
An old-time sergeant.

633
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,412
Then I shipped out on a clipper.

634
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,248
Let's head south.

635
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,448
Don't you want the judge
to hear my memoirs?

636
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,185
MAN: I say
let's burn tracks south!

637
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:39,558
You got your cut.
Why don't you ride out alone?

638
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,056
I've always been interested
in the arts.

639
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,834
Especially the art of abduction.

640
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,731
And I figured one of the oldest
crimes in civilization...

641
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,434
could be pulled off
if I found the right man.

642
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,243
And I have that honor
because I sent you to prison?

643
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:06,320
Revenge? That's an inhuman word
for small minds.

644
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,017
Now, I figured you were
the only man...

645
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:12,357
whose signature could bring me
$100,000 in cash.

646
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:17,165
- You know why I sent that note?
- You weren't ready to die yet.

647
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,234
You shouldn't have any regrets.

648
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:23,432
- Just one.
- Not hanging me.

649
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,932
You know, the kidnapper
that collects the ransom...

650
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:31,844
then kills his victim...
is a fool.

651
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,140
He merely intensifies
the search.

652
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,311
I'm your insurance...

653
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:41,756
so long as you're geographically
safe from pursuit and ambush.

654
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,224
It's a pleasure
to exchange ideas.

655
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:50,662
My companions here have made
conversation a lost art.

656
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,929
We're asking for trouble
as long as he's alive.

657
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,835
As long as I'm alive,
no one will try anything.

658
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,839
Well, I'm not waiting
for them to try.

659
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,272
[Gunshot]

660
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,805
Get his cut.

661
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,512
I can't figure
what got into you.

662
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,987
When I ride in here,
this thing bothers me.

663
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,855
It's bothered me for months,
that's what got into me.

664
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:21,056
- But why now?
- It's as good a time as any.

665
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:25,089
PREBLE: I don't know how to say
this, but I don't have a choice.

666
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:29,867
It's a hell of a thing to tell
a man his brother betrayed him.

667
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,408
Before Bassett died,

668
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:36,639
he told me it wasn't the sheriff
who gave him the money.

669
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:38,373
It was your brother Kalig.

670
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,247
He has hated you
from the day you were born...

671
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,308
because you killed his mama.

672
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:45,013
Everybody's
always known but you.

673
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,597
EVA: Please do not kill him.
Let him live.

674
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,158
HARGE: You're talking crazy.

675
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,401
Let Kalig go.

676
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:14,909
HARGE: Let's get out of here.

677
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,381
Let's go!

678
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:46,814
Lizzie Borden took an ax
and gave her mother 40 whacks.

679
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:51,946
When she saw what she had done,
she gave her daddy 41.

680
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:53,818
You comfortable, Judge?

681
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,790
Hey, not too tight, boys,
not too tight.

682
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,553
He's spending a long night here.

683
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,860
Tell me, Your Honor...

684
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,501
what do you despise
more than anything else?

685
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,907
Violence.

686
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,235
Still your favorite subject.

687
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,375
I'll never forget the sermon
you gave that day,

688
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,576
and I quote...

689
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:28,182
"The long, shrill cry of
the criminal will not stop...

690
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,157
"until all humanity realizes...

691
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,387
"that viciousness
is only for animals."

692
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,396
- How's that?
- Word for word.

693
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:41,291
- But empty words.
- It made an impression.

694
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,600
I remember another speech
you made about, uh...

695
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,506
man's breaking point.

696
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,408
Seems a lot of things...

697
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,310
have lingered with you
since that day.

698
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,982
They sure have.

699
01:15:56,585 --> 01:16:01,420
Especially the fact that you
built an empire out of violence.

700
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,451
Oh, boy. True blue Judge Garth.

701
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,028
What a joke on the ants
that admire you.

702
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:12,300
Don't they know
that you wear that halo...

703
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:13,494
because you can afford to?

704
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,695
I mean, if you didn't
have that ranch,

705
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,537
if you were a saddle tramp...

706
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:26,180
you would revert to the savage
that's buried deep inside you.

707
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:31,277
There are some forms of violence
that are forced upon us,

708
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,514
such as, um...

709
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,553
When will you try to kill me?

710
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,491
Killing you will have
to be legal surgery.

711
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,192
Surgery?

712
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:48,691
Slicing you from the body
of man... by law.

713
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,773
Tell me, don't you
ever feel remorse?

714
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,846
If you mean an apparition
of a slain party...

715
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:03,477
No.

716
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:06,282
I've tried
all kinds of criminals.

717
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:12,550
- Some of them express... regret.
- Regret?

718
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,796
There's no thought
in a murderer,

719
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:18,800
as the poet and the romanticist
would have you believe.

720
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:24,035
I remember my father's
bedtime story when I was a kid.

721
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,305
He was from Salem,
Massachusetts.

722
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,677
He heard Dan Webster's argument
that any unpunished murder...

723
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:39,113
took something away from the
security of every man's life.

724
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,917
He actually believed that.

725
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:48,760
A beautiful thought,
but basically dishonest.

726
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,788
I feel sorry for your father.

727
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:55,334
I'll never forget the look on
his face when I said good-bye.

728
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,839
He caught me taking
his life's savings.

729
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,116
Good night, hypocrite.

730
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,166

731
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,509
Good morning.

01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,745

I'll never forget
the indignities...

01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,705
I was subjected to in court...

736
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,470
that day that you called me
a sadistic mongrel.

You, masquerading
as a moral high priest...

738
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,141
of righteous justice...

calling me a parasite.

the day off sociable.

You try anything in that water,
you know what'll happen.

I know what'll happen

I'll let you write
your own epitaph.

What are we waiting for?

Give the animals a breather
before we swim.

- I ain't asking you.
- It was a stupid question.

You want me to shoot you?

Hey, you cowpokes,
you're using your heads.

nobody else bushwhacks us,

01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,721
You belly down to the one with
the brown shirt on the right.

793
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:40,353
You, the one on the left. I'll
take the one with the judge.

794
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,124
That's the one
that's got to count.

795
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,222
I know. His reflex
could trigger his gun...

796
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,732
and blow Garth's head off.

797
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,031
We've got to fire
at exactly the same time.

798
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:50,629
How are we gonna do that?
We got no timepiece.

799
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,333
- I'll signal.
- There's too many rocks.

800
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:56,332
- We can't see each other.
- Watch for my hat in the air.

801
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,436
Stick to your target,
check your guns.

802
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,368
You know, your daughter's
very fortunate.

803
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,006
Of course, she'll be
well provided for.

804
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:30,944
You know,
I wished you was my daddy.

805
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:36,411
Ha ha! That way, I could
inherit your spread, huh?

806
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:40,387
And get gold watches from
journalists... who envy me.

[Laughing]

808
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:19,450
It'll be dark soon.
Then we'll cross.

[Winding watch]

810
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,662
Your desperate friends
must've snuck down...

811
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,192
within aiming range by now.

812
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:34,541
Hey, you saddle tramps!

813
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,246
Why don't you come down here
and get a good look?

814
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,770
One shot out of you...

815
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:44,712
and the pious brains
of your anointed watchdog...

816
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:46,515
will be blown
from here to Shiloh.

817
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,521
This is what it all adds up to.

818
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:03,868
Sentiment, loyalty,
recognition, justice.

819
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,166
A watch...

820
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,877
with tiny little
non-meaning words on it.

821
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,939
Oh, precious words...
but only to you, Your Honor.

822
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:24,956
You know what I think of your
sentiment, loyalty, and justice?

823
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:27,754
Yah!

SARAH ANN:
Kalig, are you all right?

827
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,837
Regardless of what happens,
you're my son,

828
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,137
and you come to me.

829
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:52,474
I love you.

830
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:56,945
I love you more than anything or
any person in this whole world,

831
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,782
and you must never forget that.
