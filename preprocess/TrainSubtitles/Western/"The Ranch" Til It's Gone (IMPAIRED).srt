1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,803
All right, I got "H-O-R." You
got "H-O." It's your shot.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,639
All right, for this one you
gotta start seated on the tailgate...

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,184
- [chuckles softly]
- shoot lefty, hip-hop style,

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,019
and punch yourself in
the balls if you miss.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,482
[Rooster grunts]

6
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,235
- [Rooster] Whoo-hoo!
- [laughs]

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,111
You're welcome, little buddies.

8
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,672
All right, all
right. Easy, Annie Oakley.

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,865
- [laughs]
- I ain't worried.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,826
You ain't never beaten me at
nothing your entire life.

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,650
[Rooster] Yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:36,227
Yeah, you always choke under pressure.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,038
[scoffs] Yeah, right, that ain't true.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,331
Oh, yeah?

15
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,291
Come on, summer camp? Minigolf?

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,087
All you had to do was get it
through the clown's mouth in four shots.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,171
It took you so long

18
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,894
that little girl's birthday
party asked if they could play through.

19
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,782
Yeah, well, right now that little girl's

20
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,536
a hot college student someplace.

21
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:54,597
She owes me one.

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,892
Okay. State fair. Hot
dog eating contest.

23
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,978
Dad had to give you the Heimlich.

24
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,813
You literally choked under pressure.

25
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,357
Shoot the damn gun.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,609
[scoffs]

27
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,347
I'm gonna do what I've been doing

28
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,635
since I was 12 years old.

29
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,988
Hit the bottle.

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,324
[Rooster] Oh!

31
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,409
Oh, my God!

32
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,579
If Dad ain't dead, he's gonna be pissed.

33
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,663
[Beau] What the hell?

34
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,081
Shit, he ain't dead.

35
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,792
Yeah, you're not kidding.

36
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,418
Oh, and by the way, you missed.

37
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,544
[groans]

38
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,468

Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

40
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,114
- Dad, we are so sorry.
- Yeah, we are so sorry.

41
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,825
Before you say anything,
I just wanna let you know,

42
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,242
it was Colt's fault.

43
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,495
I don't care whose fault it was...

44
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,331
Colt's.

45
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,667
What the hell is wrong with you two?

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,087
The next time you start messing
around with the guns, do me a favor...

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,504
point 'em at each other.

48
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,849
Okay, like I... like I
said, we're real sorry.

49
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,614
I mean, we've just been working so hard,

50
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,244
we were trying to blow off some steam.

51
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,806
- And I... I went to...
- I'll fix the window right away, okay?

52
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,682
- [Colt sighs]
- Who's gonna fix the TV?

53
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,184
TV?

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,854
Oh, my God, you killed my best friend!

55
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,775
We'll save up and buy a new one.

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,071
We're not gettin' a new
one. We don't need it.

57
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,782
Okay, Dad, you're kiddin', right?

58
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,035
Food, water, shelter, TV. These
are necessities of life.

59
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,998
We gotta stop spendin'
money on things we don't need.

60
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,001
You know what I saw in
the fridge this morning?

61
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,957
Oh, well, I put my cell phone in there

62
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:32,278
so the FBI can't track me.

63
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,923
I learned that from you, Daddy.

64
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,301
What in the fuck is almond milk?

65
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,432
It's milk.

66
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,727
Show me the tit on an almond.

67
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,023
Look, it's better for
you than regular milk.

68
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,025
It's got less calories and
it's loaded with vitamin E.

69
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,609
It's like coconut water.

70
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,529
Now, you're just makin' shit up.

71
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,909
We have got to stop spending
money on crap like this

72
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,869
when we're trying to
keep this ranch afloat.

73
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,621
Okay. Isn't it always a little bit tight

74
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,623
right before we take
the calves to market?

75
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,667
This year's different.

76
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,961
That's the nature of the beast.

77
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,587
Our bills have doubled.

78
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,714
We got an extra
person living in the house.

79
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,927
That means extra food,
extra utilities...

80
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,512
extra nut juice.

81
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,060
Colt, you heard the man. Get out.

82
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,771
But wait... [stutters]

83
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,191
What about the 15 years when
I didn't use any utilities

84
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,359
'cause I deserted the family?

85
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,362
You're welcome.

86
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,799
On top of that, we got a surprise

87
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,642
assessment from the power co-op

88
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,414
and a love letter from the
state raising our property taxes.

89
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,459
You know what they use
those taxes for? Space ships.

90
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,005
To go diggin' around on Mars.

91
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,132
Hey, NASA, you want red dirt?

92
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,802
Land in my backyard and have at it.

93
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,223
- Well, Dad, maybe we can sell...
- Stop.

94
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,225
I've been giving this a lot of thought

95
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,186
and I don't see any other way around it.

96
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,814
We're gonna have to ask
for a loan to ride this out.

97
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,320
[door closes]

98
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,032
We gotta get a loan?

99
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,452
Man, this is more
serious than I thought.

100
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,246
Dad hates banks.

101
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,617
He always said the only bank

102
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:32,481
he ever needed was under his mattress.

103
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,949
Pretty stupid thing to tell me,

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,545
because the only bank I ever
needed was under his mattress.

105
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,302
Oh, uh, you must be Mr. Bennett.

106
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,804
Uh, I'm Bill Jensen. How are you?

107
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,225
Not great, Mr. Jensen, otherwise
I wouldn't be here.

108
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,395
Well, 'course, uh, times are
very tough for a lot of ranchers.

109
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,355
I can certainly
understand... Oh, oh, excuse me...

110
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,731
excuse me, uh, what's your name?

111
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,358
Oh, hey, I'm the Rooster.

112
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:04,031
Okay, uh, nice to meet
you, Mr... Rooster.

113
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,804
[stutters] Uh, could you, uh,

114
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,099
please not touch anything on my desk?

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,287
Oh, yeah, sure, sorry about that.

116
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,409
- [sighs] That's your wife?
- Uh, that's my daughter.

117
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,083
Ooh. [chuckles] Hello.

118
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,003
She is very beautiful.

119
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,963
Uh, well, here are
some fun facts about her.

120
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,759
She is the class
valedictorian, uh, captain of the soccer team,

121
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,178
she is 17 and her dad
owns five firearms.

122
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,767
So, uh, here is the
standard loan application.

123
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,144
It's, uh, it's fairly simple.

124
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,439
I'm not giving you my
Social Security number.

125
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,025
Okay, so maybe it won't be that simple.

126
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,570
So...

127
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,157
Colt Bennett. [chuckles]

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,242
Guilty as charged.

129
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,535
You want me to sign something for you?

130
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,245
A football or a photo?

131
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,935
Uh, never signed a man's chest before,

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,565
but if it helps get the loan approved,

133
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,624
well, I'll give it a go.

134
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,918
No, uh, actually we've,
uh, we've met before.

135
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,609
Uh, I was a referee in your division

136
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,195
when you were playing for Garrison.

137
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,341
I haven't always been a, uh,

138
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,569
an award-winning equity loan originator

139
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,577
and customer satisfaction associate.

140
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,637
[chuckles]

141
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,473
You do any of my big games?

142
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,808
Uh, actually, I was behind the whistle

143
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,353
for, uh, the championship
game your Junior year.

144
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,524
- Really?
- Mmm.

145
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,526
- The line judge?
- That's right. That's right.

146
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,904
Uh, growin' up, I knew I
wanted to be either a referee

147
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,366
or a mid-level bank employee.

148
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,409
It's called living two dreams.

149
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,911
You're the reason we lost that game.

150
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,706
- How's that?
- I scored that touchdown at the end.

151
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,376
[sighs] I was afraid of this.

152
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,879
Okay, for the record, you
were down at the one.

153
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,591
But maybe you didn't hear the
whistle 'cause you were too busy

154
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,885
encouraging the opposing
team's fans to, quote,

155
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,722
"Suck it. Suck it all the
way back to Grand Junction."

156
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,018
Everyone in that stadium...

157
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,478
saw me cross that goal
line except for one person.

158
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,855
- [inhales sharply]
- And everyone in this room

159
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,276
is acting real
appropriately except for one person.

160
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,946
Says the guy who wants to
sleep with my underage daughter.

161
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,450
Well, you know what,
it's... You made a bad call.

162
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,119
- Colt.
- [Colt] No, Dad.

163
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,871
No. I mean, come on. [stutters]
People make mistakes.

164
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,541
I mean, except your mistake cost
me the state championship.

165
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,927
Also cost me a hot cheerleader three-way

166
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,861
I was promised if I won the game.

167
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,672
You won the title the next year.

168
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,882
[chuckles] Them girls had graduated.

169
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,051
Dream killer.

170
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,262
Okay, look, you know what?

171
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,971
I did not make a mistake.

172
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,308
I very clearly saw your
knee touch the ground

173
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,643
before the ball broke the
plane of the goal line.

174
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,147
So, you can, "Suck it! Suck
it all the way back to...

175
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,609
3712, uh, County Road 145."

176
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,071
- You know what you can suck?
- [Beau] Colt, shut up.

177
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,448
Okay, I have to put up with my daughter

178
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,242
calling my ex-wife's new husband "Dad,"

179
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,934
but I do not have to put up with this!

180
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,579
[clears throat] Okay.

181
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,081
Deep breath, Bill.

182
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,541
Three, two, one, one, two,
three. What the heck is bothering me?

183
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,750
[clears throat]

184
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,295
I'm sorry about that. [clears throat]

185
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,987
Do you have any questions, Mr. Bennett?

186
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,882
Yeah. Where do I sign?

187
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,425
Uh, right on that last line.

188
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,303
Or you could sign across the
line. He won't know either way.

189
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,097
Okay, that's it! [exhales deeply]

190
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,933
Four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, later I'll have a bottle of wine.

191
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,731
[country music playing on radio]

192
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,146
- [music stops]
- You were down at the one.

193
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,482
[country music playing on radio]

194
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,742
- [watch beeps]
- [inhales deeply] Oh.

195
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,993
[clears throat]

196
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,995
[inhales deeply]

197
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,204
[clears throat]

198
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,130
Oh, oh, hello, Colt.

199
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,464
Am I interrupting?

200
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,385
Oh, no, not at all. Uh, just,
uh, fighting the... the banker's bulge.

201
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,762
Hazards of a sedentary lifestyle.

202
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,390
You know, when you
study the actuary tables,

203
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,059
the numbers show that this
is as dangerous a profession

204
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,311
as being a firefighter.

205
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,647
Really? Well, that...
that can't be true.

206
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,399
When you've brought casseroles

207
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,242
to as many grieving bankers' widows

208
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,634
as I have, then we'll talk.

209
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,032
Okay. Um, I just...
I wanted to apologize.

210
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,368
I think I came on a
little bit too strong.

211
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,579
Colt... [scoffs] I get it.

212
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,992
You know... [stammers] we're a couple

213
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:06,732
of testosterone-fueled men.

214
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,462
Two big bucks, knocking antlers.

215
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,129
Getting that velvet off.

216
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,634
Okay, uh... [stutters]
I was just... I'm...

217
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,595
I just hope this
doesn't affect the loan.

218
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,137
Oh, no! Uh, not at all.

219
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,306
Uh, I would never do that.

220
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,748
You have nothing to worry about.

221
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,352
Uh, the loan is being
turned down purely on merit.

222
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,104
Turned down? Why?

223
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,983
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm
paid to assess risk.

224
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,664
And between the debt-equity ratio

225
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,427
and those new banking regulations...

226
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,989
Thanks, Obama. [sighs]

227
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,074
It's just a risk we
can't absorb right now.

228
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,744
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

229
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,662
[stutters] My dad's not a risk.

230
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,415
He's a... he's a great rancher.

231
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,916
I'm not saying he isn't.

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,904
Look... [sighs] approving a loan

233
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,069
is a completely objective process.

234
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,172
It's like reffing a football game.

235
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,216
I didn't want to call
you down at the one.

236
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,926
That was a bad night for me, too.

237
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,138
You know, somebody
peed in my convertible?

238
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,350
I did not know that.

239
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,686
Oh, yeah, yeah. People hated me.

240
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,688
Bags of crap on my doorstep,

241
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,940
uh, dirty looks when
I went to the store.

242
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,475
Why do you think I have to keep myself

243
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,801
in the peak of physical condition?

244
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,028
I have to live here.

245
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,821
Between denying loans

246
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,408
and my years as a ref, I
don't have many friends left.

247
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,825
I'll be your friend.

248
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,369
Colt, I can't give you the loan.

249
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,703
Fuck you, Bill!

250
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,830
Friendship over!

251
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,210
[wheel clacking through speakers]

252
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,005
- [man on TV] Can I get a "T"?
- What are you doing?

253
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,136
I'm listening to the Wheel of Fortune.

254
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,389
How's that going?

255
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,600
Category is Phrase.

256
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,227
There's two T's on the
board but I can't tell where.

257
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,819
Loan got denied.

258
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,780
What? You serious?

259
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,032
Yeah.

260
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,285
The guy said... [clears
throat] the ranch was too much risk.

261
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,621
[turns TV off]

262
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,290
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah, right?

263
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,751
[sighs] Oh, man,
what're we gonna do now?

264
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,546
I don't know.

265
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,717
Get some odd jobs, sell off some shit.

266
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,929
How much you think we can get for
a 50-inch flat-screen... radio?

267
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,142
Yo, how bad of shape
do you think we're in?

268
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,215
[sighs] You know how at the airport

269
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,880
they got those colors to tell you

270
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,733
- how scared you're supposed to be?
- Yeah.

271
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,068
Well, I got a similar system to
rank the state of the ranch.

272
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,152
I use quarterbacks.

273
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,573
When the ranch is in perfect
condition, it's "John Elway."

274
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,991
Obviously.

275
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,326
What state are we in now?

276
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,620
"Tim Tebow."

277
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,084
It's real bad, but at least we
know we got God rooting for us.

278
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,721
Which one of you two numb nuts

279
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,200
left the pitchfork laying
in the driveway?

280
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, looks like you're in a good mood.

281
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,098
Colt's got something to tell ya.

282
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,684
Plus, he's the one who left
the pitchfork in the driveway.

283
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,021
I went back to the bank.

284
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,065
We didn't get the loan.

285
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,110
Okay.

286
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,033
Do you want to talk about this?

287
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,284
We just did.

288
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,371
I'm gonna go check the generator.

289
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,330
[door closes]

290
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,379
He didn't even yell.

291
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,755
Yeah, this is real bad.

292
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,008
I don't think we're
in "Tim Tebow" anymore.

293
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,219
What's worse than "Tim Tebow"?

294
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,180
"Colt Bennett."

295
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,520
[chuckling]

296
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,068
What are you doing?

297
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,447
Adding a little A1 sauce.

298
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,365
Are you saying the
steak needs improvement?

299
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,786
[whispers] Do not answer. It's a trap.

300
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,960
No, I'm just changing
the flavor profile.

301
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,962
Oh, that's a bad answer.

302
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,881
If you bought a Ferrari...

303
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,134
would you get an automatic?

304
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,860
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's the only way

305
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,286
they make 'em these days, Dad.

306
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,682
I hate you.

307
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,142
[chuckles]

308
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,022
You see?

309
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,283
You mess up Dad's steak

310
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,509
and he turns the
power off with his mind.

311
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,364
Oh, probably just blew a fuse.

312
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,532
[Beau] Nope.

313
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,076
I turned it off.

314
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,371
Changes are a-comin', boys.

315
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,750
I called the power company and
had 'em cut off the electricity.

316
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,455
Are we really in that bad a shape?

317
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,987
You had to turn the power off?

318
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,632
[Rooster] Yeah, Dad, you
didn't have to do that.

319
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,634
We need money that
bad, I can sell my bike.

320
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,317
Although I still think option number one

321
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,541
should be getting rid of Colt.

322
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,306
I'm doing this while
I still have a choice.

323
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,323
We got plenty of propane

324
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:18,669
to run the
generator for the essentials...

325
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,812
until we get the calves to market.

326
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,983
Gonna save us a couple of
hundred dollars a month.

327
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,278
It's a pretty big decision to make.

328
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,561
Why didn't you ask our opinion?

329
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:34,076
Well, short answer is I don't
care about your opinions.

330
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,530
And the long answer is

331
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:38,772
I don't give a shit about your opinions.

332
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,671
You know, we've been
working our asses off.

333
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,590
This isn't just your
ranch. This is our ranch.

334
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,968
Yeah. I mean, when you
die, I want to run this place.

335
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,095
You know, it's when you
say stupid shit like that,

336
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,620
he's not gonna respect our opinions.

337
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,893
You really think this is your ranch?

338
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,607
You spend half your time drinking
and fucking off like 12-year-olds.

339
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,381
You picked a fight with the man

340
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,803
that was responsible
for giving us a loan.

341
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,741
Dad, I offered to set
your banking up online.

342
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,328
I offered to put in a
cistern to collect the runoff.

343
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,496
We try to help, you don't let us.

344
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:23,375
When you really wanna help
someone, you don't offer. You just do it.

345
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,128
You start doin' that...

346
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,505
I'll ask for your opinion.

347
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,468
You two wanna be shown respect?

348
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,888
Start growing up.

349
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,474
Act like men.

350
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,193
You had to put A1 sauce on your steak.

351
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,116
[upbeat music playing]

352
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,287
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

353
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,789
Can I charge my phone back there?

354
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,916
Oh, Hank's charging his iPad.

355
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,878
You have an iPad?

356
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,797
What, I can't have nice things?

357
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,051
What's wrong?

358
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,053
What makes you think something's wrong?

359
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,916
Well, you just picked up a random beer

360
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:19,080
and started drinking it.

361
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,934
We're not supposed to do that?

362
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,811
Look, Colt,

363
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,273
if I'm going to be a widow or
a grandmother, I need to know.

364
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,734
Those are two completely
different outfits.

365
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,486
[stammers]

366
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,240
Okay.

367
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,118
You remember my Junior year in
the state championship game

368
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,327
where I scored a touchdown and...

369
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,913
You didn't score a touchdown.

370
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,793
Whatever. Uh, it's...

371
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,586
Okay, don't tell Dad that I told you.

372
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,798
We didn't get the loan.

373
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,800
Dad had to turn off the power.

374
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,010
- [sighs] Really?
- Yeah.

375
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,680
Rooster said it's the
worst he's ever seen it.

376
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,223
He called it "Colt Bennett bad."

377
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,520
While I don't appreciate being
at the bottom of that scale...

378
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,480
- it scared the crap out of me.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,025
Well, if it's any help...

380
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,778
in the winter of '81, we
lost almost half the herd.

381
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,487
We turned off the
power till the next spring.

382
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,781
But we made it through.

383
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,034
That was "Colt Bennett bad."

384
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,638
[stutters] Once again,

385
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,688
I don't think we need to use that scale.

386
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,417
- I suppose that's reassuring.
- Yeah.

387
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,419
You know, your father's been
able to handle anything

388
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,088
that's ever been thrown his way.

389
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,256
If there were one
rancher in this whole state

390
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,820
who can make it through a tough time,

391
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:36,804
I'd bet on Beau Bennett.

392
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,388
So, you just do whatever
you can to support him.

393
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,472
Support him?

394
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,599
[stutters] I don't
even know how bad it is.

395
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,852
I mean, he won't tell
us what's happening,

396
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,215
he won't involve us in anything,

397
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:48,628
and he won't let anybody help him.

398
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,189
Oh, trust me, I know.

399
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,359
He thinks tow truck
drivers are enablers.

400
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,321
Look, son,

401
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,157
you grew up on that
ranch. You know what to do.

402
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,618
Well...

403
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,747
Thanks, Mom.

404
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,915
- Yeah.
- Hey.

405
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,878
How'd you and Dad make it three
months without any power?

406
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,667
Well, the power
went out in the winter...

407
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,782
and you were born the next fall,

408
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:18,885
- so we basically just...
- Okay, okay, okay.

409
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,177
I got it.

410
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,267
Power out?

411
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,396
No, it's mood lighting.

412
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,066
Can I talk to you?

413
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,235
Do I have to talk back?

414
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,989
Oh, so it's bad mood lighting.

415
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,327
[sighs] I spoke with Colt.

416
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,664
Damn kid can't keep his mouth shut.

417
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,834
Yeah, he's kind of the
opposite of his father that way.

418
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,170
He was scared.

419
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,048
And I told him about '81 and
I think it reassured him.

420
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,175
In '81, we got the loan.

421
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,803
Yeah, I might've left that part out.

422
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,972
You know, this is like
when you didn't want me

423
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,099
to tell him there was no Santa Claus.

424
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,600
He was four.

425
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,021
And you wonder why he's soft.

426
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,399
You still didn't have
to tell him in the mall,

427
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,193
in front of all those other kids.

428
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,530
Saved all those parents two
hours of waiting in line.

429
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,787
You know, if I had any
money to give you, I would.

430
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,457
Well, I appreciate that, Mags.

431
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,918
But I wouldn't take it if you did.

432
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,841
Although maybe Colt would
want it for that coconut water.

433
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,261
Is that a real thing?

434
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,181
I believe it is.

435
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,184
I hate everyone.

436
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,522
Look, I've been
thinking, and just hear me out...

437
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,067
I could put the bar
up as collateral for you.

438
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,321
And I appreciate that...

439
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,824
but that's the same
as offering me money.

440
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,578
You need help. It may
as well come from me.

441
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,373
This ranch isn't your
concern anymore, Maggie.

442
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,877
Bullshit. My sons still live here.

443
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,162
And whether we end up divorced or not,

444
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:19,654
that makes it my concern.

445
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,466
Plus, if you lose this place,

446
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,010
they're gonna want to live
with me in my Airstream

447
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,345
and there's no fucking
way that's gonna happen.

448
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,849
I don't want your money...

449
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,977
and I don't want to talk.

450
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,937
I got enough problems.

451
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,983
Yeah, well, now you got one less.

452
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,907
I don't hate you.

453
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,743
Or Ronald Reagan.

454
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,545
You know what the worst part
about living without power is?

455
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,215
Yeah, no hair dryer. This
is a selfie-free day.

456
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,803
No, man. The worst part about
living without power

457
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,221
is means living without porn.

458
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,392
Earlier today, I had to
use a T.J. Maxx catalog.

459
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,478
Thank God for yoga pants.

460
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,442
Colt, what in the hell do
you think you're doing?

461
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,154
Chopping wood, helping out.

462
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,198
Isn't that what you want us to do?

463
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,367
What I want you to do is
keep your mouth shut.

464
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,449
What are you talking about?

465
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,665
The fact that you're talking to
your mother about our business.

466
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,670
Oh, oh. So, now that you're
pissed, it's our business.

467
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,911
All right, let's not forget

468
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:44,780
that Colt's the one
who opened his mouth.

469
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,593
He's also the one who puts
A1 sauce on your steak, so...

470
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,555
The last thing I need is
your mother coming here,

471
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,182
putting her nose in it,

472
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,892
and offering to put up
the bar as collateral.

473
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,312
She did that?

474
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,731
That's great.

475
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,567
Yeah, then, we can go get the loan.

476
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,445
I told her no way in hell.

477
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,824
Why would you do that?

478
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,077
You're always bitching how
Mom chose the bar over you,

479
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,162
now she's willing to put
it up to save your ass,

480
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,872
you're too proud to accept her help?

481
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,956
Yeah...

482
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,751
we all got to change...

483
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,758
but you can still be the same

484
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,905
bull-headed, stubborn jackass?

485
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,007
Is that how it works?

486
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,761
I'm gonna go check the generator.

487
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,950
He's always going to
check the generator.

488
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,224
I think he just says that 'cause

489
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:42,883
he doesn't want to listen to us anymore.

490
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,360
So, anyway...

491
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,071
I was trying to use the
Lands' End catalog...

492
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,741
it's, like, wintertime, so
everyone's wearing a sweater.

493
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,163
I'm gonna go check the generator.

[somber country music playing]

495
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,241
Hey.

496
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,454
Okay, I'd offer you a whiskey, but...

497
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,955
I know you're closed.

498
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,666
Well, I was gonna say,
you couldn't afford it.

499
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,629
Suppose I deserve that.

500
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,548
What are you doing here, Beau?

501
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,384
- Listen, I came here...
- No, you know what?

502
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,010
You listen to me.

503
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,431
I care about this ranch and
I care about this family.

504
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,850
And I'm really not in
the mood to talk to you

505
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,352
if you're not gonna let me help.

506
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,438
Well, that's fair.

507
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,273
Just let me say this.

508
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,325
When I was a kid, my dad

509
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,844
was real straight on how to run a ranch.

510
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,950
Cattle are grass-fed,
don't waste free water...

511
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,954
and try to run out of
whiskey and time on the same day.

512
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,625
He was a good man.

513
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,335
Yeah.

514
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,587
He was a lot like me.

515
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,006
But, you know, without
the sense of humor.

516
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,845
He taught me everything I know.

517
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,185
Most of all, he taught me that hard
work will always get you through.

518
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,939
What he didn't say is what to
do when hard work wasn't enough.

519
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,943
Beau, I've built up some
equity in this place. Why not use it?

520
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,113
Maggie, it's not that
I don't want your help.

521
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:00,076
If I let you put this
place at risk and I fail...

522
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,079
then I take you down with me.

523
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,500
Well, I believe in you. So,
that's not gonna happen.

524
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,547
I wish I believed
that as much as you do.

525
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,383
Come on, everything's
gonna be all right.

526
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,595
I'm proud of you, Maggie...

527
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,973
what you've done here.

528
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,936
You know that, right?

529
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,228
I do now.
