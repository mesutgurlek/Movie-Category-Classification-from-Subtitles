Recognized his voice

across the same tire tracks,

Sorry. "Blood quantum"?

To be considered a member
of the tribe,

551

you have to be a certain
percentage of Cheyenne blood.

the new blood requirement.

Why make
a law like that now?

To thin out the ranks.

559

Laughing as he lost?

806
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,586
No.

807
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,389
Malcolm deserved
to die a coward's death.

808
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:20,093
There's nothing
you can do about it.

809
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:21,795
But there is,
Mika.

810
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:23,997
I wasn't
tricking you before.

811
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:26,833
I found his body in his car
off the res.

812
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,135
No, man.

813
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:30,904
We were on the res.
I know it.

814
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:32,639
Should have brought a map,
Mika.

815
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:35,175
That body was
in the county.

816
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:37,511
Then somebody moved him.

817
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:39,246
Now, who would do
a thing like that?

818
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:48,121
You do what you got to do
with me, sheriff.

819
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:51,191
I'm good with myself.

820
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:53,894
My family's gonna be rewarded
for what I did.

821

[ Spits ]

822
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:58,231
What do you mean,
your family's gonna be rewarded?

823
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:12,045
Sheriff.

824
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:14,881
Jacob.

825
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:16,416
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

826
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:19,786
I just gave my report
to the tribal council.

827
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:21,788
I'm sure they appreciated that.
They did.

828
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:25,492
I also found out that Anita
is taking over as chairman

829
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:28,195
until an interim election
can be held.

830
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,997
And they're deciding now

831
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:32,165
who'll take over
her lower-level position.

832
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,034
Apparently,
you're the front-runner,

833
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:35,469
which confused me,

834
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,237
since you're not a member
of the Cheyenne tribe.

835
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,907
That's right,

836
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:43,844
because I don't meet
the blood-quantum requirement.

837
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:46,680
Did you know
that the U.S. government

838
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,281
only quantifies three things
by blood?

839
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:53,653
Dogs, horses, and Indians.

840
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:56,857
I've never seen
dogs or horses

841
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,893
exploit their own kind
for personal profit.

842
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:01,862
You are a cynical man.
You know that?

843
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:03,964
I'm not cynical...
just suspicious.

844
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:06,967
Suspicious that all these
terrible things happen,

845
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:09,069
and somehow,
when the dust settles,

846
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,638
you're a candidate
for the tribal council.

847
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:13,173
Couldn't that just be
my good fortune?

848
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:14,241
Could be.

849
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:16,910
Or it could be this...

850
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:18,311
you buy Malcolm's debt.

851
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:20,747
You talk him
into passing legislation

852
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,883
that raises
the blood quantum.

853
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,217
Then you find Mika,

854
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,020
who's especially angered
by the disenrollment.

855
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:29,256
You convince him
that if Malcolm

856
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:31,525
is somehow removed
from the council,

857
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:33,827
you will take over
the vacant post

858
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:35,862
and repeal
the blood quantum.

859
00:40:35,963 --> 00:40:38,799
And his family will be
reinstated back into the tribe.

860
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:43,603
You overestimate me,
Walt.

861
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:48,975
I think you might
underestimate me, Jacob.

Tried to warn you.

866
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:15,268
I know.
I'm sorry.

867
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:16,803
I've been
avoiding your calls

868
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:17,971
because I thought

869
00:41:18,072 --> 00:41:19,172
you were trying
to get back together.

I was the first couple days,
but I get it.

872
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,947
You made it pretty clear
that we're done.

873
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:33,153
You all right?

So did you.

878
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,468
He'll get over it.

[ Chuckling ]
With you, yeah.

00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:54,040

I am so sorry.

Don't be.

I don't regret
a single moment.

885
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:06,887
But you do realize

886
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:10,223
that I really only have
two choices now.

Well,
either I got to quit,

or I got to beat him.
