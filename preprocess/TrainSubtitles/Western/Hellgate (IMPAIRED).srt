1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:05,485
(Majestic music)

2
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:31,045
(Dramatic orchestral music)

3
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:14,933
(Fast-paced orchestral music)

4
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,681
Easy, Vern.

5
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:29,184
You want to get me caught again?

6
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:31,069
I can hurry him up.

7
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,437
Would we have yanked you
out in the face of that mob

8
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:33,989
Just to get you caught again?

9
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,925
Them people back in
town want to burn me.

10
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,810
Burn me alive.

11
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,544
You had a bad fall, Vern.

12
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,547
Maybe you're hurt inside
worse than you think.

13
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:43,781
You gotta go easy.

14
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,066
What's, what's keepin' him?

15
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,602
We always been able to
hold up at Wilson's.

16
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,270
Easy, Vern.

17
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,325
We ain't gonna be able
to hold up there anymore.

18
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:55,360
Wilson's dead.

19
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,194
I saw his grave,

20
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:57,625
And then I looked through the window and,

21
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,697
There's new people livin' there.

22
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:00,665
[Vern] All right. We'll keep on going.

23
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,266
The horses won't last another mile.

24
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,818
Neither will you.

25
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,020
(Cocks gun) I said we go.

26
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,571
(Slow dramatic music)

27
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:26,609
(Knocking)

28
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:30,913
(Knocking)

29
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,735
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but

30
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:38,069
This man's hurt badly.

31
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,721
Please bring him in.

32
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:45,993
Over there.

33
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:55,804
I'll get my husband.

34
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,474
Gil.

35
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:02,510
Gil.

36
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,729
Ellie, we're in trouble.

37
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:05,930
Gil, there's a man in there...

38
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,900
Mr. Barrett's mare
should've foaled before now.

39
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,619
The man's hurt, Gil.

40
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,546
Good evening.

41
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:22,580
What's wrong?

42
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,968
Horse threw him.

43
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:25,799
His ribs hurt so bad, he can hardly talk.

44
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,170
Take a big breath.

45
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,440
(Vern inhales shakily)

46
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,008
Easy. Easy.

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,177
Stand up.

48
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,216
That's it.

49
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,919
You got to stand up.

50
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,238
I don't guess you live around here, or...

51
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,257
You wouldn't have come to me.

52
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:06,874
Gil.

53
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,177
We're just passin' through.

54
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:10,962
Guess you're on your way into town.

55
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,832
I hear they're gonna burn
that man they caught tonight.

56
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,484
We're headed that way.

57
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,652
Uh, hold this end for me.

58
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:21,789
(Vern grunts in pain)

59
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:23,524
Is it tight?

60
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,610
Well, if you can't grip
it, why, perhaps my wife...

61
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,046
[Banta] They do the work of five.

62
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:29,431
Just hurry, please.

63
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,069
Thanks.

64
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:38,289
I guess that man deserves
whatever's done to him.

65
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,792
You reckon he does?

66
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,409
But we're not the ones to do it.

67
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:45,779
That's what we have laws
and a government for.

68
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:49,750
It'll see justice done
if we give it a chance.

69
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,520
I'd stand or fall by it.

70
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,541
And I fought against it.

71
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,992
You did, huh?

72
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:01,295
That should do it.

73
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,018
What are you chargin'?

74
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:07,920
There's no charge.

75
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,304
I'm not a physician.

76
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:12,373
But when you get to town,
you better see Doc Jennings.

77
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,416
Why wouldn't we come to you

78
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,568
If we lived around here?

79
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,221
(Laughs) Well, they're
all Yankees around here.

80
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:28,522
Like I said, I fought for the South.

81
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:30,441
It's hard for the winners to believe that

82
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,363
The licked man can come to
admire what they fought for.

83
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,597
Be a while before they
get to think I'm human.

84
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,505
Where's Ault?

85
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,808
Horses in the corral were fresh.

86
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,277
Ault's gettin' the last one now.

87
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:52,813
Vern, not them.

88
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,684
You're crazy as they say you are.

89
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,241
(Suspenseful music)

90
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:01,723
[Banta] Vern, come 'round
here! (Approaching hoofbeats)

91
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:08,362
(Suspenseful music)

92
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,171
Ault! Come on! Hyah! Hyah!

93
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:44,532
Anybody home?

94
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,259
[Ellen] Neill Price.

95
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:54,659
Ellie, Gil.

96
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,910
Hello, Neill.

97
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,564
I know, some of your cattle
have come down with anthrax,

98
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,216
And you need Gil. (Laughs)

99
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,104
One of our only visitors, and
he keeps his cattle healthy.

100
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:06,805
Only visitor?

101
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:08,756
Why, you had somebody
leaving as I came in.

102
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:12,310
On their way into town to
watch what happens to Brechene.

103
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,343
Well, that's what I came for.

104
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:14,562
We can ride in together.

105
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,081
As far as I'm concerned,
there's not much reason

106
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,599
To go into town tonight.

107
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:20,768
Not much reason?

108
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,823
Well, maybe you don't
think there's much reason,

109
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,140
But I do.

110
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:27,292
Goodnight, Gil.

111
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,376
Goodnight.

112
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,014
Goodnight, Ellie.

113
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,508
(Sighs) Things would be a lot simpler

114
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,326
If there were more like him.

115
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,760
(Retreating hoofbeats)

116
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,098
This is gonna be a matter of waiting.

117
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,801
It only takes one to wait.

118
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:56,153
Goodnight, Ellie.

119
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,204
Gil...

120
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,891
Is it what you really want?

121
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:02,443
Staying here, trying to make a go of it?

122
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,179
What I want, I've got.

123
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,680
You.

124
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,748
(Romantic music)

125
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:11,752
Now, you get to bed.

126
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:17,425
(Romantic music)

127
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:26,754
Thanks.

128
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:28,202
You keep it on.

129
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,384
Well, just like all
the other places, sir.

130
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,387
Been some in, been some out.

131
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,307
I hope the other patrols had better luck.

132
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,591
This one's a veterinary.

133
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,860
You wanna try him?

134
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,229
(Mumbles) said to try everybody.

135
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:04,738
(Dog barking)

136
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,250
Look around.

137
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:20,855
(Knocking)

138
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:22,924
(Knocking)

139
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,748
Oh, won't you come in?

140
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,317
You're name Hanley?

141
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:34,352
That's right.

142
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:35,285
Can I help ya?

143
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,387
Maybe.

144
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:37,838
You mind if we look around?

145
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,573
Help yourself.

146
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:43,128
What's going on?

147
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:44,279
Last night a butcher shot down

148
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,664
An army lieutenant and a peace officer.

149
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:48,848
A butcher named Brechene.

150
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,434
And he got away?

151
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:51,986
What makes you think he got away?

152
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,506
Well, you're not here
to pass the time of day.

153
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:56,774
You must be looking for something.

154
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,359
[Lieutenant] You were
a rebel in the war.

155
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,931
I fought for the South.

156
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:07,467
[Lieutenant] Anything
unusual happen here last night?

157
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,338
Well, about 4 o'clock,
we had a little colt.

158
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,556
Before that, I bound up the ribs of a man

159
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,292
Who'd been thrown from his horse.

160
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,444
He was half out of his mind with pain.

161
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:20,113
Everything all right?

162
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,082
[Soldeir] Seems to be, sir.

163
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,770
A horse doctor takes care of a man?

164
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,255
And that's not unusual?

165
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:30,374
Well, when they can't
get to Doc Jennings,

166
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:32,643
Why, I sometimes get human patients.

167
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,696
I don't do much for them, but
I don't charge them either.

168
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:37,031
Gil.

169
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,250
Is it all right if I put
a blanket on the foal

170
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,551
'Til Mr. Barrett comes?

171
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,802
Thanks, Ellie.

172
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,270
Let's go.

173
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,391
Better wait a minute, Lieutenant.

174
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,010
(Slow dramatic music)

175
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:57,134
You ever see this before?

176
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,703
I don't think so, no.

177
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,538
Those your horses out in the corral?

178
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:01,639
[Gilman] Certainly.

179
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,674
Tell him.

180
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:04,572
They've got the Randall's brand on 'em.

181
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:07,094
Two weeks ago, Brechene
stole a Randall herd.

182
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,212
You're not talkin' sense.

183
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:09,947
A man was hurt.

184
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,649
He couldn't find anyplace else to come to.

185
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,984
I s'pose you never saw
Vern Brechene before.

186
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,736
Didn't know what he looked like.

187
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,421
Make the answers good, reb.

188
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:18,556
[Gilman] You ever seen him before?

189
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:19,757
You know what he looks like?

190
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:20,825
I haven't been helpin' him get away

191
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:22,193
For the last two years.

192
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,528
[Gilman] You trying to say I have?

193
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,128
You trying to say he
didn't pay you this money

194
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:27,498
For the fresh horses
you had waiting for him?

195
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,998
Just left it as a gift.

196
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,334
Is that it, reb?

197
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,969
What does all this mean?

198
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,187
It's simple.

199
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:34,938
For a year, we've been looking for the man

200
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,475
Who has helped Brechene
hide out in this area.

201
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:39,411
And now we've found him.

202
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,345
You're under arrest for
criminally conspiring

203
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,815
With Vernon Brechene against
the United States government.

204
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:44,414
Oh, no.

205
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,482
You're out of your mind.

206
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:47,101
Now, get outta here, before I...

207
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:49,703
[Ellen] Gil.

208
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:55,655
(Dramatic music)

209
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,213
And in view of the
fact that the accused,

210
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:03,099
By willfully aiding and
conspiring with a deserter

211
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,819
From the United States Army,

212
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,793
Has forfeited all rights
to trial by civil court.

213
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,670
We will prove, beyond a doubt,

214
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,178
That this man is guilty.

215
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,548
(Dramatic orchestral music)

216
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,951
I saw those strangers
turnin' down Hanley's lane.

217
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:39,353
(Dramatic orchestral music)

218
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:41,839
No, Gil didn't say
who the visitors were,

219
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,725
Except one was a patient.

220
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,976
All he said was there wasn't much reason

221
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,461
For goin' into town.

222
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:49,730
That doesn't make him guilty.

223
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,199
(Dramatic orchestral music)

224
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,085
The only horses in Hanley's corral

225
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,403
Was the ones Brechene
stole from the Randalls.

226
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:58,877
(Dramatic orchestral music)

227
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,458
And this is the saddlebag
that Private Benson found

228
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,144
With over $5,000 in it.

229
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,766
The court, having
materially and carefully

230
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,018
Considered the evidence produced,

231
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,488
Finds the accused, Gilman S. Hanley,

232
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,424
Guilty.

233
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:18,809
The only guilt here is yours.

234
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:19,969
Silence.

235
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,564
This once, you're going to listen to me.

236
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,750
Has one of these witnesses actually proved

237
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,670
I ever saw Brechene before that night?

238
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:32,403
Only Brechene can do that.

239
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,058
Or one of his men.

240
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:35,643
Find Brechene.

241
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:37,577
Find any of his men.

242
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,098
Let them declare they ever in their lives

243
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:41,932
Had anything to do with me!

244
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,984
The prisoner will maintain silence.

245
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,653
[Prison Guard] On your feet, Hanley.

246
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,523
Hanley, on your feet!

247
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:51,725
Someone to see ya.

248
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:56,597
Can't open the door, lady.
Better make it quick.

249
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,734
Oh, Gil. Gil, darling.

250
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:02,370
Ellie.

251
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,522
Ellie, you've got to get
to somebody higher up

252
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,006
Than these people.

253
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:08,609
Once they learn what's going on in there,

254
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,477
Even if it's too late,

255
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,079
Get to them.

256
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:13,663
You haven't heard?

257
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,016
They haven't told you?

258
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,784
Oh, what's there to hear?

259
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,305
They've caught Brechene, darling.

260
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:21,823
They've caught Brechene!

261
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:23,957
(Approaching footsteps)

262
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,100
Take these two along.

263
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,928
Brechene, this man claims he's not now,

264
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:46,396
And never was connected
with you in any way.

265
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:48,783
Do you deny or confirm his claim?

266
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:51,912
Tell him the truth.

267
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:54,555
You didn't do a very good job, did ya?

268
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,409
With the money I left ya,

269
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,945
You could've bought your
way outta this scrape.

270
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,980
You can't save yourself.

271
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,749
What further harm could it
do you to tell the truth?

272
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,602
And save a man that helped
you when you were in pain.

273
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:11,071
I don't know what you're mad at me for.

274
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:14,208
You wouldn't want me to lie, would ya?

275
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:16,544
[Soldier] Place him in his cell.

276
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,231
I got a hundred men they can't find.

277
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,700
Maybe you can tell 'em where they are.

278
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,519
And what they're gonna do next.

279
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:29,190
(Dramatic music)

280
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,344
You were the one who requested

281
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,930
That Brechene, himself, identify you.

282
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,434
Oh, Gil.

283
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:43,170
Gil.

284
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:47,441
Time's getting short, lady. Come on.

285
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,411
- No. No, no. (Crying)
- [Guard] Come on.

286
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:55,115
(Sorrowful music)

287
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:04,303
(Dramatic music)

288
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,615
But my husband's alive. He's alive.

289
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,584
He wasn't executed with the others.

290
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,152
That means he wasn't guilty.

291
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:17,755
He's free. Free to come home.

292
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:19,490
By what right do you refuse to tell me

293
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,225
What you've done with him?

294
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,844
Does a human life mean so little to you?

295
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,830
Mrs. Hanley, I've done
all I can for your husband

296
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,148
By commuting his sentence
to a prison term.

297
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,968
Take my advice.

298
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,387
Forget him.

299
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:39,105
(Dramatic music)

300
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,422
[Prison Guard] Get movin'.

301
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:13,060
(Dramatic music)

302
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,219
[Prison Guard] Prisoners
on the water wagon!

303
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,022
Prisoners on the water wagon!

304
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:47,245
Tell the Comman that
new scurvies are comin' in

305
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:48,696
On the water wagon!

306
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,868
(Orchestral music)

307
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,851
Get 10 men to unload the wagon!

308
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,739
Still afraid to drive inside, huh, Frank?

309
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,475
I'm called on to deliver
water to the prison,

310
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:20,294
Not inside.

311
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,530
Here's the consignment.

312
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,033
Let's take a look at the livestock.

313
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,534
Six new scurvies.

314
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:37,310
That means six less barrels of water.

315
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,213
Get 'em outta there!

316
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:43,034
[Guard] All right, out of the wagon.

317
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,818
Come on outta there!

318
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,073
All right, you
scurvies, get outta there.

319
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,241
Come on, get a move on.

320
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,641
Come on, get a move on.

321
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,165
Come on.

322
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,594
Come on, get a move on.

323
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,914
On your feet.

324
00:19:56,914 --> 00:19:59,016
From now on, anybody gets
a callus on his butt,

325
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:00,917
He can take a free swing at me.

326
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,786
All right, inside. Quick step!

327
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,538
All right, you scurvies,
move along! Come on, move it!

328
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,624
Come on, move.

329
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:08,141
Prisoners, halt!

330
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,047
Address is right.

331
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,653
Now, I want your hats off.

332
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,159
You're gonna meet somebody.

333
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:28,795
You're gonna meet the Commandant.

334
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,211
Lieutenant Voorhees.

335
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,135
Maybe you're not gonna like him.

336
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,472
More important, he's not gonna like you.

337
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:41,941
Come to attention!

338
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,029
[Guard] Easy with those water barrels.

339
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,480
Take care of that water!

340
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,584
Consignment from Fort Jackson
and Fort Jefferson, sir.

341
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:52,269
Jackson?

342
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:53,971
That mean, well, we must be honored by

343
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:56,656
The presence of Mr. Gilman Hanley.

344
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,256
Which one is Hanley?

345
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:00,460
Right here.

346
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,406
Now, why wouldn't they
shoot a mad dog like you?

347
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:16,643
Look him over Doctor Pelham.

348
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,278
It's like this, Mr. Hanley.

349
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,467
In your little group here is a deserter,

350
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:26,953
A mutineer, a thief, and a murderer.

351
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:30,991
But you're the only one that
has gorilla on his record.

352
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,729
Gorillas burn down homes,

353
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:38,765
With women and children in them.

354
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:44,204
You'll find I have a special
regard for gorillas. Hm?

355
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,567
Now, because you're our new boarders,

356
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:57,384
And because we want you
gentlemen to be happy here,

357
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,587
We're gonna conduct you on a little tour.

358
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,356
All right, you scurvies, move along!

359
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:09,373
(Desolate music)

360
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:23,177
At their lowest point, those
cliffs are 208 feet high.

361
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:28,132
Even if you found a
way up out of the pits,

362
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:30,834
And somehow managed to climb these walls,

363
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,035
You know what would hit you in the face

364
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:33,703
When you got on the outside?

365
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,405
Hundreds of miles, in every direction,

366
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:38,909
Of the deadest, driest desert
you ever thought existed.

367
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,284
No man who's ever been
here ever knew of a way

368
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:43,781
Across that desert to the Mexican line.

369
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:46,951
Just bear in mind that
no man has ever made it.

370
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:48,968
And none of you is gonna be the first.

371
00:22:56,493 --> 00:23:00,146
Let's say a guest did manage
to wander out into the desert.

372
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:02,967
You don't think we'd
let you perish out there

373
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:04,661
With a thirst, do you?

374
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,652
Why, we wouldn't be that inconsiderate.

375
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,426
[Sgt. Maj. Kearn] On your feet.

376
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:18,765
They look like Apaches.

377
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,068
Beside them, Apaches are tame.

378
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,357
They're Pimas.

379
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:26,173
You know how they earn their pay?

380
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,292
For every escaped prisoner they bring

381
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,161
Out of the desert alive,

382
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:31,945
They get $25.

383
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,548
For every dead one, $50.

384
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,918
They'd like to see you
get out into the desert.

385
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:42,122
[Sgt. Maj. Kearn] As you were.

386
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:48,674
(Desolate music)

387
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,986
As an extra service,

388
00:23:56,986 --> 00:24:01,047
We have, what our guests
refer to, as the bake oven.

389
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:03,810
You can see its effect for yourselves.

390
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:17,258
With these majestic walls, and the desert,

391
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:21,461
You can see for yourselves
why we don't stress the use of

392
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:24,464
Iron bars and numerous guards.

393
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:30,004
I feel that you should also
know that we have no water here.

394
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:32,271
Absolutely none.

395
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,591
However, we are making every effort

396
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:38,212
To discover a source on our own premises.

397
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,898
Now, we need water here. Very badly.

398
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:46,898
Because, occasionally, we
are visited by the fever.

399
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,457
And that makes it very bad for everybody.

400
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:54,460
But until we discover a source of water,

401
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:58,364
We receive a supply once
a month from Copper City.

402
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,567
Well...

403
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,906
This concludes our little tour.

404
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:08,458
We bid you welcome.

405
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,343
Hope you enjoy your stay.

406
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,663
Get their shackles off.

407
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,832
Mark 'em and assign the cells.

408
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,834
All except the gorilla.

409
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,553
I want him to come with me.

410
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:21,688
Guard!

411
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:27,795
Blacksmith!

412
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,599
Now, you can put your hats on.

413
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,839
To send you here,
they must've wanted you

414
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,744
To remain alive.

415
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:00,026
That sort of ties my hands, doesn't it?

416
00:26:01,678 --> 00:26:04,248
Why did they want you to
stay alive, Mr. Hanley?

417
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:07,050
I'm here because they
couldn't kill me on the

418
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,436
Evidence they had.

419
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:10,771
You really believe that, don't ya?

420
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:14,107
Well, you don't have to worry
about being here too long.

421
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:15,959
If you brought me here to tell me that,

422
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,944
You're wasting your time.

423
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:22,048
A few years ago, I used
to bayonet that uniform.

424
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:25,451
It'd take a good deal to
make me change my mind.

425
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:28,721
You're the one to prove I made a mistake.

426
00:26:33,444 --> 00:26:35,311
Well, it's clear that
you're one prisoner

427
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:37,198
They don't want killed.

428
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:39,198
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:43,871
But these orders don't apply
to a man who tries to escape.

430
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:47,541
You thinkin' of forcing one to try?

431
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:51,044
Well, I...

432
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,781
I have to admire your spirit, Mr. Hanley.

433
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,838
That's the kind of spirit
it took for you gorillas

434
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:00,471
To burn down homes,

435
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:02,855
Without letting the
women and children out.

436
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:05,709
One of ya burned down mine.

437
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,994
With my wife and daughter in it.

438
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:19,539
You're not gonna like what
happens to you here, gorilla.

439
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:24,743
You're probably gonna want
to make a break for it.

440
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:28,681
Get these shackles off,
and put him in his cell.

441
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:34,754
Put him in with Redfield.

442
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,572
(Ominous music)

443
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,285
From now on, just think
of this as your parlor.

444
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:49,735
Open the grate!

445
00:27:50,654 --> 00:27:52,105
(Metal scraping)

446
00:27:58,128 --> 00:27:59,646
Down you go.

447
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:05,763
(Ominous music)

448
00:28:08,474 --> 00:28:10,223
Right turn, gorilla.

449
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:16,396
Now, left.

450
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,333
Get 17 open!

451
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,261
Like the Commandant said...

452
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,446
Welcome.

453
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:37,250
(Dramatic music)

454
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:42,138
Here's one of the reasons your water's

455
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,990
Gonna be short this month.

456
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:03,009
Let him settle, Jumper.

457
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:10,126
Jumper Hall is the name.

458
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:11,668
If you think we're glad
to have you with us,

459
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,136
You right.

460
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:14,337
We are not.

461
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:17,122
But as long as you're
here, meet the family.

462
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:20,760
This is Artilleryman Nye, Fifth, Ohio.

463
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,013
Still standing too close to the guns.

464
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,098
You make too much noise, Jumper.

465
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,085
This is Gundy Boyd, New York Infantry.

466
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:31,971
Hi. Sorry to see you.

467
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,507
You met the Pimas on the outside?

468
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:37,610
This one is on the inside.

469
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:40,045
Ever seen a deformed Indian?

470
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:42,515
Killed one of his own people.

471
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,986
Now, nobody likes you, do they, Hunchy?

472
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,722
[Redfield] Hey, cut it
out, both of you guys!

473
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,018
Sorry, Hunchy.

474
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:53,576
I said get him settled.

475
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,328
All right, Red.

476
00:29:58,014 --> 00:30:00,516
You can see we are a happy family in here.

477
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:02,986
I'm the only who's got a
chance to walk out of here.

478
00:30:02,986 --> 00:30:04,737
My time in, you can count.

479
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,906
Come over here.

480
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:15,715
You got a long time to go in here?

481
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,667
Not very long.

482
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:18,802
Same with me.

483
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:20,186
Less than a year.

484
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:25,475
Ah, you didn't ask to be put in with us,

485
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,162
And we didn't ask to have you.

486
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:30,280
Now, I think the smartest
thing is for you and us

487
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,399
To make the best of it, right?

488
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:34,868
Well, what's that mean?

489
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:37,621
Just don't ever talk about
what you see to anybody.

490
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,905
Not even to us.

491
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:41,091
We got an understanding?

492
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,142
Who says we need an understanding?

493
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:44,910
Fine.

494
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:48,681
In this hole, we've got to
breath together to live.

495
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,050
And you don't want to breath with us.

496
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:54,521
Now, what are we gonna do about you?

497
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:57,357
That's up to you.

498
00:30:57,707 --> 00:30:58,992
[Sgt. Maj. Kearn] Open 17.

499
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:04,464
(Gate unlocking and opening)

500
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:15,342
Here's you playmate, Red.

501
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:20,196
Any of you got any complaints
about short water rations,

502
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:21,346
See him.

503
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,934
Well, you don't see anybody
rushin' for the water, do ya?

504
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,953
You got 'em all too well
trained, if front of me.

505
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:32,125
Just once, don't slam it.

506
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,000
Sargent...(slams gate)

507
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:44,554
Sargent, let me see Doc Pelham.

508
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,723
He can't get you outta
work in the cistern.

509
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:49,326
He can if he knows what
the noise does to me.

510
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:50,861
Voorhees knows.

511
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,562
The cistern,

512
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:54,591
I-it's like a thousand
explosions inside here.

513
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:55,564
To a gorilla?

514
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:56,766
I'm an artilleryman.

515
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,000
You were.

516
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,769
All Voorhees knows is what you turned into

517
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:02,138
After you skipped the artillery.

518
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:04,992
This is one noise he
wants you to get used to.

519
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,363
(Retreating footsteps)

520
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:16,369
I won't ever work in that cistern again.

521
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,606
Get your cup, Nye.

522
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:50,637
What about him?

523
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:58,311
Oh, don't worry about the killer.

524
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:02,648
Guess he must like this
better than water. (Thuds)

525
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:08,155
(Dramatic music)

526
00:33:15,311 --> 00:33:16,446
Bleeding from the nose and mouth

527
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:18,397
Means internal injuries.

528
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:21,200
A man can die that way.

529
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,203
I don't want you helpin' him along.

530
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:27,106
You don't?

531
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:28,724
You come in here new,

532
00:33:28,724 --> 00:33:30,960
And start tellin' me what you want?

533
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,945
Red!

534
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:34,548
Let him go.

535
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:40,319
Is this what you meant
by an understanding?

536
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:44,257
Get your cup.

537
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:48,194
(Thuds)

538
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,631
(Gate unlocking)

539
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,606
You, against the wall. Lean!

540
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:03,342
Turn around!

541
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,079
Now, lean.

542
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,181
Would you say everything's all right, Red?

543
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:26,465
No disturbance.

544
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,868
Yeah, I'd say.

545
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,450
You know...

546
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,403
They like nothing better
than target practice.

547
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:49,521
In case you're ever thinking of running.

548
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:20,852
Thanks.

549
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,357
Still trying to make
it good for him, gorilla?

550
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:29,863
The man's dying.

551
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,132
Well, he better not die.

552
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,036
I hear you're some kind of a doc.

553
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:38,003
Can you keep him alive?

554
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:40,406
I'll do better than you've done.

555
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:44,143
As long as you do, we'll
leave our business unfinished.

556
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:47,213
(Brass horn playing)

557
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:08,635
(Suspenseful music)

558
00:36:09,552 --> 00:36:11,654
I told ya I won't go
down in that cistern again.

559
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:12,855
Go ahead and shoot.

560
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,039
Why, you.

561
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:16,875
Prisoner loose! Prisoner loose!

562
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:19,439
Hold your fire.

563
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:20,863
Hold your fire!

564
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,548
On the rim, hold your fire!

565
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,267
Why don't you shoot? Go ahead and shoot!

566
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:26,920
Why don't you shoot?

567
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:30,273
Go ahead! Why don't you shoot?

568
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,691
Why don't you shoot!

569
00:36:32,642 --> 00:36:36,162
(Dramatic music)

570
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:39,498
What a gorilla wants
is a run for his money.

571
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:43,736
(Dramatic music)

572
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,228
Go ahead! Why don't you shoot?

573
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,546
Why don't you shoot!

574
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:58,951
Why don't you shoot!

575
00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:03,555
All right, Sargent.

576
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:05,124
Commence firing!

577
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:06,926
Commence firing!
(guns firing)

578
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:14,955
(Dramatic music)

579
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,800
Bring him down, Sargent.

580
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,052
Mapes, Calard, on the double!

581
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:50,737
Man ended up one of
your kind. A gorilla.

582
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:53,456
Move 'em along.

583
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:55,508
Detail, forward! Quick step!

584
00:37:56,726 --> 00:38:00,579
(Desolate music)

585
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:08,004
Keep goin'.

586
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:10,273
Keep goin'! Close it up!

587
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:11,457
Close it up!

588
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:17,576
(Desolate music)

589
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:35,831
Go easy, when it starts.

590
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:36,899
We've been digging for years.

591
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,634
There's no water below us.

592
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:40,937
That's the way Voorhees keeps us busy.

593
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:42,421
Just watch the dust.

594
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,056
Right turn!

595
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,063
All right, get diggin'.

596
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:57,316
(Desolute music)

All secure!

605
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:35,707
How is he?

606
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:39,111
He won't get any better in here.

607
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,552
That's it, killer.

608
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:50,255
The last thing we want
is to lose you for good.

609
00:39:51,874 --> 00:39:55,245
He's a chicken dirt robber of the dead.

610
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:56,796
Real careful, Mott.

611
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,365
Mott didn't wanna be a soldier.

612
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,769
He lived all his life a
hundred miles from here.

613
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:04,670
Copper City.

614
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:06,973
You know what he was?

615
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:09,108
A prospector.

616
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,845
You know where he prospected?

617
00:40:12,196 --> 00:40:13,512
In the desert.

618
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:15,664
You're never going to...

619
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,883
Easy, Mott.

620
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:20,036
He's the only man who's ever been in here

621
00:40:20,036 --> 00:40:21,671
Who knows the way across that desert

622
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:23,288
To the Mexican line.

623
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,658
And Mott's gonna tell me, when I'm ready.

624
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:31,029
First, you've gotta
get out in the desert.

625
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,334
I'll show you how things
can be done around here.

626
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:38,403
Come over here, and learn something.

627
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,015
Hey, Red. I'll watch the door.

628
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,884
No, you won't.

629
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:54,204
Hunchy.

630
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:55,321
Keep an eye out.

631
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:00,209
Look close.

632
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,411
Hundreds of years ago, the Indians had

633
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:02,994
A fire going right here.

634
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:07,001
Now, I figure that where there's fire,

635
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:09,402
There's gotta be a way
out for the smoke, right?

636
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,823
Took me over a year to find out

637
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:16,726
That none of these cracks
went up high enough

638
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,277
To be the outlet.

639
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:21,447
You know where that smoke traveled?

640
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:24,350
It curled in and out of these,

641
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,520
'Til it found its way up that one.

642
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:35,761
(Soft thudding)

643
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:39,531
(Approaching footsteps)

644
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,106
(Retreating footsteps)

645
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,987
Think we got somethin' worthwhile here?

646
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:03,122
All right, let's get started.

647
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,497
He follows me up.

648
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:17,949
(Slow dramatic music)

649
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:49,146
(Dramatic orchestral music)

650
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:19,498
This is as far as we've gone.

651
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,501
Broken pick heads.

652
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:24,370
Made to order, for in here.

653
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,638
Kearn's still lookin' for 'em.

654
00:43:28,158 --> 00:43:30,543
Well, we oughta break
through this part tonight.

655
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:32,828
Yeah, even if you make
it over these cliffs,

656
00:43:32,828 --> 00:43:35,714
You've still got the desert
and those Pima Indians.

657
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:40,086
Three days before we go, I
write a letter to Copper City.

658
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,704
It's an innocent letter to a shoe shop.

659
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,389
Sayin' I need a pair of shoes.

660
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:45,908
The third night, you know what's hidden

661
00:43:45,908 --> 00:43:47,727
100 yards outside these cliffs?

662
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:49,328
Horses.

663
00:43:49,912 --> 00:43:53,065
And on those horses will
be full canteens and guns.

664
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,603
I hope you make it.

665
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:00,190
Where are you goin'?

666
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,841
You gonna work with us, or not?

667
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:03,893
All Voorhees needs is to find out

668
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,160
I'm part of this.

669
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,296
It's kind of important
Voorhees doesn't find out

670
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,214
Anything about it.

671
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:12,551
Gundy, get Mott up here.

672
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:15,287
He can work in the gorilla's place.

673
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,691
This kind of work
won't be good for Mott.

674
00:44:21,377 --> 00:44:23,696
You can't take a chance on Mott dying.

675
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:28,100
That's not the way.

676
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,705
Look at it like this.

677
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,740
The most of us are a long time here.

678
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:38,901
This way, we have a chance.

679
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,231
You can't stay awake all
night, for many nights.

680
00:44:41,231 --> 00:44:43,215
There's six of us. We'll be watching you.

681
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,552
One morning, we'll come in
find you had an accident.

682
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:48,337
Then, whatever it is you wanted to prove

683
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,788
Won't be proved.

684
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,107
You won't have helped Mott,

685
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,392
You won't have helped us,

686
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:55,995
And you won't have helped yourself.

687
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:27,506
(Melancholic music)

688
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,795
[Voiceover] My dearest.

689
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:34,049
It's dark outside now,

690
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:37,302
And already the dawn
seems an eternity away.

691
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:40,556
In the morning, I leave for St. Louis,

692
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:43,459
Where Neill has arranged for
me to meet Senator Caldwell,

693
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:46,378
Who's staying over there,
before returning to Washington.

694
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:50,946
Neill says the Senator is an
honest man of great influence.

695
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:52,652
Perhaps he'll help us.

696
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:56,322
If necessary, I'll go back
to Washington, myself.

697
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:59,858
(Approaching footsteps)

698
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:02,627
[Sgt. Maj. Kearn] Hanley, sir.

699
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,130
Oh, Mr. Hanley.

700
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:09,718
I have a letter here from
Lieutenant Colonel Woods,

701
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:11,736
The judge advocate at your trial.

702
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:16,208
He wants to know if you have
any inclination to talk.

703
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:19,244
You got any inclination?

704
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:21,480
Talk about what?

705
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:26,335
Brechene had over a
hundred of you gorillas.

706
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:28,654
They'd like to know where
the rest of them are.

707
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:32,324
That all?

708
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:36,260
Good. Good.

709
00:46:36,745 --> 00:46:38,613
I'm glad you have no inclination,

710
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:42,335
'Cause if you had, I might've
had to turn you loose.

711
00:46:43,186 --> 00:46:45,470
I hope you hold out, gorilla.

712
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:48,307
I hope you hold out 'til it's too late.

713
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:50,975
That's all.

714
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:56,415
What about the letters from my wife?

715
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:00,469
You sure there were some letters?

716
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:01,786
I'm sure.

717
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:07,893
Like these, maybe.

718
00:47:08,844 --> 00:47:11,129
Well, yes, your wife has written you.

719
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:14,900
I felt it best not to bother you with...

720
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:17,670
Letters like these.

721
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,540
Does she say anything about
the reopening of the trial?

722
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:25,427
Oh, yeah, she's written to Washington.

723
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:27,229
She's been to Washington.

724
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,582
She's done everything she can for ya.

725
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,535
Tell me, gorilla...

726
00:47:33,535 --> 00:47:36,455
Are you growing tired of our cistern?

727
00:47:39,044 --> 00:47:40,726
Do I get my letters?

728
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:46,765
Take him back to his cell.

729
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,931
Don't!

730
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,068
It might ruin its shape.

731
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:27,289
Some kids learned arithmetic.

732
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:28,907
I learned to pick locks.

733
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,345
Can you pick that one?

734
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:33,445
Sure.

735
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:35,947
But where you gonna go after it's picked?

736
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:38,033
Maybe the guards on this level

737
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:39,601
Asked the guards on the main level

738
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,637
To pull up the grate.

739
00:48:41,637 --> 00:48:43,605
And the guards at the tunnel
mouth and the main gate

740
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:46,392
All decide to go to sleep. (Laughing)

741
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:57,868
You're beat.

742
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,172
You won't stand many days
double-shift in the cistern.

743
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:06,681
Voorhees is in for a surprise.

744
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:10,882
I'm gonna get used to it.

745
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,001
You feeling any better?

746
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:31,970
Voorhees...

747
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:34,206
[Gilman] Lie back.

748
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,812
I scratched it on
the inside of the door.

749
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,649
The way across the desert.

750
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:45,684
Scratched,

751
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:49,020
Right above your eyes.

752
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:53,225
What door?

753
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,828
You (mumbles), didn't ya?

754
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,415
I told him I hope they
bake you in the oven

755
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:01,933
Until... (gasps, thuds)

756
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,333
It don't make any difference
whether you go along,

757
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,251
Just give me what he told ya.

758
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,759
He said somethin'
about marks on the door.

759
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:30,829
There's nothin' there.

760
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:39,037
Post number six, all secure!

761
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:44,008
Post number six, all secure!

762
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:50,316
(Scraping)

763
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:16,208
(Dramatic music)

764
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:18,293
Hey, gorilla.

765
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:20,629
Come out of it, come on.

766
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:23,215
You won't have to fight
that cistern anymore.

767
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,467
We're there.

768
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:28,086
We've broken through.

769
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:29,688
Take a look.

770
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,840
(Dramatic music)

771
00:51:51,626 --> 00:51:52,743
All this time,

772
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:55,213
And now a foot outside, it's free.

773
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,016
Well, the rest is just like walking out.

774
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:01,303
Now, the rest is up to you.

775
00:52:02,573 --> 00:52:04,590
Not up to me.

776
00:52:07,175 --> 00:52:09,044
We've broken through.

777
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,429
We're gonna rot waiting
for him to change his mind.

778
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:18,069
(Dramatic music)

779
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:29,332
How close to outside?

780
00:52:29,332 --> 00:52:30,648
He's through.

781
00:52:32,268 --> 00:52:34,170
You mean, they can try it now?

782
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,120
Well, there's nothin' in their way.

783
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:38,806
Except the climb to the top,

784
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:40,075
The guards,

785
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,911
Getting down the outside of the cliff,

786
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:43,916
The desert, and the Pimas.

787
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:45,463
Yeah, they can try.

788
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,898
You didn't tell 'em what Mott said?

789
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:51,586
Look, can you work that lock tonight?

790
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:52,838
What for?

791
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:56,691
All it gets you is on the
other side of this gate.

792
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:58,611
After that, you can't get nowhere.

793
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:01,913
There's some things I want
in the Commandant's office.

794
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:04,649
Commandant's office?

795
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:06,852
You crazy?

796
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:08,271
Open it.

797
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:09,253
Not now.

798
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:12,457
In less than an hour,
they got guard relief.

799
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,810
They'll leave the grate
at the top of the ramp

800
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,261
Open for eight minutes.

801
00:53:17,446 --> 00:53:19,515
Whatever you're gonna do,

802
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:21,165
You got eight minutes.

803
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:26,504
(Suspenseful music)

804
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,490
This is crazy.

805
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,076
Maybe you got a chance to
walk out of here, like I have.

806
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:34,313
If Voorhees catches...

807
00:53:35,563 --> 00:53:40,418
(Suspenseful music)

808
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:56,046
(Suspenseful music builds)

809
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:04,971
(Approaching footsteps)

810
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:07,435
Hup! Hup!

811
00:54:07,795 --> 00:54:09,781
Hup! Hup! Hup!

812
00:54:10,828 --> 00:54:15,828
(Suspenseful music)

813
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,337
[Guard] Who's there?

814
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:38,276
That you, Corporal?

815
00:54:41,998 --> 00:54:43,013
Halt!

816
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:46,452
(Gun fires)

817
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:49,220
Get Sargent Kearn!

818
00:54:50,138 --> 00:54:53,758
(Suspenseful music)

819
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:15,297
In here!

820
00:55:15,297 --> 00:55:16,515
(Indistinct talking)

821
00:55:22,437 --> 00:55:24,105
Couldn't make him out.

822
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:25,457
Open it up.

823
00:55:33,682 --> 00:55:35,100
Who was it?

824
00:55:36,685 --> 00:55:38,637
Don't give me the "I don't know".

825
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:42,874
Who just came in here.

826
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,009
Nobody.

827
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,647
You know what happens to liars, Gundy.

828
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:52,651
Well, maybe I gotta
go through this again.

829
00:55:54,402 --> 00:55:56,120
I said nobody came in here.

830
00:55:56,505 --> 00:55:57,856
I meant nobody.

831
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:04,045
You, you, and you. Outside.

832
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:05,763
You know what's gonna happen.

833
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,868
Why them?

834
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:11,886
What difference does it make?

835
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:13,989
Sooner or later, one of 'em will talk,

836
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:15,557
With some urging.

837
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:17,358
You can save the effort.

838
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:19,144
I was the one who was out.

839
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:23,347
You lied to me, Gundy.

840
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:25,917
You know the penalty for lyin'.

841
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,586
Outside.

842
00:56:29,337 --> 00:56:31,406
I told ya, I'm the one you want.

843
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:32,907
Sure.

844
00:56:32,907 --> 00:56:35,461
Only Voorhees will want
to handle you himself.

845
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,754
Let's get it off, liar.

846
00:57:10,346 --> 00:57:12,663
And I want to know how
that gate got opened.

847
00:57:27,629 --> 00:57:29,414
All on account of you.

848
00:57:29,832 --> 00:57:31,483
You wonderin' whether you're worth it?

849
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:35,186
(Dramatic music)

850
00:57:41,343 --> 00:57:43,328
Their way, it takes all night.

851
00:57:44,346 --> 00:57:46,598
And we got to wait for each one, too.

852
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:54,622
[Prisoner] Speed it up! Speed it up!

853
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:55,624
[Prisoner Two] Get it over with.

854
00:57:55,624 --> 00:57:56,257
[Prisoner] Speed it up!

855
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:56,958
[Prisoner Two] Get it over with!

856
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:57,625
[Prisoner] Speed it up!

857
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,393
[Prisoner Two] All right, all right!

858
00:57:58,393 --> 00:57:59,060
[Prisoner] That's enough.

859
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,729
[Prisoner Two] All right,
enough! He's had enough!

860
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:02,864
[Prisoner] Let him down. Let him down!

861
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:05,062
[Guard] Quiet! Shut up, in this cell!

862
00:58:05,062 --> 00:58:05,866
(Whip lashing)

863
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:08,548
[Prisoner Two] Get it
over with. Get it over with.

864
00:58:08,548 --> 00:58:09,554
[Guard] Shut up!

865
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,122
(Whip lashes)

866
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:13,457
Shut up, you scurvies!

867
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:15,543
Quiet!
(whip lashes)

868
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:17,383
[Prisoner] Let him down! Let him down!

869
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:19,681
(Whip lashes)
(prisoners shouts overlapping)

870
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:22,267
You gonna help us, or do
you like what you started?

871
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:24,435
(Whip lashes)

872
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:27,823
[Prisoner Two] Get it over
with. All right, all right!

873
00:58:27,823 --> 00:58:28,774
(Whip lashes)

874
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:29,891
All right!

875
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:31,159
Open up.

876
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:32,928
Not that way.

877
00:58:32,928 --> 00:58:34,779
You're more good to us alive.

878
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,001
(Whip lashes)
(prisoners shouting)

879
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:40,969
Gundy's had enough on account of me.

880
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:42,220
Now, get it open!

881
00:58:42,637 --> 00:58:46,758
[Prisoners] Now! Now! Now!
(whip lashes)

882
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:50,812
[Guard] Shut up, or we'll
give you some of the same!

883
00:58:53,202 --> 00:58:54,999
The more you yell, the more he'll...

884
00:58:55,683 --> 00:58:58,838
(Dramatic music)

885
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:00,538
(Whip lashes)

886
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:05,810
(Dramatic music)

887
00:59:08,562 --> 00:59:09,814
(Guns firing)

888
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:17,972
Come on!

889
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,275
Grab those torches!

890
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:20,791
Grab those torches!

891
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:23,478
Get Kearn! Get Kearn!

892
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:24,379
Kill 'em!

893
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:26,130
Get a move on it!

894
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,401
Open the grate!

895
00:59:31,286 --> 00:59:36,286
(Suspenseful music)

896
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:46,717
(Ringing)

897
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:52,307
Ah!

898
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:56,861
(Dramatic music)

899
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:59,230
(Ringing)

900
01:00:00,115 --> 01:00:04,950
(Dramatic music)

901
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:11,510
Hold it, that mug
Hanley'll get himself killed.

902
01:00:13,295 --> 01:00:17,315
(Suspenseful music)

903
01:00:18,933 --> 01:00:19,850
(Thuds)

904
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:24,951
(Thuds)

905
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:30,706
(Dramatic music)

906
01:00:42,256 --> 01:00:44,442
You crazy mug! Come off there!

907
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,614
(Indistinct yelling)

908
01:00:58,202 --> 01:01:00,736
Get up. Who's responsible?

909
01:01:01,316 --> 01:01:03,128
Him. All the way.

910
01:01:04,012 --> 01:01:05,984
Inciting a riot.

911
01:01:05,984 --> 01:01:07,782
Well, providing nobody's been killed,

912
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:10,618
It'll be a long time before
you'll see the sun again.

913
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:12,069
But you'll feel it.

914
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:16,241
(Desolate music)

915
01:01:28,536 --> 01:01:30,088
Any life in there?

916
01:01:30,672 --> 01:01:32,440
He ain't much on food.

917
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,275
But he don't leave no water.

918
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,310
[Guard] In a couple more days,

919
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,961
He'll be leaving ya his water.

920
01:01:37,879 --> 01:01:40,565
(Desolate music)

921
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,168
(Breathing heavily)

922
01:01:54,596 --> 01:01:56,631
[Voiceover] I crossed the desert.

923
01:01:56,631 --> 01:01:59,817
I, I scratched it, right above your eyes.

924
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,105
Come in, Neill.

925
01:02:06,615 --> 01:02:09,027
You remember Mr. Price at the trial.

926
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:11,662
This is Colonel Wood, the judge advocate.

927
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,648
Neill, it's happened.

928
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:15,415
They're letting Gil come home.

929
01:02:15,415 --> 01:02:16,767
For a fair trial?

930
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:18,652
As I told Mrs. Hanley,

931
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,488
Her husband hasn't been acquitted.

932
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:22,223
He's to be released under my custody,

933
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:24,141
To report to me twice a month.

934
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:27,228
I'll want a complete
account of his every move.

935
01:02:27,228 --> 01:02:29,830
As well as a list of
the visitors he's had.

936
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,532
But that's not freeing him.

937
01:02:31,532 --> 01:02:34,368
Oh, he'll be home.
That's what's important.

938
01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:36,672
Sounds to me like Gil's
being used for bait.

939
01:02:36,672 --> 01:02:37,721
Neill.

940
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:40,008
You're hoping what's
left of Brechene's gorillas

941
01:02:40,008 --> 01:02:42,777
Will try to contact Gil, and
give you a chance to grab 'em.

942
01:02:42,777 --> 01:02:44,579
That's your own conclusion, Mr. Price.

943
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:46,615
Please, Neill, it's all right.

944
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:49,284
Hanley isn't being
forced to leave the prison.

945
01:02:49,284 --> 01:02:51,419
The full facts will be presented to him.

946
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:53,955
If he decided to cooperate,

947
01:02:53,955 --> 01:02:56,173
There's a chance his
sentence will be reduced.

948
01:02:56,757 --> 01:02:59,043
I want to remind Gil to thank you.

949
01:02:59,628 --> 01:03:01,219
Good day, Mrs. Hanley.

950
01:03:01,659 --> 01:03:02,856
Mr. Price.

951
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,202
When will Gil come home?

952
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,937
I'll send a dispatch today.

953
01:03:09,937 --> 01:03:12,072
It should reach the prison tomorrow.

954
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,609
But the prison officials
have three weeks to decide

955
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:18,179
Whether the prisoner's
record justifies his release.

956
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:19,397
Thank you.

957
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:23,902
Open it up.

958
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,605
Come on, come on.

959
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:33,007
(Door creaks)

960
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:37,682
Well, Hanley.

961
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:40,501
Dr. Pelham tells me you might die

962
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:42,887
If we left you in there any longer.

963
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,874
We can't have anything like that happen,

964
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:47,459
Inside the prison.

965
01:03:49,377 --> 01:03:50,594
Get him out.

966
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,665
Come on, on your feet.

967
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:58,086
Three or four days
rest down in the cistern,

968
01:03:58,086 --> 01:03:59,321
You'll be able to come back here

969
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:01,890
And pay off the time you owe the oven.

970
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,557
Go on, take him down.

971
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:24,228
Easy.

972
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,798
You've had a bad time.

973
01:04:28,149 --> 01:04:29,667
[Gundy] Welcome back.

974
01:04:30,718 --> 01:04:32,736
We didn't think you'd make it.

975
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:35,392
Anytime you're ready,

976
01:04:35,392 --> 01:04:37,441
You can send that letter to the shoe shop.

977
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:43,333
You're gonna give me the way.

978
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,149
I'm gonna show it to ya.

979
01:04:46,268 --> 01:04:48,887
Post number one, nine o'clock!

980
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:51,155
All secure!

981
01:04:52,874 --> 01:04:55,660
Post number one, nine o'clock!

982
01:04:56,578 --> 01:04:57,962
All secure!

983
01:04:58,746 --> 01:05:00,664
(Horn blowing)

984
01:05:03,384 --> 01:05:05,235
Now, exactly where?

985
01:05:10,325 --> 01:05:11,876
Right above that ridge.

986
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:13,744
Hm.

987
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:20,621
Now, how do they know where
they're gonna come out?

988
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:22,954
Oh, Redfield's got
it figured to the inch.

989
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:26,274
What time tonight?

990
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:28,593
Right after the midnight guard change.

991
01:05:29,944 --> 01:05:31,908
What makes you so sure that

992
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:35,315
Mott told Hanley the
way across that desert?

993
01:05:35,315 --> 01:05:37,084
Oh, I'm not so sure.

994
01:05:37,084 --> 01:05:38,336
Redfield's sure.

995
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:40,571
That's good enough for me.

996
01:05:41,455 --> 01:05:42,606
Mm hm.

997
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,442
All right, take him back to his cell.

998
01:05:47,095 --> 01:05:49,179
You're not gonna put me back there now.

999
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,489
But I don't wanna make the try.

1000
01:05:59,274 --> 01:06:01,025
I want to walk out of here.

1001
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:03,260
In less than a year.

1002
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:06,330
And I won't, if you make
me go with them tonight.

1003
01:06:09,217 --> 01:06:11,669
You'll never let 'em get to
the top of that cliff alive.

1004
01:06:12,653 --> 01:06:14,271
Take him back to his cell.

1005
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,045
(Door closes)

1006
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:22,882
Well...

1007
01:06:23,872 --> 01:06:26,250
You get your wish to
get back at a gorilla.

1008
01:06:27,535 --> 01:06:29,570
One of the ones that tries tonight

1009
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,854
Was a gorilla.

1010
01:06:32,941 --> 01:06:37,495
(Suspenseful music)

1011
01:07:12,647 --> 01:07:15,899
Hey, Red. What if
Voorhees knows about it?

1012
01:07:16,183 --> 01:07:18,353
He'll shoot us as we come out.

1013
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:19,820
There's no way he can know.

1014
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,722
But what if he does?

1015
01:07:21,722 --> 01:07:24,592
And he's out there,
waiting for us to come out.

1016
01:07:24,592 --> 01:07:27,195
Well, then I'd say somebody told him.

1017
01:07:27,195 --> 01:07:28,463
Long as you're the one worrying about it,

1018
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:30,481
Maybe you better climb out first.

1019
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:33,450
I was just thinking
of what could happen.

1020
01:07:34,502 --> 01:07:36,254
[Redfield] We'll follow you, Jumper.

1021
01:07:42,178 --> 01:07:46,997
(Suspenseful music)

1022
01:08:01,195 --> 01:08:06,016
(Suspenseful music)

1023
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,557
Now, Lieutenant.

1024
01:08:47,341 --> 01:08:49,143
No, he's not outside yet.

1025
01:08:49,143 --> 01:08:50,694
Hold your fire.

1026
01:08:51,612 --> 01:08:53,214
I want him far enough away to send

1027
01:08:53,214 --> 01:08:55,131
My retrievers after him.

1028
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:04,287
(Suspenseful music)

1029
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,788
Jumper. You tried to inform on us.

1030
01:09:33,788 --> 01:09:35,323
No, I didn't. No, I didn't!

1031
01:09:35,323 --> 01:09:36,107
(Thuds)

1032
01:09:37,025 --> 01:09:39,543
(Dramatic music)

1033
01:10:03,017 --> 01:10:04,267
Come on!

1034
01:10:05,353 --> 01:10:09,606
(Dramatic music)

1035
01:10:12,726 --> 01:10:13,778
(Horses whinnying)

1036
01:10:26,374 --> 01:10:27,643
Let's get going.

1037
01:10:27,643 --> 01:10:29,256
Where's Jumper?

1038
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:30,211
He didn't make it.

1039
01:10:30,211 --> 01:10:31,945
Well, there were five
of us. Only four horses.

1040
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:33,147
You said guns and water.

1041
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:34,314
I've got 'em.

1042
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,986
Let's get outta here before they find out

1043
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:37,401
And turn those Pimas on us.

1044
01:10:38,919 --> 01:10:43,919
(Dramatic music)

1045
01:10:59,273 --> 01:11:01,392
(Wind howling)

1046
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:20,077
[Redfield] Well?

1047
01:11:21,095 --> 01:11:23,530
Another 15 miles, and we're halfway.

1048
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,865
Let's go!

1049
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:26,066
Are you crazy?

1050
01:11:26,066 --> 01:11:28,702
All you been telling me is we
gotta stay in a straight line.

1051
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:30,136
Bog down in this storm,
and lose that line,

1052
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:32,273
What'll we do, go back to
the prison and start over?

1053
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,141
No, we wait here for
the Pimas to catch up.

1054
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:35,543
But they're on foot!

1055
01:11:35,543 --> 01:11:37,044
All right, you stay here.

1056
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,447
You tell the men to cross
the desert and get free.

1057
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:40,614
I've sweated to get this far.

1058
01:11:40,614 --> 01:11:41,715
Do you think I can't take care of

1059
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:43,800
A few rat-faced, lousy redskins?

1060
01:11:44,785 --> 01:11:46,687
You're waiting 'til I say.

1061
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,655
I've wasted too much time on this.

1062
01:11:48,655 --> 01:11:50,107
You're not gonna get us lost.

1063
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,744
You try finding the way by yourself.

1064
01:11:55,129 --> 01:11:56,781
(Wind howling)

1065
01:11:59,933 --> 01:12:01,118
(Horse whinnying)

1066
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:08,759
(Thuds)

1067
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:12,030
(Thudding and grunting)

1068
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,370
(Thudding)

1069
01:12:29,931 --> 01:12:30,848
(Whooshing)

1070
01:12:33,534 --> 01:12:35,185
(Pimas whooping)

1071
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,489
(Dramatic music)

1072
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,103
(Gun fires)

1073
01:12:54,756 --> 01:12:55,906
(Gun fires)

1074
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,944
(Gun firing)

1075
01:13:00,862 --> 01:13:02,145
(Gun firing)

1076
01:13:03,678 --> 01:13:04,728
(Gun fires)

1077
01:13:05,419 --> 01:13:06,370
(Gun fires)

1078
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:07,584
(Gun fires)

1079
01:13:20,915 --> 01:13:25,915
(Dramatic music)

1080
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:47,257
(Suspenseful music)

1081
01:13:48,975 --> 01:13:49,944
(Gun fires)

1082
01:13:49,944 --> 01:13:51,060
(Gun fires)

1083
01:13:53,247 --> 01:13:55,099
(Pimas whooping)

1084
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:59,970
(Dramatic music builds)

1085
01:14:02,456 --> 01:14:03,440
(Gun fires)

1086
01:14:05,593 --> 01:14:06,894
Hold your fire!

1087
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:07,928
[Sgt. Maj. Kearn] Hold your fire!

1088
01:14:07,928 --> 01:14:09,179
Hold your fire!

1089
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:28,064
Come on down here, Hanley.

1090
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,398
Where's the rest of 'em?

1091
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:45,482
Dead.

1092
01:14:45,966 --> 01:14:48,536
Well, I almost didn't get here in time.

1093
01:14:48,536 --> 01:14:50,520
That would've been too bad for me.

1094
01:14:51,072 --> 01:14:53,723
They sent for ya. Officially.

1095
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,293
They want to turn you loose.

1096
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:58,863
But they've left it up to me.

1097
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,015
You boys did your job.

1098
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,050
You'll get paid in full,

1099
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,135
Even if it has to come
out of my own pocket.

1100
01:15:05,953 --> 01:15:07,604
Soldier, pick up his horse!

1101
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:13,445
(Desolate music)

1102
01:15:40,387 --> 01:15:41,889
How long overdue?

1103
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:43,807
Oh, two hours.

1104
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,259
Looks like they'll
come back as empty-handed

1105
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:48,095
As the other details.

1106
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,746
If they come back.

1107
01:15:50,798 --> 01:15:54,067
Well, a man can go
three weeks without food,

1108
01:15:54,067 --> 01:15:55,552
And three days without water.

1109
01:15:56,036 --> 01:15:58,589
Tomorrow'll be the
second day without water.

1110
01:15:59,073 --> 01:16:01,092
We had enough water here for two weeks.

1111
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:03,860
All the barrels were
dumped, thanks to you.

1112
01:16:05,045 --> 01:16:07,648
Who knows about typhus fever?

1113
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:09,883
Decimated the Roman Legions.

1114
01:16:09,883 --> 01:16:11,985
Out here, one of our own guards fall dead,

1115
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:13,855
And it's here.

1116
01:16:13,855 --> 01:16:16,624
Did he get it out of the filth
of the underground cells?

1117
01:16:16,624 --> 01:16:19,076
Did he breathe it out of the air?

1118
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:23,696
All we know is, it can
contaminate the water they drink.

1119
01:16:23,696 --> 01:16:25,982
That's why I emptied our supply.

1120
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:27,468
And unless we get fresh water...

1121
01:16:27,468 --> 01:16:29,403
Oh, get away from me! Don't talk to me.

1122
01:16:29,403 --> 01:16:31,722
Go give him a pill, that's
all you're good for.

1123
01:16:32,406 --> 01:16:36,593
Good citizens have erected a
barricade outside the town.

1124
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:39,685
They're afraid we'll come in contact with

1125
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:41,682
Their wives and kids.

1126
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:44,334
They've fired on every detail
I've sent in there for water.

1127
01:16:47,554 --> 01:16:49,272
[Guard] Detail coming in!

1128
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,508
(Approaching hoofbeats)

1129
01:16:57,231 --> 01:16:58,832
No water, sir.

1130
01:16:58,832 --> 01:17:00,567
You gotta give me more men.

1131
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:03,070
They shot Mapes and
Clark at the barricade.

1132
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,354
We need a whole company to get through.

1133
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,224
Guards!

1134
01:17:09,743 --> 01:17:11,091
Get him to dispensary.

1135
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:12,713
He's got it, sir.

1136
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:14,464
We can't touch him.

1137
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,487
Now, you do like I tell ya.

1138
01:17:20,487 --> 01:17:22,379
Get him to the dispensary.

1139
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:23,816
Come on, hurry up.

1140
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:35,102
Go on back.

1141
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,938
Go on back, and tell 'em I
got half this prison down

1142
01:17:36,938 --> 01:17:38,539
With typhus fever.

1143
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:40,875
Dying 50 a day, and no water.

1144
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,010
Tell 'em they oughta
be proud of themselves,

1145
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,012
Shootin' my men down.

1146
01:17:45,012 --> 01:17:46,780
All we ask is water.

1147
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,864
Go on!

1148
01:17:48,448 --> 01:17:50,651
Ah, hold up, soldier.

1149
01:17:50,651 --> 01:17:51,718
Hold up.

1150
01:17:51,718 --> 01:17:52,903
Dismount.

1151
01:17:54,854 --> 01:17:57,974
Never mind. Get yourself some rest.

1152
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,952
There's one way to get water.

1153
01:18:11,171 --> 01:18:12,523
Dream it up?

1154
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:14,341
There's a prisoner...

1155
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:17,344
Knows how to cross the desert into Mexico.

1156
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,762
He could bring back enough to get us by.

1157
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:24,534
The gorilla?

1158
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:26,136
He could do it.

1159
01:18:35,228 --> 01:18:36,680
(Men moaning)

1160
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:42,032
[Patient] Doc, you've
gotta give me some water.

1161
01:18:42,032 --> 01:18:43,887
I-I'm gonna die without it.

1162
01:18:47,007 --> 01:18:49,476
I won't put it that
you'll be helping them.

1163
01:18:50,266 --> 01:18:53,114
Or that there are three times this many

1164
01:18:53,114 --> 01:18:54,949
That we haven't been able to bring up here

1165
01:18:54,949 --> 01:18:56,665
From the cells below.

1166
01:18:57,551 --> 01:18:59,403
They mean nothing to ya.

1167
01:19:00,554 --> 01:19:02,623
All you can think of is that you

1168
01:19:02,623 --> 01:19:04,591
Might be helpin' me,

1169
01:19:04,591 --> 01:19:06,542
And that's the last thing you want to do.

1170
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:10,647
I'm sure I'd feel that way,
if I was in your place.

1171
01:19:12,232 --> 01:19:14,851
I can't promise you your freedom.

1172
01:19:16,023 --> 01:19:18,388
I can't even honestly say that

1173
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:21,758
It'll change my attitude towards ya.

1174
01:19:22,542 --> 01:19:24,561
'Cause you were a gorilla.

1175
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:30,067
All I can do is ask ya
to decide for yourself.

1176
01:19:32,586 --> 01:19:35,471
(Dramatic music)

1177
01:19:51,572 --> 01:19:52,639
(Mumbles)

1178
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:53,957
How sick is this man?

1179
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,543
He may, or may not, regain consciousness

1180
01:19:56,543 --> 01:19:57,894
Before he dies.

1181
01:20:01,848 --> 01:20:04,051
If he comes to, he can
prove I never saw Brechene

1182
01:20:04,051 --> 01:20:05,919
Before the night he came to me.

1183
01:20:05,919 --> 01:20:06,920
I don't know his name,

1184
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,873
But he was with Brechene
the first time I saw him.

1185
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:12,174
(Mumbling indistinctly)

1186
01:20:15,129 --> 01:20:17,414
Well, it's up to you
whether you go or not.

1187
01:20:18,498 --> 01:20:19,963
(Mumbling indistinctly)

1188
01:20:19,963 --> 01:20:20,884
Speak up.

1189
01:20:21,168 --> 01:20:22,903
If he doesn't go,

1190
01:20:22,903 --> 01:20:25,438
Will you give him permission
to remain here in the tent?

1191
01:20:25,438 --> 01:20:26,973
On the chance that this man may recover

1192
01:20:26,973 --> 01:20:28,825
Long enough to clear him?

1193
01:20:34,348 --> 01:20:36,332
To prove he wasn't a gorilla?

1194
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:40,773
Yes.

1195
01:20:57,838 --> 01:20:58,839
Well, there's enough money here

1196
01:20:58,839 --> 01:21:00,223
To pay for the water.

1197
01:21:01,474 --> 01:21:03,793
There's a letter of authority,
in case you need it.

1198
01:21:07,146 --> 01:21:08,832
You might need this, too.

1199
01:21:11,518 --> 01:21:13,687
I've still got a few guards
that are on their feet,

1200
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:15,342
They can go along with ya.

1201
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:17,732
I told you I go alone, or I don't go.

1202
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:19,992
Well, I'm countin' on you headin'

1203
01:21:19,992 --> 01:21:22,062
Straight across the desert.

1204
01:21:22,062 --> 01:21:25,041
And not turnin' toward town,
as soon as you're outta here.

1205
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,249
That's up to you.

1206
01:21:28,768 --> 01:21:30,920
All right. You go alone.

1207
01:21:40,047 --> 01:21:42,565
Remember, Hanley,
straight into the desert.

1208
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:45,835
Go ahead.

1209
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:11,728
Prisoner escaping!

1210
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:15,131
(Guns firing)

1211
01:22:21,506 --> 01:22:22,522
All right, all right.

1212
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:23,506
Cease fire!

1213
01:22:25,959 --> 01:22:28,178
So, Hanley decided to escape.

1214
01:22:28,895 --> 01:22:30,664
But if he thinks he'll get to Copper City,

1215
01:22:30,664 --> 01:22:31,981
He'll never make it.

1216
01:22:32,432 --> 01:22:34,284
They'll get him at the barricade.

1217
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:39,555
What I came to report,

1218
01:22:40,173 --> 01:22:43,294
The man Hanley counted on
to clear him just died,

1219
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,562
Without regaining consciousness.

1220
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:56,051
(Orchestral music)

1221
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,881
[Gilman] Put down your rifle.

1222
01:23:09,602 --> 01:23:10,904
Now, come over here.

1223
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:12,389
It's one of the prisoners.

1224
01:23:15,509 --> 01:23:16,859
[Gilman] Hold it.

1225
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:18,344
If you'd shot me,

1226
01:23:18,344 --> 01:23:21,030
Everybody around here might've
been dead in 24 hours.

1227
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:23,533
What do you mean?

1228
01:23:24,651 --> 01:23:26,869
I want all of you to hear what I mean.

1229
01:23:27,687 --> 01:23:29,739
Now, let's walk toward that barricade.

1230
01:23:30,723 --> 01:23:35,723
(Dramatic music)

1231
01:23:44,205 --> 01:23:45,505
Wait a minute.

1232
01:23:49,035 --> 01:23:50,660
You start shootin', he will.

1233
01:23:51,745 --> 01:23:53,546
Now, he could've killed us, and didn't.

1234
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:54,881
He has something to say to us.

1235
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:56,899
Give him a couple of seconds.

1236
01:24:02,289 --> 01:24:03,140
(Gun fires)

1237
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,878
I don't blame you.

1238
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:10,965
You're like me.

1239
01:24:10,965 --> 01:24:12,982
You don't trust what you don't know.

1240
01:24:13,567 --> 01:24:14,835
You're right in being scared of me,

1241
01:24:14,835 --> 01:24:16,286
I've been with the fever.

1242
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:19,572
I told these men that if you killed me,

1243
01:24:19,572 --> 01:24:20,974
You'd all be dead,

1244
01:24:20,974 --> 01:24:22,258
And that's true.

1245
01:24:23,109 --> 01:24:24,644
The very fact that you're here with guns

1246
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:26,146
Means you're afraid the fever will be

1247
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:27,853
Carried to your families.

1248
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:28,932
How?

1249
01:24:29,483 --> 01:24:30,817
You don't know.

1250
01:24:30,817 --> 01:24:32,485
Your barricade and your rifles

1251
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:35,021
Won't stop the fever from reaching you.

1252
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:36,356
Somehow, it's going to creep under

1253
01:24:36,356 --> 01:24:38,892
Or over those walls out there.

1254
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:40,693
There's only one way
you can stop the fever

1255
01:24:40,693 --> 01:24:42,461
From reaching you.

1256
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:45,347
Kill it where it is. At the prison.

1257
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,418
Don't give it a chance to come find you.

1258
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:53,022
All we need, for a start, is fresh water.

1259
01:24:53,774 --> 01:24:55,976
I could've gotten it in Mexico,

1260
01:24:55,976 --> 01:24:58,061
But it's six days there and back.

1261
01:24:59,046 --> 01:25:01,815
I came here because it's
a matter of one day,

1262
01:25:01,815 --> 01:25:03,600
For you, as well as for us.

1263
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:06,969
One wagon-load of water.

1264
01:25:07,554 --> 01:25:10,222
And you'll stop it where
it should be stopped,

1265
01:25:10,222 --> 01:25:11,707
Where it began.

1266
01:25:12,993 --> 01:25:15,445
And if it's stopped, it can't touch you.

1267
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:21,751
It's your decision.

1268
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:28,308
[Guard] Lieutenant!

1269
01:25:28,308 --> 01:25:29,626
Lieutenant Voorhees!

1270
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:33,696
Lieutenant! Lieutenant Voorhees!

1271
01:25:34,581 --> 01:25:37,101
Lieutenant! Look what's comin' in!

1272
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:43,417
(Hopeful orchestral music)

1273
01:25:55,152 --> 01:25:56,019
Whoa!

1274
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,276
Well, ya came back, Mr. Hanley.

1275
01:26:03,276 --> 01:26:04,477
What about that man?

1276
01:26:04,477 --> 01:26:06,413
Did he come to? Did he say anything?

1277
01:26:06,413 --> 01:26:08,181
[Voorhees] You somehow
managed the water.

1278
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:10,517
I'm sorry. Banta died before he...

1279
01:26:10,517 --> 01:26:13,636
Before he could sign his
name to what he told me.

1280
01:26:14,654 --> 01:26:16,238
He cleared you completely.

1281
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:18,675
He told me you never were a gorilla.

1282
01:26:19,025 --> 01:26:20,360
And I believed him.

1283
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,578
You understand?

1284
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:22,930
Yes.

1285
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:25,932
I not only understand, I
feel kinda good, Lieutenant.

1286
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:27,717
I'll get your case reopened.

1287
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:31,037
I'll stand witness for ya, myself.

1288
01:26:31,037 --> 01:26:33,589
But you'll be home before
anybody knows about it.

1289
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:37,260
Guard! Come on, let's
get that water unloaded.

1290
01:26:45,485 --> 01:26:50,485
(Lovely orchestral music)

1291
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:06,301
(Orchestral music swells)
