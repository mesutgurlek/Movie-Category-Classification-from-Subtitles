1
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:39,438
Deep among the lonely
sun-baked hills of Texas...

2
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:43,777
the great and weather-beaten
stone still stands.

3
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:48,099
The Comanches called it
Squaw's Head Rock.

4
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,419
Time cannot change
its impassive face...

5
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,279
nor dim the legend
of the wild young lovers...

6
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:59,161
who found heaven and hell
in the shadows of the rock.

7
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,460
For when the sun is low...

8
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,360
and the cold wind blows
across the desert...

9
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:05,988
there are those
of Indian blood...

10
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,669
who still speak
of Pearl Chavez...

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,558
the half-breed girl
from down along the border...

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,441
and of the laughing outlaw...

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,821
with whom she here kept
a final rendezvous...

14
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,723
never to be seen again.

15
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,603
And this is
what the legend says...

16
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,483
A flower known nowhere else...

17
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,903
grows from out
of the desperate crags...

18
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,802
where Pearl vanished...

19
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,723
Pearl, who was herself
a wild flower...

20
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:35,063
sprung from the hard clay,
quick to blossom...

21
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:36,924
and early to die.

22
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,475
Pearl.

23
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,598
Where's your ma?

24
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,526
She's in there, dancing.

25
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,947
Like mother, like daughter.

26
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:14,513
I'm commencing to think
I like the daughter better.

27
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,201
Let go!

28
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,168
You go away from me,
or I'll call my pa.

29
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,488
That renegade creole squaw-man?

30
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,159
That's a rich one.

31
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:03,756
I'll just raise you
fifty, Mr. Chavez.

32
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:06,072
Would you mind?

33
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:07,474
Mind what?

34
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:10,415
That weed.
I find it rather repulsive.

35
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,295
Pretty fancy gentleman,
ain't you, Mr. Chavez?

36
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:16,508
He's not so fancy
about his wife, if you ask me.

37
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:17,999
Look at her.

38
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:51,191
Quitting? Broke again?

39
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,897
Yes, gentlemen...

40
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:54,824
but there are
greater tragedies...

41
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:57,079
that I'm sure
you wouldn't understand.

42
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,275
Pa!

43
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,553
Pa, will you take me
in the Presidio?

44
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,886
I ain't never
been in there and...

45
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,329
And you never should be.

46
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,272
What are you doing out here
at this hour anyway?

47
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:48,651
I was just dancing.

48
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,091
I've told your mother
repeatedly...

49
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,532
this street is no place
for a girl your age.

50
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:54,307
I didn't mean no harm.

51
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:01,132
It's my fault, child, not yours.

52
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:03,534
The sins of the fathers.

53
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,316
Go home now, dear.

54
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:10,736
I'll be back in a little while.

55
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,866
Don't! Stop!

56
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,337
No, Chavez! Don't!

57
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,081
Don't! Don't! I beg you! Don't!

58
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:44,695
Pa!

59
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,519
I plead no mitigating
circumstances.

60
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,440
They deserved to die,
as I deserve to die.

61
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,321
For I long since
killed a person...

62
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,699
much superior
to either of them... myself.

63
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,602
I killed that person the day
I gave my family's name...

64
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,482
to the woman
who became my wife.

65
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,861
And since I believe...

66
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,802
the punishment
should fit the crime...

67
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,723
I suggest that you hang me
by the neck until I am dead.

68
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,464
It's from Laura Belle.

69
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:20,155
Did I ever tell you about her?

70
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,916
She's my second cousin.

71
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,846
Yes, Laura Belle
is my second cousin...

72
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:28,971
but she was
more than that to me.

73
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:33,845
You see, once upon a time,
in a different age...

74
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:38,478
in a different age
and such a different world...

75
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:40,450
I was in love.

76
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,573
And wonderful to believe,
the lady was in love with me.

77
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,178
You mustn't look at me
as though that were impossible.

78
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,043
I was quite the looker
in my day and very dashing.

79
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:53,926
Perhaps a bit too dashing.

80
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,266
And that's why
this very wonderful girl...

81
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:03,128
who might have been your mother,
decided on security...

82
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,887
and gave herself in wedlock
to a wealthy yankee.

83
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,307
Better make it fast, Chavez.

84
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,705
You've only got
five minutes left.

85
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:10,522
No! No!

86
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,271
They can't.

87
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,957
They can't. I won't let them.

88
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,848
Better that it end.

89
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,684
Really it is.

90
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,275
Your mother and I
can't hurt you any longer.

91
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,003
Laura Belle wants
my little girl to go to her.

92
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,889
Yes, just a few more weeks...

93
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,809
and at last,
you'll have a home...

94
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,688
the mother you should have had.

95
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,591
No, you mustn't leave me.
You mustn't.

96
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,929
You've been a good child.

97
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,850
Through some miracle,
you're good...

98
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,271
and you're decent,
and you're strong.

99
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:47,171
And now you must prove
that you are strong.

100
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:49,968
You will do that for me,
won't you, darling?

101
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:52,353
No tears, no grief...

102
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,794
now or later.

103
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,498
Here. Keep this scarf.

104
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:04,332
Wear it sometimes.

105
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:06,961
Get her out of here, Chavez.

106
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:10,145
Listen to me, darling.
We've very little time.

107
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,014
I want you to lean
on Laura Belle...

108
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:15,395
make her your inspiration
and your guide.

109
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:18,295
And then one day,
you'll be the great lady...

110
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:21,175
I've always wanted you to be.

111
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:23,555
Promise me that.

112
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:24,955
I promise.

113
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,437
Cross your heart?

114
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:29,275
Cross my heart.

115
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:31,215
She'll love you.
I know she will.

116
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:35,096
And you must give her
all the love you've had for me.

117
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:44,698
Smile for me.

118
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:48,079
Now, now. Head high.

119
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:51,588
Strong.

120
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:56,179
Very strong.

121
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,140
All threats of hell
and hopes of paradise...

122
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,520
one thing at least
is certain...

123
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,421
this life flies.

124
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:17,300
One thing is certain,
and the rest is lies.

125
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:22,643
The flower that once
has bloomed forever dies.

126
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,462
Ready, Chavez?

127
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,382
Quite ready, sheriff.

128
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,183
Whoa!

129
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,785
I beg your pardon.

130
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,166
You can't be...
What's your name?

131
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,107
None of your business.

132
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,447
Sorry.

133
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:05,708
I really am sorry.
I wonder if I could...

134
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:08,588
I don't talk to no strangers.

135
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:12,969
That's a good rule generally,
I grant you, but...

136
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,829
in this case, it...

137
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,127
Come on.

138
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:20,067
Won't you answer
just one question?

139
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:21,487
What is it?

140
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:23,094
Did you see
a little southern tot...

141
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,528
on the Guadalupe coach?

142
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,510
No.

143
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,870
Are you sure?
She was traveling alone.

144
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,623
You said "one question."

145
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,049
I know, but it doesn't
seem unreasonable if you...

146
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,950
Now you go away
and leave me alone.

147
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,869
I know all about men like you.

148
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,332
Well...

149
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,128
Good morning.

150
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,513
Why couldn't they have been
a little more explicit...

151
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,433
about just which coach
they were sending her on?

152
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,852
Don't worry, Jesse.

153
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,084
I'll drive her out to the ranch
whenever she shows up.

154
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,533
Thanks, Lem.
You can't miss her.

155
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:52,974
She's one of those...

156
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,413
well-brought-up
southern children.

157
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:55,979
Probably be hungry
and crying her eyes out.

158
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:58,955
I'll give her some milk
and blow her nose for her.

159
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,334
Thanks again.

160
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,895
And... so long!

161
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,459
So long.

162
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,393
Give my regards to the old man.

163
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,482
I will.

164
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,395
Say hello to Laura Belle for me.

165
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:13,775
Wait!

166
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,831
Wait! Do you know
somebody named Laura Belle?

167
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:23,416
I said, do you know
somebody named Laura Belle?

168
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,817
None of your business.

169
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,256
It is my business.

170
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:27,989
I don't talk to no strangers.

171
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,749
You can answer
one question, can't you?

172
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,259
That won't hurt you none.

173
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:34,197
All right, one question.
But remember, just one.

174
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:35,827
I know all about girls like you.

175
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,299
Don't you dare say that.

176
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,615
Pearl.

177
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:41,307
How'd you know my name?

178
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:42,987
If you hadn't been so uppity...

179
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,084
I'd have known who you were
a long time ago.

180
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,665
Now come on. Get in.

181
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:48,097
Who are you?

182
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,871
My mother couldn't come
to meet you...

183
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,298
so I came in her place.

184
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,072
I'm Laura Belle's son...
the older one, Jesse.

185
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,041
There.

186
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:15,202
I'm sorry about
not recognizing you.

187
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,581
I guess your clothes
sort of fooled me.

188
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,981
Don't misunderstand me.
I think they're beautiful.

189
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,382
You do?

190
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,323
Yes, and very unusual.
But you know...

191
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,703
I think I'd like to see you
in brighter colors.

192
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,602
Like green?
I have a green blouse.

193
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:31,190
- Green, blue, yellow maybe.
- Yellow?

194
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,083
I have a real pretty
yellow one right here.

195
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:36,587
- I'll put it on now.
- Not now.

196
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,902
Save it for tomorrow.

197
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,485
Here's where the ranch starts.

198
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:58,116
There's the marker...
the Spanish Bit...

199
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,218
a million acres
of McCanles empire.

200
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,627
Empire? Isn't this still Texas?

201
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:06,319
Yes, but the Senator doesn't
always acknowledge that. Look.

202
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,626
He puts his seal
of ownership on everything.

203
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,778
It's on his sons, too,
I suppose.

204
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,688
In fact, I'm sure
my brother Lewt and I...

205
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,608
are the Senator's
favorite property.

206
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,529
Is your brother as nice
as you are?

207
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,866
Girls in town think he's nicer.

208
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,756
- Hiya, Jesse.
- Howdy, Jake.

209
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,190
Fine foals.

210
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,357
Is that your house?

211
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,125
That is the residence

212
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,676
of Jackson Tilt McCanles
and family.

213
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,989
And on to the fortress...
and happiness.

214
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:05,987
Jesse! Pearl!

215
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,755
Here you are.

216
00:16:21,736 --> 00:16:24,696
Prettiest girl ever to set foot
on Spanish Bit.

217
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,437
Pearl, dear.

218
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:30,540
I'm so glad you've
come to us, darling.

219
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:33,249
Here, let me look at you.

220
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,720
Yes, you're Scott's daughter.

221
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:37,158
And now you're ours.

222
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:38,808
You're just like he said.

223
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,405
I'm afraid I'm somewhat
different than he remembered.

224
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:42,839
But come, dear.

225
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:44,737
Did you take good care
of her, Jesse?

226
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:46,658
I showed her all
the points of interest.

227
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:49,579
- He did. He's nice.
- I think so, too.

228
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,417
You southern belles
are all alike.

229
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:55,320
Where in holleration
you been all day?

230
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,052
I just went down
to Paradise Flats.

231
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,855
- Senator, this is Pearl.
- Who?

232
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,198
Pearl Chavez, our cousin.

233
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:03,516
You remember. We invited her
to come and stay with us.

234
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,629
Don't be scared.
You're not a trespasser.

235
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,876
She's no cousin of mine.

236
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,656
She's Scott Chavez's
daughter, ain't she?

237
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,581
Yes, of course she is.

238
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,168
Why don't you say so?

239
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:19,480
Girl, what are you doing
in that getup?

240
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,301
Is that the latest fashion...

241
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:25,140
with them aristocratic
cousins of yours?

242
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:29,735
Or is it what they're
wearing this season in wigwams?

243
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,508
Come on, boy.
We got to talk business.

244
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,923
See you later, Pearl.

245
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:39,031
Come, dear.
I'll take you to your room.

246
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:40,404
He don't want me here.

247
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:43,345
You mustn't mind the Senator.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

248
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,225
It's his way ever since...

249
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:47,145
ever since his accident.

250
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:48,565
Accident?

251
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:50,005
It's a long story...

252
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,946
and, I'm afraid,
not a very pleasant one.

253
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,866
I wish we had
a better room for you...

254
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:56,620
but later on,
we'll speak to the Senator.

255
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:58,714
Lewton, dear.

256
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:05,016
This is Pearl.
My youngest son... Lewton.

257
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,203
Pleased to meet you, Lewton.

258
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:13,111
Pleased to meet you...

259
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,404
Pearl.

260
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,249
Come, Pearl.

261
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,814
You and Lewton will have
plenty of time later on...

262
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,959
to get to know one another.

263
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,161
I'm sure we will.

264
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,670
Yay... boy.

265
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:43,439
Sounds of the rude world

266
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:46,937
Heard in the day

267
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:49,000
Lulled by the moonlight

268
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:53,288
Have all passed away

269
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:58,389
Beautiful dreamer

270
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:01,818
Queen of my song

271
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:05,383
List' while I woo thee...

272
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:08,276
Where will I put
your medicine, Mrs. McCanles?

273
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,655
Leave it on the table.

274
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,997
Mrs. McCanles,
can I get married?

275
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,334
But, Vashti, whom do
you want to marry?

276
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:19,277
Nobody in particular, ma'am.

277
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:22,198
I just thought I'd kind of
like to get married.

278
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:23,577
Of course, Vashti.

279
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:25,434
You may marry
whenever you wish.

280
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,356
Thank you, ma'am.

281
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:30,216
Do you know anybody...

282
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:32,199
who would be nice
for me to marry?

283
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:36,808
No, I don't,
but I'll think about it.

284
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,885
Thank you, ma'am.

285
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:41,382
There's no particular hurry.

286
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,195
That Vashti.

287
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:46,452
I'm afraid I'll never be able
to train her properly.

288
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,026
And as to marriage...

289
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,505
Sit down.

290
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,148
I'm glad your father
sent you to me.

291
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,665
All you have to do
is behave like a lady.

292
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,559
Not that
Scott Chavez's daughter...

293
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,479
could ever be anything
but a lady.

294
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm a good girl, ma'am.

295
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:06,989
Of course you are, dear,
but you see...

296
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:10,135
you'll be the only young girl
at Spanish Bit.

297
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,668
No one could blame you...

298
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,351
if your head
were turned a little.

299
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,866
You take Lewton, for instance.

300
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:18,262
He's such an attractive boy.

301
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:20,161
I think Jesse's much nicer.

302
00:20:20,122 --> 00:20:22,332
But you scarcely know Lewton.

303
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:24,408
Of course, he's
a bit undisciplined...

304
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:27,824
but perhaps that's what gives
westerners their charm.

305
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:30,183
The Senator was like that.

306
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:32,542
That's why, when your father...

307
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:37,925
Jesse always chides me
for talking about the past.

308
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:39,431
I hope Jesse likes me.

309
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,198
We're going to lose him someday.

310
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:44,624
I've known that ever since
he came back from law school.

311
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:46,151
I've been so selfish.

312
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,920
He'd have gone long ago
if it weren't for me.

313
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:52,767
My firstborn... he's so good.

314
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:56,648
He's made such
a difference in my life.

315
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:59,654
- Ma'am?
- Yes, Pearl?

316
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,860
I'll be a good girl.

317
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,267
I promise I will.

318
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,666
I want to be like you.

319
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:09,567
That's what my father wanted.

320
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:12,448
I'm afraid neither
your father nor I...

321
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,328
found happiness, child.

322
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,791
I hope you will.

323
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:21,009
Come, child.

324
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:23,429
This is no way to begin.

325
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,745
Do you know this waltz?

326
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:33,904
Will you stop
that infernal instrument!

327
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,563
King me, Senator.

328
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,242
I always figured when I moved
into my own quarters...

329
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,632
I'd be rid of that noise.

330
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:42,611
I guess that's it, Senator.

331
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:45,032
I think I'll take me
a little stroll.

332
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,390
Now we got that papoose
to put up with.

333
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:50,291
I don't know.

334
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:52,588
She looks like
a pretty cute tamale to me.

335
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:55,993
You think so?
Wouldn't appeal to me none.

336
00:21:55,894 --> 00:22:00,146
Of course, I always
liked my women more...

337
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:03,308
Say, Senator.

338
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,673
Yeah, Lewt?

339
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:06,613
You know that last trip
I took up to Abilene?

340
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:07,700
Yeah.

341
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:10,989
I was driving the herd all day
and kind of tired...

342
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,854
and felt like getting
some relaxation.

343
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,775
Yeah. Didn't happen
to drop into a place...

344
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,611
called the Last Chance, did you?

345
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:18,534
How did you find that out?

346
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,957
Sent them a check
for 1,600 just yesterday.

347
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,856
That's how I found out.

348
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:26,277
I guess I had
a few drinks too many.

349
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,136
That's all right.

350
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,056
A fella's got to sow
some wild oats sometime.

351
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,937
What's the money for?

352
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,856
Senator...

353
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:37,194
I hope someday I'll be like you.

354
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:43,099
The only thing
I don't like about you...

355
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:45,439
is the miserable way
you play poker.

356
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:49,840
Trying to fill inside straights
is a sucker's game.

357
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:52,701
Go on, boy. Go on. Run along.

358
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,808
What a boy.

359
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:10,200
How'd they come
to name you Pearl?

360
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,144
I don't know, sir.

361
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:15,270
Couldn't have had
much eye for color, could they?

362
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:23,967
They might better have called
you Pocahontas or Minnehaha.

363
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:25,286
Ain't that right?

364
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:28,056
I guess so.

365
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,985
All right, Minne, on your way.

366
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:33,407
Good night, sir.

367
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:36,098
Minne... ha ha.

368
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:38,151
Ha ha.

369
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:40,106
Hello, Pearl. What's the matter?

370
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:43,527
Are you unhappy?
Don't you like Spanish Bit?

371
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:46,825
If everybody was like you.

372
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,747
If everybody was like me,
the world would be...

373
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,667
a terribly frustrated
sort of place.

374
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:52,046
What do you mean?

375
00:23:52,027 --> 00:23:55,029
Nothing for you to worry
your pretty little head about.

376
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,908
I want to learn.
Will you learn me?

377
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:58,828
Your ma says you're a lawyer.

378
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,749
I want to be a lady
and know everything, like her.

379
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:04,629
I wonder if learning
ever made mother any happier.

380
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:07,010
- I wish I could do that.
- What?

381
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,367
Make rings like that.
Can I try? Let me try.

382
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:11,725
No, Pearl. Now whoa.

383
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:13,628
Ladies aren't supposed to smoke.

384
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:18,469
Now you won't want
to learn me things, will you?

385
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,849
You don't like me
no more, do you?

386
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,250
Of course I do.

387
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,571
I'm afraid a lot of men
will want to learn you things.

388
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,730
I think you better go to bed...

389
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:37,631
like a good little girl.

390
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:42,965
We'll discuss your education
another time.

391
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:44,832
All right.

392
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,752
Good night, Pearl.

393
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:48,673
Good night, Jesse.

394
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,507
Good night.

395
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,159
What do you want?

396
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,360
I hate you!

397
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:57,281
Don't you pretend
nobody ever did that before.

398
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:00,536
They didn't. Nobody did.
Nobody's going to.

399
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,015
You little...

400
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:11,505
You leave that alone!

401
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,969
I reckon he must be
the white half.

402
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:22,258
I forgot to say
good night, ma'am.

403
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:34,752
Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child

404
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:39,900
That ain't no ham, Miss Pearl.
That's a pig.

405
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,351
Same thing.

406
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:43,785
But Mrs. McCanles,
she's very particular...

407
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:48,645
and she don't want no big pig
listed like no little ham.

408
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,986
Here. Maybe you better
make the list, Vashti.

409
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,885
No, ma'am. I can't write.

410
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:56,767
Mrs. McCanles says to me once,
"Vashti, can you write?"

411
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:58,646
And I says, "Mrs. McCanles..."

412
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,566
Vashti.

413
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:03,655
Mrs. McCanles says to me once,
"Vashti, can you write?"

414
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,360
And I says, "Mrs. McCanles..."

415
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:06,787
Vashti!

416
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,227
Mrs. McCanles says...

417
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,668
Vashti!

418
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:12,275
That's Mr. Lewt.
I think he wants to see me.

419
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,625
Vashti, where are you?

420
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,443
I'm scared of that Mr. Lewt.

421
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,788
He says to me once,
"Vashti, you're empty-headed."

422
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:20,688
Vashti!

423
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,649
Tell Miss Pearl
to come out here.

424
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,902
Miss Pearl...

425
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,683
I heard him. Tell him I'm busy.

426
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,070
Why don't you tell him...

427
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,759
and I'll just run along
up to the house?

428
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,106
All right, I'll tell him.

429
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:34,949
What do you want?

430
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,558
Thought you might like
to see some tricks.

431
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:38,951
Watch this.

432
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:44,738
That's a good boy.

433
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,794
Hey, Lewt.

434
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:00,104
What do you want?

435
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:02,345
I thought you were supposed to
be on the round-up today.

436
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:04,171
And suppose you tend
to your mortgages...

437
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:06,761
and stop sticking your nose
in my business.

438
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:09,114
Just as one civilized man
to another, l...

439
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,556
if that isn't insulting you...

440
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:12,495
I have a little
suggestion to make.

441
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:14,415
All right. Let's have it.

442
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:17,586
Why don't you
leave this one alone?

443
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:20,581
She may do very nicely
if given half a chance.

444
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,695
What's the matter, judge?

445
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:26,492
You got her earmarked
for yourself?

446
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:36,678
Hey, Pearl.

447
00:28:37,897 --> 00:28:40,358
Come on, Dice. Push.

448
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,341
Whoa.

449
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:44,466
Give me a good push.

450
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,019
Whoa, boy.
I want you to meet a lady.

451
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,497
Now bow for the lady, Dice.

452
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,498
He's right smart.

453
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:04,678
What do you think
of my new girl, Dice?

454
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:09,623
Oh? Maybe not.

455
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:11,921
Did you teach him all that?

456
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,602
All that and lots more.

457
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:17,376
He'll turn on a dime
and give you change.

458
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:20,345
- Do you want to try him?
- Me ride him?

459
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:21,681
You're just having fun with me.

460
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,122
Or can't you ride bareback?

461
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,896
- Of course I can.
- Let me see you.

462
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:28,157
I could show you,
but I got work to do.

463
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:31,731
Of course, if you don't dare,
I don't give a doggone.

464
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:37,711
Yeah?

465
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,291
Get off him.

466
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:41,266
Sure enough. He won't throw you.

467
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:43,187
He's smooth as cream.

468
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:51,347
Come on!

469
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,186
Now git!

470
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:15,171
Open the gate!

471
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:03,697
You all right?

472
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:12,335
That was a fool thing to say.

473
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:15,695
You never rode bareback
before in your life.

474
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,293
I never said I had.

475
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,072
Is she hurt, Lewt?

476
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:23,662
No. Get out of here.

477
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:25,096
Can we do anything?

478
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,203
Go on and mosey, will you?

479
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,660
Sure.

480
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,439
You got gumption,
but you ain't got no sense.

481
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,151
If you'd only let me
start him right...

482
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:42,078
instead of scaring him that way.

483
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,998
It wasn't him that was scared.

484
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,918
He won't throw me next time.

485
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:47,671
You better stick
to buggy-riding.

486
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,765
Maybe him and me
ain't your style.

487
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,138
Ain't no maybe about you.

488
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,040
I wish you'd let me
ride him some more.

489
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,751
Sure.

490
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,680
How'd you like me
to give him to you?

491
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:00,309
You mean for keeps?
You're not just teasing?

492
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,200
No. I guess you'd
rather have Jesse...

493
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,787
pick you out a riding horse...

494
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,554
even if he don't know
the difference...

495
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,481
between a pinto
and a strawberry roan.

496
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:08,900
I like this one.

497
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,840
And you like me,
don't you, honey?

498
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:12,761
You won't throw me no more.

499
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,016
All right. He's yours.

500
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,777
Let's you and me ride down
to the sump after supper, huh?

501
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,142
Where's that?

502
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:30,083
A shady place
over by Hidden Canyon.

503
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:34,131
The water's good and deep now,
almost over your head.

504
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,632
You mean go swimming... together?

505
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:39,859
I'll bring along my guitar,
play us some music.

506
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:41,225
You got a nerve.

507
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,498
The moon will be
pretty near full.

508
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:46,405
You didn't buy me,
just giving me a horse.

509
00:32:46,326 --> 00:32:50,204
I'll be waiting for you
after supper out by the bell.

510
00:32:50,086 --> 00:32:52,087
I won't go.

511
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,118
I won't!

512
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:04,089
Listen to this for poppycock.

513
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:06,969
"And the benefits
to be derived...

514
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:10,849
"by the small ranchers
from the new railroad...

515
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:14,773
"are too numerous
to need recounting here."

516
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:16,192
"Small ranchers."

517
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,796
Ignorant, nasty,
spoiling the open range...

518
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:20,355
with their measly fences.

519
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,291
And say, Jesse.
I should have told you before.

520
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,171
Them surveyors had the gall...

521
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,590
to come traipsing
over Spanish Bit...

522
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:30,366
with them infernal
spyglasses of theirs.

523
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,876
I almost fired
that new foreman Ken...

524
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,645
for letting them on the place.

525
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,978
Shouldn't have
done that, Senator.

526
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,224
Why not?

527
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:41,005
Because it wasn't Ken
who let them on the place.

528
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:42,931
Nobody else would
have had the nerve.

529
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:45,436
I was the one that told them
they could do it.

530
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:48,125
- Have you gone plumb crazy?
- I don't think so.

531
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:50,054
I thought it might be
a good idea to cooperate...

532
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,473
and have the tracks where
they'd do the most good.

533
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,790
Good? What do you mean good?

534
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,235
It's getting rather cool,
don't you think?

535
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:58,213
For one thing...

536
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:00,633
the railroad will bring
new people, a school.

537
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:02,743
Paradise Flats will become
a real town instead of...

538
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:04,946
And that same railway
will ship...

539
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:08,355
a lot of emigrants
from up north down here...

540
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,925
and they'll start in voting
and putting in taxes.

541
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,067
It's your ranch.

542
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,684
I was just trying to be helpful.

543
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:23,222
Spanish Bit's going to
belong to you someday...

544
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,805
you and Lewt.

545
00:34:24,777 --> 00:34:26,527
So I don't see why you don't...

546
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,457
Senator, I know
you mean well for me.

547
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:30,377
You've always been
generous to us.

548
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,798
Maybe Lewt and I would be closer
to what you wanted us to be...

549
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,239
if you hadn't been so generous.

550
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,678
What's wrong with Lewt?

551
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,244
Nothing at all
that you'd object to.

552
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,304
That's not the point.
I'm the one who's the maverick.

553
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:43,594
I don't know
what you're talking about.

554
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,543
I'd like one McCanles to give
something to this state...

555
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,085
and not just take from it.

556
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,871
Good night, sir.

557
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,955
Your son, ma'am?

558
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,135
Yes, Senator.

559
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:10,662
Who's there?

560
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:13,081
Is that you, Jesse?

561
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:17,275
Hello, Pearl. Nice night.
Want to take a little walk?

562
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:20,750
It's kind of late.
I think I'd better go...

563
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,663
Where were you going when l...

564
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:27,669
Got to get me
somebody to love

565
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:29,547
I...

566
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,130
I guess that's Lewt.

567
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,731
Certainly is Lewt.
He's the best serenader...

568
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:34,331
this side of the Rio Grande.

569
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:37,599
I don't care if he is.
Him and his old guitar.

570
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:40,425
Just because he gave me a horse.

571
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,765
I know why, too.
He can't fool me none.

572
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,043
That's a horse
on Lewt, isn't it?

573
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:48,530
I didn't really
want to meet him.

574
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:50,426
Honest, I didn't.

575
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:53,348
It was just that
I was kind of lonesome and...

576
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,726
I know.

577
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:58,418
Do you still want me
to take that walk with you?

578
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:01,461
I don't know why not.

579
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:04,430
Lewt can supply the charming
musical background.

580
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:12,666
Got to get me
somebody to love

581
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:14,470
I'll be...

582
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:37,929
Thanks, Lewt.

583
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,538
You're a better wrangler
than all of them.

584
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:42,432
Sid, see that chestnut
over there?

585
00:36:42,392 --> 00:36:44,352
She looks lame.
Take her out to pasture.

586
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:45,564
Sure.

587
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,054
It's hotter than a stove lid.

588
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:49,993
Sure wish we was over
at the sump right now.

589
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:52,207
And somebody else figures
the same way, I reckon.

590
00:36:52,154 --> 00:36:53,988
Looks like she's heading
for a cool-off.

591
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:00,165
- I'll see you later.
- Where are you going, boss?

592
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:03,825
- I got business.
- That lucky stiff.

593
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:06,949
I wish I was a McCanles.

594
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:28,868
Good afternoon.

595
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,294
How's that water?
As cool as it looks?

596
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:33,697
You go away from here.

597
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,970
- Care for a swimming lesson?
- No.

598
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:38,254
What if I just stay around,
keep you company?

599
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:39,325
Don't you dare.

600
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:41,612
I'm sorry, honey.
I can't hear a word you say.

601
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,854
Move over.

602
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,340
You can't come in here.

603
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:46,278
Just act like I'm not even here.

604
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,393
Act like we never even met.

605
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:06,473
You disappointed?

606
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,315
If you ain't the lowest,
dirtiest, meanest...

607
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:15,201
Come on out.
I ain't stopping you.

608
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,747
I can't, with you there.

609
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:20,226
Wait till it's plumb dark,
for all I care.

610
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,531
Let go! Let me down!

611
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:29,945
Making me late for supper
just to be mean!

612
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:31,344
What will your ma think?

613
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:33,118
If you hadn't been so doggone
scared I'd see something...

614
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,962
you'd have been home
a long time ago.

615
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:38,220
Little tiger cat.

616
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:45,128
Evening, Pearl.
Have a good swim?

617
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:47,704
Let me through!

618
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:53,881
Am I too late for supper?

619
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:56,098
I mean, is everybody finished?

620
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,007
Mrs. McCanles say anything?

621
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:01,429
Yes, ma'am.
She said, "Where's Miss Pearl?"

622
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:03,287
And I said, "I don't know,
Mrs. McCanles."

623
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:05,208
And she said,
"Where's Mr. Lewton?"

624
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:07,629
And I said,
"I don't know, ma'am."

625
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:09,028
And she said, "Well..."

626
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,218
Pearl, dearest.

627
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:12,879
I was so worried about you.

628
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,308
Sorry, ma'am.

629
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,249
What happened?

630
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,669
I went riding.

631
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,610
With Lewton?

632
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,988
Vashti, get Miss Pearl
some supper.

633
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,265
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:24,876
The Senator's
got rules about supper.

635
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,810
He says to me,
"Don't you ever..."

636
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:28,523
- Vashti.
- Yes, ma'am.

637
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,160
Did you go riding with Lewton?

638
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:32,468
No, ma'am...

639
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:34,411
I didn't go riding with Lewton.

640
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,831
He wasn't here
for supper either.

641
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:38,232
He's coming.

642
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,172
But he wasn't with you?

643
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:43,092
We just happened to meet up.

644
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,180
I see.
But why is your hair wet?

645
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,713
I was down to the sump.

646
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:53,614
You went in swimming?

647
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:55,533
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,995
With Lewton?

649
00:39:58,374 --> 00:39:59,875
No, ma'am.

650
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:03,228
I didn't, ma'am.
Honest, I didn't.

651
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:05,134
I didn't, ma'am.

652
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:07,554
All right, Pearl. L...

653
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,783
Evening, ma.

654
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:11,359
Good evening, Lewton.

655
00:40:11,336 --> 00:40:15,131
Sorry to be late.
We were down to the sump.

656
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:22,017
I think I'll take a ride
over to El Paso tomorrow...

657
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,357
and get me a little fun
and relaxation.

658
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,256
Anything I can bring you, ma?

659
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,843
No, thank you.

660
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:30,068
Pearl, I think
I'll try to get you one...

661
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,977
of them newfangled
bathing suits.

662
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:36,566
She swims real well, ma.
Where'd you learn?

663
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:37,878
Oh, my dear!

664
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:41,579
You... you varmint!

665
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,083
What you getting
your bristles up about?

666
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:49,907
Giddy!

667
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:58,859
Miss Pearl, wake up.

668
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:00,780
What is it?

669
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:02,701
What's the matter?

670
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:04,121
Well...

671
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:05,561
What time is it?

672
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,501
It must have been about 9:00...

673
00:41:07,462 --> 00:41:09,923
when Mrs. McCanles
says to me, "Vashti...

674
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:13,322
"when Mr. Jubal Crabby
gets here..."

675
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:16,891
What is it? Who's Mr. Crabby?

676
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:19,034
Why did you wake me up?

677
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:20,443
I almost forgot.

678
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:24,385
Mrs. McCanles wants to see you
up in the sitting room.

679
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:26,808
Maybe you better hurry.
She's been a-waiting.

680
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:28,538
I didn't know where you was...

681
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:30,839
so I said,
"I'll go see Mr. Lewton."

682
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:32,244
And he said...

683
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,310
Why are you so slow?

684
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:35,891
I don't rightly know...

685
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:39,117
exceptin' I always have
so much to remember.

686
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,839
This is the child, Jubal.

687
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,914
Of course, she isn't dressed
quite properly, but...

688
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:47,286
Close the door, Pearl.

689
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,226
This is Mr. Crabby.

690
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,146
We have no minister
in these parts, but...

691
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:54,568
A man doesn't have to wear
the cloth to be a sinkiller.

692
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:56,928
I know that.
That's why I was so anxious...

693
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,827
to have you talk to the child.

694
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:00,288
Come here, girl.

695
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,548
You call her a child?

696
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:07,929
Under that heathen blanket...

697
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,869
there's
a full-blossomed woman...

698
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,332
built by the devil
to drive men crazy!

699
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:15,129
You mustn't frighten her.

700
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,778
I'm sure she only needs
a little guidance.

701
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,462
Guidance she needs,
and guidance she'll get...

702
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,350
or I ain't been the sinkiller...

703
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,770
from here to El Paso
for thirty years.

704
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,712
Sit down, girl.

705
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:31,491
You could be a woman of sin
or a woman of God.

706
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,391
Which is it to be?

707
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:35,311
I want to be a good girl.

708
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:37,149
Then remember that the devil's
always able to hog-tie you.

709
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:39,072
Sometimes he comes
ghosting over the plains...

710
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:40,992
in the shape
of a sneaking rustler...

711
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:43,413
and sometimes... begging
your pardon, Laura Belle...

712
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,812
he stakes out the home...

713
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,753
to the worthy
and the God-fearing.

714
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:49,674
You're curved
in the flesh of temptation.

715
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:52,054
Resisting is gonna be
a darn sight harder for you...

716
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,953
than for females protected
by the shape of sows.

717
00:42:53,914 --> 00:42:56,375
Yes, sirree, bob, you've got to
sweeten yourself with prayer.

718
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:57,773
Pray till you sweat...

719
00:42:57,754 --> 00:42:59,713
and you'll save yourself
eternal hellfire.

720
00:42:59,674 --> 00:43:02,385
- Do you understand me, girl?
- Yes, sir.

721
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:04,024
Then on your knees.

722
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:06,955
Now I'm gonna start you
toward salvation.

723
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,334
O Lord, look upon this,
thy creature.

724
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:11,736
She's a weak vessel
and a pauper, as thou knowest.

725
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,843
But she wants to be
thy handmaiden.

726
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:16,048
Give her the horse sense
not to go wandering off...

727
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:18,333
in the tulies
with worthless cowpokes.

728
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:19,611
Amen.

729
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:24,674
Rise, girl.

730
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:26,973
Here. I want you to take this.

731
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,836
It's a hallowed medal,
and a good one.

732
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:31,884
I took it off
a thieving card sharper...

733
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:33,297
but first I shrived him...

734
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,196
and sent him
to the pearly gates...

735
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,120
as nice and pretty as any from
his own faith could have done.

736
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:40,000
You wear it, girl.

737
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,919
Thank you, sir.

738
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:43,839
Part Indian, ain't you?

739
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:46,260
Those ancestors of yours
will be spinning like tops...

740
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,159
when they know you got this on.

741
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,079
Just the same, it'll keep you...

742
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,501
sweet and clean
as the first milking.

743
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,899
Won't get you into heaven...

744
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,340
but it will comfort you
on the way there.

745
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,241
That is, if you use it right.

746
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:02,082
Laura Belle, don't you think...

747
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,002
we ought to be saying
a few words of prayer...

748
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:05,922
for them worthless cowpokes?

749
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:09,844
I got a feeling
they'll be needing...

750
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,057
consolation.

751
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:15,522
On your knees again, girl.

752
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:19,883
O Lord, have mercy on all men,
young and old alike...

753
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:23,764
who gaze upon this,
thy regained servant.

754
00:44:23,645 --> 00:44:25,104
Amen.

755
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:36,085
Senator! Where's the Senator?

756
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:37,629
What's up?

757
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:39,941
- Senator McCanles!
- What's the stampede?

758
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,013
There's a great big railway gang
down close to the east fence.

759
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:43,425
How close?

760
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:45,366
They say they're coming across
Spanish Bit line this afternoon.

761
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:47,620
- What will we do?
- Get ahold of Lewt and Jesse.

762
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:49,527
Lewt's not back from El Paso.

763
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,947
Holleration.
I guess Jesse and me...

764
00:44:52,847 --> 00:44:54,807
can handle it all right.

765
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:57,228
- Sid.
- Yes, Senator?

766
00:44:57,168 --> 00:44:59,127
Listen carefully now.

767
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:02,548
Sound every bell
from here to Blue Hills ranch.

768
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:05,909
I want every wrangler,
every cowhand...

769
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:08,769
every man and boy
on Spanish Bit...

770
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,693
down there at the east fence,
and I want them there fast.

771
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:14,154
- Yes, sir.
- And Sid.

772
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,923
- Yes, sir?
- I want them there armed.

773
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,392
You betcha.

774
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:13,493
I don't like this, Mr. Langford.

775
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,418
It's your railroad,
and it's your headache...

776
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,671
but I still don't like it.

777
00:46:17,617 --> 00:46:19,202
What do you mean,
you don't like it?

778
00:46:19,178 --> 00:46:21,137
You told me we were legally
in the clear, didn't you?

779
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:23,557
Yeah, and I know you asked
the army for help, too.

780
00:46:23,497 --> 00:46:26,500
And I hope they don't come.
And I hope we don't need them.

781
00:46:26,378 --> 00:46:27,795
What do you mean?

782
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:30,738
I mean Jackson McCanles
don't scare so easy.

783
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:34,744
We roamed the plains together.
We fought at Vicksburg together.

784
00:46:34,618 --> 00:46:36,953
And if he gives up
in this fight...

785
00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:39,275
he ain't the man
I've known for fifty years.

786
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,263
I wish you wouldn't
try to ride, father.

787
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,179
You think I'm going
to sit in this house...

788
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,933
like some old woman?
Lift me on that horse.

789
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,528
If they want war,
they can have it.

790
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:52,462
- Ken.
- Yes, sir?

791
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,130
Strap me on here.

792
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:58,580
Come on.

793
00:47:46,747 --> 00:47:50,375
I aim to defend
Spanish Bit with lead.

794
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:55,062
If there's any yellow-bellies
among you, get out now.

795
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:59,230
Are you with me?

796
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:03,759
All right, then.
Spread out in a line...

797
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:06,669
from the west marker
to Pinto Point.

798
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,090
Come on!

799
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,820
Kind of thought he wouldn't
take this lying down.

800
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,220
Looks like they mean business.

801
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,257
Smoot!

802
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:55,605
Lem Smoot, I thought you had
more sense than this.

803
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:58,732
Yeah? Since when did you
ever know me to dodge a fight?

804
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:00,226
You know I'm lawyer
for the railroad...

805
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:03,078
Never mind that stuff.
Who's the dude?

806
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:05,755
Langford is the high
mucky-muck on the railway.

807
00:50:05,683 --> 00:50:08,227
Heard a lot about you, Senator.
Glad to make your acquaintance.

808
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:11,165
Can't say the same,
thank you kindly.

809
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:13,253
You better tell those
hired thieves of yours...

810
00:50:13,203 --> 00:50:14,996
to pick up their tools...

811
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,841
and fast, if you know
what's good for you.

812
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:19,222
We have the law on our side.

813
00:50:19,203 --> 00:50:21,205
If you had come into court
when I asked you to...

814
00:50:21,124 --> 00:50:22,750
this land might not have been...

815
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:25,726
Never mind
that fancy legal talk.

816
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,524
There's my law right there.

817
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:35,307
Have you a copy
of the writ with you, Smoot?

818
00:50:35,205 --> 00:50:36,707
What's the sense of...

819
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:38,480
All right. Are you our lawyer,
or aren't you?

820
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:41,283
- Now read it to him.
- Save your breath.

821
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,458
"From the people of
the sovereign state of Texas...

822
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:46,328
"to Jackson Tilt McCanles,
greetings."

823
00:50:46,247 --> 00:50:48,373
"Greetings." Ain't that nice?

824
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:49,786
Jackson.

825
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,103
You and I fought to build
this state of Texas...

826
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,468
and I aim to see these men
perform their duties...

827
00:50:54,408 --> 00:50:56,368
peacefully and as authorized.

828
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:58,330
Is that so?

829
00:50:58,248 --> 00:51:01,918
I'm gonna shoot any trespasser
that comes on my property.

830
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:05,229
If you don't like that,
you can lump it...

831
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,630
you and the state of Texas.

832
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:09,404
Just a minute.
May I speak to you privately?

833
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:13,250
Say what you got to say
right here and now.

834
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,631
I'm sorry, father...

835
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,572
but I'm afraid
you're in the wrong.

836
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,616
I ain't aiming
to let you settle that.

837
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,280
You mean to shoot down
unarmed men?

838
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:23,795
Just like they was rattlesnakes
if they cross this line.

839
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:25,609
In that case, Senator...

840
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:35,293
Get me a pair of wire cutters.

841
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:36,339
Ferguson.

842
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:38,710
So that's where you stand.

843
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:40,112
Think I'd rather be
on the side...

844
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:41,970
of the victims
than of the murderers.

845
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,214
Jesse, I'm warning you.

846
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:50,634
We're going to fire
on those coolies...

847
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,701
the moment you cut those wires.

848
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,574
Their blood will be
on your hands.

849
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:08,283
Jesse, I'm asking you
for the last time.

850
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:18,458
Column left. Ho!

851
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:24,252
Thank God.

852
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:37,180
Column left. Ho!

853
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:57,379
Right front into lines. Ho!

854
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,507
I once fought for that flag.

855
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:41,428
I'll not fire on it.

856
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:51,528
Sid, tell those men
to get back to their work.

857
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,888
Yes, sir.

858
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:54,328
Father, l...

859
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:56,268
Get out of my sight...

860
00:53:56,229 --> 00:54:00,315
and stay away from Spanish Bit
as long as I live.

861
00:54:02,845 --> 00:54:05,181
Whoa, General!
Hey! Whoa, boy!

862
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:13,010
Get me out of here!
Hey, get me out of here!

863
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:15,515
Get me out of this!

864
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,885
Unbuckle him!

865
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:28,312
Are you all right, father?

866
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:31,212
Leave me be, you Judas.

867
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:33,094
Here.

868
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,196
Fours left, column left.

869
00:54:43,137 --> 00:54:45,598
Gallop. Ho!

870
00:55:40,192 --> 00:55:41,693
Hiya.

871
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:57,037
Afternoon, Mr. Lewton.

872
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:58,958
Where the devil is everybody?
The place is deserted.

873
00:55:58,919 --> 00:56:00,378
I don't rightly know...

874
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:02,318
exceptin' that
the Senator went riding.

875
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:03,696
The senator went riding?

876
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:05,474
You must be
going out of your mind.

877
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:08,527
No, sir. He went riding
with lots and lots of other men.

878
00:56:08,442 --> 00:56:11,445
And I heard they're having
a kind of a meeting.

879
00:56:11,323 --> 00:56:12,824
What kind of a meeting?

880
00:56:12,763 --> 00:56:16,224
I don't rightly know,
but I said to Mrs. McCanles...

881
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:18,125
"Mrs. McCanles, where are
all those men going?"

882
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,669
And she said...

883
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:21,480
Never mind.

884
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:22,906
She did say...

885
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:25,347
"Vashti, go right on
about your business.

886
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:27,457
"Right on about your business."

887
00:58:07,556 --> 00:58:10,349
I guess this means
good-bye for a while.

888
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:11,737
Now, don't you cry.

889
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:13,343
I'll be back before long...

890
00:58:13,317 --> 00:58:16,111
and he'll get over it
when the railroad comes through.

891
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:18,498
I always knew you'd
have to leave someday...

892
00:58:18,439 --> 00:58:21,400
but now that it's come,
I just can't bear it.

893
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,279
It's not as bad as all that.

894
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,201
I'll get a place in Austin.
You can come visit me.

895
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:28,081
If you're a good girl,
I might even take you...

896
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,002
on a little trip to New Orleans.

897
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:31,922
No. He'd never forgive me.

898
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,344
I'll never see you again. Never.

899
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,203
I know it.

900
00:58:37,164 --> 00:58:41,126
He said he'd shoot you
if you ever step foot on...

901
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:43,675
One McCanles can be
just as tough as another.

902
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:48,317
Mrs. McCanles, come in here!

903
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:50,376
You better go to him now.

904
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,990
But you won't go yet awhile?

905
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:57,890
No. I'll just pack my things
and say good-bye to Pearl.

906
00:59:25,778 --> 00:59:27,613
Are you there?

907
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:35,133
Jesse, go away, please.

908
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:37,189
What you scared of,
Pearl, honey?

909
00:59:37,142 --> 00:59:39,269
Come on in.

910
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:47,555
Thanks for knocking.

911
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:52,545
I didn't used to think...

912
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,383
there was much to all those
fancy manners of yours...

913
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:57,224
but I guess I was wrong.

914
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:04,908
Jesse, I...

915
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,358
Forgive me for intruding, Pearl.

916
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:12,019
You, too, Lewt.

917
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:18,414
Good-bye, Pearl.

918
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,456
Wait a minute, please!

919
01:00:25,395 --> 01:00:26,855
I didn't mean to...

920
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,796
It's all right.
I understand perfectly.

921
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:30,925
No, you don't.

922
01:00:32,277 --> 01:00:35,739
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Austin.

923
01:00:35,638 --> 01:00:38,474
You gonna be gone long?

924
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:41,634
Quite long, I'm afraid.

925
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:45,114
It isn't because of...

926
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:47,208
No. Bless your heart.

927
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:52,083
I'm leaving by request...
the Senator's request.

928
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:56,227
Going away, Jesse?

929
01:00:56,203 --> 01:00:59,831
Uh-huh. Your dream's come true.
I'm going away.

930
01:00:59,725 --> 01:01:02,102
It's gonna seem
kind of lonely around here...

931
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:04,673
without the judge,
ain't it, Pearl?

932
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:05,984
Yes, it is.

933
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:07,427
Don't see how we'll know...

934
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:10,452
when we're doing right
and when we're doing wrong.

935
01:01:10,368 --> 01:01:12,662
You surprise me.
First time I knew...

936
01:01:12,609 --> 01:01:14,944
you were interested in ethics.

937
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:20,351
I'm sure you folks
will excuse me.

938
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:23,753
You must have a lot of things
you want to talk over.

939
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:27,780
The nights are long, oh, so long

940
01:01:27,654 --> 01:01:30,615
It is going to be
lonesome without you.

941
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:32,996
I just don't know
how I can stand it.

942
01:01:32,935 --> 01:01:35,187
You seem to be doing all right.

943
01:01:37,096 --> 01:01:40,016
I'm sorry. That was mean of me.

944
01:01:41,257 --> 01:01:42,717
I couldn't help it.

945
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,158
You just can't go away
believing...

946
01:01:45,098 --> 01:01:47,224
I tried hard. Honest, I did.

947
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,930
I know.

948
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:50,861
Lewt's hard to resist.

949
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:52,782
No! I hate him!

950
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:55,371
I know what you're thinking.

951
01:01:57,182 --> 01:02:02,145
I guess I'm just...
trash, like my ma.

952
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,610
You mustn't believe that.

953
01:02:03,584 --> 01:02:05,586
It was Lewt's fault.
You needed some help.

954
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:08,173
I did. I needed you to help me.

955
01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:14,067
I might as well say it.

956
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:16,489
I loved you.
Somehow you touched me.

957
01:02:16,387 --> 01:02:18,889
You... love me?

958
01:02:18,788 --> 01:02:21,792
I thought of what you'd be like
when you grew up a little.

959
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:25,216
I didn't know.

960
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,025
Why didn't you tell me?

961
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,785
I didn't think it would
be fair to tell you.

962
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,338
I was a fool.

963
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:35,159
I came to your room
to say good-bye...

964
01:02:35,113 --> 01:02:39,075
to tell you that someday
I'd be back for you...

965
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:41,624
that I'd think about you
and that I'd write...

966
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:51,437
I'll write to you.

967
01:02:51,397 --> 01:02:54,025
You will?

968
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:57,753
If you need me, I'll come back,
Senator or no Senator.

969
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:00,100
And you'll forget about...

970
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,043
about tonight, won't you?

971
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:06,321
You'll forget it?

972
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,910
No, I don't think I'll forget.

973
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:11,344
I don't think
I'll ever be able to.

974
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:15,951
I shouldn't have told you
the way I felt.

975
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:17,552
It wasn't fair.

976
01:03:20,525 --> 01:03:24,362
There I go again,
trying to be fair.

977
01:03:31,248 --> 01:03:32,751
Trash.

978
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:42,338
I hear you turned out to be...

979
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:45,544
a prize yellow dog
down at the fence line.

980
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:52,897
I should have done that
to you years ago.

981
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:09,220
Nights are long, oh, so long

982
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,229
On the prairie

983
01:04:13,101 --> 01:04:19,940
Got to get me somebody to love

984
01:04:26,865 --> 01:04:29,033
The dirty skunk!

985
01:05:07,156 --> 01:05:09,617
All right, Jesse.

986
01:05:09,557 --> 01:05:12,518
You said you'd never forget.

987
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:38,280
This the other one
you meant, Lewt?

988
01:05:44,848 --> 01:05:47,101
You don't like this,
but you're gonna get it...

989
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,260
right over the head
if you don't settle down.

990
01:05:49,209 --> 01:05:51,628
What's the matter?
You having trouble?

991
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,505
Back, you killer! Back!

992
01:05:57,612 --> 01:05:59,154
Here, Ed.

993
01:06:04,054 --> 01:06:06,431
Don't pick up that halter!
He'll charge you!

994
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:08,585
You're scared of him,
and he knows it.

995
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:10,619
Never run from him.
Stand your ground.

996
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:14,035
Come on, boy.

997
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:16,643
I got a nice leather
bonnet for you.

998
01:06:19,298 --> 01:06:21,383
Easy, boy.

999
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,540
Be careful.

1000
01:06:32,942 --> 01:06:35,651
- He's just plumb crazy!
- Don't you worry none about him.

1001
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:50,502
Look out! Watch his feet!

1002
01:06:58,469 --> 01:07:00,763
He's got his ear.
Ear him down!

1003
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:03,254
Dig 'em deep.

1004
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,066
That'll stop him.

1005
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:27,029
You got him.

1006
01:07:29,117 --> 01:07:31,119
Nobody could
have done it but you.

1007
01:07:31,038 --> 01:07:34,166
That's all there is to it.
Just don't let him bluff you.

1008
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,722
You see, there ain't nothing
to handling stallions.

1009
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:42,602
It just takes
a little know-how.

1010
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:44,190
You sure got nerve.

1011
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,230
Get away, Ed.

1012
01:07:48,283 --> 01:07:49,784
You're the boss.

1013
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:00,934
What?

1014
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:03,722
You don't have to stay
around here anymore, do you?

1015
01:08:03,648 --> 01:08:06,609
Don't never have to do nothing.

1016
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:08,989
I stay around here
because I like it.

1017
01:08:08,929 --> 01:08:11,556
Bet you I can hit
that ding-dong straight off.

1018
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:13,491
Who cares?

1019
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:17,131
What's up?

1020
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:20,052
Nothing. Just practicing.

1021
01:08:19,973 --> 01:08:21,933
Can you shoot?

1022
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:23,853
Sure. It's easy.

1023
01:08:23,815 --> 01:08:26,775
That's what you said
about bareback riding.

1024
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:28,654
All right, I'll show you.

1025
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:31,075
Better not try it.
You might hit Ken...

1026
01:08:31,016 --> 01:08:32,851
or the mare, more likely.

1027
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:39,198
Sure is doggone hot.

1028
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:41,308
Sure is.

1029
01:08:41,259 --> 01:08:43,469
You know what I'd like to do?

1030
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,879
What?

1031
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,320
I'd like to take a swim.

1032
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:49,220
You mean it?

1033
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:51,642
Sure, I mean it.

1034
01:08:51,582 --> 01:08:53,875
Let's go to the sump.

1035
01:08:53,823 --> 01:08:56,157
I don't mind if I do.

1036
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:09,867
Am I your girl?

1037
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:11,788
Of course you're my girl.

1038
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,208
Then we can be married,
can't we?

1039
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,192
I guess so.

1040
01:09:16,148 --> 01:09:18,026
No. If I'm not
good enough to marry...

1041
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:19,950
I'm not good enough to kiss.

1042
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,536
Come here, you bobtailed
little tree cat.

1043
01:09:21,511 --> 01:09:22,969
We're bespoken, ain't we?

1044
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:25,244
It wouldn't do no harm
to tell folks, would it?

1045
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,650
Sure, we'll tell them.

1046
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:28,592
Can we tell them soon?

1047
01:09:28,553 --> 01:09:30,471
Can we tell them
Saturday at the barbecue?

1048
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,268
Sure, we can. Why not?

1049
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:36,715
What you got here?

1050
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:38,134
Something the sinkiller gave me.

1051
01:09:38,115 --> 01:09:39,741
He said it would keep me...

1052
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:41,676
sweet and clean
as the first milking.

1053
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:45,349
Who cares about milking?

1054
01:09:45,318 --> 01:09:47,444
I don't want no milkmaid.

1055
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:02,222
Don't you get awful tired
eating just beef?

1056
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:08,424
Wish we could get
an eighty-hour week.

1057
01:10:08,363 --> 01:10:10,323
Yeah. Me, too.

1058
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:12,244
Kind of miss Jesse
around here. Don't you?

1059
01:10:12,206 --> 01:10:14,458
Jesse? Better not mention
his name on Spanish Bit.

1060
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:17,076
Can't get over Lem Smoot
joining those railroad people.

1061
01:10:17,007 --> 01:10:18,967
I always say, if you can't
whip them, join them.

1062
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:20,387
Never saw so many crows...

1063
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,828
around here before
in all my life.

1064
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:25,729
Wish they'd learn
to grow corn without husks.

1065
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,450
Wouldn't surprise me none
if that Indian girl...

1066
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:34,371
didn't up and massacre
the whole dern lot of them.

1067
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:35,751
When I'm married...

1068
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,693
I'm gonna have
lots and lots of parties.

1069
01:10:38,612 --> 01:10:43,074
But who would do all the work
when I gives my party?

1070
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:45,394
I likes fishing better
than I does dancing.

1071
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:47,295
You never go fishing.

1072
01:10:47,255 --> 01:10:49,925
I never goes dancing neither.

1073
01:10:49,856 --> 01:10:52,108
The gals to the center
and ring to the left.

1074
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:54,016
The boys shake hands
and go to the right.

1075
01:10:53,977 --> 01:10:56,938
Now weave a basket.
Circle left.

1076
01:10:56,858 --> 01:11:00,320
Now we'll weave that basket
the other way.

1077
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:02,179
Senator, they
appreciate it very much.

1078
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,101
I try to show my people
a good time, eh, Lewt?

1079
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,980
You bet your boots, Senator.

1080
01:11:06,942 --> 01:11:09,401
Now, birdie in the center
and seven hands around.

1081
01:11:09,342 --> 01:11:12,135
Bird hop out,
and the crow hop in.

1082
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:14,022
She around the she,
and the he around the he.

1083
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:16,110
The he around the she,
and the she around the he.

1084
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,690
Four hands up, and here we go.

1085
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:19,124
Hurry up, boys,
and don't be slow.

1086
01:11:19,104 --> 01:11:21,565
'Cause you'll never get
your love if you don't do so.

1087
01:11:30,868 --> 01:11:33,329
Pearl, dear, I've been
looking all over for you.

1088
01:11:33,268 --> 01:11:35,729
You should be downstairs.
It's very rude.

1089
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:37,129
I'm sorry.

1090
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:39,570
I was fixing my hair
the way you told me to.

1091
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:40,969
Do I look all right, ma'am?

1092
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:43,410
You're the prettiest girl
at the party.

1093
01:11:43,353 --> 01:11:45,313
Here, dear. Wear this.

1094
01:11:45,272 --> 01:11:50,276
You're so kind to me...
this dress and everything.

1095
01:11:55,356 --> 01:11:57,815
Come, dear.

1096
01:11:57,756 --> 01:12:00,758
Oh, ma'am! What's the matter?

1097
01:12:02,237 --> 01:12:05,073
It's nothing. Let's go.

1098
01:12:06,358 --> 01:12:10,862
Balance your partners,
and two ladies cross

1099
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,516
You cross to that cowboy so true

1100
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:17,988
I sure love being here,
Mr. McCanles.

1101
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,882
Fine. There he is.

1102
01:12:19,842 --> 01:12:21,761
Lewt, come here.

1103
01:12:21,683 --> 01:12:23,684
You call me, Senator?

1104
01:12:23,602 --> 01:12:26,230
Yeah. Wheel me in there.

1105
01:12:26,164 --> 01:12:29,667
Come on, boy. Come on.

1106
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:33,518
Something wrong, Senator?

1107
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:35,155
Close the door.

1108
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:38,588
So this is where
that squaw lives, huh?

1109
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,489
Scott Chavez.

1110
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:42,409
I've been meaning
to speak to you, Senator.

1111
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:44,331
I think we ought to
kind of fix it up...

1112
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,959
Too good for her, if you ask me.

1113
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:48,348
- She's all right, Senator.
- She's all right, huh?

1114
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:51,084
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1115
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:52,973
I've been watching you...

1116
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:55,894
making calf's eyes
at that half-breed.

1117
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:57,775
Have you lost your mind?

1118
01:12:57,694 --> 01:12:59,695
I don't understand you, pa.

1119
01:12:59,614 --> 01:13:02,617
You want me to have
a good time, don't you?

1120
01:13:02,495 --> 01:13:05,497
Sure. Is that all
you got in mind?

1121
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,876
Of course.

1122
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,317
I ain't been working
thirty years on this place...

1123
01:13:09,215 --> 01:13:11,717
to turn it into
no Indian reservation.

1124
01:13:11,616 --> 01:13:13,619
You know me better than that.

1125
01:13:13,537 --> 01:13:16,039
- Is that right, son?
- Yeah, sure.

1126
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:18,441
You had me worried
for a time, boy.

1127
01:13:18,339 --> 01:13:21,300
- Shove me out of here.
- All right.

1128
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:27,002
Yes, a little relaxation
is mighty pleasant...

1129
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:29,902
after a man's been chasing Satan
all the way from here to Austin.

1130
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:31,281
Yes, sirree, bob.

1131
01:13:31,263 --> 01:13:33,514
You've been to Austin?
Did you hear anything of Jesse?

1132
01:13:33,463 --> 01:13:35,130
I heard plenty.

1133
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:37,064
Enough to warm the cockles
of your gentle heart.

1134
01:13:37,024 --> 01:13:38,484
You know what they're saying?

1135
01:13:38,465 --> 01:13:40,258
He'll be governor
of the whole dern state...

1136
01:13:40,226 --> 01:13:41,852
before he's ready
to meet his maker.

1137
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:43,201
I knew it.
Do you think it's true?

1138
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:46,731
Judging from the fancy office
he's got already, it's true.

1139
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:48,588
Has a rolltop desk
and a gold spittoon...

1140
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:50,508
you couldn't miss
if you aimed from here.

1141
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,428
I hope he isn't
working too hard.

1142
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:54,807
I shouldn't fret
too much about that...

1143
01:13:54,749 --> 01:13:56,083
not while old man
Langford's daughter...

1144
01:13:56,069 --> 01:13:57,529
is as sweet and pretty...

1145
01:13:57,509 --> 01:13:59,135
as the sunrise on the mesa,
I wouldn't.

1146
01:13:59,111 --> 01:14:01,570
Yes. He wrote me about her.
He says she's a lovely girl.

1147
01:14:01,512 --> 01:14:02,972
If wedlock's his aim...

1148
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:04,621
he couldn't shoot
at a neater target.

1149
01:14:04,593 --> 01:14:05,844
What are you looking
so sad about, Pearl?

1150
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,042
This is a party. Come on.

1151
01:14:07,033 --> 01:14:09,244
Let's show these cowpokes
a thing or two about dancing.

1152
01:14:09,193 --> 01:14:11,153
Girl, where's that medal
I gave you?

1153
01:14:11,115 --> 01:14:12,241
I...

1154
01:14:12,234 --> 01:14:14,028
She loaned it to me.
I'm trying to get...

1155
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:15,455
one just like it
made for myself.

1156
01:14:15,435 --> 01:14:17,812
Good. Good!

1157
01:14:17,757 --> 01:14:20,216
Put your left foot,
put your left foot

1158
01:14:20,157 --> 01:14:22,950
Put your left foot just so

1159
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:25,672
Put your left foot,
put your left foot

1160
01:14:25,598 --> 01:14:28,352
Put your left foot just so

1161
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:31,782
Take a step to the side,
take a step to...

1162
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,140
Come on, honey.

1163
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,081
Don't let them yokels
laugh at you.

1164
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,834
But I don't know how.

1165
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:38,804
It's easy. Just follow me.

1166
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:56,249
Now you're doing it.

1167
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:22,595
Won't they be surprised
when they hear about us?

1168
01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:24,202
When they hear what about us?

1169
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:25,927
That we're bespoken, of course.

1170
01:15:25,895 --> 01:15:27,355
Oh, that.

1171
01:15:27,335 --> 01:15:29,796
But that's what you said.
You said we'd tell them tonight.

1172
01:15:29,736 --> 01:15:31,697
Just as everything
is going good...

1173
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:33,617
you got to go
and start all that again.

1174
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:37,540
Either you tell people
we're bespoken, or I will.

1175
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,101
I want to tell you
something...

1176
01:15:46,062 --> 01:15:47,521
you don't fool me none no more.

1177
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,461
Will you stop
poking up and vexing me?

1178
01:15:49,423 --> 01:15:51,883
I don't know how a man
stands it, the way you go on.

1179
01:15:51,823 --> 01:15:53,783
You think you don't
have to marry me.

1180
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:55,705
Maybe you don't.
And you don't have to go on...

1181
01:15:55,665 --> 01:15:57,625
lying to me no more neither.
I made up my mind.

1182
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:59,545
You made up your mind
about what?

1183
01:15:59,506 --> 01:16:00,965
Just like I said...

1184
01:16:00,946 --> 01:16:02,907
if you won't marry me,
I'll get out.

1185
01:16:02,867 --> 01:16:04,327
I'll go away as fast as I can.

1186
01:16:04,307 --> 01:16:06,267
You can go and keep
going for all I care.

1187
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,188
Go find yourself
somebody else to pester.

1188
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,108
But don't you care?

1189
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:11,944
No woman can tie
onto me like that...

1190
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:16,371
least of all a bobtail
little half-breed like you.

1191
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:20,192
All righty.
Thanks for letting me know...

1192
01:16:20,073 --> 01:16:22,575
how you think about me.

1193
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:27,790
El Paso and Amarillo
ain't no different...

1194
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:29,214
than Sodom and Gomorra...

1195
01:16:29,194 --> 01:16:30,654
on a smaller scale,
of course, but...

1196
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:33,345
What in Beezelbub's name
do you call that?

1197
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:48,562
I wasn't having a very good time
at the party neither.

1198
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,052
I was just kind of tired.
Who are you?

1199
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:56,131
I'm the new
straw boss around here.

1200
01:16:56,082 --> 01:16:58,918
Name's Pierce.
Sam to my friends.

1201
01:16:58,842 --> 01:17:00,718
Mind if I sit down?

1202
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:01,766
If you want.

1203
01:17:03,604 --> 01:17:06,565
Must be plenty tiring
on a person, all that dancing.

1204
01:17:06,486 --> 01:17:08,613
- Don't you dance?
- No, ma'am.

1205
01:17:08,566 --> 01:17:10,984
Somehow, I never got
the chance to learn.

1206
01:17:10,885 --> 01:17:12,888
You ought to. It's fun.

1207
01:17:12,807 --> 01:17:15,809
Lots of folks seem to think so.

1208
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:17,689
How would you like
to learn tonight?

1209
01:17:17,608 --> 01:17:19,610
What? Do you mean
you'd teach me?

1210
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:22,032
I ain't so good at them
fancy dances myself...

1211
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:24,264
but we could learn
together, if you want.

1212
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:27,130
- I'd be right honored.
- Then come on.

1213
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:30,004
Come on!

1214
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:43,636
The next dance
will be ladies choice.

1215
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:45,537
The ladies choose the gents.

1216
01:17:45,455 --> 01:17:47,957
Gents line up
over on this side...

1217
01:17:47,857 --> 01:17:49,860
ladies over yonder.

1218
01:17:49,779 --> 01:17:52,906
Now, ladies,
this is your big chance.

1219
01:17:52,819 --> 01:17:56,947
And don't be afraid to go after
the true love of your choice.

1220
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,321
I'd rather play me some poker.

1221
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,887
Females shouldn't be
allowed no choice.

1222
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,361
It ain't decent.

1223
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,636
I'll bet you six bits
that fat one grabs me.

1224
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:06,168
You leave Jake alone.
You had him all evening.

1225
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:08,020
Of all the nerve!

1226
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:14,438
When I stomp my heels
three times...

1227
01:18:14,345 --> 01:18:16,347
run for the gent of your choice.

1228
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:19,809
Ready? One, two... scat!

1229
01:18:55,516 --> 01:18:58,519
I want you to get acquainted
with little Lewt...

1230
01:18:58,438 --> 01:19:02,357
the longest-legged critter
this side of the main house.

1231
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,198
He's so cute!

1232
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,245
A lot cuter than big Lewt.

1233
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,920
He's just like silk.

1234
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:22,365
There you are, ma.

1235
01:19:25,405 --> 01:19:27,866
Want to see the others?

1236
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:31,059
Yes. And I'm gonna help you
take care of them, too.

1237
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,509
Sure, you are.

1238
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:35,480
Ain't they wonderful,
these babies?

1239
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:36,907
Any kind of babies.

1240
01:19:36,888 --> 01:19:38,347
They sure are.

1241
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:41,165
I remember reading something
once when I was a kid.

1242
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:43,617
What?

1243
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,903
You'd think I was silly...

1244
01:19:44,891 --> 01:19:47,185
a big galoot like me
spouting poetry.

1245
01:19:47,131 --> 01:19:48,758
No, Sam. Please.

1246
01:19:48,732 --> 01:19:52,361
I'm going to sit right here
until you tell me.

1247
01:19:52,253 --> 01:19:55,256
It goes something like this.

1248
01:19:56,574 --> 01:20:01,370
For everything created in
the bounds of earth and sky...

1249
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:04,175
has such longing to be mated.

1250
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:07,558
It must couple or must die.

1251
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:10,419
That's the best poem
I ever heard.

1252
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,799
I'm glad you like it.

1253
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:14,699
You married?

1254
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:18,955
Nope. Never run across
anybody I wanted to marry.

1255
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,947
Besides, I never got up
nerve enough to ask anybody.

1256
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:24,823
I guess you must be
getting pretty old.

1257
01:20:24,742 --> 01:20:28,704
Yep. Old enough to be
your father... and then some.

1258
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,543
Why?

1259
01:20:30,504 --> 01:20:31,922
Nothing.

1260
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:34,525
I guess, just the same...

1261
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:37,967
there are plenty of women
who would marry you anyway.

1262
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:39,825
I better be getting home.

1263
01:20:39,746 --> 01:20:43,041
Mrs. McCanles is kind of ailing.

1264
01:20:48,908 --> 01:20:51,703
You wouldn't marry me,
would you?

1265
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:55,092
- What did you say?
- I said, would you marry me?

1266
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:56,951
Don't get mad, please.

1267
01:20:56,912 --> 01:20:59,040
First time in my life
I got up some nerve.

1268
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:00,743
How could a big galoot...

1269
01:21:00,713 --> 01:21:02,673
Don't say that.
You don't know about me.

1270
01:21:02,632 --> 01:21:04,092
If you did, you wouldn't ask.

1271
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:05,532
You mean about Lewt?

1272
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:07,973
So you know about
me and Lewt, too?

1273
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:09,875
Yeah, I guess
ain't nobody don't know.

1274
01:21:09,835 --> 01:21:11,795
I've knocked around plenty...

1275
01:21:11,755 --> 01:21:14,716
- I'm trash, I tell you.
- Don't go telling me that.

1276
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:17,097
I'd kill the first man
who said anything like that.

1277
01:21:17,037 --> 01:21:20,499
But I don't love you.
Don't that matter?

1278
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:22,358
You've only known me
a little while.

1279
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:24,279
I know I'm not something
girls dream about...

1280
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,699
like the McCanleses.

1281
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,140
- I'm not rich like them either.
- It ain't that.

1282
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,041
But I'd love you,
and I'd take care of you.

1283
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,960
I got a little money saved.

1284
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:33,881
Get a little ranch
of our own, maybe.

1285
01:21:33,842 --> 01:21:37,304
Won't you even think
about it, honey? Please, honey.

1286
01:21:37,203 --> 01:21:39,163
Don't you call me "honey."

1287
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:41,751
Lewt called me that.
You're all alike!

1288
01:21:48,246 --> 01:21:49,706
Coming?

1289
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:56,067
I hope I didn't say nothing
to hurt your feelings.

1290
01:21:55,928 --> 01:21:58,347
That's all right.

1291
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,591
I'll marry you
if you still want me to.

1292
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:05,032
You mean it?

1293
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:32,531
I declare. I never saw...

1294
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:34,792
so many cows before
in all my life.

1295
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:37,200
I'm afraid they're not
all cows, Helen.

1296
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,101
Sometimes, my dear, I think...

1297
01:22:39,061 --> 01:22:41,021
that I didn't
bring you up properly.

1298
01:22:40,982 --> 01:22:44,150
All right. I understand.
All I need is a hint.

1299
01:22:59,627 --> 01:23:02,046
Those steers
are from Spanish Bit.

1300
01:23:01,988 --> 01:23:04,490
I thought your father's ranch
was hundreds of miles from here.

1301
01:23:04,427 --> 01:23:06,263
See? There's the brand.
They're on their way to market.

1302
01:23:11,631 --> 01:23:13,633
If it ain't
the big railroad man.

1303
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:15,553
How's everything at the Bit?

1304
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:18,474
Getting along just fine
since you left... Mr. McCanles.

1305
01:23:18,352 --> 01:23:19,853
Same old Sid.

1306
01:23:19,792 --> 01:23:22,294
I'll be inside, darling.
Come, father.

1307
01:23:22,193 --> 01:23:23,696
Hey, that Langford's daughter?

1308
01:23:23,635 --> 01:23:25,136
Heard you were
kind of sweet on her.

1309
01:23:25,075 --> 01:23:26,408
Yes, that's Miss Langford.

1310
01:23:26,354 --> 01:23:27,689
Pretty, ain't she?

1311
01:23:27,634 --> 01:23:29,135
We could use a few like her
around the ranch...

1312
01:23:29,074 --> 01:23:30,576
especially now that
Pearl's going... maybe.

1313
01:23:30,516 --> 01:23:32,018
What do you mean?

1314
01:23:31,957 --> 01:23:33,791
Darnest thing you ever heard.
She's getting married.

1315
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:35,720
Can you imagine
anybody marrying Pearl?

1316
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:37,140
Is she marrying Lewt?

1317
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:39,080
Lewt? What would Lewt...

1318
01:23:38,998 --> 01:23:41,000
Nah, she's marrying Sam Pierce.

1319
01:23:40,919 --> 01:23:42,921
Pearl ought to be
very happy with Sam.

1320
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,841
She ain't marrying him yet.

1321
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,762
She ain't marrying nobody...

1322
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,682
until Lewt decides
to give the bride away.

1323
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,563
So long, Judas.

1324
01:23:52,963 --> 01:23:55,340
Can't say I like...

1325
01:23:55,284 --> 01:23:59,244
your Spanish Bit people
very much, if he's any criteria.

1326
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,918
Darling, I've been thinking.

1327
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:03,346
Why couldn't there be a spur
track right on Spanish Bit?

1328
01:24:03,286 --> 01:24:05,246
Then they could
just ship the cattle...

1329
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,833
instead of driving them
all that distance.

1330
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:09,726
You're not even
listening to me, dear.

1331
01:24:09,688 --> 01:24:12,147
Certainly I am.
You were saying...

1332
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:15,924
You were asking if...
What were you saying?

1333
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:17,227
I was trying to prove...

1334
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,836
what a helpful wife
I'm going to be.

1335
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:20,311
Give me a kiss.

1336
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:23,651
I couldn't help overhearing.

1337
01:24:23,612 --> 01:24:24,571
What?

1338
01:24:24,572 --> 01:24:26,531
You liked that girl, didn't you?

1339
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:27,952
You still like her?

1340
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:29,893
I'm sure I'll always
be devoted to her.

1341
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:31,813
Hope you'll like her, too.

1342
01:24:31,773 --> 01:24:33,858
But you were in love
with her, weren't you?

1343
01:24:33,814 --> 01:24:36,192
Yes, I was in love with her.

1344
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,518
I said I was.

1345
01:24:44,257 --> 01:24:46,218
Jesse. Father.

1346
01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:50,515
Sometimes I think he didn't
bring you up properly.

1347
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,328
What were you worried about
when I came out just now?

1348
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:59,140
Worried? I was just wondering
what my brother Lewt might do.

1349
01:25:21,627 --> 01:25:24,588
Zeke, where's
my peppermint and soda?

1350
01:25:24,509 --> 01:25:25,969
Coming up now.

1351
01:25:25,951 --> 01:25:27,910
Hear you named the day.

1352
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,330
That's right.

1353
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:31,771
Ring just come in the last post.

1354
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:32,671
Mighty pretty. Yep.

1355
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,631
You sure are shot full of luck.

1356
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,552
I'd like to stand
the drinks for everybody.

1357
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,473
I'm getting married
in the morning.

1358
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:39,892
That's fine.

1359
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:41,875
Save your money, Pierce.

1360
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:51,768
So you figure
you got yourself a wife.

1361
01:25:51,717 --> 01:25:53,802
I don't figure. I know I have.

1362
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:55,718
Think you can keep her?

1363
01:25:55,678 --> 01:25:57,888
Reckon as how I can.

1364
01:25:57,839 --> 01:26:00,048
Cattle rustlers
and women rustlers.

1365
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,792
Both of them steal...

1366
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,678
what's got another man's
brand on it.

1367
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,727
I don't think I like
the way you're talking.

1368
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:09,644
Maybe I didn't rightly
understand you.

1369
01:26:09,603 --> 01:26:12,813
Yeah, you understand me
all right.

1370
01:26:12,723 --> 01:26:17,436
Pearl Chavez is my girl,
and she'll always be my girl...

1371
01:26:17,284 --> 01:26:20,036
just as long
as I want her to be.

1372
01:26:26,407 --> 01:26:30,243
From now you, you're gonna
respect Pearl's name.

1373
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:33,715
If that ain't
the best joke yet.

1374
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:37,988
He's defending the lady's name...
my girl's name.

1375
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,330
Has anybody else around here...

1376
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:54,796
got any fancy ideas
about Pearl Chavez?

1377
01:26:59,137 --> 01:27:01,472
Don't seem to be no takers.

1378
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:17,530
I don't rightly know
much about Sam Pierce, O Lord...

1379
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:19,174
but from what I hear...

1380
01:27:19,143 --> 01:27:22,188
he'll be needing
no introduction to you.

1381
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:24,480
Seeing as how Sam was snatched
from his loved ones' arms...

1382
01:27:24,423 --> 01:27:27,009
before they even had time
to get a good grip on him...

1383
01:27:26,943 --> 01:27:29,321
I'm counting on you to give him
a better break up yonder.

1384
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,125
Hey, you hatchet face!

1385
01:27:32,106 --> 01:27:34,066
Are you so almighty hungry
to hang one man...

1386
01:27:34,026 --> 01:27:36,946
that you can't wait till we
get through planting this one?

1387
01:27:38,347 --> 01:27:41,392
Now I be consigning him
to your keeping.

1388
01:27:41,309 --> 01:27:43,437
And I'm guessing
you'll find him...

1389
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:45,349
the gentlest,
sweetest straw boss...

1390
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:48,437
ever to enter the pearly gates.

1391
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:49,852
Amen.

1392
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:54,714
Start shoveling, cowpokes.

1393
01:28:06,116 --> 01:28:09,578
It's our fault.
We raised him wild.

1394
01:28:09,477 --> 01:28:12,480
If he'd only gone
to school, like Jesse.

1395
01:28:12,358 --> 01:28:15,987
I thought I asked you never
to mention Jesse's name again.

1396
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:17,214
It's true.

1397
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,661
You spoiled Lewt, and I let you.

1398
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,561
Ever since he was a child...

1399
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,483
he thought rules
weren't made for him.

1400
01:28:24,361 --> 01:28:26,988
He thought you made
the rules, all of them...

1401
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:29,258
not just those
for Spanish Bit.

1402
01:28:29,163 --> 01:28:30,664
It's that Indian girl.

1403
01:28:30,603 --> 01:28:32,604
If you hadn't
brought her here...

1404
01:28:32,523 --> 01:28:34,525
none of this
would have happened.

1405
01:28:34,444 --> 01:28:37,446
Perhaps if your attitude
toward her had been different...

1406
01:28:37,324 --> 01:28:40,244
It's my fault, huh?
It's my fault.

1407
01:28:40,165 --> 01:28:43,627
You dared to bring
that Indian baggage...

1408
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:47,989
right here into this house,
and now you try to tell me...

1409
01:28:47,848 --> 01:28:50,309
You get her out of here.

1410
01:28:50,249 --> 01:28:54,211
And what's more,
get her out of here tonight!

1411
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:58,052
You've screamed at me
for the last time.

1412
01:28:57,930 --> 01:29:01,892
You made one of your sons
hate you and sent him away.

1413
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:04,775
You made the other one
a... murderer.

1414
01:29:06,093 --> 01:29:10,680
Pearl will stay here
just as long as I do.

1415
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,501
Here's the money.
You better clear out of here...

1416
01:29:34,422 --> 01:29:36,382
until this thing blows over.

1417
01:29:36,342 --> 01:29:37,761
Thanks, pa.

1418
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:39,744
It's gonna take
plenty of fixing.

1419
01:29:39,702 --> 01:29:42,163
So you better
stay away from here...

1420
01:29:42,104 --> 01:29:45,064
until I send you the word.

1421
01:29:44,985 --> 01:29:47,946
It'll take a year maybe.

1422
01:29:47,865 --> 01:29:49,825
Maybe more than that even.

1423
01:29:49,786 --> 01:29:52,246
I'm sorry to cause you
all this trouble.

1424
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,146
If you get me out of this one...

1425
01:29:54,106 --> 01:29:56,066
Never mind that.

1426
01:29:56,028 --> 01:29:59,990
I ain't counting
on no reformation.

1427
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:01,996
Go on. Get going fast.

1428
01:30:01,949 --> 01:30:03,743
Good-bye, pa.

1429
01:30:03,709 --> 01:30:05,169
So long, Sid.

1430
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,653
So long, Lewt.

1431
01:30:08,032 --> 01:30:10,992
Take care of yourself, son.

1432
01:30:10,912 --> 01:30:12,914
I will, pa.

1433
01:30:27,237 --> 01:30:29,197
Yay, boy.

1434
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:32,035
Now here's a chance
to do something for pa.

1435
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:59,905
I've been working
on the railroad

1436
01:31:59,784 --> 01:32:03,245
All the live-long day

1437
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:08,465
Come on, Sid. Come on.

1438
01:32:08,425 --> 01:32:11,386
You ain't got the mint
on this game.

1439
01:32:11,307 --> 01:32:13,267
Sorry, Senator.

1440
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:17,105
You certainly stuck your head
in a noose that time.

1441
01:32:18,349 --> 01:32:19,767
Pearl, honey.

1442
01:32:22,111 --> 01:32:24,654
What you doing with that thing?

1443
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:26,343
There ain't nobody here but me.

1444
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:29,439
I'm gonna kill you.

1445
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:32,937
That wouldn't be a very ladylike
thing to do, would it...

1446
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,501
after me riding thirty miles
just for a kiss?

1447
01:32:35,434 --> 01:32:38,018
You're gonna get
what you gave Sam Pierce.

1448
01:32:37,955 --> 01:32:39,414
That just goes to show you...

1449
01:32:39,395 --> 01:32:41,313
there ain't no gratitude
for nothing.

1450
01:32:41,275 --> 01:32:43,945
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be tied up...

1451
01:32:43,876 --> 01:32:47,337
with that brokendown
cowhand right now.

1452
01:32:47,237 --> 01:32:50,697
You might as well marry pa.

1453
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:54,517
Sam Pierce was a good man,
and you're a skunk.

1454
01:32:54,398 --> 01:32:55,900
Of all the ornery females.

1455
01:32:55,879 --> 01:32:57,339
One minute you're yammering...

1456
01:32:57,319 --> 01:32:58,779
because I don't
love you enough...

1457
01:32:58,759 --> 01:33:01,220
and when I go out
and show you how much I do...

1458
01:33:01,161 --> 01:33:03,163
you're wanting to plug me.

1459
01:33:05,003 --> 01:33:07,213
You're my girl, honey.

1460
01:33:07,162 --> 01:33:08,873
I was your girl.

1461
01:33:08,843 --> 01:33:12,304
Anybody who was my girl
is still my girl.

1462
01:33:12,205 --> 01:33:15,165
That's the kind of guy I am.

1463
01:33:15,085 --> 01:33:17,044
You know... loyal.

1464
01:33:17,006 --> 01:33:18,466
Stay back.

1465
01:33:18,446 --> 01:33:21,949
There ain't nobody
gonna take my girl.

1466
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:25,710
Nobody.

1467
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,835
Never.

1468
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:34,877
I'm saving you, tiger cat.

1469
01:33:34,851 --> 01:33:37,979
Just when I figure
I'm doing fine and dandy...

1470
01:33:37,891 --> 01:33:42,521
I start thinking about you,
and nothing else is any good.

1471
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:49,593
Here.

1472
01:33:51,015 --> 01:33:52,683
What's going on around here?

1473
01:33:53,897 --> 01:33:55,523
Come in.

1474
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:56,831
Howdy, Senator.

1475
01:33:56,777 --> 01:33:59,363
Sorry to be busting in
on you like this.

1476
01:33:59,297 --> 01:34:01,799
It's all right, sheriff.
How's tricks?

1477
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:03,531
How's the law-breaking
business?

1478
01:34:03,499 --> 01:34:06,001
Pretty quiet... since Lewt left.

1479
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,901
Yeah, pretty dull
without him around.

1480
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:10,823
Ain't heard from him lately,
have you, Senator?

1481
01:34:10,701 --> 01:34:14,538
Lewt? Here. Have a bite.

1482
01:34:15,662 --> 01:34:17,497
Don't mind if I do.

1483
01:34:17,423 --> 01:34:19,425
Wish I could afford this brand.

1484
01:34:19,344 --> 01:34:22,346
The next batch I get,
I'll send you some.

1485
01:34:22,224 --> 01:34:25,227
No, I ain't heard
a word from Lewt...

1486
01:34:25,105 --> 01:34:30,026
since he was attacked
by that no-account Sam Pierce.

1487
01:34:29,865 --> 01:34:32,826
How's your other son
feel about it?

1488
01:34:32,748 --> 01:34:34,624
I ain't got no other son.

1489
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:38,069
Funny thing... one of the boys...

1490
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:44,878
Lewt? I wish it was so.

1491
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:47,377
Don't mind if I have
a look around, do you?

1492
01:34:47,311 --> 01:34:50,773
No. Go ahead, sheriff.
You got your duties to do.

1493
01:34:50,672 --> 01:34:53,342
I'm sorry you're gonna have
your trouble for nothing.

1494
01:34:54,675 --> 01:34:57,511
I hear Mrs. McCanles
has been feeling kind of poorly.

1495
01:34:57,435 --> 01:34:58,936
It ain't nothing.

1496
01:34:58,915 --> 01:35:01,041
Just getting
a little old, I guess.

1497
01:35:00,996 --> 01:35:02,706
You reckon the missus
would mind...

1498
01:35:02,676 --> 01:35:04,844
if I kind of
looked around her room?

1499
01:35:04,797 --> 01:35:06,382
No. Why should she mind?

1500
01:35:06,357 --> 01:35:07,733
Go ahead.

1501
01:35:07,717 --> 01:35:09,678
Sid, ain't you moved yet?

1502
01:35:13,879 --> 01:35:15,255
Come in.

1503
01:35:16,601 --> 01:35:18,227
- Evening, ma'am.
- Sheriff.

1504
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,369
Sorry to disturb
your privacy, ma'am.

1505
01:35:20,321 --> 01:35:21,906
Sheriff Thompson, what is it?

1506
01:35:21,881 --> 01:35:23,841
It's really nothing, ma'am.

1507
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:25,762
One of the boys
had a fool notion...

1508
01:35:25,723 --> 01:35:27,684
that Lewt was around here.

1509
01:35:27,643 --> 01:35:29,603
I'm afraid if Lewton
were around...

1510
01:35:29,564 --> 01:35:32,233
I'd be the last person
to know it.

1511
01:35:32,164 --> 01:35:33,457
Sorry.

1512
01:35:47,729 --> 01:35:50,190
Oh, my sons.

1513
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:52,132
My sons.

1514
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,394
Let's try this one.

1515
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,879
Who's that?

1516
01:36:00,852 --> 01:36:02,354
Is that you, girl?

1517
01:36:03,894 --> 01:36:05,520
What do you want?

1518
01:36:05,495 --> 01:36:08,956
It's me... Sheriff Thompson.
You ain't seen Lewt, have you?

1519
01:36:08,855 --> 01:36:11,816
Lewt? That murdering,
sneaking no-account.

1520
01:36:11,736 --> 01:36:13,696
I wish I could see him.

1521
01:36:13,657 --> 01:36:15,908
I reckon you do.

1522
01:36:15,857 --> 01:36:18,026
I was forgetting
about Sam Pierce.

1523
01:36:17,977 --> 01:36:19,062
Sorry.

1524
01:36:19,058 --> 01:36:22,936
Good night.
See you at the hanging.

1525
01:36:32,103 --> 01:36:33,520
Poor old Mac.

1526
01:36:33,462 --> 01:36:36,590
He don't know how close he came
to getting plugged.

1527
01:36:36,503 --> 01:36:39,130
Be quiet. It ain't safe yet.

1528
01:36:39,064 --> 01:36:40,899
It ain't safe for them,
you mean.

1529
01:36:40,864 --> 01:36:42,867
There they go now.

1530
01:36:44,346 --> 01:36:46,348
I think I'll light out
for Mexico.

1531
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:47,766
Mexico?

1532
01:36:47,707 --> 01:36:48,915
Yeah.

1533
01:36:48,908 --> 01:36:50,618
I'm gonna grab me a ranch...

1534
01:36:50,587 --> 01:36:53,089
that'll make this place
look like a gopher hole.

1535
01:36:53,027 --> 01:36:56,281
It would be like heaven,
being in Mexico together.

1536
01:36:56,188 --> 01:36:58,315
I'll show these
heel-squatters around here...

1537
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:59,896
a thing or two about ranching.

1538
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,205
You can do it, too.

1539
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,151
- Lewt.
- Huh?

1540
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:06,530
- Go saddle my pinto.
- What for?

1541
01:37:06,431 --> 01:37:09,893
- While I get ready.
- Ready for what?

1542
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:13,254
I'm going with you, of course.
Hurry up.

1543
01:37:15,075 --> 01:37:17,410
You wouldn't like it
down there, honey.

1544
01:37:17,315 --> 01:37:19,149
Sure, I will. I'll be
a big help to you, too.

1545
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:21,201
I can cook, and I can shoot
as good as you...

1546
01:37:21,156 --> 01:37:22,783
and I never get tired riding.

1547
01:37:22,756 --> 01:37:24,382
You'll try to stop me
from doing things...

1548
01:37:24,357 --> 01:37:25,816
yammering about me
maybe getting shot...

1549
01:37:25,797 --> 01:37:27,423
or start all over again
about marrying somebody.

1550
01:37:27,397 --> 01:37:30,359
No. I promise I won't never say
another word about marrying.

1551
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:31,571
You'll probably
want to go with me...

1552
01:37:31,559 --> 01:37:32,852
every time I feel
like going on a bust...

1553
01:37:32,838 --> 01:37:34,048
or playing me some poker.

1554
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,334
I wouldn't, honest.

1555
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,780
Just so long
as I could be near you.

1556
01:37:36,761 --> 01:37:38,388
I'm gonna live my own way.
Nobody's gonna hog-tie me.

1557
01:37:38,362 --> 01:37:39,488
Please.

1558
01:37:39,481 --> 01:37:40,941
I'll come back
every once in a while...

1559
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:42,215
and see you, like tonight.

1560
01:37:42,202 --> 01:37:43,828
I'll do anything you say.

1561
01:37:43,803 --> 01:37:46,764
Honey, I love you. I'll see you
every time I come back.

1562
01:37:46,683 --> 01:37:48,643
I'll send for you someday.
Honest I will.

1563
01:37:48,604 --> 01:37:50,064
I want to go with you.
I've got to go with you.

1564
01:37:50,044 --> 01:37:51,504
Will you stop your yammering?
I've got to mosey!

1565
01:37:51,484 --> 01:37:53,444
You love me!
You said you loved me!

1566
01:37:53,405 --> 01:37:55,365
Nobody else can have me
because I'm yours!

1567
01:37:55,325 --> 01:37:57,452
I don't want anybody else!
I want you!

1568
01:37:57,408 --> 01:37:59,951
I'm yours!
Nobody else can have me!

1569
01:37:59,887 --> 01:38:01,931
You said nobody ever!
Now take me with you!

1570
01:38:01,888 --> 01:38:04,264
You've got to take me!
Please! Please, honey!

1571
01:38:04,209 --> 01:38:07,420
- Shut up!
- Lewt, honey, please!

1572
01:38:57,144 --> 01:38:59,521
Begging your pardon, ma'am...

1573
01:38:59,464 --> 01:39:01,049
I'd like to say
all us boys at the Bit...

1574
01:39:01,025 --> 01:39:03,026
is praying mighty hard
that you get...

1575
01:39:02,944 --> 01:39:05,948
All right, Ken. All right now.
You just wait downstairs.

1576
01:39:05,827 --> 01:39:07,744
I'll let you know
when I need you.

1577
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:11,703
Will you thank the boys for me?

1578
01:39:11,588 --> 01:39:14,090
Tell them it isn't
quite as hard to go...

1579
01:39:13,988 --> 01:39:15,491
as they may think.

1580
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:17,932
What are you
talking that way for?

1581
01:39:17,831 --> 01:39:20,833
Anybody would think
you was dying.

1582
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:24,618
I'm a nuisance to you
even to the end.

1583
01:39:24,551 --> 01:39:26,553
It's the first time
you've been in this room...

1584
01:39:26,472 --> 01:39:28,473
since that night.

1585
01:39:28,393 --> 01:39:31,104
Don't bring that up.

1586
01:39:31,035 --> 01:39:34,704
I never had the courage
to discuss it with you before...

1587
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:36,554
but it doesn't matter now.

1588
01:39:36,516 --> 01:39:38,475
I've paid for my mistake.

1589
01:39:38,436 --> 01:39:40,730
You've hated me
all through the years.

1590
01:39:40,677 --> 01:39:44,305
You paid? What about me,
with these legs?

1591
01:39:44,197 --> 01:39:46,658
As useless as a hog-tied steer.

1592
01:39:46,597 --> 01:39:49,892
And all because you
couldn't stand to be...

1593
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,969
mistress of the biggest
ranch in Texas.

1594
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,008
And why? I'll tell you why.

1595
01:39:56,841 --> 01:39:58,468
Nobody needed to tell me...

1596
01:39:58,442 --> 01:40:00,236
who you was running away to
that night.

1597
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:03,705
Nobody needed to tell me
you was running to Chavez.

1598
01:40:03,603 --> 01:40:06,355
That's not true. It's not true.

1599
01:40:06,284 --> 01:40:09,245
I was running away,
but not to Scott.

1600
01:40:09,164 --> 01:40:11,124
Not to Scott.

1601
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:13,045
True or not, you left me.

1602
01:40:13,006 --> 01:40:15,967
And true or not,
I went after you...

1603
01:40:15,888 --> 01:40:21,267
like any lovesick,
half-baked boy would do.

1604
01:40:21,088 --> 01:40:26,093
I'd give anything...
anything to undo it.

1605
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:31,852
I loved you, Laura Belle.
Yes, sir, I loved you.

1606
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:34,612
Kept on saying to myself
all through the years...

1607
01:40:34,532 --> 01:40:39,494
that I hated you,
until finally I did hate you.

1608
01:40:39,334 --> 01:40:42,295
In my heart,
I knew all the time...

1609
01:40:42,215 --> 01:40:44,258
it wasn't your fault, though.

1610
01:40:44,215 --> 01:40:45,674
It was my fault.

1611
01:40:45,655 --> 01:40:50,034
It was my jealousy
that made me like I was...

1612
01:40:49,896 --> 01:40:52,357
hard and cruel-like...

1613
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:55,716
till I guess
you had to leave me.

1614
01:40:55,618 --> 01:41:00,079
I never should have
gone out after you that night.

1615
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:03,152
But when I found out
you was gone...

1616
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,603
I got to thinking
you was going to him...

1617
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:07,709
and I couldn't stand it.

1618
01:41:07,662 --> 01:41:12,124
I swore I'd stop you
and bring you back.

1619
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,943
I went crazy.

1620
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:18,366
Yes, that's what it was.
I just went crazy.

1621
01:41:18,225 --> 01:41:22,187
And I rode through the night
like a drunken Comanche.

1622
01:41:22,066 --> 01:41:26,486
It was my own crazy jealousy
that threw me off that horse.

1623
01:41:26,347 --> 01:41:30,810
Jackson, forgive me.

1624
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:33,629
Look at me.

1625
01:41:33,548 --> 01:41:37,010
You're my husband... my very own.

1626
01:41:57,555 --> 01:41:59,015
Hiya, boys.

1627
01:41:58,996 --> 01:42:03,624
- It's Jesse.
- Well, I'll be.

1628
01:42:03,478 --> 01:42:07,106
He's got a lot of gall,
coming back here.

1629
01:42:16,761 --> 01:42:19,347
Where do you think you're going?

1630
01:42:19,283 --> 01:42:22,702
I thought I told you
to keep out of my sight.

1631
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:24,396
I just found out
my mother is dying...

1632
01:42:24,363 --> 01:42:27,033
and I came to see her,
and I intend to see her.

1633
01:42:26,964 --> 01:42:29,216
They tell me
you're the big noise now...

1634
01:42:29,165 --> 01:42:31,333
with them trespassing thieves.

1635
01:42:31,287 --> 01:42:33,705
I hope my good fortune
doesn't distress you too much.

1636
01:42:33,646 --> 01:42:35,774
They're even talking
about putting you...

1637
01:42:35,727 --> 01:42:37,187
up for public office.

1638
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:38,960
They must pay high
for double-crossers.

1639
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:40,387
Senator,
let's not discuss that.

1640
01:42:40,369 --> 01:42:42,163
I'm afraid we
see things differently.

1641
01:42:42,129 --> 01:42:43,589
Nothing on earth
would bring me here...

1642
01:42:43,569 --> 01:42:45,862
You're mighty lucky my men
didn't take a shot at you.

1643
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:47,436
That was their orders.

1644
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,371
I was about to say
that nothing on earth...

1645
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,333
would bring me back here
except mother.

1646
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:53,209
Is she in her room?

1647
01:42:53,173 --> 01:42:56,133
- No, she ain't in her room.
- Where is she?

1648
01:42:56,054 --> 01:43:02,476
You'll find her right in there,
in a long pine box.

1649
01:43:43,507 --> 01:43:45,175
Hello, Vashti.

1650
01:43:46,547 --> 01:43:48,549
- Mr. Jesse...
- No, thank you.

1651
01:43:48,468 --> 01:43:50,762
But Mrs. McCanles,
she said to me once...

1652
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:53,711
"Vashti, you be sure and see
that Mr. Jesse eats proper..."

1653
01:43:53,589 --> 01:43:57,926
You've been a good friend.
I shan't forget it.

1654
01:43:59,351 --> 01:44:02,353
Poor Mrs. McCanles.

1655
01:44:02,232 --> 01:44:05,694
I wonder if Miss Pearl
would mind if you woke her up.

1656
01:44:05,593 --> 01:44:10,556
I have to go away soon.
I would like to see her.

1657
01:44:10,395 --> 01:44:12,897
What's the matter?
Didn't you hear me?

1658
01:44:12,795 --> 01:44:14,797
Yes, I heared you.

1659
01:44:14,716 --> 01:44:16,717
Only I'm certain sure
the devil hisself...

1660
01:44:16,636 --> 01:44:18,638
has been chasing Miss Pearl.

1661
01:44:18,557 --> 01:44:20,558
What on earth
are you talking about?

1662
01:44:20,476 --> 01:44:23,938
Mrs. McCanles, she treated
Miss Pearl awful good.

1663
01:44:23,839 --> 01:44:27,301
She treated everybody
awful good, even me.

1664
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,661
And after she went to heaven...

1665
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:33,563
Miss Pearl looks like she's had
a spell or something.

1666
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:35,444
She wouldn't eat nothing.

1667
01:44:35,362 --> 01:44:37,363
She wouldn't talk to nobody.

1668
01:44:37,282 --> 01:44:38,784
She just stared and stared...

1669
01:44:38,723 --> 01:44:41,225
at Mrs. McCanles lying there
so still-like.

1670
01:44:41,124 --> 01:44:42,625
She ran to the barn...

1671
01:44:42,564 --> 01:44:44,816
and wouldn't come out
for nobody.

1672
01:44:44,764 --> 01:44:46,432
Poor Pearl.

1673
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:49,866
She's sad.
I listened at the barn door...

1674
01:44:49,767 --> 01:44:51,768
and I heared her weeping
something awful.

1675
01:44:51,687 --> 01:44:53,689
I want you to do
something for me.

1676
01:44:53,607 --> 01:44:55,108
Yes?

1677
01:44:55,047 --> 01:44:57,049
Go and fix Miss Pearl
a hot breakfast.

1678
01:44:56,968 --> 01:44:58,469
Yes!

1679
01:44:58,408 --> 01:45:01,869
And I want you to pack
Miss Pearl's things.

1680
01:45:01,769 --> 01:45:04,272
Yes, ma'am! Yes, sir!

1681
01:45:07,531 --> 01:45:09,032
Go away.

1682
01:45:08,972 --> 01:45:10,598
Vashti said you wouldn't
come into the house...

1683
01:45:10,571 --> 01:45:11,990
and I couldn't believe her.

1684
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,391
Leave me alone.

1685
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:14,791
Have you gone out of your mind?

1686
01:45:14,733 --> 01:45:16,317
What are you doing out here
in the stable?

1687
01:45:16,294 --> 01:45:18,253
I bet your pa would think
it was too good for me.

1688
01:45:18,214 --> 01:45:20,175
Never mind what he thinks.
I'm not going to allow you...

1689
01:45:20,135 --> 01:45:22,762
Don't you worry none about me.
I'm going away from here.

1690
01:45:22,695 --> 01:45:26,322
- Really? Where are you going?
- It ain't your business.

1691
01:45:26,216 --> 01:45:28,176
Me and Dice
will get along all right.

1692
01:45:28,136 --> 01:45:30,097
Of course, there's Lewt.
He'll be paying a visit here...

1693
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:32,017
sooner or later,
if I know Lewt.

1694
01:45:31,979 --> 01:45:35,440
That's right, I'm Lewt's girl.
You can't forget that, can you?

1695
01:45:35,338 --> 01:45:37,507
What makes you think that?

1696
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:40,546
That's what you said that night.
You said you'd never forget it.

1697
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:42,254
I did say that, didn't I?

1698
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:45,349
It worried me sometimes
to think I'd made so much of it.

1699
01:45:45,261 --> 01:45:48,889
I hope it didn't make
any difference.

1700
01:45:48,783 --> 01:45:51,744
It didn't make no difference.

1701
01:45:51,664 --> 01:45:53,624
You're right. I'm Lewt's girl.

1702
01:45:53,584 --> 01:45:56,044
It's all I ever was.
It's all I ever could be.

1703
01:45:55,986 --> 01:45:57,946
You love him, don't you?

1704
01:45:57,905 --> 01:45:59,365
Love him? I hate him.

1705
01:45:59,345 --> 01:46:02,306
I wish they'd hang him.
I wish they'd hang him fast.

1706
01:46:02,227 --> 01:46:05,687
Yes. After all you've
been through, I suppose...

1707
01:46:05,588 --> 01:46:07,965
It ain't just his fault.

1708
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:14,309
If he sent for me tonight,
I guess I'd go to him.

1709
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:16,611
Lewt's not sending for you
tonight or any other night.

1710
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:18,510
Listen, I have to be
in Paradise Flats...

1711
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:19,932
a few days on business.

1712
01:46:19,912 --> 01:46:21,706
Do you want to wait here
until I go to Austin...

1713
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:23,467
or would you like to
come with me right now?

1714
01:46:23,433 --> 01:46:26,227
Me? You're just
being sorry for me.

1715
01:46:26,154 --> 01:46:28,113
You don't have to be
sorry for me none!

1716
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:30,035
Listen to me.
I won't have you thinking that.

1717
01:46:29,994 --> 01:46:31,955
It's you who are feeling
sorry for yourself.

1718
01:46:31,915 --> 01:46:35,877
I told Helen long ago
I wanted to get you out of here.

1719
01:46:35,756 --> 01:46:37,216
You told her?

1720
01:46:37,196 --> 01:46:40,157
Yes. She wants to be
your friend.

1721
01:46:40,078 --> 01:46:42,038
After your ma died...

1722
01:46:41,999 --> 01:46:44,460
I just didn't want to
go on living no more.

1723
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:46,901
I know what you mean.

1724
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,681
You'll like Helen,
and she'll like you, too.

1725
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,269
You just wait and see.

1726
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:58,437
She's a lady, ain't she?
Like your ma.

1727
01:46:58,323 --> 01:47:01,284
She's a lady,
like you're going to be.

1728
01:47:01,203 --> 01:47:03,164
No, I can't be no more.

1729
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:05,085
Of course you can.
We'll just pretend...

1730
01:47:05,046 --> 01:47:07,005
the whole thing
was just a bad dream.

1731
01:47:06,966 --> 01:47:09,843
That's all it was actually,
a nightmare.

1732
01:47:09,766 --> 01:47:12,768
If only I could be good again!

1733
01:47:12,688 --> 01:47:15,148
Look at me.

1734
01:47:15,088 --> 01:47:17,048
Remember when you
wanted to learn...

1735
01:47:17,008 --> 01:47:19,469
when you wanted me to help you?

1736
01:47:19,408 --> 01:47:21,785
I know just the school for you.

1737
01:47:21,729 --> 01:47:22,939
School?

1738
01:47:22,929 --> 01:47:26,223
What's the matter?
Don't you still want to learn?

1739
01:47:26,132 --> 01:47:28,092
I'll do anything.

1740
01:47:28,052 --> 01:47:31,013
I'll cook for you.
I'll wash Miss Helen's clothes.

1741
01:47:30,933 --> 01:47:32,393
You'll do nothing of the sort.

1742
01:47:32,373 --> 01:47:34,834
You'll learn to waltz
and make small talk...

1743
01:47:34,773 --> 01:47:36,733
and have pretty dresses.

1744
01:47:36,695 --> 01:47:38,153
Here.

1745
01:47:40,775 --> 01:47:42,985
For me?

1746
01:47:42,936 --> 01:47:44,646
From mother to you.

1747
01:47:46,297 --> 01:47:48,757
Jesse, I...

1748
01:47:48,699 --> 01:47:50,658
I wish...

1749
01:47:52,059 --> 01:47:54,894
I wish I could die for you.

1750
01:47:56,059 --> 01:47:58,520
Let's hope you never
have to do that.

1751
01:48:28,469 --> 01:48:31,263
Is that you, Judas?

1752
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:33,817
I got a message
from your brother...

1753
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:36,044
the McCanles with the guts.

1754
01:48:35,992 --> 01:48:37,618
What's the matter
with the bad man?

1755
01:48:37,592 --> 01:48:39,302
Can't he deliver
his messages in person?

1756
01:48:39,273 --> 01:48:41,983
He has some business
tonight... with a train.

1757
01:48:41,913 --> 01:48:45,125
He just plumb don't like trains.

1758
01:48:45,034 --> 01:48:47,745
So I've heard.
Have you become his assistant?

1759
01:48:47,674 --> 01:48:49,634
We keep in touch
with each other.

1760
01:48:49,595 --> 01:48:51,055
You should have seen his face...

1761
01:48:51,035 --> 01:48:52,786
when I told him
you have Chavez with you.

1762
01:48:52,756 --> 01:48:54,423
I bet it was
a lovely sight to behold.

1763
01:48:54,397 --> 01:48:55,773
What's the message?

1764
01:48:55,756 --> 01:48:58,592
He says I'm to bring her
back with me... pronto.

1765
01:48:58,478 --> 01:49:02,315
Suppose she doesn't feel up
to making the trip?

1766
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:03,951
He says if she don't
come back...

1767
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,713
he's coming here
tomorrow morning...

1768
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,389
bright and early and get her.

1769
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,221
You seem to be
a capable messenger.

1770
01:49:11,121 --> 01:49:13,415
Would you mind
carrying back a reply?

1771
01:49:13,362 --> 01:49:15,154
Not at all. Glad to oblige.

1772
01:49:15,123 --> 01:49:18,125
You can tell my beloved brother
that I'll wait for him here.

1773
01:49:18,003 --> 01:49:21,298
I should have the sheriff
waiting for him...

1774
01:49:21,204 --> 01:49:23,165
but I prefer to meet him alone.

1775
01:49:23,125 --> 01:49:25,711
- Is that a promise?
- You're not talking to Lewt.

1776
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:59,885
That's near enough.

1777
01:49:59,814 --> 01:50:02,192
I'm giving you one more chance.
Send Pearl out here...

1778
01:50:02,136 --> 01:50:04,137
or I'll plug you
from here to breakfast.

1779
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:07,599
Just what do you think
Pearl's doing here with me?

1780
01:50:07,498 --> 01:50:08,958
Don't give me any...

1781
01:50:08,938 --> 01:50:11,023
of your high and mighty
noble talk, big words.

1782
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:14,065
You think I wouldn't shoot you
because you ain't got a gun?

1783
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:17,315
I wouldn't credit you
with any such compunctions.

1784
01:50:22,543 --> 01:50:24,586
I'm riding back
to that hitching post...

1785
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:27,295
and then turning
and starting to shoot.

1786
01:50:27,223 --> 01:50:28,808
It's more than you did
for Sam Pierce.

1787
01:50:28,785 --> 01:50:30,245
Why all the consideration?

1788
01:50:30,225 --> 01:50:32,269
Just don't want them
fancy friends of yours...

1789
01:50:32,225 --> 01:50:35,769
to say you had a brother
who shot you down in cold blood.

1790
01:50:35,666 --> 01:50:37,208
You're going to hang.

1791
01:50:37,187 --> 01:50:41,065
You're going to hang
by the neck until you're dead!

1792
01:50:40,907 --> 01:50:42,408
You'll just go on
killing and killing...

1793
01:50:42,348 --> 01:50:45,059
till they kill you.

1794
01:50:44,988 --> 01:50:48,533
I hope Pearl gives you
a pretty funeral.

1795
01:51:07,675 --> 01:51:10,803
- Who's that?
- Just me... Lem Smoot.

1796
01:51:10,715 --> 01:51:12,509
Come here to gloat over me, huh?

1797
01:51:12,476 --> 01:51:15,605
You can turn right around
and get out of here.

1798
01:51:15,518 --> 01:51:18,479
I came because I thought maybe
you'd be needing a friend.

1799
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:22,194
There's a funny glow in the sky
tonight, ain't there?

1800
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:25,207
I remember once hearing
one of them Indian legends...

1801
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:28,415
about how their ancestors
lit bonfires in the sky...

1802
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,781
when a chief's son was a-dyin'.

1803
01:51:30,721 --> 01:51:32,682
He's dying?

1804
01:51:32,642 --> 01:51:34,601
It don't surprise me none.

1805
01:51:34,563 --> 01:51:37,023
Lewt always was a good shot.

1806
01:51:36,964 --> 01:51:38,924
It looks like
them ancestors of yours...

1807
01:51:38,884 --> 01:51:41,845
have to put out those bonfires.

1808
01:51:41,765 --> 01:51:43,725
What do you mean?

1809
01:51:43,685 --> 01:51:47,148
I guess Jesse's a little tougher
than you thought.

1810
01:51:47,047 --> 01:51:48,507
Thank God.

1811
01:51:48,487 --> 01:51:52,449
I thought I knew you
better than that.

1812
01:51:52,327 --> 01:51:54,788
I know how fond you were
of those boys...

1813
01:51:54,728 --> 01:51:57,148
and how proud
of them you were.

1814
01:51:57,089 --> 01:51:59,550
It don't seem possible...

1815
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:02,451
but I must have been wrong
about a whole lot of things.

1816
01:52:02,372 --> 01:52:05,333
Laura Belle warned me
I was spoiling Lewt...

1817
01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:08,213
but I wouldn't listen to her.

1818
01:52:08,132 --> 01:52:12,386
Look. You see
them plains and hills?

1819
01:52:12,254 --> 01:52:14,088
I was so almighty proud...

1820
01:52:14,055 --> 01:52:16,348
of what I carved
out of this country.

1821
01:52:16,295 --> 01:52:18,756
I figured
I was building something...

1822
01:52:18,695 --> 01:52:20,655
for Lewt and Jesse.

1823
01:52:20,616 --> 01:52:23,076
And what have I got now?

1824
01:52:23,017 --> 01:52:26,144
Lewt a murderer, an outlaw.

1825
01:52:26,059 --> 01:52:27,267
Jesse...

1826
01:52:29,259 --> 01:52:32,678
Jesse would come back
any time you want him to.

1827
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:35,080
You think so?

1828
01:52:35,021 --> 01:52:37,982
He told me to tell you so.

1829
01:52:40,301 --> 01:52:44,263
I'm just a lonely old man
who needs a friend...

1830
01:52:44,142 --> 01:52:46,103
like you said.

1831
01:52:52,786 --> 01:52:55,037
Whoa!

1832
01:52:59,067 --> 01:53:01,069
Here's your luggage, miss.

1833
01:53:04,709 --> 01:53:06,752
You're Miss Helen, ain't you?

1834
01:53:06,709 --> 01:53:08,587
And you're Pearl.

1835
01:53:08,551 --> 01:53:10,511
He's been asking for you.

1836
01:53:10,471 --> 01:53:12,931
How is he?

1837
01:53:12,872 --> 01:53:16,333
He's... gonna be all right.

1838
01:53:16,232 --> 01:53:18,235
Thank heaven.

1839
01:53:21,994 --> 01:53:24,955
I shouldn't cry. I know it.

1840
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:27,335
He wouldn't like it.

1841
01:53:27,275 --> 01:53:30,777
You couldn't do nothing
he wouldn't like.

1842
01:53:33,677 --> 01:53:36,847
You're very fond
of Jesse, aren't you?

1843
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:42,241
After my pa...

1844
01:53:44,081 --> 01:53:49,085
There wasn't never nobody
good to me like my pa...

1845
01:53:50,322 --> 01:53:53,283
Except Mrs. McCanles...

1846
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:54,662
and Jesse.

1847
01:53:54,643 --> 01:53:56,145
My dear.

1848
01:53:57,525 --> 01:54:01,362
You will come
and live with us, won't you?

1849
01:54:02,646 --> 01:54:04,814
I want you to.

1850
01:54:10,489 --> 01:54:12,073
Yes?

1851
01:54:12,049 --> 01:54:16,094
I'm glad you and Jesse
are... bespoken.

1852
01:54:17,131 --> 01:54:18,131
Thank you.

1853
01:54:26,333 --> 01:54:28,751
Hi, Pearl.

1854
01:54:28,694 --> 01:54:30,195
How's the hero?

1855
01:54:30,174 --> 01:54:32,134
I just heard
he was gonna pull through.

1856
01:54:32,094 --> 01:54:33,554
Tough luck, ain't it?

1857
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:36,161
But Lewt will get him next time.
You can bank on that.

1858
01:54:36,095 --> 01:54:38,889
- Next time?
- Yeah.

1859
01:54:38,815 --> 01:54:40,776
Next time.

1860
01:54:40,738 --> 01:54:43,699
I got good news for you.

1861
01:54:43,618 --> 01:54:46,079
Yeah? What is it?

1862
01:54:46,018 --> 01:54:48,229
It's from Lewt.

1863
01:54:48,179 --> 01:54:49,805
He says you got to
hightail it out of here...

1864
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:51,406
if you want to
kiss him good-bye...

1865
01:54:51,379 --> 01:54:52,964
before he beats it
across the border.

1866
01:54:54,581 --> 01:54:57,583
You mean it? Where is he?

1867
01:54:57,461 --> 01:55:00,465
I kind of figured
you'd like that.

1868
01:55:00,343 --> 01:55:01,844
He's hiding out
at Squaw's Head Rock.

1869
01:55:01,784 --> 01:55:03,285
You got that? Squaw's Head Rock.

1870
01:55:03,224 --> 01:55:05,226
Just fire two shots
when you get there.

1871
01:55:05,145 --> 01:55:07,146
I got it. Squaw's Head Rock.

1872
01:55:07,064 --> 01:55:09,066
Take the Apache trail
to the mission.

1873
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,987
Any Indian there can tell you
how to get to Buffalo Ridge.

1874
01:55:11,865 --> 01:55:13,868
And then you...
You got a good horse?

1875
01:55:13,787 --> 01:55:15,288
It's a couple of days' ride.

1876
01:55:15,227 --> 01:55:17,229
Sure. I got my pinto.

1877
01:55:17,148 --> 01:55:23,819
You know, the one Lewt gave me
before I was his girl.

1878
01:56:54,495 --> 01:56:56,455
Hiya, Pearl!

1879
01:56:57,857 --> 01:57:01,818
Here I am!
I've been waiting for you!

1880
01:57:42,469 --> 01:57:45,430
Hello, honey!
I'll be right down!

1881
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,101
Stay there!

1882
01:58:00,434 --> 01:58:04,146
I can't see you!
Can you see me?

1883
01:58:32,404 --> 01:58:36,866
You... double-crossing... bobcat!

1884
01:59:09,534 --> 01:59:12,453
I guess that does it.

1885
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:34,299
You got me that time.

1886
01:59:34,222 --> 01:59:35,723
I'm done for.

1887
01:59:35,702 --> 01:59:37,120
You're lying.

1888
01:59:38,503 --> 01:59:40,422
You're lying,
like you always do!

1889
01:59:44,265 --> 01:59:47,183
I can't shoot no more, honey.

1890
01:59:48,585 --> 01:59:50,379
Honest.

1891
01:59:50,346 --> 01:59:52,473
I'm not scared of you.

1892
01:59:52,428 --> 01:59:54,930
I'm coming up after you.

1893
01:59:54,828 --> 01:59:58,831
All right, then. Come on up!

1894
02:00:31,798 --> 02:00:34,718
No use in my...

1895
02:00:34,638 --> 02:00:36,807
lying no more.

1896
02:00:37,999 --> 02:00:39,459
I'm through.

1897
02:00:42,321 --> 02:00:44,281
You hear me?

1898
02:00:44,242 --> 02:00:45,744
Yeah.

1899
02:00:46,963 --> 02:00:48,965
I'm dying.

1900
02:00:50,324 --> 02:00:51,950
I...

1901
02:00:51,925 --> 02:00:54,384
I'm going... fast.

1902
02:00:54,325 --> 02:00:57,786
Are you...
Ain't you coming up?

1903
02:00:59,126 --> 02:01:01,795
I want to see you.
I got to see you.

1904
02:01:01,727 --> 02:01:03,519
Where are you?

1905
02:01:04,888 --> 02:01:06,889
Where are you?

1906
02:01:08,249 --> 02:01:10,210
Hurry!

1907
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:12,506
Please!

1908
02:01:12,450 --> 02:01:15,536
I... I got to...

1909
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:19,788
hold you... just once more.

1910
02:01:22,014 --> 02:01:24,473
I love you.

1911
02:01:25,854 --> 02:01:27,480
I love you!

1912
02:01:27,453 --> 02:01:30,331
Hurry. Hurry!

1913
02:01:32,656 --> 02:01:34,616
Hurry, honey.

1914
02:01:34,577 --> 02:01:37,037
Hold on! Hold on!

1915
02:01:36,977 --> 02:01:38,437
Hurry!

1916
02:01:38,417 --> 02:01:40,878
Wait for me!

1917
02:01:40,819 --> 02:01:42,821
Wait for me.

1918
02:01:52,342 --> 02:01:54,052
Where are you?

1919
02:02:43,677 --> 02:02:46,138
You always said you could shoot.

1920
02:02:46,077 --> 02:02:49,038
I never believed you.

1921
02:02:48,957 --> 02:02:51,918
I love you.

1922
02:02:53,119 --> 02:02:55,245
I love you.

1923
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:57,659
Don't cry, honey.

1924
02:02:57,601 --> 02:02:59,561
Don't cry.

1925
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,939
I had to do it.

1926
02:03:02,882 --> 02:03:04,842
Of course you did.

1927
02:03:04,803 --> 02:03:07,764
Let me hold you.

1928
02:03:07,684 --> 02:03:09,143
Let me...

1929
02:03:09,124 --> 02:03:12,085
Just hold me.
Hold me once more.

1930
02:03:12,005 --> 02:03:15,466
Little... bobcat.
