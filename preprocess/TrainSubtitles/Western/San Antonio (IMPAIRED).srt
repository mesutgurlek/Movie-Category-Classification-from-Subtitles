that the tally book is in your hands now?

I wonder why they didn't.

1115

Because you did not tell them to,
I suppose.

I wonder why Stuart didn't need them
until after Charlie Bell was dead.

1117

If he hadn't killed Charlie Bell,

Ah. He's still afraid of that.

She'd only turn around and come back.
I'd do the same thing myself.

1376
01:43:04,263 --> 01:43:07,394
Jeanne, if you feel so bad,
we don't go someplace.

1377
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:10,063
We don't leave
until after we all get killed yet.

1378
01:43:10,241 --> 01:43:12,143
If that is what you want. Ah.

1379
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:14,408
No, Bozie. We're leaving now.

1380
01:43:14,917 --> 01:43:17,787
If he can't even walk across the plaza
to say goodbye to me...

1381
01:43:17,957 --> 01:43:21,452
...I don't want to see him again
or think of him or hear his name.

1382
01:43:24,136 --> 01:43:26,038
Now we pack.

1383
01:43:26,306 --> 01:43:29,540
Quick, quick, quick.
Begin putting the stuff on the...

1384
01:43:29,714 --> 01:43:31,114
Huh?

1385
01:43:31,283 --> 01:43:33,185
Gee. You...

1386
01:43:34,556 --> 01:43:36,185
I was very happy to meet you.

1387
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,828
Thank you. See you again.

1388
01:43:37,997 --> 01:43:40,433
It was very nice. Thank you.

1389
01:43:40,601 --> 01:43:42,935
You've searched the Alamo again
since daylight?

1390
01:43:43,107 --> 01:43:45,009
There was only one body in the Alamo.

1391
01:43:45,178 --> 01:43:46,840
The body of Legare.

1392
01:43:47,014 --> 01:43:48,677
Nobody knows what happened in there.

1393
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:51,345
Oh, we'll know more about it
when we find Clay.

1394
01:43:51,523 --> 01:43:53,151
- Lf we find him.
- Yeah.

1395
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:55,297
Aye.

1396
01:44:33,312 --> 01:44:34,837
[GUN CLICKS]

1397
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,932
Move over, honey.

1398
01:47:01,939 --> 01:47:03,135
BOZIE:
Look, look, look.

1399
01:47:03,309 --> 01:47:05,211
There goes an empty horse.

1400
01:47:05,379 --> 01:47:08,715
You look like they drug you through
in an irrigation project, backwards.

1401
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,214
He looks as though
they completely killed him.

1402
01:47:11,391 --> 01:47:15,160
- Just where do you think you're going?
- Out of Texas, you can bet on that.

1403
01:47:15,333 --> 01:47:18,099
- How can you even think of leaving Texas?
- Well, l...

1404
01:47:18,271 --> 01:47:21,836
Can't you see the sad look in the eyes
of those poor little cattle out there?

1405
01:47:22,012 --> 01:47:23,412
Look at them.

1406
01:47:24,918 --> 01:47:27,252
- You mean, that Matagorda knot-head?
- Yeah. Huh?

1407
01:47:27,422 --> 01:47:29,016
Matagorda?

1408
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:30,958
Now, just a minute.

1409
01:47:32,432 --> 01:47:35,598
Since when did Easterners
start talking about Matagordas?

1410
01:47:35,773 --> 01:47:38,335
Well, l... I guess I just wasn't thinking. L...

1411
01:47:38,511 --> 01:47:40,174
I'll say you weren't.

1412
01:47:40,348 --> 01:47:42,784
I always thought
there was something phony about you.

1413
01:47:42,954 --> 01:47:45,322
Now, are you going to tell me the truth?

1414
01:47:45,492 --> 01:47:47,928
Just where
were you born and raised, huh?

1415
01:47:48,231 --> 01:47:49,290
Fort Worth.

1416
01:47:49,466 --> 01:47:51,993
A Texan, I thought so.

1417
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:58,310
I could have gotten away with it
if I'd really tried.

1418
01:47:58,484 --> 01:48:01,388
You let go of her, Clay Hardin.
We're going to New Orleans alone.

1419
01:48:01,557 --> 01:48:03,993
No, ma'am, we're not.
There is only one place for us Texans.

1420
01:48:04,162 --> 01:48:06,759
<i>Amigo, turn around.</i>

1421
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:18,045
- Always the opposite.
- Ha, ha! That's right.
