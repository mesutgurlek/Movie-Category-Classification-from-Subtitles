for which Mr. Durant
is very well famous.

487

inspector needs to verify.

489
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:38,044
You seemed plenty confident in your track's
integrity yesterday, Mr. Huntington.

490
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:41,364
I can't imagine there'll be
a problem with it today,

491
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:43,015
or with your records.

492

Goddamn it!

493
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:50,707
Thomas, the fact is, and cannot change,

494
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:52,609
it will read about in the history books,

495
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,843
I beat you, sir.

I beat you to Ogden.

It's over, sir.

up to inspection, Collis.

Does that make you happy or sad?

511
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:53,922
The cost was high.

Well...

513
00:35:57,327 --> 00:36:00,261
You did the impossible,
the unimaginable.

514
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:03,531
Is any cost really too high?

you, Mr. Bohannon.

You think I'm scared?

531
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:06,728
You think I'll hand you Ogden to
avoid a government inspection.

532
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,498
Thomas, I won.

533
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:16,504
When those government inspectors
order you to rip up and rebuild

534
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,659
half the shoddy track you laid
either side of the 50 miles

535
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,694
you buttered up for Campbell,

536
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:25,647
it'll cost you a hell of
a lot more than Ogden.

537
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:29,968
And when those very same
inspectors look at your track,

half-spiked, half tied, held
together with a prayer,

they're gonna ask some
very tough questions,

540
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:38,426
including what the hell have
you done with all their money?

541
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,697
You'll land in jail over this.

542
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:46,113
I've been there before, Collis.
I'm willing to go back.

Are you?

544
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,675
You're mad.

545
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:57,579
Good night, Collis.

546
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,564
I'll give you half a million dollars.

547
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:01,266
I don't want the money.

548
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:02,834
Three-quarters of a million dollar.

549
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:04,369
Enjoy the festivities.

550
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,454
Oh, for Christ's sake, take it!

551
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,390
Take Ogden.

552
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:13,692
If that will end this,
Thomas, by all means,

553

take it.

00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:24,055
And I keep all the government bonds.

00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,840
All two and a half
million dollars' worth.

It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Collis.
