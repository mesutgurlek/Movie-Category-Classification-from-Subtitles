I met him in Texas.

323

And I just --
I just fell in love with him.

324

After we were married,
he told me his secret.

325
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:08,100
Why not make a deal
with the feds,

326

of Witness Protection?

[ Scoffs ]
Ray didn't trust the FBI.

328
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:17,242
We just wanted a normal life.

329
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,177
We bought this ranch
and the horses

330
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,679
four years ago to blend in.

331
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,381
So all this is a cover.

Paid cash,
everything in your name

333
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:27,819
so Ray couldn't
leave a paper trail.

00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,755
Yeah.

335

I guess we were just
kidding ourselves.

You can't hide
from the Depanzo family forever.

I don't know what to believe.

or they drove Ray
to kill himself.

Ray said don't trust the police,
no matter what.

346
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:00,786
No, he said the mob
owns the cops.

You think I'm with the mob?

you arrested her?

all of us look bad.

Look, once I got upstairs
to the office,

I had every intention
of filling you in

excited to be the one looking

into a possible organized-crime
connection to this case.

387

The paper didn't say anything
about organized crime.

Must be the first time the press
didn't get the whole story.
