Go home...

170
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:58,325
Grieve with your mother,
find some comfort in that.

171
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,926
You're miserable here.

172
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,629
And I'm making you miserable too.

173
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,153
I'll wire you if I discover anything.

174
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,107
Write me letters...

175
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:17,661
Not too rude, in case mother opens them.

176
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:21,448
What is it?

177
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:27,819
[Sniffs] It's harder for you to leave
Durant than it is to leave me.

178
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,758
But... go.

179
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:45,055
I know you pray for me...

180
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:48,141
F-for us, and, uh,
I think your prayers have been answered.

181
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,976
I just got the money
for a piece of machinery

182
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:52,362
to get us over that mountain
and out of this place.

183
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:54,364
Few weeks,
we won't ever have to see Cheyenne

184
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,733
or the Wyoming territory again.

185
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,535
Or my family?

186
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:00,987
Will I ever see them again?

187
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,489
If you really wanted to, yeah.

188
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,991
I would really want to.

189
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,993
All right, then.

190
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,545
We'll take the train.

191
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,547
By then, I'll have my own private car.

192
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,549
Your car?

193
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,002
Will the baby and I be there?

194
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,838
That's what I meant.

195
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840

00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,033
It's me... Cullen.

200
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,701
Can you see me all right?

201
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:51,254
I see you in my path.

202

I am bear killer.

Yeah.

Yeah, I own that's true
from the looks of it.

00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:13,159
Huh?

Hey...

00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,230
I got me a wife.

211
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,065
Can you imagine that?

212
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,233
A son too.

- What'd I tell you?

214

but don't go riding into
Cheyenne like this.

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,848
I'm riding straight in.

222
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,484
Yeah, uh...

223
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,938
Yeah, we got a, uh, auction house.

224

Slave market?

225
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,110
Yeah. Why don't you
camp yourselves right here?

226
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,779
I'll come fetch you and the slaves

227
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,698
when the market opens.

228

That sound about right?

229
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:20,710
Mm-hmm.

Come on. This can't wait.

239
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,580
Leave the pot.

but I'll lose my seat!

Wait.

243
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,541
Something's happened to him.

244
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,326
I...

245
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:45,495
Something bad. He ain't right.

246
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:49,249
Well, take me to him.

247

Now, you listen to me, Eva.

248
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,170
He's right messed up, especially his mind.

249
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,671
I don't care.

250
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,113

What I'm saying is...

255
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,933
We got to be gentle, all right?

256

His... his... his remembering is wrong.

257

He don't seem to know me,
but he might know you.

- I can't believe he's back.
- He may not be back.

I'm going home to Boston.

This train doesn't go to Boston.

I have to ask you something.

269
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:05,837
Why are people saying
you had something to do

270
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,389
with father's disappearance?

271

People don't think that.

272

Yes.

heavily in Union Pacific bonds.

I take the blame.

313

I couldn't.

317

No.

in my railroad dreams?

Will I regret that for the rest of my life?

Absolutely.

00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:09,303
Is there trouble?

339
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:13,708
I'll go and check on it, and you stay here.

340
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,579
What I hear bid for these slaves?

341
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,414
Huh?

342
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,083
It's a good breed.

343
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:23,801
Can we handle the merchandise?

344
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,252
[Laughter]

345
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:27,421
They breed good.

346
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,590
Why don't you take your
drunk ass and go home,

347
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,176
you black man? [Crowd gasps]

348
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,928
Somebody put a stop to this!

349
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,597
I need to hear a bid.

350
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,182
Somebody give me a bid!

351
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,433
Shit!

352
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:41,102
- Wait right here.
- Come on!

353
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,821
This a good breed right here.
They make good babies.

354
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:46,190
They work hard.

355
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,777
Sunup to sundown, they work hard.

356
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:53,280
Once you separate the
negro from his prisoners

357
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:56,834
and he refuses to surrender, kill him.

358
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,252
What's your plan?

359
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,007
Separate the negro from the women.

360
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,459
If he should refuse,
then we'll have no choice, but...

361
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:06,961
Now, hold on. I don't think that's the way.

362
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:08,462
We don't even know what's going on.

363
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:09,797
Never hand me again.

364
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:16,020
There will be no trade in
human commerce in my town...

365
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:19,140
Neither involving squaw, white women,

366
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,858
nor addled negro.

367
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,309
All right, now, he ain't done nothing.

368
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:24,879
Contrarily, he's stated his intent

369
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,480
at the most heinous of crimes,

370
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:28,866
and he is guilty of
kidnapping at the least.

371
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,035
Look at him. He's a
danger to public safety.

372
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,238
[Shouting indistinctly]

373
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:37,074
Mr. Campbell...

374
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,493
You're a veteran.

375
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:44,048
You know what violence can do to a man.

376
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,500
Mainly to the weak-minded

377
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:49,503
and predisposed to violence.

378
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,256
The negro is an inferior race,

379
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:55,059
but human nonetheless.

380
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:59,513
That is why we fought your war,
Mr. Bohannon.

381
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:03,350
The emancipation proclamation,

382
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:05,269
the constitution...

383
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,354
Those are his rights.

384
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:09,273
He ain't in his mind.

385
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:11,525
He'll fight you if he's cornered.

386
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,528
Then that is his choice.

387
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,748
Field the perimeter when he makes a run.

388
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:22,888
That man right there...

389
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,878
That's my friend.

390
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,933
Okay.

391
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,553
You have 15 minutes to solve this charade.

392
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,072
Hey. What the hell is this?

393
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,907
Your stop.

394
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,077
This ain't no stop!

395
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,411
Hey, what are you doing?

396
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,664
Get your... get your hands off me!

397

[Grunts]

398
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,586
You're a dead man!

399
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:15,089
Do you... you know who I am?

400
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:16,590
Do you know who I am?

401
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,675
I do.

402
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,593
[Grunts]

403
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,929
How did Mrs. Delaney get on the train?

404
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,930
We didn't see her, Mr. Durant.

405
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:26,150
[Whimpers]

406
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:29,436
Straight to Cheyenne after this.

407
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:32,072
[Both grunting]

408
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,278
Look at her. She breed good for you!

409
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,890
- Gone crazy.
- She got everything you want.

410
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:18,662
She breed good and get you good business.

411

- What you gonna do?
- Get over here.

[Whimpers]

00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,823
Look at her.

414
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:26,196
I'm gonna retell him who he is.

- Elam?

Elam!

Look hard at my face, all right?

419
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:40,202
Cullen Bohannon.

420
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,420
I hear of you.

421
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,789
[Softly] Yeah.

422
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,842
[Normal voice] We been friends a long time.

423
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,044
You got some slaves to sell?

424
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:52,214
That there one of yours?

425
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,885
This ain't a slave market.

426
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,755
This ain't Charleston, new Orleans neither.

427
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,258
This is Cheyenne.

428
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,394
You even know where you are?

[Crowd gasps]

430
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,123
You trying to fool me?

431
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,074
No.

432
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:22,912
I'm trying to save your damn life.

433
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,419
Come on.

434
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,588
Y'all get on home!

435
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,723
This ain't a damn show.

436
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,225
Elam: Prime, healthy.
It ain't gonna cost you a lot.

437
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,260
- Beat it, kid.
- Elam: Come here!

438
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,145
- Mr. Campbell.
- Elam: Look at her! This one...

439
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:41,931
Get!

440
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,402
You've left Mr. Bohannon to
defuse this situation alone?

441
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,487
Interesting to watch Mr. Bohannon

442
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:51,657
confront the monster of his own creation.

443
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,992
- Interesting?
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:55,277
Those women's lives are at risk.

445
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,946
I'm well aware.

446
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,782
I've ordered my men not to spook the negro.

447
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:05,504
His name is Elam Ferguson,
an honorable man.

448
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:06,789
At least I've known him to be.
Elam: Come on!

449
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,458
Get your head up!

450
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,794
Act like you got some dignity!

451
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,429
You trying to be uppity on me?

452
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,964
You trying to be an uppity negro?

453
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,182
Nothing in his past will save him

454
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:20,636
from his fate today.

455
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,805
And killing a negro makes
you a little more formidable,

456
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,107
doesn't it?

457
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:28,043
Elam: They work hard.

458
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:31,146
Those women's lives are at risk.

459
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:34,316
We are in agreement on that, are we not?

460
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:38,320
Elam: I need to hear a
bid for these slaves now.

461
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:40,990
They're worth more than that.

462
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,326
Just keep in mind,
you'd be walking into five drawn guns.

463
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,461
Come on, now.

464
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,212
Do I hear a bid for these women?

465
00:27:47,214 --> 00:27:48,464
Get up. Look at me. Good lord.

466
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,666
Look at them. Show your face.

467
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,836
- What do you do? What do you do?
- Elam!

468
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:56,672
My brother.

[Both laughing]

470
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,729
Oh, I knew you'd know me.

471
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:06,181
Mm-hmm. Heard you was back, huh?

472
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,901
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

473
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:12,488
You about finished here?

474
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,273
I need... I need you to
get something for me.

475
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,607
Anything.

476
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,192
Run to the big house and tell mamma

477
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:18,694
to get me something for my head.

478
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,912
It's starting to hurt.

479
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,197
- Go ahead and run.
- Sure, Elam.

480
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,583
She most likely in the
kitchen right about now.

481
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,502
Now go on ahead.

482
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,536
Why don't you come with me, huh?

483
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,171
Be faster.

484
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:31,206
No, shoot, man.

485
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,374
You know what'd happen
if the missus catch me

486
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,676
round the big house.

487
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,210
Now go on.

488
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:36,879
Come on, I got business.

489
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,213
Elam.

490
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,849
God, please listen to me.

491
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:43,052
The men here gonna kill you
you try to sell these women.

492
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,554
I know.

493
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,973
They gonna try.

494
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,359
Something they don't know...

495
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,195
Can't nobody kill me, mo.

496
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:54,730
Nobody.

497
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,066
What's my name?

498
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:01,036
Moses Then.

Go. Come on.

Time's up.

00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:23,726
Elam, Elam!
