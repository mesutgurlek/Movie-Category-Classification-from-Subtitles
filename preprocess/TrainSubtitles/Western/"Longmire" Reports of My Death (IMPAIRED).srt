00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,094
It is my fault Hector is dead.

2
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:20,031
I am the one who asked him
to help with Miller Beck.

3
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:24,235
Hector's dead because
David Ridges killed him.

4
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,542
So Nighthorse lied?

5
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,178
David is alive?

6
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,782
I think Nighthorse sent his former employee

7
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,017
to kill the only man who
could prove you're innocent.

8
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:42,220
Branch and I tried to talk to him,

9
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,322
but we didn't get very far.

10
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:46,958
Turns out he's hired Malachi Strand

11
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,693
as his new head of security.

12
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:49,794
Funny.

13
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,328
Malachi did not mention that

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,098
when he came in yesterday
and offered to buy my bar.

This whole thing's starting
to feel like a conspiracy.

17
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,472
I just need to find a way

18
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:04,674
to get at Malachi and Nighthorse.

19
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:06,777
Figure out what they have planned.

20
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:09,479
I know of one guy who
is working for Malachi.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,416
When Malachi was in prison, the man was...

22
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:17,521
staking out my bar, saving Malachi's seat.

23
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:20,523
This man tell you his name?

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,695
He comes back, you call me.

25
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:27,063
We'll track him down.

40

back to the station without making a scene.

Okay.

Uh, he's not drunk.

44
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,224
Of course he's drunk.

Uh, t-this bum? Are you serious?

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,313
According to his I.D.,
this is Welles Vanblarcom.

68
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,848
As in Vanblarcom mining?

69
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,618
Didn't his mom die like eight years ago

70
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,954
and leave him a bunch of cash in her will?

71
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,088
Yep.

72
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,923
He's been missing for 30 years.

73
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:03,159
Most people figured he was dead, so...

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,695
Which...

75
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:06,829
he is.

76
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,698
My God, I read all about this.

77
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,900
It was all over the news, even in Philly.

78
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,103
Which is why none of you
can say a word about this.

79
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,539
This is national news.

80
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,110
We need to notify the
Vanblarcoms and make an I.D.

81
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,745
Before the press gets any wind of it.

82
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,914
Are we gonna bring the
family into the station?

83
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,917
No, if they show up
here or at the hospital,

84
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,719
people will start asking questions.

No.

86
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,489
We take the body to them.

87
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:37,193
So...

88
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,763

They're attached with hex bolts.

I need a special wrench to take them down.

Come back at 5:00.

So, it looks like Welles
Vanblarcom didn't have much family.

100
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,930
Just a brother, a sister, and a nephew.

101
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:17,767
Their combined net worth was $500 million.

102
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:20,870

even get that much money?

Are you sure it's him?

Well, we found an I.D. And

Both match your brother's.

him before it's official.

I don't know how much help we'll be.

I-I suppose it's him.

Yeah.

What sketch?

130
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,545
Eight years ago, when our mother died

131
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:40,249
and left Welles' inheritance,
we had this sketch made.

132

Graham: It's a projection of
what Welles would've looked like

30 years after this picture was taken.

134

showed up with anything.

a few miles from his childhood home.

Maybe he was trying to come home finally.

Wish he would've come back a lot sooner.

143

Would've meant a lot to our mother.

She never stopped hoping
that he'd come back.

She even left money in
her will to maintain them.

151
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,381
She left all sorts of provisions

for us to keep this place like a shrine.

153

But the birds, they were her pets.

I know she would want Welles'
body buried in the family plot.

168
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,903
The bar sink is broken.
The heads are on the table.

169
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:07,606
You sure this is everything?

170
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,152
I don't want to have to come back.

171
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,557
A sentiment we both share.

172
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,285
[inhales sharply]

173
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:23,388
[grunts]

174
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,294
[grunts]

175
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,787
I never thought of you
as the garden party type,

176
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,393
but you seemed real comfortable

177
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:43,823
with the monopoly twins back there,

178
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,045
especially Penny.

179
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,681
My dad looked after their stables.

180
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,683
I'd go in sometimes.

181
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:52,399
Penny would come down to sketch
the horses while we worked.

182
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,521
Sketch the horses?

183
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,857
[chuckling] Sounds like
she had a crush on you.

184
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,891
[laughs]

185
00:08:57,892 --> 00:08:59,626
What were you like at 12?

186
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,335
Chatty, I bet, right?

187
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,963
[chuckles]

188
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:09,485
Sheriff, how long ago did
the Vanblarcom heir die?

189
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,387
Had he been in Wyoming
this whole time, Sheriff?

190
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:14,223
Sheriff, are you getting any
sort of reward from the family?

191
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,524
No comment.

192
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,228
Ferg: Nothing. I got nothing.
If you hit conference call...

193
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,963
We tried calling Vic to warn you.

194
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:22,698
Oh, the phones got overloaded.

195
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:23,966
Calls from the reporters,

196
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,502
and now the whole system has shut down.

197
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:28,804
Ferg, keep an eye on the door.

198
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:32,775
Branch: So, the missing
Vanblarcom heir finally showed up?

199
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:33,976
Where you been?

200
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,711
Working.

201
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:39,415
Got that transcript from
Malachi's parole hearing.

202
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,683
Also talked with my friend

203
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:42,385
who works with the county assayer.

204
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:44,787
He's got maps of all the caves
near where we found Hector.

205
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:47,423
I figured we'd pick him
up, head over to the caves,

206
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:48,958
start looking for Ridges.

207
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,694
[sighs] I got my hands full here.

208
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:52,995
You go.

209
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:55,531
As soon as things die down, I'll join you.

210
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:56,999
Hey, you know, I can go with Branch

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
till you can catch up.

212
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,602
I'm fine on my own.

213
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,103
Walt: Take her.

214
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,339
[door opens]

215
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,107
[sighs]

216
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:12,648
Henry.

217
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:21,457
[ringing]

218
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,069
Henry: It is a beautiful day at
the Red Pony and continual soiree.

219
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,496
No one is able to come to the
phone, so please leave a message.

220
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:28,064
[beep]

221
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:29,832
Not much of a soiree, Henry. I'm outside.

222
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,834
The door is locked, and we had a meeting,

223
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:34,670
so call me, please.

224
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,652
[camera shutter clicking]

225
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:01,964
[camera shutter clicking]

226
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,737
[banging]

227
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,973
[grunts]

228
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,310
[glass shatters]

229
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,782
[grunting]

230
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,773
Shit.

231
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:46,409
- Ruby.
- Ruby: Hmm?

232
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,477
Ferg and I are heading to Durant Memorial.

233
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,946
The autopsy shows that Welles
died of a drug overdose.

234
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:51,987
Seems like you've got

235
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:54,317
quite the crowd out there, Longfinger.

236
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,786
You came by early to talk.

237
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,988
We're ready to talk.

238
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:03,793
We found these cameras this
afternoon that were hidden

239
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:06,862
outside my office and
at the construction site.

240
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:09,332
We thought you might like them back.

241
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,034
What makes you think they belong to me?

242
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,969
Well, seems you've taken a keen interest

243
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,339
in, uh, Mr. Nighthorse's activities.

244
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,307
See, I have a habit of getting a warrant

245
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,509
before I plant any
surveillance equipment, so...

246
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,613
There's only one store in
town that sells these cameras.

247
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:28,317
Last week, a man came in
and bought a whole bunch.

248
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:32,888
Name on the receipt was, uh...

249
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,457
Branch Connally.

250
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,810
I'm gonna need to talk to your Deputy.

251
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,964
He's busy.

252
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:44,733
Uh-huh.

253
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:49,739
[door opens]

254
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,440
You might want to reevaluate

255
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,276
some of your employees, Walt.

256
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:56,912
You're only as good as the people you hire.

257
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:58,481
[chuckles]

258
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,983
[door closes]

259
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:03,018
Ferg.

260
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,354
Get Branch on your cellphone.

261
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,355
- Now!
- [door opens]

262
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:07,556
Ruby: Hey. Please.

263
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:09,291
I told you all to wait in the foyer.

264
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,559
You haven't told me anything.

265
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,994
Who are you?

266
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,929
Welles Vanblarcom,

267
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,099
and reports of my death
are greatly exaggerated.

268
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,859
Walt: I'll admit you look
somewhat like this police sketch,

269
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,928
but if I'm gonna believe you're Welles,

270
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:28,871
I'll need to see some proof.

271
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,639
My word's not good enough for you?

272
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,642
Not when the man we found
had two forms of I.D. saying

273
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:35,511
he was Welles Vanblarcom, no.

274
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:36,745
I gave those to him.

275
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,514
I got sick of people trying to find me.

276
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:39,915
I don't even go by Welles anymore.

277
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,683
Everyone just calls me John.

278
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:42,851
John.

279
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,520
Were you and the dead man close?

280
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,589
I just met him at a bar
one night in Cleveland.

281
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,857
He looked a little like me.

282
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,559
I thought, "if I give him my I.D.,

283
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,127
I could disappear for good."

284
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:54,429
How do I know you're not just some imposter

285
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,698
trying to lay claim to
the Vanblarcom inheritance?

286
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,600
Because I don't want anything from them.

287
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,237
Money messes people up.

288
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:05,140
I just came here because I
want that man's real family

289
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:06,175
to know he's dead.

290
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,209
Can you give me his name?

291
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,283
No. But you're a cop.

292
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:10,692
I'm sure you have ways of figuring it out.

293
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:11,713
I do.

294
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,515
But before I start looking into it,

295
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,517
I need to be sure that you are who you say.

296
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,153
Now, the fastest way to
prove you're Welles is

297
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,154
to do a DNA test.

298
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,622
Not a chance.

299
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:22,791
I've spent decades trying
to keep myself hidden.

300
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,227
I take a DNA test, and I
got the press all over me.

301
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:26,595
Okay.

302
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:28,797
Let's go see your brother and sister, then.

303
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:30,165
They might be able to identify you.

304
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,266
They're strangers to me,

305
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,634
and I prefer to keep it that way.

306
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:35,637
I know my rights. You can't hold me here.

307
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,239
Maybe not.

308
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,540
But I can tell those reporters

309
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,175
that you're the real Welles Vanblarcom,

310
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:42,444
and you'll never have
another moment's privacy.

311
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:47,082
Or we could just take a
ride and talk to your family.

312
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,185
Hypothetical question.

313
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:52,788
Um, say a client that you
represent was released on bail

314
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:55,457
and he's not exactly
where he's supposed to be.

315
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,826
Henry bolted, didn't he?

316
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,561
Maybe. You need to find him

317
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:01,555
before the monitoring
company realizes he's gone.

318
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:05,267
Otherwise, all that bail
money is out the window, okay,

319
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,202
and he's in jail every
day up until the trial.

320
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,570
That... that can't happen

321
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,107
because he barely made
it out alive last time.

322
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,175
Maybe I should call my dad.

323
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,743
<i>No, no, no. Bad idea.</i>

324
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:17,312
Listen, you're protected by
attorney-client privilege, okay,

325
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:20,258
but anyone else you tell is
required by law to reveal it,

326
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,650
or they could face jail time.

327
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,546
<i>[sighs] And you really
shouldn't even be telling me this</i>

328
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:28,390
unless you're trying to bring
me officially onboard the case.

329
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,626
[chuckles] Can't afford you.

330
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:34,563
So tell me, where would I
find Henry if he were missing?

331
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:36,498
<i>Hypothetically. [chuckles]</i>

332
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,667
[birds chirping, squawking]

333
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:45,874
Look up.

334
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,477
Hello. I'm Penelope.

335
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,413
I guess I'm your brother.

336
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,415
[scoffs]

337
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,651
Given our family's wealth,

338
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:59,421
you can understand why
we might be skeptical.

339
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:02,424
Perhaps you could answer
a few questions, like...

340
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,792
where were you born?

341
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,428
In a hospital, I imagine.

342
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:07,763
Cut that out.

343
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:10,432
What was our mom's full name?

344
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,335
Mother?

345
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:14,670
What was my nickname?

346
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:17,772
Welles was the only
one who called me by it.

347
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:22,344
How dare you?

348
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:23,679
You're not our brother.

349
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,715
Fine, I'm not your brother.

350
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:29,351
But I'm telling you the guy
in the morgue isn't, either.

351
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:31,620
[camera shutter clicks] Hey.

352
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,121
[cellphone chimes]
You're not tweeting that.

353
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,023
Hey, man.

354
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:39,861
Hey!

355
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,363
Hey, where are you going?

356
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,764
Far from here.

357
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:46,435
Look, all I wanted was to
do right by that poor man.

358
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:48,337
- So if you'll just excuse me...
- Look.

359
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,772
Whether you're Welles or not,
I got a dead man in the morgue,

360
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,342
and so far, you're the only
person who knows who he is.

361
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:55,243
You're staying till this thing is settled.

362
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:56,958
Where? In your jail cell?
Are you arresting me?

363
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,613
No.

364
00:16:58,614 --> 00:17:01,550
No, there's, uh, too many
reporters at the station.

365
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:02,551
I know a place.

366
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:03,819
It's not a hotel.

367
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,189
There's a couch you could sleep on.

368
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,658
Just nothing fancy.

369
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,827
[bird cries]

370
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,539
Okay, that's the last one.

371
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,676
[grunts]

372
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:35,484
Looks like we're live.

373
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,386
It's fancy.

374
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:40,555
I didn't know the department
had money for gear like this.

375
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:42,357
They don't. I bought them.

376
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:43,759
[sighs]

377
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,092
Cameras will switch on if
anybody comes through here.

378
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,930
[sniffs]

379
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:51,165
Better find a campsite.

380
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,201
I'm sorry. A campsite?

381
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:54,403
We're gonna sleep out here?

382
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,671
Who said anything about sleep?

383
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,774
You got to sleep sometime.

384
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,208
What are you doing out here, Vic?

385
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,376
I said I was fine on my own.

386
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:03,045
Go back. Take my truck if you want.

387
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,822
I don't feel very comfortable
leaving you out here

388
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:06,261
when there's a murderer on the loose.

389
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,955
Especially one that is so
hell-bent on killing you.

390
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:10,618
[sighs]

391
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:15,423
There's some extra gear in there.

392
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,294
Did the tox screen show

393
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:20,595
what kind of drug he overdosed on?

394
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,130
It was an opiate of some kind,

395
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,433
but it was too pure to be heroin, so...

396
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:25,700
[cellphone beeping]

397
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,402
...we're running some further tests.

398
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,070
Excuse me.

399
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,640
[rattling]

400
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:38,747
Walt: So, someone else
is claiming to be you.

401
00:18:38,748 --> 00:18:40,782
I'm not sure if I believe him,

402
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,818
but says you died of a drug overdose.

403
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:50,425
[sighs]

404
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:55,506
I don't see any track marks on your arms.

405
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,336
How is it you can disappear for decades...

406
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:04,539
and show up a few miles from home

407
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,608
right in front of my station?

408
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,477
Where were you before?

409
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,351
Bryant: Thought you'd be
working the Vanblarcom case.

410
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:18,453
Hobnobbing with millionaires,

411
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:21,189
not hanging out with the homeless.

412
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,724
I'm doing both.

413
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:25,193
Has the high school donated
any clothes recently?

414
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:27,195
Yeah, every summer, we get

415
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:30,832
all their unsold sweatshirts
and jerseys and socks.

416
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,701
[chuckles] You name it.

417
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,369
Thought these looked familiar.

418
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,637
I wore the same colors

419
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,839
when I played football for the team.

420
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,809
Bryant.

421
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,278
You remember giving
these socks to this man?

422
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,447
Yeah, I remember him.

423
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:49,384
He came in... a few
days ago with his friend.

424
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,553
Which friend?

425
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,490
You mind if I sit, Sergeant?

426
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:05,300
I want to ask you some questions

427
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:08,470
about the man you came
into the shelter with.

428
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:09,838
Oh, you mean Welles?

429
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,406
You two are friends?

430
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:13,375
Sort of.

431
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:16,278
Met him in Cleveland a while back.

432
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,681
He's a nice guy, but
when you're on the street,

433
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:22,918
it's really easy for a guy
like him to get hurt, you know?

434
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,854
So started looking out for him.

435
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:27,689
You're a long way from Cleveland.

436
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,823
[chuckles]

437
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:30,325
What brought you two out here?

438
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:32,928
Welles just found out
he came into some money.

439
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,731
Said he'd cut me in on it
if I made the trip with him.

440
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:41,534
I said okay, but I don't
know how much I believe him.

441
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,838
Guy's kind of schizo.

442
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,241
He ever tell you anything about his family?

443
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,509
No.

444
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,082
I asked him about them once, but...

445
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:51,346
he got real dark,

446
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,616
started screaming some
gibberish about his mom.

447
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:57,419
Got the feeling something
bad happened between them.

448
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,388
Well, considering his drug habit,

449
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:03,309
family might've found him hard to handle.

450
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,395
Uh, Welles never did drugs.

451
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,598
Hell, that was part of his problem.

452
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,166
Wouldn't even take the crazy meds

453
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,281
the, uh, the shrinks gave him.

454
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,338
Is Welles in some kind of trouble?

455
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,940
You're the second person
to ask me about him.

456
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,342
Who's the first?

457
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:24,246
Some private investigator
came around two days ago,

458
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,813
asking if I'd seen Welles.

459
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:29,317
Was a... a big guy.

460
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:31,886
Have a birthmark on the side of his face?

461
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,355
Yeah.

462
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,724
Anyway, I told him, uh, told him I...

463
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:38,627
I hadn't seen Welles in a few days.

464
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:42,397
Woke up two mornings
ago and... was just gone.

465
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,368
Thanks.

466
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:51,439
Welles is... dead, isn't he?

467
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,342
Drug overdose.

468
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,478
Then somebody killed him.

469
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,682
Looks that way.

470
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:06,082
What, you come here to gloat? [chuckles]

471
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,151
I searched for Welles Vanblarcom for years.

472
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,620
He turns up dead on your doorstep.

473
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,121
When did you first
start looking for Welles?

474
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,523
Eight years back.

475
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:16,959
Family hired me along with a bunch
of other agencies around the country.

476
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,628
We didn't have much to go on, though.

477
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:23,866
Just this sketch showing
what he would've looked like

478
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,935
30 years later.

479
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,440
I was given a different
sketch by the family.

480
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:32,664
Well, it's not uncommon

481
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:34,010
to have a few composites drawn up.

482
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:35,711
The family probably gave different sketches

483
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:37,079
to different investigators.

484
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,715
I looked for Welles for
about a year and a half.

485
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:41,180
Tracked him all the way to Cleveland,

486
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:42,718
but then the trail went cold.

487
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:46,722
The family was only paying
me for travel and food,

488
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,533
so I wasn't make enough money

489
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,359
and, you know, had to call it quits.

490
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,562
Ah.

491
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:55,665
So, why were you looking for him
two days ago at the homeless shelter?

492
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,701
[chuckles] Well, you know how it is, Walt.

493
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:01,637
It's hard to give up on
the cases you don't solve.

494
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:04,740
I pursued Welles for so
long, and then the other day,

495
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:07,476
I see a guy looks just like my sketch.

496
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,712
I really thought I'd seen him.

497
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:11,914
Apparently, I did.

498
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,584
Mind if I keep this?

499
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:16,018
Sure.

500
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,988
And hey, congrats.

501
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:20,590
I'm just glad to see

502
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:23,025
a local boy get that big
bonus from the family.

503
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,761
Well, Sheriff's Department
doesn't get rewards

504
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,163
for doing its job.

[cellphone beeps]

508
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:45,548
Cady, I am sorry I did not pick up earlier.

509
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,850
<i>Dead battery. I just charged
it and saw you called.</i>

510
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:49,852
37 times. Where are you?

511
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,121
<i>There was something urgent
I needed to take care of.</i>

512
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:53,856
No, you can't just take off, Henry.

513
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:56,025
When something comes
up, you ask me for help.

514
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:56,792
You ask my dad.

515
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:58,928
Cady, I am tired of everybody else

516
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,429
doing things for me.

517
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,598
I need to take matters into my own hands.

518
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:05,901
A good man is dead now because of me.

519
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,771
I'm sorry.

520
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:12,608
I can't imagine how
hard that must be, but...

521
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:15,679
there are a lot of people here
that care about what happens to you.

522
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:18,614
<i>None of us wants to see you back in prison.</i>

523
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:21,417
I am sorry. I will come back now.

524
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,185
See you soon.

Sorry, Sheriff. I didn't know it was you.

534
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,033
The caller I.D. Said "Vanblarcom."

535
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:04,136
I confiscated a phone
from Carter Vanblarcom.

536
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,770
How's my house guest?

537
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,674
[scoffs] Snoring.

538
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,609
You find out anything new about our victim?

539
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,977
Well, I'm not sure

540
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,046
if he's a dead heir or a dead imposter.

541
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:15,881
Either way, it looks like he was murdered.

542
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,216
Really? By who?

543
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,652
I'm having trouble finding
anyone that knew him.

544
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,588
He had one buddy at the homeless shelter,

545
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,523
and there's a Private Investigator

546
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,757
who thinks he saw him.

547
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,492
Other than that,

548
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,808
the only person who seems to have met
the victim is sleeping in my house.

549
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:41,707
What if this John guy
really is Welles Vanblarcom?

550
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,509
I mean, maybe the dead guy
tried to blackmail him...

551
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,813
You know, threaten to expose
him if he didn't pay up.

552
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,949
John could've killed our victim

553
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,518
and then made up this story
about swapping identities

554
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,853
to cover his tracks.

555
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,154
You're getting the idea.

556
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,523
You're babysitting a murder suspect.

557
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,992
Keep your eyes open.

558
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,527
On it.

Whew.

563
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,909
Good morning. Uh, good evening.

00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:26,460
- You're here late.
- Yep.

566
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,640
You know the phones are back up.

567
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:31,380
I wanted to be sure I've got
all these messages written down

568
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,814
before I went home.

569
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:34,383
Where are all the reporters?

570
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,752
Well, some of them are probably drinking.

571
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:37,953
[chuckles]

572
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:39,121
Some are sleeping,

573
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:40,989
and some are posting their articles.

574
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,925
Ruby, if you'd been given this sketch,

575
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:48,096
would you have known to follow our victim?

576
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,931
Probably not.

577
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:51,833
They don't look all that similar.

578
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,069
What about this one?

579
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:58,740
That looks just like him.

580
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,008
Okay.

581
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,752
Now that the phones are working again,

582
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,378
would you mind calling the phone company?

583
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:05,280
Have them pull the records on Fred Tavish.

584
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,416
- That's that Private Investigator?
- Yeah.

585
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,285
Uh, and in the morning,
call Durant Financial.

586
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:11,953
I want to take a look at his bank records.

587
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:13,688
Okay, Walt.

588
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,232
Hello, Deena.

589
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:27,035
Oh, my God. I-I can't believe this.

590
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,036
Come in.

[door closes]

00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:31,673
Hi, baby.

593
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:33,475
I tried calling you.
When I didn't hear back,

594
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:35,444
I thought maybe you
were angry or something.

595
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,781
Deena, just... just stop for a second.

596
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:41,850
I do not know if you heard,

597
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:44,252
but I spent a little time in jail.

598
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:45,987
What?

599
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:47,355
Henry, what did you...

600
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:52,327
Being there... gave me
a lot of time to think

601
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:56,431
about what is really important to me.

602
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:59,768
So, Deena...

603
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:03,104
I have a question for you.

604
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:09,911
Oh.

605
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,279
Oh, my God.

606
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,447
Deena...

607
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:15,450
where the hell is my $40,000?

608
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:17,919
You're just cruel.

609
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
And stealing from me was not?!

610
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,356
- Betraying me again?!
- [screams]

611
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:23,692
Get out! Now!

[cries]

613
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:28,830
You were the only other person

614
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:30,165
who had the combination to my safe.

615
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,101
Ow!

616
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,804
Are you sleeping with
that guy who just left?

617
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:38,640
[laughs]

618
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:42,143
Darius? Oh, please.

619
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:45,347
What? You want to hurt me?

620
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,816
Do you want to hit me?

621
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:49,217
Go ahead!

622
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:50,352
Aah!

623
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:54,022
I would not hit you.

624
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,258
But if you do not tell
me why you did this to me,

625
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:59,227
I will not be the only
one of us going to prison.

626
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,665
You're hurting me.

627
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,200
[screams]

628
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,201
Son of a...

629
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,136
Deena: Oh!

630
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,405
<i>- I am hurting you?
- Yes!</i>

631
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:12,841
Forget about the fact that
I cannot afford a lawyer

632
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:14,910
or that I cannot pay my own bail!

633
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:17,913
How do you think I feel knowing
that the woman I love stole from me?!

634
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:20,582
That wasn't part of the deal!

635
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,754
What deal?

636
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,690
I got... I got into money trouble.

637
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:34,462
The kind of trouble
that you leave town for.

638
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:37,866
And I...

639
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,467
I met Darius at a 9-ball tournament

640
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:40,869
at backseat billiards,

641
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,207
and he offered to... help get me right.

642
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,042
In exchange for a favor?

643
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,177
Not that kind of favor.

644
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,316
He just asked me to get in contact with you

645
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:57,485
and just keep tabs on the
business at the Red Pony,

646
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:58,613
<i>and that's it.</i>

647
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,956
And he asked you to steal from me?

648
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:04,025
Baby, he didn't ask.

649
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,261
[whimpering]

650
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,500
[voice breaking] I didn't
mean to hurt you, Henry.

651
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,369
[Crying]

652
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,443
He didn't give me any choice.

653
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,246
There is always a choice, Deena.

654
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:27,548
In this case, we both
just made the wrong one.

655
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:35,257
Where's my Deputy?

656
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:37,826
Inside. Hiding all the knives.

657
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:39,794
[chuckles]

658
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,196
What did you tell him?

659
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:44,198
That you're a murder suspect.

660
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:54,242
This is a nice life you got.

661
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:58,746
If I had had this, I
wouldn't have needed to leave.

662
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,385
You still don't believe me?

663
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:06,288
You haven't done much to convince me, so...

664
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,458
I don't really care whether
you believe me or not, Wally.

665
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,929
That's what your dad used to call you.

666
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,999
Wally. Right?

667
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,267
I remember.

668
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:20,535
He used to bring you around

669
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:22,003
when he was working at the stables.

670
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,038
You're lucky.

671
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,039
Your dad worked.

672
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,373
He worked hard.

673
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:26,941
You work.

674
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:29,911
You appreciate the value
of things in your marrow.

675
00:31:29,912 --> 00:31:32,047
I needed to get away from my life

676
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:35,417
if I was ever gonna know that feeling.

677
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:39,754
You never felt the urge to come back?

678
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:42,256
Not even when your mother was sick?

679
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,961
I tried calling once.

680
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:50,332
But by that point...

681
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,201
her cancer was pretty advanced.

682
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,469
[sighs]

683
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,505
And she was so doped up on pain killers,

684
00:31:57,506 --> 00:32:00,408
she didn't even know who I was.

685
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:04,045
So...

686
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,414
I decided to stay off the grid.

687
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:10,785
But you were never really
off the grid, were you?

688
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:13,154
Took some money with you.

689
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:15,223
Well, I'm not stupid.

690
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,959
[chuckles]

691
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,261
You recognize this man?

692
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,303
Large amount of money was
deposited in his account

693
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:31,239
around the same time he
stopped looking for you.

694
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,440
He didn't get that money

695
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:34,409
from your brother and your sister.

696
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,811
Did you give it to him?
He found me in Cleveland.

697
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:40,315
I paid him to leave me
alone and keep quiet.

698
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:43,351
He definitely knows what you look like?

699
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:47,055
I'd say so.

700
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:49,123
Right.

701
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,101
I made breakfast.

702
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:59,804
Eggs.

703
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:01,839
No, thanks. I'll pass.

704
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,671
Again, if you want to head back...

705
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,578
No, it's fine.

706
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:11,849
I'll wait till Walt can get here.

707
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,753
You think I can't be out here on my own?

708
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:17,221
Really.

709
00:33:17,222 --> 00:33:20,191
I said it's okay.

710
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:22,660
What do you think I'm gonna do?

711
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:23,828
[sighs]

712
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:25,930
I don't know, Branch.

713
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:29,433
Kidnap a guy and force him to take peyote?

714
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,508
Travis tell you that?

715
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,949
So, you're not gonna deny it?

716
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,051
Okay.

717
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:50,021
Maybe now you understand
why I am not so excited

718
00:33:50,022 --> 00:33:52,223
to leave you out here alone.

719
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,794
You think I'm losing it.

720
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:59,794
But you have no idea what
it's like to know the truth

721
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:01,485
and not have anyone believe you.

722
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:02,300
[laughs]

723
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,602
The only way to prove that Ridges was alive

724
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:06,971
and that he shot me was
to break a couple of laws.

725
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:09,173
Travis and I didn't hurt that guy.

726
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,776
We just used the peyote
he already had on him.

727
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,811
And let's not forget I
was right about Ridges.

728
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:14,812
[scoffs]

729
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:15,947
Oh, come on!

730
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,622
We both work for a man

731
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,517
who doesn't stop until he has answers.

732
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,752
Don't you compare yourself to Walt!

733
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:22,987
Right.

734
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:26,090
I forgot you two have
a special relationship.

735
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:29,493
Listen.

736
00:34:29,494 --> 00:34:32,860
I'd understand if you
felt you had to tell Walt.

737
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:35,166
But this isn't about me
trying to save my job.

738
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,410
This is about me trying to
find the man who shot me,

739
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,538
who scalped and murdered Hector,

740
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,874
and, for all we know,
may be coming back for me.

741
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,978
So you do what you got to do.

742
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:51,849
But I'll tell you now...
my conscience is clear.

743
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,493
I got to pee.

744
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:07,067
<i>- [P.A. Dings]
- Can I help you.</i>

745
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:10,537
Walt Longmire to see Penny and Graham.

746
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,849
<i>One moment.</i>

747
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:15,409
[sighs]

748
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:21,948
[gate buzzes]

749
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:28,321
That's good.

750
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:34,395
I'll compare these samples
to the body at the morgue.

751
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:37,197
But the man I brought in
earlier is, uh, refusing

752
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:38,465
to submit to the tests.

753
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,200
Can't you make him?

754
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,343
I can't force a man to
inherit money he doesn't want.

755
00:35:42,344 --> 00:35:43,303
[door closes]

756
00:35:43,304 --> 00:35:46,039
A Mr. Tavish is here to see you.

757
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,409
<i>Fred? What are you doing here?</i>

758
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,310
I got your text.

759
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,021
"Fred, it's Penny. Come right over."

760
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:56,993
Actually, uh... that was me.

761
00:35:57,485 --> 00:35:58,685
These things are pretty handy.

762
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:01,559
[chuckles]

763
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,529
So, when was the last time you saw Fred?

764
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,298
Six, seven years ago, I guess.

765
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,466
Oh.

766
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,819
Well, you respond pretty fast

767
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,023
to people you're so out of touch with.

768
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,671
Well, they were good clients.

769
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,240
Uh-huh.

770
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:17,108
So, you didn't think you'd been called here

771
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:18,409
to receive a bonus?

772
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,768
Even though you already got one years ago

773
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:23,050
when you actually found Welles

774
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,683
and he paid you not to say anything.

775
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,318
You found Welles?

776
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:31,389
See, here's what I don't understand, Fred.

777
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,391
You knew what their brother looked like,

778
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:36,327
so why were you hunting down this guy?

779
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,208
Now, look, I...

780
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,372
He doesn't even look anything like

781
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:42,285
the sketch you were given eight years ago.

782
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:47,105
Unless you were working off this sketch.

783
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:49,607
How would I have gotten that?

784
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:52,143
From Penny and Graham.

785
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:53,411
Well, they just told you

786
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,613
I haven't talked to them in seven years.

787
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,382
According to your phone records,

788
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,117
you've had four calls from this house

789
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,551
in the past week.

790
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:05,690
Your drawing skills have
really gotten better, Penny.

791
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,692
I didn't know it was your work at first.

792
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,694
I thought it looked like a police sketch.

793
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:12,263
But the perspective was wrong.

794
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,132
Almost looked like a...

795
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,067
like an image from a security camera.

796
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,236
Like the one at your front gate.

797
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,537
[P.A. Dings]

798
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,439
The victim came to this house, didn't he?

799
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,175
His image was caught on the camera.

800
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:27,378
You drew it and gave it to Fred Tavish.

801
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,989
Penny: Yes, all... all right.

802
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,586
I gave Fred the sketch, but
that man was harassing us,

803
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:36,721
and I hired Fred to find
him and make him stop.

804
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,257
Why didn't you call me?

805
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:42,093
Is that what people do?

806
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,529
Well, people that don't
have something to hide.

807
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,865
[chuckles] I don't have anything to...

808
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:48,633
Why would I have something to hide?

809
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,435
Fred never found the man.

810
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:53,271
You were the one who found him dead.

811
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,106
And you identified him as your brother,

812
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,994
even though you knew he was an imposter.

813
00:37:56,995 --> 00:37:59,244
Ever since our mother passed,

814
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:01,512
we've been the victims of con artists.

815
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,690
I just... if I said he was my brother,

816
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,283
It would put an end to it.

817
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,885
I just wanted it all over with.

818
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:09,821
How badly did you want it to be over?

819
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:13,725
Enough to hire Fred to
find a man and kill him?

820
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:18,563
You told us it was an overdose.

821
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:21,833
So, how does an accidental overdose

822
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,801
of a homeless addict become murder?

823
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:27,305
It's murder when the
victim doesn't take drugs.

824
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,739
When the drugs in the
system are the same given

825
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,410
to cancer patients in pain

826
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,245
and the drug is an opiate,

827
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,482
It can be confused with
heroin in a tox screen.

828
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,768
My wife used it during
her cancer treatment.

829
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:44,222
I assume your mother used it during hers.

830
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:45,823
And seeing as how this, uh,

831
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,459
this place is preserved like a shrine,

832
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,395
I'll bet I can find it
in her medicine cabinets

833
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:51,462
when I search the house.

834
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,097
[scoffs]

835
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,133
You give those drugs to
Fred to kill that man?

836
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:57,135
- I didn't kill anybody!
- Fred, just sit down.

837
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:58,603
<i>- Fred, sit down.
- Penny called me.</i>

838
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:00,772
She said some bum came to their door,

839
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,240
claiming he was Welles.

840
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:03,510
She kicked him to the curb,

841
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,311
but then she realized
that she could use that guy

842
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:07,879
to get her hands on Welles' money.

843
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,282
So she decided to offer the
homeless man a million bucks

844
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:13,685
to sign paperwork saying that he was Welles

845
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,753
and forfeiting his inheritance.

846
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:18,423
Only problem was he wouldn't go for it.

847
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:20,325
The guy was convinced he really was Welles,

848
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,526
and he wanted all the money.

849
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,648
I thought that was that,

850
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:25,396
and then she came back in

851
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,332
and jammed the guy with a needle.

852
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,922
Penny told me I could still get paid

853
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:31,235
if I would dump the body
where it could be found.

854
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,804
That way, she could I.D. him later

855
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:35,406
and get Welles' money.

856
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,543
So, $50 million wasn't
enough for you, Penny?

857
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,878
You think it was about the money?

858
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,183
It was never about the money.

859
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:46,784
Our brother just took off.

860
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,421
Your brother just wanted to be left alone.

861
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:53,591
No, he abandon us.

862
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:59,263
He turned his back on
our family, on everything.

863
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,333
He knew how cruel our mother was,

864
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:03,200
and he left me to take care of her.

865
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,337
I nursed her.

866
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,773
I gave her, her medications.

867
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:13,111
I took care of her damn birds.

868
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:16,647
I gave up my life for that woman

869
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,183
[voice breaking] and he
got all her affection.

870
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,369
[sniffles]

871
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,324
He got double the money we did.

872
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:30,361
Just wasn't fair.

873
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:32,630
It's not fair to take your revenge

874
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,565
on an innocent man, either.

875
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,601
Penny.

876
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,015
[handcuffs click]

877
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:56,287
Thank you. I appreciate your understanding.

878
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,656
No problem. Take care of yourself.

879
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:09,500
You're lucky I was here to
stall him for half an hour.

880
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:10,835
I am also lucky that I could fit

881
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,303
through the window in my office.

882
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,662
It is more narrow than I recall.

883
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:14,872
Where were you?

884
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:18,976
You said that you were gonna be right back.

885
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,881
I need to talk to your father.

886
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,756
I have good news.

887
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:33,324
I broke up with Deena.

888
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,159
Deena came here?

889
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:39,096
I also managed to get a
picture of Malachi's guy.

890
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,437
Henry, this picture wasn't
taken at the Red Pony.

891
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:47,505
No, it was not.

892
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,140
Hey!

893
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:50,608
I'm your lawyer,

894
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,411
so you don't get to have
private conversations anymore.

895
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:54,745
What's going on?

896
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,883
His name is Darius. He works for Malachi.

897
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:01,152
I found out he blackmailed my ex-girlfriend

898
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:02,487
into stealing my money.

899
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:04,422
He approached her a couple of months ago

900
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:05,423
at Backseat Billiards.

901
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:07,758
Backseat billiards?

902
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,160
That's in Denver.

903
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:11,863
Yes.

904
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:16,317
Malachi Strand has people
working for him in Denver.

905
00:42:18,157 --> 00:42:21,258
Is this the guy that had mom killed?

906
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:30,650
