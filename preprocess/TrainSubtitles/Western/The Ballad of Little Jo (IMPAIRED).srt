What are you doin'?

1131
01:55:36,206 --> 01:55:38,372
How am I supposed
to take a picture of that?

1132
01:55:39,875 --> 01:55:41,507
Lyle: Well, maybe...

1133
01:55:41,509 --> 01:55:44,109
Maybe somebody ought
to get us a rope.

1134
01:55:44,111 --> 01:55:46,144
Does somebody
got a rope here?

1135
01:55:46,146 --> 01:55:50,081
Give it here, son.

1136
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,192
How is that?

1137
01:56:02,194 --> 01:56:04,961
Tyler: You old fool.
Open his eyes.

1138
01:56:04,963 --> 01:56:06,862
How can I take
a decent photograph

1139
01:56:06,864 --> 01:56:07,963
with his eyes closed?

1140
01:56:07,965 --> 01:56:11,099
Lyle:
His eyes, Sam.

1141
01:56:19,975 --> 01:56:21,941
Sam:
<i> Her</i> eyes, Lyle.

1142
01:56:21,943 --> 01:56:23,942
Lyle:
Oh.

1143
01:56:27,314 --> 01:56:31,215
Badger:
Dirty son of a bitch!

1144
01:56:31,217 --> 01:56:34,017
God damn you!

1145
01:56:34,019 --> 01:56:38,021
You were just fooling
and lying! Yeah!

1146
01:56:38,023 --> 01:56:43,026
Son of a bitch!
God damn you!

1147
01:56:47,765 --> 01:56:50,398
Aah! God damn!

1148
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,633
God damn!

1149
01:57:24,533 --> 01:57:27,700
My God, little Jo.

1150
01:57:55,629 --> 01:57:59,097
 My sweet son 

1151
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:02,333
 the blue of night
has fallen 

1152
01:58:02,335 --> 01:58:09,072
 I can't be by your side 

1153
01:58:09,074 --> 01:58:12,275
 only son 

1154
01:58:12,277 --> 01:58:15,711
 it's hard to take
the leaving 

1155
01:58:15,713 --> 01:58:22,383
 but for your sake,
I'll lie 

1156
01:58:22,385 --> 01:58:28,822
 in my hand
is a silver dagger 

1157
01:58:28,824 --> 01:58:35,561
 if you need my knife 

1158
01:58:35,563 --> 01:58:38,096
 in my heart 

1159
01:58:38,098 --> 01:58:42,166
 like a Thorn of hope 

1160
01:58:42,168 --> 01:58:48,705
 ever you abide 

1161
01:58:48,707 --> 01:58:55,244
 and it's true
the life that I am leading 

1162
01:58:55,246 --> 01:59:01,750
 the law will not uphold 

1163
01:59:01,752 --> 01:59:04,719
 and it's true 

1164
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:08,189
 that even though
it could change 

1165
01:59:08,191 --> 01:59:14,895
 I would not change it now 

1166
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:17,631
[ vocalizing ]

1167
01:59:41,389 --> 01:59:47,625
 In this wild place
where the roads end 

1168
01:59:47,627 --> 01:59:54,531
 I've been both lost and free 

1169
01:59:54,533 --> 02:00:00,770
 my hands are hard
but so strong 

1170
02:00:00,772 --> 02:00:07,709
 they touch more tenderly 

1171
02:00:07,711 --> 02:00:14,615
 laddie, baby,
the boy I leave behind me 

1172
02:00:14,617 --> 02:00:20,620
 the man I'll never see 

1173
02:00:20,622 --> 02:00:23,623
 in my dreams 

1174
02:00:23,625 --> 02:00:28,693
 I dream that you are with me 

1175
02:00:28,695 --> 02:00:33,831
 constantly
