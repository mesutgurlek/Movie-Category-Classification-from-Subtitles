called back.

up-to-date computer syst--

Why, Branch? Why did the
victim come into my station?

00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:34,977
Some friend of his, a woman
named May Stillwater,

457
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:36,545
was looking
for her missing daughter.

458
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,779
Parkford was helping out.

459
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,382
He brought a photo
of the missing girl.

Everything I could.

463
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:47,356
Parkford wasn't a relative.

464
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:48,924
Couldn't file
a missing-persons claim,

465
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:50,591
and he said the girl
was from the res.

466
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,028
By law, that makes it
a tribal police problem,

467
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:54,062
so I forwarded the info
on to them.

468
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,663
I could've called the feds,

but I know you don't like it
when they get involved.

Why didn't you tell me
any of this at the time?
