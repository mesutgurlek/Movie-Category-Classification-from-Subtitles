# #

3
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,768
Wonderin' if you folks
might let me climb aboard.

4
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,065
Uh-uh.

5
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,131
I don't take no blue bellies
on board, mister.

6
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,904
War's over, driver.

7
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,104
I'm willin' to pay.
Yellowbacks.

8
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,410
Yankees killed both my brothers
at First Manassas.

9
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,040
I'll tell you somethin',

10
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,244
there ain't enough money
in the state of Colorado

11
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,288
to buy passage on this rig.

12
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,257
What's the problem, Johnny?

13
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,918
Well, there ain't
no problem, Chance.

14
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,462
It's just that, seems
one of Mr. Lincoln's boys

15
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,498
has lost his way,
that's all.

16
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,725
Sorrell came up lame.

17
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,734
I was hopin' I might be able
to climb aboard

18
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,326
and get a lift
to the next town.

19
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,372
Don't see any harm in lettin'
this poor sod aboard, Johnny.

20
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,704
Chance!
You of all people.

21
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,470
It's like he said.

22
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,136
War's over.

23
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,861
Lieutenant Kirby Scott,
ma'am.

24
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,032
Rebekah Shepard.

25
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,076
This is my father
Jedediah.

26
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,872
After my momma died, my father
and I elected to come west.

27
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,378
We're joining my sister.

28
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,880
She's already got a business
established in Rampart.

29
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,041
(Jedediah)
How about you, son?

30
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,414
Mustered out
of Fort McHenry, sir.

31
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,474
Week after Appomattox.

32
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,644
That didn't
take you long.

33
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,085
Homestead Act, sir.

34
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,986
Figured I better get out here
and get some land

35
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,457
before the rest of Mr. Lincoln's
army beats me to it.

36
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,461
Ah, well, if it's land you're
looking for, you're in luck.

37
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,053
My father's a new land agent.

38
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,622
Jedediah Shepard
at your service.

39
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,395
So you're gonna be
a Sodbuster.

40
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,629
Something against
honest work?

41
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,639
Just sounds like, uh...
work.

42
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,969
And you?

43
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,443
Gambling? Robbery?
Shiftless lay about?

44
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,707
(Rebekah)
Lieutenant! I hardly think
that's appropriate.

45
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,373
Were it not for this man,

46
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,885
you'd hardly be aboard
this conveyance.

47
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,338
Whoa now! Whoa!
Ho!

48
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,269
Anybody goes for a gun
and I'll break her neck.

49
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,241
That includes you, Banker!

50
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,503
Go on.
Hand 'em over, boys.

51
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,010
Be quick about it.

52
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,412
All of you.
Out with your hands high.

53
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,780
You leave these passengers
alone, mister.

54
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,614
Do you want to join
your brother, Johnny?

55
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,517
Come on! Come on!

56
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,120
Well, look what we got here.

57
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,095
A real blue belly.

58
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,597
Let's get a rope
and string him up right now.

59
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,826
Don't get itchy, boys,

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
and you won't get hurt.

61
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,632
Lemme see that piece.

62
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,804
Well, will you look
at this.

63
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,537
What are you,
some kind of fancy gun thrower?

64
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,171
Actually,
I'm an ornithologist.

65
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,545
Ooh! I'd be horny too,

66
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,584
ridin' next to this
sweet little thing.

67
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,482
I think she oughta
come back with us.

68
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,986
Keepin' me mighty warm
at night.

69
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,047
Step back or I'll give you
the bellyful of lead

70
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,685
I should've given
you at Shiloh.

71
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,955
Quiet!

72
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,690
Now let's get
what we came here for, boys.

73
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,824
Law's gonna catch up
to you one day, partner.

74
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,927
Well, I am just quaking
in my boots, Johnny.

75
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,272
It's locked, boss.

76
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,106
Turn the box around.

77
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,379
Anybody else?

78
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,750
There's a fortune
in here, boss.

79
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,089
It's about time.

80
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,891
That's government money.
You'll never get away... Eh!

81
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,931
No!

82
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,365
Maybe that'll teach you some
respect, Mr. Government agent.

83
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,902
Stop it, please.
Just stop it.

84
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,197
Leave him alone.

85
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,262
Just take the money
and leave us alone.

86
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,398
Take what you came for
and get out.

87
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,739
Grab the strongbox
and the mail.

88
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,478
Bring it to my horse.

89
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,890
Now don't go spendin'
all that

90
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,516
before we get back to town.

91
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,855
You know what to do.

92
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,225
You haven't got
a problem with that,

93
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,264
now do you, Lassiter?

94
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,266
(Rebekah)
You can't do this.

95
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,565
It's cold-blooded murder.

96
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,367
Maybe we can make an exception
in your case, honey.

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,907
[Laughter]

98
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,602
Sha!

99
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,544
Come on, come on.

100
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,608
It'll be first light
in less than an hour.

101
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,247
Gut shoot him and let's get
this thing over with.

102
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,223
Lieutenant!

103
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,700
Let's get out of here.

104
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,309
Johnny!
Let's get him in the coach.

105
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,508
Are you all right, sir?

106
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,880
I think so.

107
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,476
Lieutenant!
We need a hand here.

108
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,357
Be careful.
He's hurt pretty bad.

109
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,094
I've never seen
anything like this.

110
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,366
The two of you,

111
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,965
you almost seemed
like you were one person.

112
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,008
We should.

113
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,414
I don't understand.

114
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,351
He's my brother.

115
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,261
Whoa now! Whoa! Whoa!

116
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,595
JT!
Sheriff!

117
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,568
What's the ruckus, Johnny?

118
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,002
Find Doc Gaylen. We got
a wounded man in the coach.

119
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,039
Get away clean?

120
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,095
Whoa, boy.

121
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,232
Same outfit as last time.

122
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,709
You know, the hoods,
the whole works.

123
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,405
Howie, you round up
Doc Gaylen.

124
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,844
Matt, you and Mordechai
get him

125
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,541
up to Mother Smalley's.

126
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,083
Daddy, he's hurt.

127
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,140
Legs, legs.

128
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,185
Grab his legs.

129
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,312
Shhhew!

130
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,583
These two here gunned
half a dozen of 'em.

131
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,715
And if the leader
hadn't have grabbed

132
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,692
the box aforehand
and rushed off with it,

133
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,125
they'd have got him to.

134
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,457
You know how
teary-eyed I get

135
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,827
around these things,
big brother.

136
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,229
Why don't you, uh,

137
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,096
handle the formalities
with the Sheriff here,

138
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,362
and I'll, um,

139
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,461
be in my office.

140
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,630
Miss Rebekah?

141
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,934
My brother here?

142
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,941
He loves paperwork.

143
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,316
Appears like you
and your brother

144
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,862
happened along
in the nick of time.

145
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,558
That's just what anybody
would've done, sir.

146
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,500
I can assure you that ain't
the case, young fella.

147
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,663
Seeing as how there have been
six payroll robberies

148
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,900
in six weeks,
and nobody yet done nothin',

149
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,373
including me.

150
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,670
Your name?

151
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,541
Lieutenant Kirby Scott.

152
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,637
Or make that just Kirby Scott.

153
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,410
You wouldn't by any thought
be the Kirby Scott

154
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,885
from Little Roundtop,
Antietam,

155
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,148
Bull Run?

156
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,019
Yes, I've been
to those places, sir.

157
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,887
Been to those places?

158
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,587
Son, if you're the same
Kirby Scott I'm talkin' about,

159
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,789
we heard of you
even way out here

160
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,593
in this little one mule town.

161
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,998
No wonder Johnny there
thinks you're aces,

162
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,933
and he rode with Jeb Stewart.

163
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,028
There's a lot of heroes
in the war, Sheriff.

164
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,596
If you don't mind, I'd
just as soon not jaw about it.

165
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,269
Mindin' my own business don't
precisely come with this job,

166
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,606
if you know what I mean.

167
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,408
No offense.

168
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,471
I often wonder if folks
keep electin' me

169
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,016
because I'm naturally nosy,

170
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,449
or just not bein'

171
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,816
the swiftest bull
in the herd

172
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,946
don't qualify me
for much else.

173
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,047
Man needs to know
his limitations.

174
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,651
And able companions
they have become.

175
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,128
If these little facts
you'll swear to, if need be,

176
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:44,033
just put your John Henry
on that last line there.

177
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,071
What are your plans, son?

178
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,472
Don't suppose you'd consider
postin' here as my deputy?

179
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,783
That's a kind offer, sir,
but no.

180
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,980
It's a lousy offer.

181
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,114
And I don't blame you
one whip.

182
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,558
This town's been mouse quiet
since the mine shut down.

183
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,720
But with the war over,
folks are gonna come west

184
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,663
faster than goose grease
through a tin horn.

185
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,066
Neither me nor Marshall Boone
are gettin' any younger.

186
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,366
There's plenty of able-bodied
folk around.

187
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,497
Able-bodied ain't
what's in short supply.

188
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,303
Good luck, son.

192
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,176
Bartender, you got any of that
Tennessee sippin' whiskey?

193
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,587
These boys drink
elephant piss.

194
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,921
Think they've gone
to hell.

195
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,724
Put away your money,
stranger.

196
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,096
First drink in town
always on Del Shannon.

197
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,362
Might that be the same
as on the house?

198
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,630
Might be.

199
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,299
Damn you,
you two-timin' sidewinder.

200
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,705
(Del)
Hold it there, partner.

201
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,539
Do I know you?

202
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,011
You sure as hell
gonna remember me.

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,049
Hey, bartender, you move
any closer to that shotgun,

204
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,607
and I'll gut shoot him
right now.

205
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,677
Now, mister, I don't know
what got under your scent,

206
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,950
but if you will sit
for a spell

207
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,321
and have a drink...

208
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,555
Ha! I ain't drinkin'
with no rattlesnake like you.

209
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,392
Well, well, well,
Horace.

210
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,455
Is that you?

211
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,966
There's the one
that done it.

212
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,434
You... You tell him
to stay back, Shannon.

213
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,698
This bushwhacker
jumped my claim.

214
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,637
On your orders.
And I can prove it.

215
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,641
Least-wise I could, but...

216
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,475
(Del)
Now, mister,
those are mighty strong words.

217
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,139
Maybe if you'll just
sit a spell,

218
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,410
we can work this out.

219
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,718
Or you can just say
adios, Horace.

220
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,312
Ah! Unh!

221
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,915
D-Did I do that?
I am so sorry.

222
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,395
I just got this thing, and have
no idea what to do with it.

223
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,667
My apologies again.

224
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,938
Shake the man's hand.

225
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,353
Arly Lyons.

226
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,651
Pleasure, I'm sure.

227
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,332
I-I don't know
who are, mister,

228
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,598
but thank you kindly.

229
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,507
I don't know whether to shake
your hand or shoot you.

230
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:50,647
That old fool might come back
someday and bushwhack me.

231
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,420
Got a feelin' you'll be
seein' him first.

232
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,432
Excuse me.

233
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,163
Dad, look at that.

234
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,431
It'll be fine.

235
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,303
Well, you'd be
Jedediah Shepard.

236
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,433
I'm Matt Elden.

237
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,067
Matt Elden, I'd like to
introduce you

238
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,634
to my daughter Rebekah.

239
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,044
Well, it's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, ma'am.

240
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,074
I'm afraid that
your desk is rather...

241
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:25,317
Ellis Potter must not be
as neat as I remembered.

242
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,918
Sir, Ellis Potter
was murdered six weeks ago.

243
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,689
L... I assumed you knew.

244
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,787
Murdered?

245
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,855
I thought Ellis Potter
was retiring.

246
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,458
I knew him back in Virginia.

247
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,333
Well, he was to retire
this week,

248
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,340
but I'm afraid
he didn't make it.

249
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,740
Jedediah! Is that you?

250
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,868
Mrs. Potter!

251
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,105
Rebekah Shepard!

252
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,737
Oh, darling!

253
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,282
My, how you have grown!

254
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,443
Mary, I just found out
about Ellis.

255
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,510
I'm so sorry.

256
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,555
Oh, thanks, Jed.

257
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,318
It was bad business.

258
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,018
Not that there's any chance

259
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,618
of corrallin' the varmints
that did it!

260
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,926
Now, Mary, you know
that is not fair!

261
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,091
This town
has its hands full.

262
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,601
Oh, it has its hands full,
sure.

263
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,604
Just not ladylike
to speculate what!

264
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,436
(Jedediah)
Kirby Scott. Just the man.

265
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,941
Matt Elden,
Kirby Scott.

266
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,910
Looks like he may be
our first customer.

267
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,105
I'm afraid Union Army

268
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,082
is not too popular
in these parts, Mr. Scott.

269
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,378
Well, I best rustle up

270
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,750
some new duds
before I'm shot, huh?

271
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,948
Mary, can I arrange
for you to get a ride home?

272
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,049
It's not too safe for a woman
traveling alone these days.

273
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,787
Oh, Dad,
I can go with her.

274
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,692
That way I'll be able
to see the countryside.

275
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,561
I-I'm afraid you don't
understand what I meant.

276
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,361
I'll see to it
you get home, ma'am.

277
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,925
And I will make sure that Miss
Shepard returns safely as well.

278
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,437
Fine idea.

279
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,803
That'll give me a chance
to track down Rachel

280
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,398
and rustle up some land
to show you.

281
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,467
Does that sit well
with you, Mary?

282
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,806
Right down
to the ground, Jed.

283
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,440
Mr. Scott,
come help me find my buggy.

284
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,519
Why, Miss Rebekah.

285
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,023
I was just comin'
to visit with you.

286
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,524
Oh, were you now?

287
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,891
Well, I was just wondering
if I could have the pleasure

288
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,556
of your company
at supper this evening.

289
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,896
Well, I'm afraid
your brother invited me

290
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,493
to accompany him
out to Miss Potter's.

291
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,128
I mean,
I'll be back in time.

292
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,470
I'll wait up, even if
it's way past my bedtime.

293
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,010
Whoa!

294
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,774
Well, hello, little brother.
You lost already?

295
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,815
I'm found, big brother.

296
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,681
I am found.

297
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,387
(Mrs. Potter)
So there's another Mr. Scott.

298
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,652
Better and better.

299
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,886
Don't worry, young man.

300
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,727
You'll have her all to yourself
on the way back.

301
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,788
Tashi'ne.

302
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,958
Lives with her older sister

303
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,262
in a played out mine
near the lake.

304
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,302
Just the two of them?

305
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,133
Three.

306
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,433
Her older sister married
Willie Brax

307
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,996
when he mustered out
of the Third Colorado

308
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,167
after Sand Creek.

309
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,334
Bad business.

310
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,707
Lot of folks say
he deserted.

311
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,245
But I know better.

312
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:05,079
Not a yellow bone
in his body.

313
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,011
Rebekah told me

314
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,386
that you and your brother
came out here together.

315
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,517
Was he in Mr. Lincoln's
army as well?

316
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,687
Uh, we didn't exactly
come out together, Miss Potter.

317
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,960
And, no, he didn't exactly
join the regular army.

318
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,433
Surely he didn't join
John Brown's men

319
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,595
or Quantrell's?

320
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,695
No, ma'am.

321
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,433
Uh, Chance sort of
sat on the sidelines,

322
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,633
if you know what I mean.

323
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,643
It was a hard war
to choose sides.

324
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,372
Didn't you have
a brother in the war?

325
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,073
Well, my brother Roy.

326
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,638
Evil bastard.

327
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,843
Pardon my language.

328
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,409
Rode with
"Bloody" Bill Anderson.

329
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,786
Left his granddaughter

330
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,348
for me to raise.

331
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,293
I dread the day
when he comes back.

332
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,330
What became
of your husband Ellis?

333
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,298
Ellis was a mining man
all his life...

334
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,664
from Pennsylvania.

335
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,397
Me being from Virginia, well,

336
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,099
we couldn't agree about nothin'
when the war came.

337
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,541
He put a lot of store
in Mr. Lincoln.

338
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,340
And most of the folks I knew

339
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,505
thought Abe was as dumb
as a post.

340
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,039
God rest his soul.

341
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,746
And when we came west,
Ellis ran the assay office

342
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,721
when the mines were open.

343
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,155
After the Homestead Act in '63,

344
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,692
it was just natural for him

345
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,625
to move on over
to the land office.

346
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,027
They couldn't get
a single man

347
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,124
from back east
'cause of the war.

348
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,194
[Sighs]
The last few months, though,

349
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,500
Ellis was actin'
very strange.

350
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,973
Excited and afraid.

351
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,068
My husband was not
a brave man, Kirby.

352
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,010
But he was honest.

353
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,173
Are you sayin'
my father's in danger?

354
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,774
I'd sure as hell say it.

355
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,218
(Mrs. Potter)
Shoot!

356
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,119
Sarah!

357
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,124
You'll say nothin'
of the sort!

358
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,320
L... This is my daughter, Sarah.

359
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,331
Quite an alarmist,
as you can see.

360
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,367
Sarah. My name's Kirby Scott.

361
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,096
This is Miss Shepard.

362
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,104
Please to make
your acquaintance.

363
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,003
And this is Roy's
granddaughter Kathleen.

364
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,510
Say hi, baby.

365
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,807
Kathleen.

366
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,542
Perhaps we should be going.

367
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,548
Oh, no, please.

368
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,847
Won't you stay
for dinner, please?

369
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,216
Please.

370
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,653
Well, we have
so few folks here,

371
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,917
and we have plenty of food.

372
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,923
Not today, Mrs. Potter.

373
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,516
But I'd like very much
to visit you

374
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,925
later this week,
if you'll allow me.

375
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,362
Well, that just sounds grand.

376
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,990
I'm gonna hold you to it.

377
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,797
You can bank on it.

378
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,962
Don't look so worried,
Miss.

379
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,472
You heard that girl.
How can I not?

380
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,975
You know how excitable
women can be.

381
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,204
So you're an expert
on women, are you?

382
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,543
Oh, no. That's more
my brother's department.

383
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,742
Wait till he meets
my sister.

384
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,443
You must be Jedediah Shepard.

385
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,818
I am.

386
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,880
Excuse all the noise
around here,

387
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,325
but I'm having the place
spruced up a mite

388
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,453
on account
of the big onslaught.

389
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,587
Onslaught?

390
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,427
War's over, man.

391
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,693
Last coupla years,

392
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,997
you coulda fired Jeb Stewart's
cannon through town

393
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,128
and hit nothin' but birds.

394
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,672
Next coupla weeks,

395
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,173
half the town's population
is comin' back.

396
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,675
I suppose you're correct.

397
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,973
Suppose?

398
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,843
Your land office
and my saloon

399
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,611
will be the two top businesses
within 50 miles.

400
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,552
So put a smile
on that face of yours.

401
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,248
I'm lookin'
for a young woman.

402
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,086
Of course you are.

403
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,092
Forgive my poor manners.
Amanda!

404
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,129
We got ourselves here
a young fella

405
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,960
rode darn near 1,500 miles,

406
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,329
and we ain't yet offered him

407
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,301
a fine drink
or a nasty woman.

408
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,770
Right here,
Mr. Land Agent.

409
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,364
(Del)
Clint, my best bottle

410
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,842
for the land agent here.

411
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,879
Right here we have
our very, very best.

412
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,313
Excuse me, boys.
[Laughs]

413
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,180
Dad.

414
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,618
Dad!
[Crying]

415
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,091
Dad!

416
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,991
Dad...

417
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,223
Dad!

418
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:50,234
Don't get near me.

419
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,600
Dad...

420
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,402
Rachel.
Why are you dressed like that?

421
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,876
Let's not get into this,
Rebekah.

422
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,640
[Crying]

423
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,180
Shut up!

424
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,412
[Men laughing]

425
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,512
Where's that Virginia charm,
carpetbagger?

426
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,851
Come on, Chance.

427
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,187
Show us that legendary
American know-how.

428
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,126
[Laughs]

429
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:23,027
[Laughter]

430
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,865
You know, you could
just pay for it.

431
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,566
Afraid I'd quickly
become a poor man.

432
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,871
Told you things
would get exciting.

433
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,173
I don't think the law would
help on either side. Do you?

434
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,113
Job's still yours
if you want it.

435
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,412
A wise man knows
when to mind his own business.

436
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,076
We'll see.

437
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,947
Thank you for meeting me
this evening.

438
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,685
It was a very kind offer.

439
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,226
I've been called a lot
of things, ma'am,

440
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,386
but kind ain't one of 'em.

441
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,362
Well, you are.

442
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,796
Here's to kindness.

443
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,665
And to kind women.

444
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,704
Like my sister.

445
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,207
My pa didn't approve
of my life either, Rebekah.

446
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,608
Said I was too wild.

447
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,975
Too foolish.

448
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,742
Didn't care about
the important things.

449
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,080
Mucking stalls
and slapping hogs?

450
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,713
[Laughs]
And duty, honor, country.

451
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,381
Well, your father may not
have approved of you

452
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,824
not joining the army,
but I do.

453
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,760
War's foolishness.
What does it prove?

454
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,855
A man's worth, maybe?

455
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,593
Poppycock.

456
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,396
This war was an excuse
for Mr. Abraham Lincoln

457
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,632
and his Yankee profiteering
friends, who were trying to...

458
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,605
To free the slaves?

459
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,044
You and Father.

460
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,079
You think Rachel was furious

461
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,638
when her husband Ben
went back to fight?

462
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,946
I imagine so.

463
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,885
Furious women
do foolish things.

464
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,024
Well, you should take this wine
from me, Mr. Gambler.

465
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,427
I'm about to make
some foolish choices of my own.

466
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,378
Cabin should be
just over there.

467
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,176
This grassland
would be yours too.

468
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,412
Right up to that hillside.

469
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,851
Kinda fills the eye,
don't it?

470
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,321
Great place
to raise a family.

471
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,290
If a fella was so inclined.

472
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,350
If a fella was so inclined.

473
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,844
Sorry, son.
It looks worse than I had hoped.

474
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,559
Might be better off

475
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,502
to tear it down
and start over again.

476
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,006
It's not so bad,
Mr. Shepard.

477
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,066
Looks solid enough to me.

478
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,341
Mighty pretty at sunset.

479
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,440
My daughter's taken
quite a shine to you, son.

480
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,246
I suppose you know that.

481
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,082
I don't know
about that, sir.

482
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,849
I kinda figure she liked
my brother better,

483
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,412
if you want to know
the truth.

484
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,582
Fella like Chance

485
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,990
looks might enticing
to a girl at first.

486
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,427
But a man like you,
and a place like this,

487
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,487
looks better to me.

488
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,226
Ain't you maybe gettin'
the plough

489
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,733
a bit ahead of the mule, sir?

490
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,531
I know my daughter,
son.

491
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,730
And I know men.

492
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,602
You want this place,
it's yours.

493
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,937
But if you want my daughter,

494
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,874
you're gonna have to
go after her.

495

Mr. Elden thought
you wanted to see me.

496
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,095
He was mistaken.

497

Ah.

00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,762
I'm sorry I wasn't there
after Mom passed, Bekie.

00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,862

Otherwise engaged?

502
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,506
Look, I know you don't
approve of me.

503
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,100
But you weren't here

504
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,974
after Ben died.

505
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,741
I had no other way.

506
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,577
No easier way.

507
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,208
Please don't judge me, Bek.

508
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,082
Can't we just go back to...

509
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,418
We can't go back,
Rachel!

510
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,981
Today and tomorrow
is all we have.

511
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,583
But the War...

512
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,561
Is over! It's over!

513
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,063
People keep blaming the war,
and I am sick of it.

You gotta be kiddin', honey.

00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,269
I could never work here.

Never.

523
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,406
Never.

524
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,793
Didn't bury the hatchet,
I see.

525

Can't you see it stickin'
in my back?

526
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,031
Rebekah, this was

527
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,564
a very tough town
to live in during the war.

528
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,812
You think livin'
in Virginia was easy?

529
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,814
Half the families
for Lincoln.

530
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,406
The other half
were for Lee.

531
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,146
Our house was taken over
three times

532
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,312
as battle headquarters.

533
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,446
Once for the North,

534
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,012
twice for the South.

535
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,252
We lost everything.

536
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,619
Everything.

537
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,461
I'm sorry.
Hm?

538
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,864
Let it out.

539
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,635
I promised myself
I wouldn't do that.

540
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,640
That's a tough promise
to keep.

541
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,200
You said
this was a tough town.

542
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,620
So have you worked
for the bank long?

543
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,851
Not too long.

544
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,984
Used to have a ranch
just west of town.

545
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,030
Beef contracts
with the Union Army.

546
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,066
Easy work when the Army
was just fighting the Indians.

547
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,467
Not too popular when we
started fighting each other.

548

Lots of Confederate
sympathizers hereabouts,

as you can imagine.

550
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,972
Silver strike drew folks
from all over the South.

551
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,842
Owning a bank, you didn't
have to choose sides.

552
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,245
No.

553
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,307
Just have to lend money.

554
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,650
That's popular with everybody.

00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,586
Let them go.
They've done nothin' to you.

811
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,927
They're here with you, old man.
That's enough.

812
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,398
May you and Shannon
rot in hell.

813
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,766
At least you'll
be there first.

Ehh!

I told you I needed help,
Scott.

826
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,757
Don't come bellyachin' to me
just 'cause I can't

be every place at once.

Miss, is there anything
I can do?

Where the hell were you
this morning?

832
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,686
At the livery stable.

Gettin' ready to ride out

Why?

Anybody vouch for that?

837
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,064
You don't ask the questions
around here, Sodbuster.

838
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,159
I do.

839
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,567
How could you have...

840
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,538
Because you didn't
want the job.

841
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,198

No.

you a room at the hotel.

No.
Go home.

Tashi'ne, this is Rebekah.

Lyons, you're either
workin' for me

865
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,133
or you're workin' for Del.

like that again,

you'll be eatin'

Yes, sir.

869

Look into what happened
this morning.

870
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:53,479
I'd better not find
you were involved.

No, sir.

872

And Lyons,
the next time those boots

873
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,960
wind up on my desk
it'll be because

874
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,158
I just brought 'em back
from the undertaker.

875
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:14,901
What's the matter
with you?

876

880

No, uh, Jed's showing
a claim,

881
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,257
but I have your papers,
young man.

882
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:40,201

and ready for your signature.

Whoa, I'd actually
completely...

886
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,507
Forgotten?

887
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:49,568
Son, the paperwork's
just as important as the land.

888
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,011
Maybe more.

889
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,048
Let's get it done.

890
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,309
Mm-hmm.

891
00:50:55,652 --> 00:51:01,716
You sign here...
and here and here.

892
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,384
I was wonderin' what you might
be able to tell me

893
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,859
about the land under
Mr. Brax's claim,

894
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,919
and Mrs. Potter's as well.

895
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,089
Not much.

896
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,030
Nothing special,
I can assure you.

897
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,658
Brax's mine played out

898
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,169
years before he went
off to war.

899
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,365
Ellis and Mary Potter's piece
abuts the Brax claim,

900
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,966
but there was never
much silver on it.

901
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,568
The vein runs, um,

902
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:26,207
north along
the picket wire,

903
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:30,413
and, um, Ellis's piece
runs due south.

904
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,183
Here, I, um...
See for yourself.

905
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,090
This is the original
Colorado Mining Company survey.

906
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,651
You can see
where it peters out.

907
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,959
There's no chance
of any vein discovered?

908
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,863
Discovered by who?

909
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,528
The real action's out west,
Mr. Scott.

910
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,504
The Comstock claim
in Virginia City,

911
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,165
not to mention California.

912
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,505
Then why drive
Mr. Brax off his claim?

913
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,442
It's the law, Mr. Scott.

914
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,343
I signed the papers myself.

915
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,780
He abandoned his claim
when he went to war.

916
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,750
And there are
plenty of people

917
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,809
coming west
now that the war is over.

918
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,479
We gotta make room
for them.

919
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,420
Doesn't quite seem fair.

920
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,823
This cabin you're living in

921
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,386
was built by someone too,
Mr. Scott.

922
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,558
But he had the misfortune
of dying at Vicksburg

923
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,138
instead of at home
in his own bed.

924
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:21,695
Instead of at home
in his own bed.

925
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,762
His wife and adopted daughter

926
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,569
were not of the Christian faith.

927
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,202
Tashi'ne asked that her sister
and Emil Brax,

928
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,610
be buried here today,

929
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,648
as he himself
was a Christian man.

930
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:33,774
This is dreadful.

931
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,374
I thought we left
all of this behind us.

932
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,147
Some people say
that Emil Brax,

933
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,018
in recent days,
had been a coward.

934
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,991
He died a hero,
defending his family.

935
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,084
The end of the war has
given honorable men

936
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,153
on both sides of this
recent conflict hope.

937
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,688
Hope that we could put
the evil of slavery behind us,

938
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,133
and hope that we could be
one nation under God,

939
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,502
and hope that we can finally
turn our back on evil.

940
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,973
Never turn your back on evil.

941
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,033
Who are you?

942
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,976
John Boone,
U.S. Marshall.

943
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,445
You'd be Kirby Scott.

944
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,074
JT said I'd find you
out here.

945
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,549
That's right.

946
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,653
This is
Miss Rebekah Shepard.

947
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,517
Land agent's daughter.

948
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,715
I don't understand.

949
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,314
I thought the sheriff
was the law.

950
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,553
I'm a Federal Marshall, Miss.

951
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,117
I cover the whole territory.

952
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,359
I understand you had a chance
to become JT's deputy.

953
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,524
You turned it down.

954
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,500
I came west
for different reasons.

955
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,400
I went to dental school, Scott.

956
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:31,406
Fate is what happens when
need collides with opportunity.

957
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,465
I don't need to be a lawman.

958
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,374
Well, who cares
what you need?

959
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,073
What about what she needed?

960
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,638
Are you content to mop up

961
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,445
after the damage is done?

962
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,078
Hell, a stable boy
could do that.

963
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,179
This is none
of my business.

964
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,247
Evil is all of our business.

965
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,998
Let us pray.

966
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,811
(woman)
Sheriff! Sheriff!

967
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,312
Father told me to tell you

968
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,144
there's some men
ridin' this way.

969
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,085
Will you look at that?

970
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,045
That's "Bloody" Bill Anderson's
outfit, isn't it?

971
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,709
(Sheriff)

as three-fifths of a person

as you gonna find.

1456
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,667
I just don't want 'em voting
or owning businesses.

1457
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,362
Or mixing where
they don't belong.

1458
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,370
War's over, Greg.
You lost.

1459
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,338
How naive are you, friend?

1460
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,433
That argument is gonna last
100 years.

1461
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,375
Maybe it's time to go,
little brother?

1462
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,777
Are you saying that
I've gotta pick a side?

1463
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,817
Uh-uh.
I like it right here.

You wasting your air, Griff.

1465

Kirby here has never
mastered the art

1466
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,521
of saying the right thing.

1467
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,922
Big brother has to actually
go and do the right thing.

1468
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:53,552
Nearly got the boy killed
in Chancellorsville.

1469

Hmm, perhaps today
is his lucky day.

Hello, Mr. Elden.

1477
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,173
I'd like to ask you

1478
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,208
a few questions.

1479
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,208
Of course, son.

01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:29,246
How's Jedediah?

1482
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:30,944
He's not doing too good.

1483
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,078
I'm sorry to hear that.

1484

Seemed like a good man.

1485
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,250
Yes, sir.

1486
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,121
It's part of what almost
got him killed.

1487
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,785
Ah, yes.

1488
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:43,319
The young lady.
That's bad.

1489
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,525
I'm hoping you might
clear something up for me.

1490
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,124
Be glad to.

1491
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,863
I'd like to take another look
at that mineral plot

1492
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,234
you showed me yesterday.

1493
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:52,705
Of course.

1494
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:57,040
Here you go.

1495
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,271
This...

1496
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:02,339
is the mining plot for my deed.

1497
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:03,475
If you notice,

1498
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,712
the legend on your map
is upside-down.

1499
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,244
I see.

1500
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:09,950
Which means that
this silver vein

1501
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:12,117
is actually running south
through Mr. Brax's claim.

1502
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,058
Across into Ellis Potter's

1503
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:15,789
and into my own.

1504
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:16,795
Now, if we're dead

1505
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,525
or run off our land,

1506
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,501
these claims revert back
to your bank, Mr. Elden.

1507
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,036
And to you.

1508
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,774
Well, isn't that something?

1509
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,935
I know you didn't do it
alone, Mr. Elden.

1510
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,641
Del Shannon and Lyons

1511
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,184
were in on it with you.

1512
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,747
Did Shannon
kill Ellis Potter?

1513
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,017
Or did you?

1514
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,992
I'm afraid that was Del's doing.

1515
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:50,793
You see, Ellis discovered the
government's error one night.

1516
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:53,925
A lot of mistakes were made
in Washington during the war.

1517
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:58,200
The emphasis was on war maps.

1518
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,400
And as to the rest of it...

1519
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,069
Well...

1520
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,009
The stage holdups weren't
for the money at all.

1521
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:07,104
It was just to stop the mail.

1524
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,016
At least until Mr. Brax
was dead

1525
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:14,486
and Mr. Potter was back
in Virginia.

1526
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:19,185

Mr. Scott.

Can't say that I have.

01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:20,746
Step away from him.

1616
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:21,873
No.

1617
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,917
Step away from him!

1618
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:26,612
No. It's over.

1619
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,892
I'll be the judge of that.

1620
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,458
Boone.

1621
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:40,032
Stay out of this, old man.

1622
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:42,160
Time we settled old scores, Del.

1623
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,362
Why not?

1624
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:48,532
Wipe the slate clean.

1625
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:50,236
My thoughts exactly.

1626

[Cocks gun]

1627
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,665
Time to go, folks.

1628
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:22,140
Ready, Mr. Scott?

1629
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,699
As I'll ever be.

1630
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:27,805
Everything in order, Jed?

1631
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:30,146
Tashi'ne here
is the rightful owner

1632
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:31,616
of Brax's land.

1633
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:34,017
And Kirby gets those
under his land as well.

1634
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:37,285
Looks like when that arm heals,
you may be a wealthy man.

1635
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:40,293
I've got all I need right here.

1636
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,731
Am I missing the double wedding?

1637
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,266
Not yet.

1638
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,960
Right now Chance and I
want to see

1639
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:49,502
what's a little further west.

1640
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:52,539
Not much for settling down.
That's more Kirby's style.

1641
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:54,198
We'll see.

1642
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:57,438
You gonna stick around
and be a deputy, Mr. Scott?

1643
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:59,604
I reckon I could help out
once in a while.

1644
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,977
If I'm not in the way.

1645
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:02,538
I'll be sure that he does.

1646
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:04,413
I'm glad to hear it.

1647
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:07,045
You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever.

1648
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:09,385
Someday maybe you'll be
after my job.

1649
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:12,516
I think I'll stick
a little closer to home.

1650
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:19,157
I'll see you folks
in the by-and-by.

1651
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:20,860
Light's getting yellow, Chance.

1652
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:28,174
Bye, big brother.

1653
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:29,174
Don't be a stranger.

1654
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:30,733
Oh, we'll be back.

1655
01:37:30,811 --> 01:37:32,574
Besides, you're gonna be
a rich man.

1656
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:35,581
Can't play poker
with the dead.

1657
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:53,860
I'm gonna miss them.

1658
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:54,992
A lot.

1659
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:56,969
[Speaking native language]

1660
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:59,028
Go with God, brother.

1661
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:04,177
Go with God.
