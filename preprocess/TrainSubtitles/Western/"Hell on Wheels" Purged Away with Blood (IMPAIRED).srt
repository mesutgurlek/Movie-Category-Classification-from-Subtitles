00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:18,611
Did you really think

341
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:22,315
I would allow your manifesto

342
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,567
- to be published?
- Shut her up!

343
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:27,370
Your fate was sealed

344
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:29,071
the moment you walked in that door.

345
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:31,290
Well, you sealed their
fate as well as your own.

346
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,493
Please, let the lady go.

347
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:38,714
She's with child, for God's sake.

Elam: You would have took that shot

353
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,170
if it was anybody but
your friend out there.

354
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:24,410
What the hell are we doing
just sitting around, anyway?

355
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,079
We need to be doing something.

356
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:28,030
Just sit tight till
Ruth and Joseph get here.

357
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:29,832
Sit tight?

358
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,001
The man said he need to see his children.

359
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,586
He ain't giving up, he's saying good-bye.

360
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,254
You think I ain't worried?

361
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,458
I don't get that train moving
before Weston gets here,

It ain't the same, damn it!

It ain't the same.

368
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:11,440
Well, where do you fit in?

369
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:14,293
I reckon I don't.

370
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:17,130
Yeah.

371
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:19,632
It's probably for the best.

372
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:23,669
That child ain't got
a chance in this world.

373
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:27,306
But I guess you know that
better than anybody, don't you?

374
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:37,984
Have you heard about the train?

375
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,236
Yes.

376
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:43,022
Is he dead?

377
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:45,358
No.

378
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:47,360
No, he's not.

379
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,812
Then why are you here?

380
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,835
He wants to see you.

381
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,453
To see you and Joseph.

382
00:27:57,504 --> 00:28:01,090
Why?

383
00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:04,677
Don't know.

384
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:08,264
Maybe you can talk him into giving up.

385
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:11,634
Why would he listen to me?

386
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,438
You're his daughter, Ruth.

387
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:17,440
How can you just sit there?

388
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:25,615
He hates me.

389
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,534
He has made that very clear

390
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:31,237
- my entire life.
- Ruth...

391
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:36,492
he's going to kill everyone on
that train if we don't do something.

392
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:40,379
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

393
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:43,382
We have to try and stop him.

I know you don't love me anymore.

here. You just say the word.

510
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,453
I am not gonna let you pay the price

511
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,240
for me running like a
cwe can go to Mexico... 

512
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,792
Listen to me.

513
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,913
I am done running.

514
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:26,968
There's no honor in the
way I've been living.

515
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:34,759
The least I can do is die with some.

516
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:14,181
My 3 boys died in the war.

517
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:18,519
I never got a chance to bury them.

518
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,641
But... 

519
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,894
I had a good life.

520
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:30,147
Probably better than I deserve.

521
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,153
You want me to read some words?

522
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,773
I'm ready.

523
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:15,576
I don't know if I can do it.

524
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:21,209
You be strong, son.

525
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,168
You be strong.

526
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:39,054
