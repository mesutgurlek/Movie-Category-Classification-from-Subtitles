Mr. Pemberton. So nice to see you.

Hello, my dear. Thank you.
You're looking very beautiful, as usual.

Griffin, are the others ready?

Master Jack. I'll bring him.

Hey, Griffin. Come on in.

Bullwhip took Tom Wingay with him
to the gold fields.

Tom was just my age and he wrestled
with a grizzly bear. Bullwhip did.

00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,048
The bear got loose and ran away,
so Bullwhip really won!

52
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,108
Mmm. Well, it would be nice,
Master Jack,

53
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,313
if you would become better
acquainted with the classics

54
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,324
rather than wasting your time
upon such trivia.

How?

57
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,220
I bet you can't show me
in any of those books

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,996
where it tells how to pan gold,
or how to wrestle with a grizzly bear.

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,132
Hmm. Quite true. They do, however,

98
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,383
So much for the will.
Now for the facts.

99
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,052
During the later years of his life,

100
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,927
Mr. Flagg lived not only
on borrowed time...

101
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,833
...but on borrowed money.

102
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,701
You mean, he died broke?

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,940
Dead broke.

[Sobbing]

107
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:18,395
Even the mortgage
on this house was past due,

108
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,227
long past due.

109
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,768
However, the bank has promised
not to foreclose for 90 days.

110
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,170
[Lawyer] I'm sorry, my dear.

111
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,541
[Sobbing] Think of poor Miss Arabella.
Not even a home to live in.

112
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,075
And a little brother to look out after.

113
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,589
And she's got no training.
Never had to go out and face the world.

114
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,922
What's she going to do?

115
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,780
Excuse me, miss.
Is there anything I can do?

116
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,874
[Laughs]

117
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm sorry, Griffin. I know I shouldn't
be laughing, but I can't help it.

118
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,119
But, miss, this is a serious matter.

119
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,058
Don't you see?
Even writing out his will,

120
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,619
he had to have his own little joke.

121
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,530
Well, if that is what one considers it.

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,501
Well, Grandpa used to say
people are 98 percent water.

123
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,097
If you don't stir them up
once in a while, they stagnate.

124
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,868
The disturbing thing is, miss,

125
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:41,505
that he has left you and Master Jack
without any financial security.

126
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,072
Unprotected.

127
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,984
Well, I think that's what he wanted
most of all.

128
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,522
For us to be free
to make our own lives.

129
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,924
But Master Jack is only 12 years old.

130
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,790
Grandpa was only 11
when he ran off to sea.

131
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:01,162
What about you, miss?
It's different for a young lady.

132
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,665
I'm not afraid, Griffin.

133
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,069
There's a lot of Grandpa in me.
I'll think of something to do.

134
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,505
Lf, uh...

135
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,743
If there's anything you want...

136
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,610
- Griffin?
- Hmm?

137
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,350
What will you do? Get a job
somewhere else as a butler?

138
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:29,360
I suppose so, miss. I really had not
given the matter much thought.

139
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,795
Do you remember
your ninth birthday party?

140
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,231
You threw a serving tray
through the window

141
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,361
and said you wouldn't ever
be a butler when you grew up.

142
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,597
I remember, miss.

143
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,269
But I had rather hoped
that others had forgotten.

144
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,141
How could I forget that, Griffin?

145
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:52,480
You're the only boy I knew in Boston
who ever broke a window deliberately.

146
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,079
Thank you, miss.

147
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,653
And now, if, uh,
you will excuse me, I shall, uh...

148
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,387
...prepare the dinner menu.

149
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,598
[Sighs]

150
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,506
I don't know, Grandpa. I guess some
people just can't be stirred up, huh?

151
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:21,870
Miss Arabella! It's Master Jack.
Quickly. Where's Miss Arabella?

152
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,437
Miss Chesney! Now, really!

153
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,212
- I was just in Master Jack's room.
- What is it?

154
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,880
Master Jack. He's gone.

155
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,862
"Dear Arabella. I have set out
to seek my fortune

156
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,265
so you will not
have to take care of me.

157
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,031
When I am rich, I will come back
and take care of you.

158
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,165
Would you please
feed my goldfish? Jack."

159
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,641
- Goldfish, indeed.
- [Sobs]

160
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,238
No, not now, Miss Chesney. Go tell
Harry to get the carriage ready.

161
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,408
We have to find him and
bring him back before it's too late.

162
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,851
Look. I'm afraid he has succumbed
to the California gold fever.

163
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,515
[Arabella] Oh, no,
what are we going to do?

164
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,491
I think I know where I can find him.
With your permission,

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,858
I shall stop him
before he gets too far.

166
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,295
Yes, yes, Griffin. Please do.

167
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,265
Oh, uh, yes, miss.
Uh, right away, miss.

168
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,143
I have it, gentlemen. A ticket.
Gather round, gentlemen, up here.

169
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,238
A ticket for the sailing.

170
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,512
A ticket on the <i>Lady Wilma</i>
to San Francisco.

171
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,351
[Man] Step right in, gentlemen.
Now, this is an unclaimed ticket

172
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,913
that I am going to sell
to the highest bidder.

173
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,583
This is your ticket to fortune,

174
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,958
to the gold fields of California.
What am I offered?

175
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,465
Will some gentleman start this bidding,
say at $500?

176
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,933
- [Man] Five hundred.
- Thank you, sir, $500.

177
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,438
Remember. This is the last ticket
on the beautiful <i>Lady Wilma,</i>

178
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,600
sailing now for San Francisco.

179
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,439
I have five,
I'm looking for 550, anybody?

180
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,878
- [Man 2] I'll make it 550.
- Thank you. $550.

181
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,677
[Auction continues in background]

182
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,806
Stay where you are.

183
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,485
- [Jack] Are you trying to stowaway too?
- Stowaway? Oh, no, lad.

184
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,120
What I needs must shake the
murderous hounds pursuing me.

185
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,060
- Are the police after you?
- Shh!

186
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,259
[Man] Ah. Here, boy.

187
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,038
In with you. Come on. Give me that.

188
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,341
Who will make it 1200? 1200?

189
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,646
- 1200!
- Thank you, sir. 1200.

190
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,152
I have 1200. Who will make it 1250?

191
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,951
Oh, come on, gentlemen.

192
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,855
You can wash that much gold
out of your socks every night

193
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,393
- after you get to California.
- [Laughter]

194
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,057
All right, gentlemen, who will
make it 1250? Going once...

195
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,863
Going twice...
Are you all through, gentlemen?

196
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,268
You're gonna hate yourselves
in the morning.

197
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,206
Going...

198
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,902
...going...

199
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,707
...and gone!
- Yahoo!

200
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,771
[Crowd clamoring]

201
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,751
Oh, yes, sir. Right away.
You got a great wagon there, sir.

202
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,288
Put that in the envelope for you.
There you are.

203
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,229
- Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
- Oh, pardon me.

204
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,662
- I am sorry.
- I'm sure it was my fault.

205
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,667
I'm so excited. I'm going
to California for the gold rush!

206
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,999
Good for you! Oh, my hat.

207
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,837
Well, I'm sorry I was...
But I... Well...

208
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,545
- Your ticket.
- Oh!

209
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,725
The ticket, it's gone.

210
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,756
But I just bought it.
Somebody stole my ticket.

211
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,064
[Shouting] I've been robbed!
Search everybody!

212
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,766
- You, sir. You were over there.
- Yes, I was.

213
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,241
He is absolutely right. He bought
a ticket. I was there. I saw him.

214
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,303
- You just keep out of this...
- I beg your pardon.

215
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,872
I, sir, am Judge Higgins
of the appellate court,

216
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,682
and I demand that you search
every single man along this...

217
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,817
Wouldn't do any good, though,
would it?

218
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,949
Everybody going aboard
is bound to have a ticket.

219
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,689
- Let us handle it, Your Honor.
- Yes, of course.

220
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,958
Step off the gang plank.

221
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,195
I say, you. Oh, I didn't get your name.

222
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,535
- Brown. Brown, sir.
- Mr. Brown.

223
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,666
Why don't you go over there
with the aid of these two officers

224
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,271
and carefully go through all your
pockets and see if you can't find it.

225
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,442
You were terribly excited.
It's not good to get that excited.

226
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,782
- Yes, sir. Thank you, Your Honor.
- Yes. It's quite all right.

227
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,549
- Ready?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,687
- [Man 1] Your ticket.
- [Man 2] Thank you.

229
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,925
You, sir. Are you
the captain of this ship?

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,400
Captain Swain.
If you've any business with me,

231
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,198
say your say
and be quick about it.

232
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,966
I have reason to believe
there is a 12-year-old boy

233
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,635
- stowed away aboard your ship.
- I have reasons to believe there isn't.

234
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,909
He is the grandson
of the late Alonzo Flagg of Boston.

235
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,645
Now, I want no part in no stowaway.

236
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,688
[Swain] Will you give me your word,
as a gentleman,

237
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,782
that you and him'll be ashore
before we sail.

238
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,520
Unquestionably.

239
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,287
All right.

240
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,859
I'll show you how to get below.

241
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,924
Thank you.

242
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,107
If the police aren't after you,
then who is?

243
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:30,175
I could a tale unfold whose lightest
word would harrow up thy soul.

244
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,082
Freeze thy young blood.

245
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:38,112
And 'tis better you take heed also,
for 'tis true, lad,

246
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,854
he who runneth with the fox
must beware the hounds.

247
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,020
Or is it dogs?

248
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,929
[Stammering] Yes, well,
I think I'd better be going.

249
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,990
[Door rattles]

250
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,590
[Banging]

251
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,040
Breathe softly and beware.

252
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,842
For it is often said
that jackals run in pairs.

253
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,724
[Jack] Good grief, Griffin.
What are you doing here?

254
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,855
You know him?

255
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,400
You've just knocked out our butler.

256
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,860
Griffin?

257
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,632
Griffin?

258
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,645
- You gave me your word, didn't you?
- I have tried to explain, sir.

259
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,011
You took advantage
of my good disposition.

260
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,346
Well, you'll work your passage
in the bunkers

261
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,787
and you'll rue the day you ever
heard the name of Captain Swain!

262
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,127
I am making a formal request, captain,

263
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,029
that you set us both ashore
at your first port of call.

264
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,293
[Laughs] I'll put you ashore
right enough

265
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,597
but it's what happens
between now and then,

266
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,968
is what you've got to worry about.

267
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,407
Get away from that.
That's not for you.

268
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,111
I appreciate that, sir.

269
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,347
You'll take your scoffings
with the crew,

270
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,413
unless I put you on bread and water.

271
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,948
I think I would prefer that, sir,
if we have a choice.

272
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,020
We'll leave it to the paying
passengers to malign the chow,

273
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,498
if ya don't mind.

274
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,931
If I may make a suggestion, captain.

275
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,943
Rather than waste my talent
in the bunker, sir,

276
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,004
if you would permit me
to prepare and serve your food

277
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,210
in the fully proper manner,
for your own safety, sir,

278
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,549
with the help of Master Jack,
my apprentice.

279
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,614
- You'll do what I say.
- By all means, sir.

280
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,756
Hey.

281
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,593
Have you ever tried
your hand at galley grub?

282
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,736
- Galley grub?
- He knows all there is to know...

283
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,277
...about food.
- Knowing and doing

284
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:25,180
is two different things, especially
for a landlubber put to sea.

285
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,819
My grandfather, sir,
prepared and served the meals

286
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,051
for Admiral Lord Nelson
at the Battle of Trafalgar.

287
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,825
All right.

288
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,888
One chance, I'll give ya.
And one chance only.

289
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,955
Thank you, sir.

290
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,003
And if you don't serve me
a fair to middling meal,

291
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,301
then it's off to the bunkers for you!

292
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,786
"And while the captain had agreed
to set us ashore at first port of call,

293
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,451
he now refuses to release us
from our duties:

294
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,825
Preparing his meals
and tending his cabin.

295
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,763
Consequently, we shall continue
on to the gold fields,

296
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,130
praying that fortune shall smile upon us

297
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,466
and that you may forgive us
the anxiety we have occasioned.

298
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,870
Master Jack has made friends
with an old judge

299
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,306
who has agreed to post this
when we reach Rio."

300
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:29,678
Doesn't that beat all?
The two of them bound for California.

301
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,479
Isn't that just like Griffin?
Even if he were assigned to a rock pile,

302
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,349
he'd make himself indispensable.

303
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,584
I can't get over it.
Griffin and Master Jack.

304
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,287
All alone in that wild country out west.

305
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:48,265
Well, we won't let them be all alone.
You may start packing my things.

306
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,234
- Don't you say you go.
- Why not?

307
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,067
There's nothing I can do here
I can't do in California.

308
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:58,405
- It's not a right place for a lady.
- Oh...

309
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:02,345
- Oh, sorry.
- Some of the stories I've heard.

310
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,942
Men outnumber women
100 to one in San Francisco.

311
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,384
Well, there's nothing wrong
with those odds,

312
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,446
especially when a young lady
has to earn her own living.

313
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,857
Oh, Griffin wouldn't approve
of you going to California.

314
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,385
But I think Grandpa
would approve of it heartily.

315
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,027
He wanted me to be free
to try my wings.

316
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,631
To find my own place
in this beautiful and exciting world.

317
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,903
I'll go lay out my things.

318
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,275
- That's about all.
- Oh.

319
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,974
Tell you what, miss.
Just to make it a clean deal,

320
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,042
I'll add $5 for the frame and picture.

321
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,182
Oh, I wouldn't part with Grandfather
for $1,000.

322
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,556
But if you're
going to California, miss...

323
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,492
Oh.

324
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,656
Well, in that case,
I'll leave him in your custody.

325
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,205
I'll take the five.

326
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,612
<i>Griffin and Jack</i>
<i>who spent theirjourney in the galley</i>

327
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,591
<i>At last were nearing</i>
<i>San Francisco Bay</i>

328
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,596
<i>Their culinary art won over</i>
<i>the captains heart</i>

329
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,361
<i>As the menu grew</i>
<i>more elegant each day</i>

330
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,668
As soon as we drop anchor
in San Francisco Bay,

331
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,372
every blasted member of the crew
is going to be over the side

332
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,039
and headed for the gold fields.

333
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,243
Hasn't been a ship left port in months.

334
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,308
Oh.

335
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,752
Do you have any idea
what time we'll get there?

336
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,280
We should get within spitting distance
during the graveyard watch.

337
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,259
We should get in tomorrow morning?

338
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,319
Tomorrow afternoon more likely.

339
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,695
[Swain] I'm not picking me way
through no floating graveyard

340
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,132
- and early morning soup.
- Oh.

341
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,031
Now, now, now, sonny.

342
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,632
[Swain] A few hours isn't going
to make all that difference.

343
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,145
Why don't you go and start
getting your donnies together?

344
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,443
I'll see you get to shore
in the first boat tomorrow.

345
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,950
- You're very kind, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

346
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,754
[Slurping]

347
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,468
[Jack and Griffin] <i>Oh, Susanna</i>
<i>Oh, dont you cry for me</i>

348
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,663
<i>For Im off to California...</i>

349
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,765
- Well, well. Griffin.
- Uh, by all means, sir.

350
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,369
[Laughs] And my
little friend Jack, huh?

351
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,039
What a beautiful day for singing.

352
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,878
Watch this.

353
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,913
- [Guffaws]
- Very good.

354
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,548
Oh, I'll bet you can
hardly wait to reach port.

355
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,058
Just barely. Are you going up
to the gold fields?

356
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,857
The gold fields?
Oh, I may, eventually.

357
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,229
But there are things in the world
more important than gold, son.

358
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,237
This is a new land, and it needs laws
and courts and justice.

359
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:18,106
Laws, courts, justice. Those are the
things I'm concerned with most of all.

360
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:24,172
Oh, yes. Laws, courts and justice.
Oh, yes, sir.

361
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,877
I really like that Judge Higgins.
Don't you?

362
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,648
Well, I don't know, Master Jack.

363
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,418
Sometimes I think
he tries almost too hard to be friendly.

364
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,016
What's wrong with being friendly?
You told me...

365
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,722
- Wait a minute.
- [Muffled banging, mumbling]

366
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,793
[Groaning]

367
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,500
- Mr. Bartlett, what happened?
- Who did this to you?

368
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,869
- Who did this to you?
- They followed me.

369
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,244
They are on this ship.
The thread of life spins out.

370
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,308
- Did you see who hit you?
- A coward's blow from behind.

371
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,946
When I came to, I was blindfolded.

372
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,583
I could hear the man
ransacking my room.

373
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:12,523
[Bartlett] I suppose you do know
what he was seeking.

374
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,292
[Sighs]

375
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,494
- But he found it not.
- Found what not?

376
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:24,134
Hidden there lies ample bait
to lure the most treacherous of hounds.

377
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,973
A map given to me by a dying man

378
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,879
whom I had befriended
in a boarding house in Salem.

379
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:42,626
A map... to the mother lode.

380
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,592
Oh. Yes, well, um...

381
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,158
We will report this to the captain
immediately.

382
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,535
Oh, no, it would do no good
for I know not mine enemies.

383
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,700
And I do not greatly trust
that Captain Swain.

384
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,937
Oh.

385
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,174
Well, sir, I'm afraid that
under the circumstances,

386
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,148
there is nothing we can do for you.

387
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,653
Stick with me, you two.
If you'll a willing ear incline,

388
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,157
what's mine is yours
and what is yours is mine.

389
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,489
- You want us to be partners?
- [Bartlett] Aye, lad.

390
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,792
These are the crucial hours
as our journey nears its end.

391
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,823
For mine enemies,
the time is ripe to strike swiftly.

392
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,838
Seize the prize if they can find it
and be gone. What say you, friends?

393
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,902
[Stammering] Oh, uh...

394
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:35,105
I'm afraid that, uh...
we cannot remain with you here.

395
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,149
We have our duties
in the captain's cabin.

396
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,150
Oh, well. No matter.

397
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,120
I will remain locked in here.
You can look in on me occasionally.

398
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,421
- Bring me my remaining meals.
- Oh, by all means, sir.

399
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,494
And if another living soul
should dare to cross that threshold,

400
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,125
t'would be foolishness indeed.
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,897
Griffin! We'll be partners
in the mother lode!

402
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,369
- Shh.
- Master Jack!

403
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,962
Please?

404
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,667
Very well.

405
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,347
Mother lode indeed.

406
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,918
Don't forget my remaining meals.

407
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,910
[Jack] Griffin. Griffin. Hey, Griffin.

408
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,819
- Hmm?
- You can see 'em, Griffin.

409
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,849
Lights across the water. Somebody said
they're on boats in San Francisco Bay.

410
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,090
- Where do you think you're going?
- Don't you want to see them?

411
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,328
Oh, yes. All in due time.
You should be preparing for bed.

412
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,098
Oh, no. Just when we're getting here?
After all these months?

413
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,106
- Don't you realize...
- Master Jack,

414
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:13,941
you're going to have a busy day
tomorrow. You need your rest. Obey.

415
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,007
Oh. I stopped by to tell
Mr. Bartlett. Boy, is he excited.

416
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,052
Just think, Griffin.
If we do find the you-know-what,

417
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,419
and we're partners, we'll be about
the richest people in Boston.

418
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,357
You won't have to be a butler.
You can buy into a business.

419
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,223
Master Jack...

420
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,823
Sit down, Master Jack.

421
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,700
I want to tell you something.

422
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,697
I am proud to be a butler,

423
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,472
as was my father,
as was his father before him.

424
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,206
And, uh, I don't
understand why everybody...

425
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,649
[Swain] Fire! Fire in the hole!

426
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,745
Quick! Up on the deck!

427
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,556
[Swain] Hurry! Hurry!

428
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,292
[Panicked shouting]

429
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,600
It's a fire, a fire, I tell ya!

430
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,073
[Shouting]

431
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,179
Get back, I tell you!

432
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,809
[Man] Bring that over there. That's it.

433
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,911
- Excuse us. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

434
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,694
Abandon ship!

435
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,323
[Higgins] Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

436
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,802
Come on. Be quick. Don't stand there
like a fool. The whole ship's on fire.

437
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,333
Caution, my friend. Caution.

438
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,071
If you have any small thing of value,
you'd better take it along.

439
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,448
Fire! Fire!

440
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,524
Oh. Thank you.

441
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,996
- Turn around. Turn around.
- What? Oh.

442
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,794
I think it's the pistol. If you'd be
so kind as to hold the pistol...

443
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,883
Fire! Fire! Fire!

444
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,114
[Commotion]

445
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,555
[Swain] Hands up on decks! Hands up!

446
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:57,170
Get them buckets moving! Come on!

447
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,467
[Man] It's a false alarm!

448
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,476
It's a false alarm.

449
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,477
Just oily rags. The whole engine room
is full of smoke.

450
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,183
A false alarm?
What are you saying, man?

451
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,283
Some bilge rat done it on purpose?

452
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,953
Good heavens. It's a trick.

453
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,864
- Excuse me.
- Get in there. Come on.

454
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,899
[Coughing]

455
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,441
- Mr. Bartlett!
- What happened?

456
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,273
- Higgins, it was.
- Higgins?

457
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,212
- Judge Higgins?
- Yes.

458
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,444
I turned my back for a second

459
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,180
and he hit me.

460
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,521
[Moaning]

461
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,720
You stay here.
Do what you can to help him.

462
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,233
- Captain Swain.
- Captain's on the poop deck.

463
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,972
- Captain Swain?
- You'll have to see me later.

464
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,978
Some bilge rat took off
in my starboard boat.

465
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,276
That's exactly what I was afraid...

466
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,047
<i>Waiting there just for the findin</i>

467
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,352
<i>Shinin bright</i>
<i>Its nearly blindin</i>

468
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,452
<i>California gold</i>
<i>California gold</i>

469
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,397
<i>California gold</i>
<i>California gold</i>

470
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,264
<i>Waitinjust for me</i>

471
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,766
<i>Gotta claim my golden mountain</i>

472
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,832
<i>Gold that flows just like a fountain</i>

473
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,903
<i>Ill just spend my time</i>
<i>a- counting California gold</i>

474
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,416
- Step right in! Show on the inside!
- [Singing continues]

475
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,248
Come on in, everybody. Come on in.

476
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,689
<i>California gold</i>
<i>California gold</i>

477
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,353
- <i>California gold</i>
- Oh. Come along. Come on.

478
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,158
<i>Waitinjust for me</i>

479
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,960
[Griffin] Come on.

480
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,831
We shan't achieve our purpose
by standing there.

481
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,338
I'll bet Judge Higgins won't
waste time getting to the gold fields.

482
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,534
However, do you realize
that if we are to find this gold,

483
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,171
- we shall need a grubstake.
- Oh, yes. Hmm...

484
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,776
Look!

485
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,416
Oh! What prices!

486
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,689
My mind will not believe
what mine eyes have seen.

487
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,695
Nor mine.

488
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,425
A-ha.

489
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,938
I believe I have a thought which
obviously will be of service to mankind

490
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,166
and, I think, gain us the money we need.

491
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,680
[Sighs]

492
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:54,514
Permit me, dear friend. I think
perhaps I have more experience.

493
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,574
What?

494
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,781
[Laughs] All the world is a stage,
you know.

495
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,824
Oh. Huh.

496
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:25,973
Romans, countrymen and lovers.

497
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,645
Griffin, what are you doing?
You just gave me a haircut a week ago.

498
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,450
Shh, Master Jack. Not so loud.

499
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,821
Costly thy habit as thy purse.

500
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,383
Hey! Look what's come to town!

501
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,694
There's nothing so becomes a man
as modest stillness and humility.

502
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,701
To be...

503
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,567
To be or not to be?
That is the question.

504
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,298
Um, I was wondering
if any of you gentlemen

505
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,174
have seen a man around town
with a scar on his forehead.

506
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,544
His name is Higgins. Judge Higgins.

507
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,276
- I ain't seen him. Have you?
- No.

508
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,715
- You?
- Uh-uh.

509
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,621
How much you charge for a haircut?

510
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,153
Oh, well, sir. Uh...

511
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,626
For you, I...

512
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:15,428
Oh, I think the same modest price
as a tub bath. $10?

513
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,490
- I'm first in line, then.
- Oh.

514
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,935
You go over there
and set up as cashier. Sir.

515
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,906
- I'm after him.
- Right. Oh.

516
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,810
Oh, sir. I'm very much afraid
that for you it will be $15.

517
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,848
- [Clears throat] Same for me?
- Well, yes.

518
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,543
[Laughs]

519
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,552
I'll make it ten.

520
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,018
You can even keep your hat on too.

521
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,422
[Laughter]

522
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,794
Sir?

523
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:52,829
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

524
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,737
And if you poison us, do we not die?

525
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,935
- And if you wrong us...
- [crowd shouting]

526
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,249
This is a respectable place and
I don't want any of your kind here.

527
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,850
[Sam] Don't you ever forget it.

528
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,424
Hey, boss.

529
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,228
I go a little while. Mosey around town.

530
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,533
No. Go back inside. I want to keep
you from getting into trouble again.

531
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,365
Aw, gee, boss. You promised me.

532
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,343
All right. But only for a little while.

533
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,849
And remember,
keep your hands to yourself.

534
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,146
Sure, boss.

535
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,951
Uh, somebody said you been asking
about a man got a scar on his forehead.

536
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,993
Yeah, like down across here,
kind of, sort of?

537
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,359
- Yes, yes.
- Well, have you seen such a man?

538
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,866
- Sort of a big man, had a beard?
- That's right. It's Judge Higgins.

539
00:38:55,933 --> 00:39:00,597
We saw him come ashore in
a small boat about sun-up, I'd say.

540
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,968
Do you know where he went?

541
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,940
Well, he tried to sell us his boat.
That's all. We says no.

542
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,909
Then he asks how can he get to Fry Town.

543
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,104
- Thank you, sir.
- No, no.

544
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,115
He asked how would he get to Hang Town.
Don't you remember?

545
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,310
- Fry Town!
- Hang Town!

546
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,444
You get everything wrong.
Don't you...

547
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,751
Thank you, gentlemen. I'm most
grateful for your information.

548
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,793
There will be, uh,
no more haircuts today.

549
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,385
You never listen when people talk!

550
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,240
How are we gonna find out which it is?
Fry Town or Hang Town?

551
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,607
Well, now, Master Jack,
how do you think it can be done?

552
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:46,041
Well, one way, Mr. Bartlett could go to
Fry Town and we could go to Hang Town.

553
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,883
Exactly. And if either picks up
the trail, he can inform the others.

554
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,548
And we can leave any messages
at Sutter's Fort.

555
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,990
Idea, lad, 'tis well said,
and t'were better soon be done.

556
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,357
Hmm.

557
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,988
How much do you think it's worth,
what we have here?

558
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,761
Oh, well now. I certainly think
that's enough to purchase our supplies

559
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,665
and get us started on our way.

560
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,897
Do you have anything
to take your share in?

561
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,430
I saw no need to buy a poke
when I had naught to put in it.

562
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,637
These should do adequately
for the moment. Would you hold on?

563
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,145
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

564
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,044
[Blows]

565
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,347
[Bartlett] Oh.

566
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,382
- Here you are.
- Well.

567
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,328
- Are you the man who cuts hair?
- Correct, sir.

568
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,131
Oh, but I have terminated
my activities for the day.

569
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:44,470
No. I want you to cut my hair now.
For me.

570
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,603
- Mountain Ox.
- Hmm. I reiterate, sir.

571
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,239
I have terminated my activities
for the day.

572
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,443
Oh, and uh, well,
even if I were to continue, sir,

573
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,076
there are other gentlemen...

574
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,655
I don't care about other men!

575
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,989
I tell you to cut hair, you cut hair!

576
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:11,434
Would you please keep
your vulgar hands off my apparel?

577
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,470
[Bartlett] You, sir, are a devil.

578
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:18,736
A born devil upon whose nature
nurture could never stick.

579
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,438
Nobody don't call no names
on Mountain Ox.

580
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,245
- How dare you, sir!
- You big bully!

581
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,114
Why, you little...

582
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,081
[man] He knocked out the Mountain Ox!

583
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,558
[Crowd yelling]

584
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,697
Here's the fella that did it!

585
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,629
[Man] He's out cold!

586
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,965
- [Man 2] You got him a good one!
- [Man 3] He knocked the Ox out!

587
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,567
[Sam] All right. Coming through.
What happened?

588
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,374
[Repeating] Didn't I tell you
to stay out of trouble?

589
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,508
All right, fellas. Get back.
Give him some air.

590
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,678
What happened? How many were there?
Did they gang up on him?

591
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,652
I do hope he's not badly hurt.
I am terribly sorry.

592
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,928
You did this?

593
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,058
Well, sir, you see, um...

594
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,795
Well, to tell you the truth, I...

595
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,427
His name's Bullwhip Griffin.

596
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,871
- You oughta see him wrestle a grizzly.
- Master Jack!

597
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,341
[Crowd laughs]

598
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,945
Bullwhip? My name is Sam Trimble.

599
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,577
Oh! How do you do, sir? [coughs]

600
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,121
I'm the owner
of the Lucky Nugget Saloon.

601
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:42,056
Oh. I'm honored, sir.
Now perhaps you will allow me...

602
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,822
I'll make you an offer.
I guarantee a $2,000 purse.

603
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,092
You take on the Mountain Ox
for the bareknuckle championship

604
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,463
of San Francisco.
Winner take all!

605
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,195
[Crowd cheers]

606
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,270
My friends! My friends.

607
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,281
I am most flattered
and I do thank you

608
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:10,582
but it is impossible as my partners
and I must leave for the gold field.

609
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,817
- Immediately.
- [Crowd groans]

610
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:25,528
He'll be back
and more willing to listen to reason

611
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,198
after he's tramped up enough hills
and missed enough meals.

[Gunshots]

613
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:06,133
How many want to live?
Hold up your hands, please.

614
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,604
Now!

615
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:15,117
Please, do not complain.
The land belongs to us.

616
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,780
You come take our gold?
[Laughs]

617
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,448
We start taking yours!

618
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,322
It don't come out even, though.
[Laughs]

619
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,496
Eh, Chico?
[Speaks Spanish]

620
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,730
[Bandit] Everybody come down.
Pronto!

621
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,006
[Bandit] Yoo-hoo.

622
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,104
You come out.

623
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,254
Oh! [laughs]

624
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,312
Turn around.

625
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,061
No funny business! Get in line!

626
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,465
- Judge Higgins!
- [Laughs]

627
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,059
Yes. Yes, it is, Jack.

628
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,071
Well, how do you do?

629
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,803
Griffin, I saw you get aboard and
I was hoping we might avoid this.

630
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,640
Oh, naturally.

631
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,740
Uh, please, <i>senores.</i>

632
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,877
First we take care of our business,
then you can talk.

633
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,545
Oh.

634
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,287
Hey, Chico? The ring.

635
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,260
Come on.

636
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,638
<i>Gracias, senores.</i>
You are most kind.

637
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,782
Now to please take off your coats.

638
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,546
- Why would he want us to do that?
- Move!

639
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,916
Oh!

640
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:01,390
In the lining is a good place
to hide the extra gold coins.

641
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,052
[Laughs] I have learned that trick.

642
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,154
No, sir. No, sir.

643
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,166
I have given you my gold,
you have taken my watch.

644
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:14,933
But I refuse to give up my coat.
You will have to shoot me first.

645
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,372
You make up the rules,
<i>senor,</i> not me.

646
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,275
[Bandit] But I will do anything
to make you happy.

647
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,374
- Oh!
- [Bandit laughs hysterically]

648
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,965
<i>Gracias, senor!</i>

649
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:46,731
<i>Gracias, senores.</i> You have been,
how you say, most generous.

650
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,772
Goodbye!

651
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,872
[Whooping]

652
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,083
[Gunshots]

653
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:10,053
Oh! Now that is marvelous,
absolutely marvelous.

654
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,989
- Oh, do stop that!
- Stop what?

655
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,827
What you're doing. By the by,

656
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,925
it is fortunate that fellow
did not blow your head off,

657
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,802
for I do believe Mr. Bartlett
has a prior claim to that privilege.

658
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,205
- Because of the map?
- [Griffin] Correct.

659
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:29,041
I now demand you hand it over,
immediately.

660
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,138
- Oh, you do, eh?
- We're partners with Mr. Bartlett.

661
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,116
Oh, you are, huh?
[Laughs]

662
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,381
The reason I didn't want to give up
my coat to that bandito...

663
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,354
I had the map sewn into the lining.

664
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:43,189
And as your friend Bartlett might
have said, there's the humor of it.

665
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,559
- I don't think it's very funny.
- Neither do I.

666
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,090
Oh, you don't, huh? The two of you
working your passage all those months.

667
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:55,229
[Laughs] And the infinite pains
I took to get it.

668
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:59,503
And now we lose it to a bandit
who doesn't even know he's got it!

669
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:07,311
[Man] You'll get used to things like
this, time you've been here a while.

670
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,478
Will I? You, sir. Will you please
hand down our packs?

671
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,284
Right there. The lad and I will not
continue the journey.

672
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,517
[Jack] But Griffin...

673
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,583
Don't blubber. As we have no gold...
Here, put this on.

674
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,425
We have no heavy coats
to keep us warm.

675
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,657
There.

676
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,759
Thank you, sir. It would be foolish
for us to continue.

677
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:30,296
There. Good day.
Are you ready? Press on.

678
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,876
I don't see why
we couldn't have gone on anyhow.

679
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,208
I mean,
even if the map is gone, that's...

680
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,010
Shh. I do not think
those banditos will ride far

681
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,744
with an unwieldy bundle of jackets.

682
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,918
And if they're just feeling around
for hidden coins...

683
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:50,187
[laughs] They may not
detect the map. Mmm. Come on.

684
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,024
Let's get aboard.
Get that door closed.

685
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,427
No, wait.

686
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:00,860
Toss it down. That's my bag
right there. Toss it down quickly.

687
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:10,437
Oh, I have
a very important engagement.

688
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,582
[Griffin] It is.

689
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:23,922
Oh, see. Look! Look!

690
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,621
[Laughs]

691
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,464
[Griffin] There we go.

692
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,367
[Higgins] Wise plan, then, Griffin.

693
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,100
Oh, splendid.
Oh, I'll take that now, thank you.

694
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,405
[Higgins] Strange, isn't it,
how our paths continue to cross.

695
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:45,107
Oh, I won't trouble you to help me
into it. Just toss it up gently.

696
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,275
No, sir.

697
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:52,220
I refuse to give you the coat.
You'll have to shoot me first.

698
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,690
- No! Don't shoot!
- Toss up the coat.

699
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,249
[Laughs]

700
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,058
Oh, I have no doubt
that you are a scoundrel, Higgins.

701
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,998
But you're not the type
who would shoot an unarmed man.

702
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:08,128
Well, that is purely
a personal opinion on your part.

703
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:12,767
You're certainly not the kind
to shoot an unarmed man in the back.

704
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,242
Shall we go, Master Jack?

705
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,875
[Stammering] Sir? My back was turned.

706
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,145
Shall I count to three?

707
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,017
- One... two...
- Wait!

708
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,579
No, no, no, Master Jack! Wait!

709
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,783
- Throw, Jack!
- Here!

710
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,520
[Laughs]

711
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,121
Oh, smart boy, Jack.

712
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:41,300
And if I may once again
quote your friend Bartlett,

713
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,272
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

714
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,208
[Griffin] Or as he might remind you,

715
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,872
"The path is smooth
that leadeth onto danger."

716
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:55,543
Oh, and I assure you, sir.
Our paths will cross again.

717
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,349
Our paths... [laughs]

718
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,959
<i>Going from camp to camp</i>
<i>They searched for old Judge Higgins</i>

719
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:08,896
<i>Who kept himself so cleverly disguised</i>

<i>until they found every clue</i>

Let's ask him.

Excuse me, sir.

Sir?

725
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,552
Uh, we wanted to ask
if perhaps you had seen

726
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:43,895
a rather large man pass this way.
His name is Higgins. Judge Higgins.

727
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,127
A-ha.

728
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,569
He was wearing a white suit,
through Hang Town, headed this way.

729
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,198
[Speaks Chinese]

730
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,875
Maybe we should go ask some others.

731
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,778
Very well.

732
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,680
You're just wasting your time.

733
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,083
And just what
makes you say that, sir?

734
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,320
- Don't none of them talk English.
- Oh! Hmm.

735

Y'all want a dish of chow?
Just go in and help yourself.

I always do, every time I pass by.

737
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,432
- Don't they mind?
- Well, now, they ain't never said.

738
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:23,462
At least not so
I can understand them. [laughs]

739
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,872
[Laughs] Yes. I'm afraid
we must be on our way.

740
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,036
Now, hold on now.
This man you're looking for,

741
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,570
he sure sounds like old Cut Eye
over at Shirt Tail camp.

742
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,483
The only trouble is, he's a dentist.
He ain't no judge.

743
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,749
Well now, uh... Are you sure?
Did you meet him?

744
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,850
Meet him? I was the first one
he ever pulled tooth for

745
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,952
after he come over to Shirt Tail.

746
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:50,557
He got me all hooched up so I
wouldn't feel nothing. Look here.

747
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,459
Oh.

748
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,427
Skunk pulled every dagbusted tooth
that had any gold in it.

749
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,669
We thank you, sir,
for the information. Good day.

It's Judge Higgins they're hanging.

I demand to be heard
and I will be heard.

753
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,364
Open your mouth.

754
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,672
- In. Inside.
- Oh!

Wait!

00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,144
[Griffin] Please! Wait!

757
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,012
Oh, we've come 50 miles. 50 miles!

758
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,381
We must use your dentist
before you hang him.

[Moans]

761
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,953
Well, it looks to me like a
compound infection of an abscess root.

762
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,392
- [Higgins] Come closer, boy.
- [Moans]

763
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,556
- Open your mouth.
- No! He can't do that.

764
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,659
- He can't?
- The air. It's very bad on the tooth.

765
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,536
- The air.
- Oh. Oh, yes, yes! The air!

00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,837
[Moaning]

767
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,211
Don't touch him! A thing like that
could be fatal to a boy his age

768
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,475
if he isn't treated immediately.

769
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,779
What are we gonna do?
We gotta do something.

770
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,581
- We can't let that poor boy suffer.
- Please, please.

771
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,214
You must do something
to help this poor lad.

772
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,582
All right, boys.

773
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,959
Old Cut Eye been duly tried
by miners' court.

774
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,160
And found guilty of thievery,
and sentenced to be hung.

775
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,203
- However, this one time,
- [crowd murmuring]

776
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,762
We gonna temper justice with mercy.

777
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,832
- We gonna let you live long enough
- [moaning]

778
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:43,310
To pull this suffering boy's tooth.

779
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,408
Why, you'll never regret it, sir.

780
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,816
Thank you, sir. Oh, thank you.

781
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,824
[Crowd murmuring]

782
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,661
I was never so happy
to see anyone in my whole life.

783
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,825
Ow! [whispers]
Do you still have the map?

784
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,597
It's where nobody will find it
in 100 years.

785
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,799
Why don't you tell us where it is?

786
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,809
It won't do you any good
after they hang you.

787
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,573
Get me out of this alive...

788
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,171
...and I promise you the map is yours.

789
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,951
You are absolutely ridiculous. How
can we possibly do a thing like that?

790
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,147
- They'd shoot us all.
- Give me your word

791
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,350
- you'll do what you can.
- Oh, come along, Master Jack.

792
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,758
[Higgins] I have it. I have it.

793
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,888
Tell them I can't pull the tooth
till the swelling goes down.

794
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,989
It'll take several days.

795
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,468
You.

796
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,439
Give us the map first,

797
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,237
and I promise we'll do everything
we can to help you.

798
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,404
- You promise?
- I promise.

799
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,650
You said it was where nobody
would find it in 100 years.

800
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,452
That's the first place we'd look.

801
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,357
Not if I had been buried
with my coat on.

802
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,691
[Laughs] That's very good.

803
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,700
[Griffin stammering] But this map
is no earthly good.

804
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,604
The most important part is missing.

805
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,266
The end of the trail.

806
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,609
Shot away by that insolent varmint
who held up the stage.

807
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,915
You gave me your word
to do everything you can.

808
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,954
- We won't do anything.
- Master Jack.

809
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,791
Quite right.

810
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,021
Wait, Bullwhip! He tricked us.

811
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:44,362
Nevertheless, a gentleman
does not go back on his word.

812
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,904
Get away from that window, sonny.

813
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,409
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

814
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,173
You simply must wait
until another dentist arrives.

815
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,216
But he been convicted.
He gotta be hung!

816
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,376
[Crowd roars]

817
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:06,218
Have you ever been awakened
in the middle of the night

818
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:09,281
by an excruciating toothache?

819
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,157
One that throbs and pounds?

820
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,561
Like 1,000 hot knives
jabbing and searing

821
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,795
until you can feel it
down to your toenails?

822
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,666
[Gasps] It could happen tonight.

823
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,105
Yes, it could. Yes, to you.

824
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,166
Or you.

825
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,907
And you. It could happen
to any one of you.

826
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:36,475
Ah. But how?
How will you feel then, tonight,

827
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:41,320
when you have hanged the only
available dentist this morning?

828
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:45,953
For the time being, he's worth more
alive to us than he is dead.

829
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,429
But he gonna be
under guard every minute.

830
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:53,458
And we gonna get on with the hanging
as soon as another dentist shows up.

831
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,568
Oh, and one thing more.

832
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,540
As head of the miners' committee,

833
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:03,477
I'm ordering you and that boy
to get his grave dug.

834
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,174
[Miner] Have it ready and waitin'.

835
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:11,118
Kind of a reminder to him
that we mean business.

836
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,022
Dig her plenty deep, too.

837
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,788
We're gonna get rid of that crook
once and for all.

838
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,237
You know what was nice
about <i>Bullwhip Brannigan?</i>

839
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,299
Towards the end of the book,
after he built his rock palace

840
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,242
and married the Indian princess...

841
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,940
Indian princess?

842
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,381
- Oh!
- He told Tom Wingay,

843
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,476
"No matter where you travel
in this life,

844
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:48,047
you'll always have a home
to come back to. Here. With us."

845
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,389
Bullwhip, why don't you get married?

846
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:56,699
Well, Master Jack, for one thing,

847
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,326
I never happened to meet
an Indian princess.

848
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:03,395
It wouldn't have to be that.
What about Arabella?

849
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,033
Oh, now really, Master Jack!

850
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,136
[Stammering] You shouldn't talk like
that. That's not proper. She's a lady.

851
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,148
- You like her, don't you?
- Look, that is not the question.

852
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,912
You're always peeking
at her picture when I put it up.

853
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,247
Please, Master Jack.

854
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,016
She carries the locket
you gave her in sixth grade.

855
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,647
That is enough.

856
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,887
I thought it would make us
really brothers. Brothers-in-law,

857
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,226
and then if you and Arabella
had a house...

858
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,391
Oh, look.

859
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,333
[Stammering] Look here.

860
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:38,705
- Do you think it's a mother lode?
- Well, you know it could be, Jack.

861
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:42,176
It certainly could be. Look. Oh!

862
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,173
That's the first time you've
called me Jack, not Master Jack.

863
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,810
We're partners. That is gold! Gold!

864
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,854
Nuggets! Look!

865
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,287
Oh! Oh, look!

866
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,121
It is, it is, it is.
Look at that.

867
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:01,152
We have to get word to Sutter's Fort.
We have to alert Mr. Bartlett.

868
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,859
Oh, look! We're going to be so rich!

869
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,869
Stop. Careful.

870
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,208
You promised to keep me alive
until another dentist showed up.

871
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,013
Well, we just found out.
Old Bixby, there. He can pull teeth.

872
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,814
Why, he's no certified dentist!

873
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:29,790
He's pulled teeth before.
He can do it again if he has to.

874
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:33,590
- Come on, boys. Let's get on with it.
- You'll trust your teeth with Bixby?

875
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,131
Cut Eye, I don't know
what you're stewing about.

876
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,566
You ain't gonna need no dentist,
not where you're going. [laughs]

877
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,570
[Miner] Strike! Big strike!

878
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,096
A man and a boy was digging a grave!
Hit a vein of pure gold!

879
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,089
- Come on, come on.
- Pete, don't... Hold it.

880
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:04,024
Pete? Pete? Pete.
[Stammering] Don't go.

881
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,459
[Stammering] Don't let loose!

882
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,730
- Don't. You'll...
- [stammering] He'll be all right.

883
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,465
- He's used to this. Don't worry.
- Whoa, boy.

884
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,063
Oh!

885
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,407
[Whinnies]

886

[Shrieks]

887
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,489
Help! Somebody help!

888
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:46,461
<i>Sailing up through the Golden Gate</i>

889
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,563

<i>But to find her butler</i>
<i>and her brother Jack</i>

892
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,868
Thank you.

893
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,439
Permit me, if you will.
My name is Sam Trimble.

894
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,275
Merchant and civic leader
at your service.

895
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:47,758
As one who appreciates the pulchritude
and charm so rare in our young city,

896
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,391
may I say welcome to San Francisco.

897
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,094
Thank you.

898
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:58,038
May I ask what brings such a lovely
young lady alone to a place like this?

899
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,871
Well, I'm not really all alone.
My brother is here.

900
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,605
Oh. Big brother?

901
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,080
Little brother. Twelve years old.
Our butler is with him.

902
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,482
- Gold seekers, by any chance?
- Yes.

903
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,282
Boys, bring those things inside.

904
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,518
There's no point in staying out here
in the wet and cold.

905
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,089
And we'll have to figure out a place
for you to stay, a respectable place.

906
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,291
I'm afraid
there aren't too many of them.

907
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,163
Well, isn't there a hotel?

908
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:29,500
Yes, but you wouldn't want to spend
20 or 30 dollars a night, would you?

909
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,802
There's no telling
when they'll be back.

910
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:35,537
If the rains ease off, they may stay
in the hills two or three more months.

911
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,135
[Arabella] Oh, really?

920
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:17,309
Remember the first time
we saw the lights of San Francisco?

921
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,981
I sure do. Right after that was
when Judge Higgins stole the map.

922
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,252
Now there's a lesson to remember.

923
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:26,818
He was the one with the clever,
crooked, cunning schemes

924
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:31,390
and yet you, Mr. Bartlett and I,
we end up with all the gold.

925
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,102
[Griffin] Come along.
We'll be docking soon.

926
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:39,198
We should put our things together.
Oh, and one other thing.

927
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,176
There is no advantage
to wearing a money belt

928
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,703
if you keep fussing around and letting
everybody know you've got it.

Passenger Griffin!

[Higgins] Eric Griffin report
to the captain in the wheel house.

931
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,019
Immediately.

932
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,854
Well, now, that is most peculiar. Huh!

933
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,190
I wonder what the captain wants with me.

934
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,572
Excuse me, sir.
Did you see somebody pass by this way?

I see. You go back there.

937
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:21,850
All right! You go to our cabin.
I'll see what the captain wants.

938
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,085
Shhh!

939
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,595
- Judge Higgins!

[Struggling]

I don't want to hurt you, boy.

01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,751
Now, we've been good friends, remember?

946
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,549
Besides, I'm very grateful
to you and Griffin

947
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:04,218
for excavating my share of the gold
and transporting it from the hills.

948
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,955
Now you listen, Jack. Listen carefully.

949
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,827
It's a very fine point of the law.

950
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,493
But a man's grave is his castle.
Did you know that?

951
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,469
- Mmm...
- Did you know?

952
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:18,166
- No, sir.
- Well, it is.

953
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,767
A man's grave is his castle.

954
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,211
If you find gold in my grave,

955
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,580
it's no more than right that
I should share in part of it, isn't it?

956
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,414
Yes, sir.

You're a smart boy, Jack.

958
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:39,059
I knew you'd see it my way
if I explained it clearly to you.

959
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:48,167
Now, you understand, of course,
that I'm going to have to gag you

960
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:52,401
and tie you up, huh? But we're
still friends, aren't we? [grunts]

[Captain] Hold. Easy, now. Steady.

That's it. Steady.

977
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,109
Easy, now. Give me your hand, son.
Easy, now.

978
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:43,151
[Captain] Come on. Up we go.

979
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,653
Easy. There we go.

980
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,815
Let me have that blanket.
Keep you warm, son.

981
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,021
There's a big man...
dressed like a coolie.

982
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:56,030
But he's Judge Higgins.
And he tried to rob me.

983
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,726
Round up the coolies
and take 'em to the wheel house.

984
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,429
All right, folks. Break it up.
Back to your cabins.

It's not fair. It isn't.
Everything gone.

01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,208
After all we've been through.

988
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:23,318
- It's all my fault.
- No, come on, now. That's silly.

989
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,883
- Come on. Buck up.
- [Sighs]

990

After all, we are still in California.

991
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:32,762
And there's still enough gold
for all those who know how to get it.

992
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,767
Fortunately,
we did not lose our scissors.

993
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,110
[Man] All right, boys.
Here's your chance.

994
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,671
In two days, the <i>Robert Emmet</i>
leaves for New York.

995
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,808
Howdy, neighbors.
Where you boys from?

996
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,375
- Charleston, Savannah, New York?
- Boston. Why?

997
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,047
Boston! You gentlemen
are in the best of luck.

998
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,887
I can book you on the <i>Robert Emmet,</i>
leaving in two days.

999
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,393
Step in here,
I'll arrange for the passage.

1000
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,726
- We got the tickets...
- Now, will you wait?

1001
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,789
At the moment, we are hardly prepared.

1002
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,098
$250 each, you can't beat
a price like that to Boston.

1003
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,263
That's quite a few haircuts.

1004
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:14,673
[Stammering] Therefore, we had better
waste no time in setting up shop.

1005
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,836
Thank you. Good evening.

1006
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,247
[Jack] "Haircuts, 50 cents."

1007
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:30,417
Absolutely impossible.

1008
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,484
No waiting, gentlemen.
Step right inside.

1009
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,827
Fifty cents? It used to be $15.

1010
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,697
Times have changed, boy.

1011
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,134
Thousands of men flocking into town,

1012
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:45,401
willing to do anything
just for the price of a square meal.

1013
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,408
[Barber] I'm telling you the truth.

1014
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:51,207
I'll make it 35 cents for each of you.

1015
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,567
[Jack] I'm hungry.

1016
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,028
Yes.

1017
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,497
Oh, well.

1018
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,941
Think about something else.

1019
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,138
But how can I when I'm hungry?

1020
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:27,182
Well, concentrate your thoughts on...

1021
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:35,316
What would happen if we went in,
ate our fill and then couldn't pay?

1022
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,951
We would be thrown out.

1023
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,756
And none too gently.

1024
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,796
Step inside, gents.

1025
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,459
I'm game if you are.

1026
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,302
We shall risk the consequences.

1027
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,136
All right, gents.
Where else but in the Lucky Nugget

1028
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,268
can you get the best steaks
west of the Mississippi?

1029
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:00,941
See the dancing girls and hear the
Boston Belle. Step right up, gents.

1030
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:04,508
- Come on, Griffin.
- Wait.

1031

[Whistles]

1032
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,089
If we are going to be thrown out,

1033
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,925
at least let it be
from the best place in town.

1034

[Announcer] Hear the only piano
in San Francisco

1035
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:23,197
and listen, listen to the voice
of the Boston Belle!

1036
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,967
Come on, everybody!

1037
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,943
The best show in San Francisco.
Move right on to the inside.

1038
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,780
All right. Come right on in.

1039
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,968
They ate a big meal inside,
run up a big bill...

1040
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,804
- Oh, dear.
- Maybe we better go to the other place.

1041
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,844
We will not. Come along.

1042
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,813
[Shouts]

1043
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,372
I'll throw you out.

1044
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,715
Will you let us through, please, sir?

1045
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:15,518
- Will you please?
- Ah, Bullwhip!

1046
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,221
[Mountain Ox] I wait a long time.

1047
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,127
You come back.
Now I fix things good.

1048
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,863
I am not aware
of anything that requires fixing.

1049
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:28,027
[Laughs]

1050
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,236
- Who is he?
- The great Bullwhip Griffin.

1051
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,709
I seen him knock out the Mountain Ox
once with his open hand.

1052
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,215
- Why...
- Fight, fight, fight!

1053
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,909
You better leave him alone.

1054
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,976
This time he might close his fist
and you never will come to.

1055
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,850
- Jack!
- [Laughter]

1056
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,760
All right, Bullwhip.

1057
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,922
Close your fist.

1058
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,130
And show everybody
how you knock out Mountain Ox.

1059
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:05,503
Go ahead. Hit me.

1060
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,469
Please hit me!

1061
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:20,477
You do rather tempt one.

1062
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:23,889
- However...
- [Sam] Wait, wait. Hold it.

1063
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:27,656
Ox? How many times have I told you to
stay out of trouble? Quit fighting.

1064
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:31,130
Now I'm not gonna tell you again!
You two get outta...

1065
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,296
- Bullwhip?
- Yes.

1066
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:38,328
Bullwhip! When did you get back?
It's good to see you.

1067
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,706
- Oh, thank you.
- Everybody, Bullwhip Griffin is back!

1068
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,745
[All cheer]

1069
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,679
Don't fight him here. Not here.
Don't even touch him.

Everybody say Bullwhip
knock out Mountain Ox with one hand.

[Ox] Not even closed fist.

1074
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:01,488
Now you say don't fight.
You break Mountain Ox heart.

[Crowd murmurs]

1076
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,001
There are men who would pay
thousands of dollars to see this fight.

1077
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:12,632
Thousands of dollars.
You understand, you big ox?

01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,073
Yeah, boss.

1079
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,667
Go inside and have a drink.
I'll talk to you later.

I'm still willing to guarantee
a $2,000 purse.

1084
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,322
Winner take all. What do you think?

1085
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,530
- Naturally, one must discuss that...
- We can't think on empty stomachs.

1086
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,327
Of course not, of course not.

1087
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,766
I'll set you up
a nice, juicy steak dinner.

1088

- And then we'll talk.
- It is a bit past our dinner time.

Good, good! I'll get a table ready.

Oh! Oy.

I wish you were Bullwhip Brannigan,
so you could fight the Mountain Ox.

Jack, this is not a proper place
for a boy of your age

1096
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:32,783
and you certainly should not
display such an interest

Well, Bullwhip. What about my offer?

1166
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:44,526
One question.
If I agree to fight the Mountain Ox,

01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,864
will you give me $1,000
cash advance immediately?

- No, Bullwhip. Don't do it.
- No, we find it makes a better fight

1169
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:55,039
- winner take all.
- Oh, a better fight.

there's going to be a fight.

it really doesn't matter.

Wait. Let's not quarrel over it.
Uh, Joe.

1173
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,646
It's a gentleman's agreement then.

1174
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,920
You'll fight the Ox, let me
set the time and place. Right?

1175
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:16,259
Oh, well, I'd need a place to train,
a place to stay.

01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:20,097
No problem. There's a little room
next to the stables at my hacienda.

[Sam] It's not very fancy, but...

Tell Mr. Trimble how
you knocked out Mountain Ox.

1179

Mr. Trimble is not interested
in technique.

1180

All Mr. Trimble wants is a match.
Right?

- Right.
- [Man] Hey, Sam?

1183
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,387
[Moans] Possibly.

1184
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,255
You can't pull that glove trick
in a bareknuckle fight.

1185
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:48,490
- That is not important.
- You wanna get yourself killed?

please? An important announcement.

I'm very happy to announce
that the fight of the year

Nugget Saloon one week from tonight!

[Cheering]

1191
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:14,521
A boxing match?
No, gentlemen. A grudge fight

1192
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:18,286
for the bareknuckle championship
of San Francisco

1193
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:24,356
between the present undisputed
champion, the Mountain Ox!

01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,992
[Cheering]

1195
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:33,833
Facing the challenger, the only man
who has ever knocked out the Ox,

1196
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:38,140
the legendary and much-talked-about
Bullwhip Griffin!

1197
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,579
[Cheering]

1198
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,153
[Sam] Tickets go on sale tomorrow
for those of you who can afford them.

1199
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,094
Those of you with heavy pokes,
if you want to sign up now,

1200
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:59,156
go over to the bar.
We'll save some good seats for you.

1201
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:10,333
Bullwhip Griffin?

1202
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:14,143
Do you have even the remotest idea
what you're doing?

1203
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:18,174
I have seen the Mountain Ox take
three men twice the size that you are

1204
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,154
- and destroy them.
- He's doing it for money, Arabella,

1205
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,055
to send us home.
He doesn't care what happens to him.

1206
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,116
- Oh.
- I wouldn't take that.

1207
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:28,389
That's blood money.
What do you think I am?

1208
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:32,263
I know what you are. You are a lady.

1209
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,267
You don't belong
in a place like this.

1210
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:37,498
No. And neither do you. Come along.

1211
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,740
Come on!

1212
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:52,615
Then he took the glove filled with gold
and he swung it like a blackjack.

1213
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:56,350
My brother Jack
told me the whole story last night.

1214
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,654
Why, that shifty little shyster.

1215
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:02,389
He had everybody fooled, even the
poor Ox. He never suspected anything.

1216
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,796
So, you see, Sam,
you've got to call it off.

1217
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,561
Well, it really doesn't matter.

1218
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,364
It may not be much of a fight,
probably won't last long,

1219
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,564
but they can't say it's my fault.

1220
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:16,633
Sam? He's not a fighter, he's a butler.
He could get killed.

1221
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:20,147
What are you getting steamed up
about? Why do you need a butler?

1222
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,207
Sam. Here's your money back.
Now call the whole thing off.

1223
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,411
Call it off? Are you serious?

1224
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,650
You and I are in a position
to make some pretty shrewd bets.

1225
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,920
We know something that
those men don't know.

1226
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:36,396
Oh. Well, suppose I go out there and
tell them the same story I told you?

1227
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,831
- No, I wouldn't do that.
- They wouldn't place their bets.

1228
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,529
I imagine they wouldn't
buy tickets for your fight.

1229
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,165
Probably not. They'd be too busy
stringing up your butler by the neck.

1230
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:50,602
Honey, a lot of bets have been made.

1231
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,441
They'd lynch him before sundown.

1232
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:57,845
Well, you'd better think of something.
Or I quit.

1233
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,888
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Uh...

1234
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,480
Look, I'll have the Ox go easy on him.

1235
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:05,116
You know better than that.

1236
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:08,128
Once the big Ox gets wound up,
there'll be no stopping him.

1237
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:09,720
He'd beat Griffin to a pulp.

1238
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:13,528
Why don't you stay with me? It's
more fun to be on the winning side.

1239
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,766
- You are a beast!
- Maybe so.

1240
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:22,003
But remember I'm still your friend
and if you ever want your job back...

1241
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,553
I always thought you were
real smart about everything

1242
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,723
but this doesn't seem very smart to me.

1243
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:46,699
Master Jack.

1244
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:51,205
Now, I have a feeling that brute force
is not always decisive.

1245
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,866
I shall endeavor to combine agility

1246
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,342
with a certain basic knowledge
of fisticuffs.

1247
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,710
Fortunately, I once read the
<i>Gentlemans Guide to Boxing.</i>

1248
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:03,308
All he'll have to do
is land just one blow.

1249
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,817
[Arabella] Griffin?

1250
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,787
Griffin? Jack?

1251
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:11,256
I quit my job and sent word
to the captain of the <i>Robert Emmet</i>

1252
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,294
to hold places on board for us tonight.

1253
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,591
I'm so glad you've come to your senses.

1254
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:19,292
- Yes, well, three places.
- Three places.

1255
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,858
There's more than enough
here for the three of us.

1256
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:24,234
We could sneak on board
and we'd be out to sea

1257
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:26,296
before anyone realized you were gone.

1258
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:30,538
Miss Arabella, I couldn't do a thing
like that. I've given my word.

1259
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:34,673
What, to Sam Trimble?
Why, he'd double-cross himself.

1260
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:35,909
Well, even so.

1261
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:39,010
Wouldn't you rather break your word
than break your neck?

1262
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,952
Sure.

1263
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:44,423
Well, I am going right down
and book two passages.

1264
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:48,087
You can book as many as you like
'cause I shan't be aboard when it sails.

1265
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:49,823
Neither will I.

1266
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,890
Oh, dear.

1267
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:57,933
Well, look, even if you are going to
stay here, you're going to need this.

1268
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:01,237
You go out and get killed
and we spend your money? Don't be silly.

1269
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:03,800
How are you going to live?
You have quit your job.

1270
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,073
But I can get my job back.

1271
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:09,378
I will not have you singing in a saloon.
I will not permit it.

1272
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,351
- You will not permit it?
- [Griffin] No!

1273
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,050
Nor do I wish you to associate with
Sam Trimble. The way he looks at you!

1274
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:21,289
Well, for your information,
I like the way he looks at me.

1275
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:24,160
Master Jack.

1276
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,812
Griffin is jealous.

1277
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:50,286
Well, since you insist on going
through with this fight, Griffin,

1278
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:53,020
I guess we're all in it together.

1279
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,994
All right, gents.

1280
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,198
You all heard what Sam Trimble said.

1281
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,935
He's giving 20-1.

1282
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,173
20-1, mind you,
on the Mountain Ox to win.

1283
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:14,972
- Joe?
- Yes?

1284
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,313
This is the new bookkeeper
to give you a hand.

1285
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,945
Good. Start with those pokes.
Weigh 'em out.

1286
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,115
- And then put 'em in the safe.
- Don't you worry.

1287
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,819
I will take care of everything.

1288
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,593
Gents, gents!

1289
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:34,032
Where's your sporting blood?
Get out those heavy pokes.

1290
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:37,003
[Sam] I'm offering 30-1
on the Mountain Ox to win.

1291
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:39,005
[Crowd clamoring]

1292
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:03,561
I sure hope the Mountain Ox
would rather dance than fight.

1293
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,435
Very good.

1294
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:13,705
[Arabella] Oh!

1295
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:15,974
[Griffin] Oh!

1296
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:21,312
You know, I haven't quite
figured out how I'm going to win

1297
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,874
- merely by staying out of his way.
- For now, let's just concentrate

1298
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,147
- on how you're going to survive.
- [Moans]

1299
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,689
The first thing I'm going to do
after this is over

1300
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,590
is buy three tickets to Boston.

1301
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,220
Your best chance with the big Ox
is to get him angry

1302
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:37,730
so he loses his temper
and then he goes berserk.

1303
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:40,233
- I've seen a sample.
- Well, let's get started.

1304
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:42,496
- Fine.
- Come on.

1305
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:45,164
Now, I'll be the Mountain Ox.

1306
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,843
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1307
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:57,473
[Grunting]

1308
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,432
Mr. Bartlett!
Hey! Wait till Bullwhip sees you!

1309
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:17,095
Desist a moment, dear lad.

1310
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,572
They hold the stage.
Let them play out the play.

1311
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:24,475
You didn't hear about what happened to
us, coming back from the gold fields?

1312
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:29,949
No, but let us exchange such tales
within the shadows of this rampart

1313
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:32,508
whilst observing yon gladiators.

1314
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:45,995
This is all we wound up with, but I'm
sure Bullwhip will let you have a third.

1315
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:50,401
Well, thank you,
but by a happy circumstance,

1316
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,998
while being pursued by a grizzly bear,

1317
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,737
a great hairy beast,

1318
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,473
I perchanced to stumble
into a deep hole,

1319
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:05,144
and upon striking the bottom,
struck upon a bed of golden nuggets.

1320
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,481
Of course, it is not the mother lode
we share among us.

1321
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:13,584
And yet, uh, who can gain say?

1322
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,188
Might it not lead on to equal fortune?

1323
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,460
[Arabella] Whoa!

1324
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:24,131
Methinks David and Goliath,
and at 30-1 odds.

1325
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:27,231
Now, let us take our gold
and make haste to the Lucky Nugget.

1326
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,868
Don't you want to talk to Bullwhip,
meet Arabella?

1327
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:31,775
There is a tide in the affairs of man,

1328
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:34,406
which, taken at the flood,
leads onto fortune.

1329
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:37,474
Now, let us not tarry
until the tide has turned.

1330
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,077
[Grunting]

1331
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:55,160
Oh, Bullwhip...

1332
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,654
I'm telling you,
it'll be the fight of the year.

1333
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,351
- Good luck, Sam.
- We can't lose.

1334
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,451
Get them seated,
let's get the fight on.

1335
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:23,588
All right. Take your seats.
The fight will start in a while.

1336
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,029
[Drum roll]

1337
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:36,537
Knock him out, Bullwhip.
I bets my poke on you!

1338
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:40,980
I got everything I own riding on you.
You just gotta win.

1339
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:44,540
Good luck, Bullwhip.
I'll lose my shirt if you don't win.

1340
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:51,983
Those men who've wagered on me,
they expect me to win.

1341
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,187
So does Mr. Bartlett.
He bet all his gold on you, Bullwhip.

1342
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:59,164
- On me? To win?
- At 50-1 odds.

1343
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:02,396
This saloon,
his gorgeous hacienda,

1344
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,166
all his gold, he will forfeit to us.

1345
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:08,504
- And you know that $1,000?
- Jack, you didn't.

1346
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:11,204
No. Mr. Bartlett did it for me.

1347
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:17,748
Oh, well, then.

1348
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:20,480
I shall be forced
to trounce the scoundrel.

1349
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:26,890
[Cheering]

1350
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:49,111
Hold it. Save it for the fight.
Just one blow and it'll all be over.

1351
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,650
[Crowd booing]

1352
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:52,208
[Bell rings]

1353
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:00,520
Go get him, Bullwhip.

1354
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:09,592
There's gonna be one minute
between rounds.

1355
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:14,334
And the round ends when any part
of the anatomy touches the ground,

1356
01:35:14,408 --> 01:35:15,966
excepting the feet.

1357
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:18,739
Now I don't want no strangleholds.

1358
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,515
- [Cracking]
- [Booing]

1359
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:25,143
And no stomping a man
when he's down.

1360
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:30,953
Now, let's have a good, clean fight,
and let the best man win.

1361
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,890
[Cheering]

1362
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,737
Now that was not fair.

1363
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:51,744
You simply must observe
the Marquis of Queensbury rules.

1364
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:53,677
Huh?

1365
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:58,048

All you have to do

Don't let him get you mad.
Finish him off this round.

1393
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:58,397
I want to open up the bar.

1394
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:02,201
Dance around. Make him chase you.
Get him mad!

1395
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:05,261
- He's gotta catch you to hurt you.
- He's terrified of you.

[Sam] Ox, will you hit him?

Yoo-hoo! Oxy-Woxy?

1403
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:23,681
You're supposed to be dancing with...
I mean, fighting with Bullwhip, not him.

1404
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:35,724
Why don't you just hit him? Hit him!

[Man] Do it, Bullwhip!

1408

You know, there's a lot more
where this came from.

1409
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,754
May as well be greedy, huh, partner?

Aaahhh!

1413
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:44,222
- Trip him! Trip him!
- That's a good idea.

1414
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:53,069

Oh! I don't know
if I can run another mile.

1419
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:11,954
Now, don't get mad.

1420
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:17,456
Who's mad!

1421
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:22,628
Take it easy, Ox.
It's gonna be all right. Take it easy.

I got him now.

You've got him now. Finish him off.

Wait, wait! It's not over.

What are we gonna do, boss?
You're wiped out.

1451
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:12,400
Get the gold out of the safe.
We'll take it out the back way. Go on!

1452

I'm letting you out to fight a fire.

- Let him speak!
- Use your intelligence.

01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,870
Do you think I could have run
that fast with all that gold?

1463
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,871
- What'd you do with it?
- On the mule.

1464
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:55,271
I strapped it to the back of a mule!

1465
01:47:16,963 --> 01:47:19,454
What are you doing just sitting there,
you big ox?

1466

- The boss says he's gonna kill me.
- Sam isn't the boss anymore.

- I am. Start carrying things out.
- Sure, boss.

I don't take orders from you now!

1476

- Let him go, Ox.
- Aw, boss!

1477

Let him go.

1478

- Thank you, my dear.
- Remember, I'm still your friend.

Sure, boss.
