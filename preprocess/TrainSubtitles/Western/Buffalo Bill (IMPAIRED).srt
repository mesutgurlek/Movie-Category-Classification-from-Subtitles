refuse to obey the order to move.

there is food and water and buffalo.

What has the buffalo
got to do with it?

164

Without the buffalo, the Indian
would practically perish.

165
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:57,797
It's his main source of food. In the winter,
the hides protect them from freezing.

you would the heads of any other nations?

So that's what they give you

01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:59,277
and who, if we hold
with General Sherman...

806
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:03,118
has made more good Indians
than any other man in the West.

I was afraid I was gonna make a fool
of myself in front of you tonight...

but that would have
been all right.

815

Because a man can make a fool of himself
when he's off his own stamping ground.

816
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:43,586
But when a man makes a fool of himself

that a good Indian
is a dead Indian.

820
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:53,870
From what I've seen,
the Indian is a free-born American...

821
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:57,376
who'll fight for his folks,
for his land and for his living...

if you could see them
for yourselves...

826
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:11,482
how they live against nature
with nothing but their bare hands...

827
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:15,494
you'd never force them
to break treaties to keep from starving.

828

But the trouble is you Easterners
don't know what you're doing...

829
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:22,601
and that's why we Westerners
and the Indians have had to suffer.

830
01:15:22,669 --> 01:15:26,127
There's only one Indian you know
or that you ever thought about.

And here he is,

Man, do you realize
what you're up against?

834
01:15:43,089 --> 01:15:45,956
Do you think Vandervere's gonna let
a hayseed like you ride out of the West...

835
01:15:46,025 --> 01:15:48,152
and get away with a thing like this?
You're crazy.

Look, Bill, I like you.

Nice shot, Freddie.
You got an eye like an Indian.

Say, Buffalo Bill,
what are Indian kids like?

970
01:25:43,526 --> 01:25:45,858
- What do they do?
- Do they have to go to school?

971
01:25:45,929 --> 01:25:48,261
Sure, they go to school,
but not inside like you.

972
01:25:48,331 --> 01:25:50,265
What do they learn?
'Rithmetic?

973
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:53,461
No. They learn to ride and fish
and hunt and swim.

974
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,470
I sure wish
I was an Indian.

Tell us about it,
Buffalo Bill.

976

Well, it-it's kinda hard
to tell about 'em.

977
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:03,306

Three hundred Indians... charging
as they rode at War Bonnet Gorge.

980

It's a colossal idea!
And by the Lord Harry, we'll do it.

- Love for you, my boy.

with the Indians here in the city?
