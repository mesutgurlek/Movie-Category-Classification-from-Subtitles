1
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,300
[Walt] Thanks for coming, everybody.

2
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,445
I really appreciate your time.

3
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:21,492
So, what did you think of the book?

4
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:27,164
Of Mice and Men, it's Nobel Prize winner
John Steinbeck's classic American novel.

5
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:30,794
It was published in 1937
to wide critical acclaim.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,569
Thank you, Monte.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,365
But I was hoping to get people's
personal reactions to the book, so...

8
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,050
[Shelby] I hated it.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,454
It was too sad, and everybody was so mean.

10
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,289
Okay, um...

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,850
[clears throat]

12
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,629
Zachary, how about you?

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,838
Uh...

14
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:55,901
Uh, sorry, I'm a slow
reader, so I didn't finish.

15
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,846
[door opens]

16
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:01,598
- [Ruby] Hey.
- [Ferg] Hey.

17
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:02,533
[door closes]

18
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,520
- Ruby.
- [Ruby] Hm?

19
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,038
What's Cady doing here?

20
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:12,192
- Why don't you ask her yourself?
- Hey. Shh.

21
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,611
I'm helping with the deputy search.

22
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,904
- [Ferg] Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,740
My dad hired me to do
some background checks

24
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,176
on the people he's interviewing in there.

25
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:27,684
Are they in there right
now? [clears throat] Vic.

26
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:30,812
- They all in there right now?
- Yeah, all eight of them.

27
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:38,194
Did you meet them yet? [groans]

28
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,236
Vic.

29
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:43,265
Did you meet them yet? I
mean, did they seem all right?

30
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,768
It doesn't really matter
what I think, you know?

31
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:48,019
Walt's gonna hire whoever he wants anyway,

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,831
probably someone that doesn't threaten him.

33
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:51,624
I am hungry.

34
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:55,444
I'm gonna go to the Busy
Bee and get some food.

35
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:56,754
Anyone else want anything?

36
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,507
[Ruby] Mnh-mnh. Thanks.

37
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:06,723
Let's focus on the end of the
book, where George shoots Lennie.

38
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,058
Spoiler alert for Zachary, huh?

39
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,835
Well, I'll say the big
maroon had it coming.

40
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:16,148
By the time I got to the end, I was
so sick of John Malkovich's voice

41
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:19,318
that I was actually
rooting for him to get shot.

42
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:24,240
[clears throat]

43
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:25,950
What?

44
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:29,161
John Malkovich played the
character in the movie.

45
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:30,955
We're talking about the book, so...

46
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,481
[scoffs] Of course.

47
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:39,255
Okay, uh... as a deputy, how would you
handle this George/Lennie situation?

48
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:42,949
Well, at the academy, I was trained
to take cover at a safe distance.

49
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,744
Ideally, I'd create a barrier
between myself and the shooter.

50
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,680
I would command him to drop his weapon.

51
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,181
[knock on door]

52
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,185
Walt, sorry, we've got a situation.

53
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:57,189
[Walt] Excuse me.

54
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:06,198
There's been a shooting at the
home of Brandi and Greg Collette.

55
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,158
[Ferg] The Collettes?

56
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:12,103
Aren't they the military family that you
and Vic got called in on a while back?

57
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:16,650
Yeah, Brandi Collette had a PTSD
episode, fired a weapon at us.

58
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:18,861
Thankfully, Greg had it
loaded with blanks, so...

59
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:21,005
Not this time. Greg's been shot.

60
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,090
By Brandi?

61
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:24,133
I don't know.

62
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,890
Actually, Ferg, you stay here.

63
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,082
Tell the applicants I'm
sorry to cut things short.

64
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,727
I'll see them at the shooting range.

65
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:41,442
How is he?

66
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,426
Bullet passed underneath his left clavicle.

67
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:46,697
He's lost a lot of blood, but all
things considered, he's a lucky guy.

68
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:47,949
Where's his wife, Brandi?

69
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,283
Didn't know he had a wife.

70
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,768
- Sheriff, we got to go.
- I'm coming with you.

71
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,454
[monitor beeping]

72
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,915
[siren wailing]

73
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,169
[radio chatter]

74
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,382
Greg, did Brandi do this?

75
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:09,345
No, she didn't.

76
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:12,473
Okay, if it wasn't Brandi, who was it?

77
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,393
Some guy kicked in my
door while I was sleeping.

78
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,854
Did you get a look at him?

79
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,212
Sort of. Uh...

80
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:22,298
He had a, um... a hoodie on.

81
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:27,095
A red bandana covered his face.

82
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:31,241
White guy, sounded
young, maybe drugged out.

83
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,350
What did he want?

84
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,436
I don't know, okay?

85
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:38,708
I was gonna let him take whatever he
was looking for just so he would leave.

86
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:43,486
And then he found Brandi's
engagement ring, and...

87
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,530
Couldn't have that.

88
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:48,801
So I tried to grab it,
and he pulled out a gun.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,494
I didn't care. I just... I went after it.

90
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:56,100
Then he shot me, and then... And
then he ran away with the ring.

91
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,478
So, where was Brandi
during all this? She okay?

92
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,482
She's dead, Sheriff.

93
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,152
She killed herself two months ago.

94
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,739
I had no idea.

95
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,950
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,502
You, uh...

97
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,048
Can you describe that
engagement ring for me?

98
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,760
Green agate, set in silver.

99
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:35,514
Brandi found the stone while we
were camping near Delaney Rim.

100
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,292
[exhales sharply] It's got her name.

101
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:41,437
It's engraved on the inside.

102
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:49,445
I'm gonna find that ring for
you, Greg... and whoever did this.

103
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:52,239
Sheriff, I think you're
gonna want to hear this.

104
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:53,490
[Vic] A second robbery?

105
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:57,060
[Ruby] Yeah, at the Tall-T
Warehouse and another gunshot victim.

106
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:57,995
Hand me that mike.

107
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,376
Vic, where are you?

108
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,963
[siren wailing]

109
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,633
[tires screech]

110
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,243
Have the doctor call me as
soon as he's out of surgery.

111
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:16,513
[siren beeps, wails]

113
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,072
[siren wailing]

114
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,108
Who called this one in?

115
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:47,837
The victim, a security
guard named Lee McKinnon.

116
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,587
Sheriff's department!

117
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,314
[Lee] I'm over here!

118
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:15,572
They got me in the leg.

119
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,100
They? How many?

120
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:20,309
Three, I think, maybe four.

121
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,745
They're gone now.

122
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,067
I was going around checking temps,
and that's when I heard something.

123
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:30,420
And I came around the
corner here, and I saw them.

124
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:31,797
[Walt] What did they look like?

125
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:35,926
They were all in black, ski
masks, looked professional.

126
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:40,556
So I pulled my sidearm, and before
I knew it, we were exchanging shots.

127
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,517
[Vic] Did you hit any of them?

128
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,895
I sure as hell would hope
so. They were all right there.

129
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:48,838
They were taking boxes
off our Casper shipment.

130
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,399
[Walt] These all pharmaceuticals?

131
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,525
Yeah.

132
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:55,386
If you see any painkillers,
you can grab me some.

133
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:57,114
Paramedics are on their way.

134
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:59,449
- [Lee] Aah!
- [Walt] How's that leg looking?

135
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,494
You stitch that yourself?

136
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,832
Aah. Uh, no, one of them did it.

137
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,960
[Lee inhales sharply]

138
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,795
[shudders]

139
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,678
[siren wails]

140
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,622
Two armed robberies in one day?

141
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,248
They got to be connected.

142
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,392
[Walt] Maybe.

143
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,752
Lee McKinnon shot those
robbers at close range.

144
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,796
Call the hospitals and the local clinics.

145
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:32,191
See if any gunshot victims have shown up.

146
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:34,425
Have Ruby call every pawnshop in the area.

147
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:38,072
See if anyone brought in a green
agate engagement ring set in silver.

148
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,907
You looking to propose to someone?

149
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:43,077
It was, uh, Brandi Collette's ring.

150
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:45,937
Greg got shot trying to stop
someone stealing it, so...

151
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:49,041
Green agate must be worth
a lot more than I suspected.

152
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,294
Brandi killed herself two months ago.

153
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:56,006
Shit. Okay. I'll call Ruby from the road.

154
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:59,426
Ferg, I want you to thoroughly
process these crime scenes,

155
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,220
this place and the Collette home.

156
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,223
Tell me the differences
and the similarities.

157
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,851
That should tell us if these
two robberies are connected.

158
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,114
Ferg.

159
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,740
Call Cady for me.

160
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,200
On it.

161
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:24,701
Why?

162
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,287
I need a ride.

163
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,464
Yeah, that's right.

164
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,218
Is Greg Collette out of surgery?

165
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,306
Anybody there to be with
him when he comes 'round?

166
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,684
When are the visiting hours?

167
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,419
Okay, thanks.

168
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,378
[beep]

169
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,981
So, uh...

170
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:58,718
You dig up anything on these
candidates I ought to know about?

171
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:03,347
Dad, do you feel like maybe
you're rushing this a little?

172
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:05,159
You've been through a lot.

173
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,269
Thanks, but I'm good.

174
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,996
Now, what have you found?

175
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:13,816
Well, two of your applicants
have minor criminal records,

176
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:17,171
and one of them has a medical
history that's a little disconcerting.

177
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:18,505
Okay.

178
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:29,141
Now, I hope you never need to
use your weapon on this job.

179
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:33,645
But if you do, I hope you don't miss.

180
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,524
Treat this like the real thing.

181
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:39,484
All right.

182
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:41,737
Ready.

183
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,032
Aim.

184
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:46,033
Fire.

185
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:01,631
Not bad, Theo.

186
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,675
Thanks, Sheriff.

187
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:09,080
Monte, I get the feeling you
may have done this before.

188
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,182
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:22,569
Something wrong, Zachary?

190
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:26,490
You said to treat this
like the real thing, right?

191
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:29,851
Well, in reality, at this distance,
that bear's no threat to me,

192
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:31,161
so I prefer not to shoot it.

193
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:36,232
Actually, that's not a bear.

194
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:39,711
That's an escaped killer in a bear suit.

195
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,966
He's got an AK-47 aimed straight at you.

196
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:50,264
[shell clinks]

197
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,143
Nice shooting.

198
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,105
[Vic] Walt.

199
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:06,971
So, if Lee McKinnon did hit
one of those warehouse robbers,

200
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,639
they didn't go to a hospital or clinic.

201
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,451
Nobody's been admitted with a gunshot wound

202
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,935
except for McKinnon and Greg Collette.

203
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:14,603
What about Brandi's ring?

204
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:17,648
Ruby's still making calls, but I
just got off the phone with Ferg.

205
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,776
He said 12 boxes of pharmaceuticals
were stolen from the warehouse,

206
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,254
all from the same Casper shipment.

207
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:25,632
Zoloft, Children's
Advil, and pseudo-ephrine?

208
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,409
- Pseudoephedrine.
- [Vic] Pseudoephedrine.

209
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,844
Pseudoephedrine?

210
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,494
Meth cooks use it.

211
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:34,665
So I've been thinking, home
invasion, stolen pills, ring a bell?

212
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,601
Yeah. Unfortunately.

213
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:37,853
Yeah.

214
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,548
Cady, uh, tell the candidates that
didn't check out they didn't make the cut,

215
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:43,984
except for the medical case.

216
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,135
I'm not quite ready to cut him loose yet.

217
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,488
Okay.

218
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:59,416
[hip-hop music playing]

219
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,195
I'll do the talking.

220
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:08,091
You head inside and look for the
missing drugs and Brandi's ring.

221
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,845
[Vic] Let's hope for their
sakes we only find drugs.

222
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,849
- Boys.
- [music stops]

223
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,435
Yo, Bae, that's trespassing
without a warrant.

224
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:21,146
You're on probation.
We don't need a warrant.

225
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:24,215
You still peddling stolen drugs these days?

226
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,841
- You mean magazines?
- No!

227
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:27,570
- Come on!
- I don't.

228
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:30,054
[chuckling]

229
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,575
Like you said, we're on probation.

230
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,660
Selling drugs would wreck
that shit. So we're clean.

231
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,104
- Who's taken over your drug trade?
- No one.

232
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:41,584
You've cleaned up Absaroka County, Sheriff.

233
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,671
And yet someone just robbed
a warehouse at gunpoint,

234
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:52,219
stole entire cases of pseudoephedrine,
Zoloft, and Children's Advil.

235
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:56,181
And someone ripped off jewelry from
a grieving widower after shooting him.

236
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:59,935
I'm thinking the two of you are
about stupid enough to do both.

237
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,188
Look what I just found under
one of the couch cushions.

238
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:07,067
[chuckles] Well, that's a
violation of your probation,

239
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:11,846
which means I'm calling your
probation officer right now

240
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:14,890
unless I believe every single
word that comes out of your mouths.

241
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,392
We're not lying.

242
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:20,372
Our proby's a hard-ass. We
wouldn't risk peddling Z-loft.

243
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,772
What about the pseudoephedrine?

244
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:25,252
There's no money is pseudo, not
unless you cook that shit up.

245
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,420
And what if you can?

246
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,945
[sighs]

247
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:31,133
You can flip a package of
pseudo for three grams of meth,

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,076
maybe sell it for 100 bucks to
some dumb-ass casino tourists.

249
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,346
But we don't know how to
cook that redneck shit.

250
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:37,347
No.

251
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,190
And, Sheriff?

252
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:51,677
That's actually my nana's gun.

253
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:54,030
[Walt] Your nana's gun?

254
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:58,368
You tell your Nana to come down
to the station and pick it up.

255
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:17,620
So, those idiots are right
about meth's street...

256
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:18,621
Hey.

257
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,098
street value.

258
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:22,500
Each one of those cases of pseudoephedrine

259
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:25,187
could be worth tens of
thousands of dollars.

260
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:27,856
What did you find at the crime scenes?

261
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:31,092
Found some slugs at the warehouse
and at Greg Collette's home.

262
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:33,636
I figure we should run
ballistics on all of them.

263
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:38,099
Even though the robbery at the Collette
home looks like a random smash-and-grab,

264
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,476
I decided to make some calls
on Greg Collette anyway,

265
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,746
see if he has any enemies
or any recent run-ins.

266
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,709
- Is that why you brought Travis in?
- Uh... no.

267
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,569
Uh... he brought himself in.

268
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,421
Said he wanted to talk to you in private.

269
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,655
I have no idea what about.

270
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:57,118
Anyway, Greg Collette did have a big
blowup at the V.A. clinic in Sheridan

271
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:02,015
directed at a psychiatrist...
Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan.

272
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,559
Nice work.

273
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,102
Travis.

274
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,754
Uh... hi.

275
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:09,838
What are you doing here?

276
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,317
I'm honored to apply for
the job of deputy, sir.

277
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:15,344
I-I know me and this department may
have gotten off on the wrong foot,

278
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:18,055
but I really do believe that
I'd make a strong candidate.

279
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,825
Aside from pulling a
gun on one of my deputies

280
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:24,413
and later helping him kidnap
and drug a Cheyenne man.

281
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,041
Well, to be fair, I did come clean
on both of those errors in judgment.

282
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,984
So I do have honesty going for me.

283
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:33,279
Also, I've, uh, attached this article.

284
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,115
It says that a lot of cops
would have become criminals

285
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:38,075
if they hadn't turned to law enforcement.

286
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:41,036
So, you're saying if I don't hire
you, you're gonna commit more crimes.

287
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:44,039
[laughs] Not any felonies.

288
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,750
As you can see, I, uh... I've
never done any real jail time,

289
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,605
and I've never been convicted of
anything other than the misdemeanor.

290
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:55,611
You actually stapled your
rap sheet to your résumé?

291
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,946
My greatest weakness happens
to be my greatest strength.

292
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,514
I know where the bad guys are.

293
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:02,517
I know how they think,
and I'm a quick draw.

294
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:03,892
[chuckles]

295
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,978
[pen clicks]

296
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,205
Uh...

297
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,999
I'm in the middle of
an investigation, so...

298
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,942
All right.

299
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:13,277
I'm gonna drive to Sheridan,

300
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:16,881
talk to that psychiatrist that
Greg Collette had the run-in with.

301
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:21,869
Uh, I want you to see if
anyone's buying or stealing

302
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,580
the other ingredients you
need to cook meth in bulk.

303
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,641
Okay.

304
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:37,569
Well, I think that went
better than expected.

305
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,866
[indistinct conversations]

306
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,569
[door closes]

307
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,129
[man] Come on.

308
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:00,342
Thanks, but no thanks.

309
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,106
Sheriff Longmire.

310
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:16,191
Yeah.

311
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:26,702
Monaghan, let me help you with that.

312
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:27,935
[Donna] Oh, thank you.

313
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,478
- What happened?
- [sighs]

314
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:33,583
Well, it was either a temper
tantrum or a breakthrough.

315
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,084
It's hard to tell sometimes.

316
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,360
And the name is Donna.

317
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,570
Donna. Right.

318
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:38,881
Yeah.

319
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:42,866
Well, I do have another patient
in about five minutes, so...

320
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,577
Of course. I'll get right to it.

321
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:48,247
Do you know a Durant
man named Greg Collette?

322
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:53,961
Yes, he reached out to me a few
months ago about his wife, Brandi.

323
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:55,421
She was, uh...

324
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:58,466
She was having some pretty terrible
flashbacks after coming home from Iraq.

325
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,843
Yeah. Yeah, I experienced
one of them firsthand, so...

326
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:05,431
Well, then you know that she was in
need of immediate psychiatric care.

327
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,684
But, unfortunately, like too many veterans,

328
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:11,019
she wouldn't come here for treatment.

329
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,232
So at Greg's request, I took the
mobile unit down to Durant to see her,

330
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,712
but she refused evaluation, so...

331
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,195
How did Greg react to that?

332
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,048
Well, he was thankful for my efforts.

333
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:23,991
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

334
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:27,178
Why are you asking me all these
questions about Greg Collette?

335
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:30,181
Because someone broke into his
home this morning and shot him.

336
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:33,351
Well, is he okay?

337
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:34,960
I hope so.

338
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:39,190
Anyway, I understand that you and
Greg had a bit of a confrontation.

339
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,820
Well, I... Yes. [stammers]

340
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:47,640
It was about three months ago. He, uh...

341
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:52,728
He drove down here and demanded that I
give him some anti-depressants for Brandi.

342
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:53,729
What did you say?

343
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,982
I said the only thing I could say... No.

344
00:19:56,983 --> 00:20:00,944
Without an evaluation, I didn't know
if Brandi was suffering from PTSD

345
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:03,113
or a traumatic brain injury or both.

346
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:07,051
You know, there was no way of knowing
what kind of medication to give her, so...

347
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,220
And did that make Greg angry?

348
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,580
Yes, it made him very livid.

349
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:16,227
He, uh, told me that if I
didn't give him the pills

350
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:20,589
that, um, Brandi would kill herself.

351
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,133
But there was really
nothing that I could do.

352
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,720
At that point, my hands were tied, so...

353
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:28,639
Well, Greg was right
about Brandi, you know?

354
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,158
She did kill herself.

355
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,828
Do you actually think that
I don't know that, Sheriff?

356
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:37,123
Do you imagine that that
doesn't keep me awake at night?

357
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:43,421
Did you know that 22 veterans
kill themselves every day?

358
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:49,785
You know, I had no idea when I took this
job that it was gonna be so impossible

359
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:53,306
for me to give these people
the kind of help that they need.

360
00:20:54,875 --> 00:21:00,128
A soldier does not hesitate to get
the shrapnel removed from his leg.

361
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:05,694
But if it's the brain that's injured,
you can't get them to set foot in here.

362
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,555
They think that it makes
them weak or something.

363
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:11,074
And just...

364
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,769
So what do they do? They... They suffer.

365
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,270
And they self-medicate.

366
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,582
And sometimes, like Brandi
Collette, they kill themselves.

367
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:24,004
And if they actually do work
up the courage to come in here,

368
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,530
well, then they find
that we are so underfunded

369
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:29,825
and that the red tape is so damn thick,

370
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:33,304
it's all just starting to feel like
some, you know, sadistic joke, but...

371
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,835
I'm sorry. Excuse me. It's
okay. It's okay. I've got it.

372
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,312
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,984
[sighs]

374
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,426
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:48,737
It's uh...

376
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,114
It's been a long week.

377
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,140
So... [clears throat]

378
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:56,411
I really do have a lot more patients, so
if you don't have any more questions...

379
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:58,830
Where were you this
morning just after dawn?

380
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:02,858
I was on the road back from
Cumberland County in the mobile unit.

381
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:03,793
Why?

382
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,213
I'm just trying to piece together
all the information that I can.

383
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:09,925
All right.

384
00:22:09,992 --> 00:22:11,116
Thank you.

385
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:12,343
[Donna] Of course.

386
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:25,840
Deputy Ferguson here has
examined two crime scenes,

387
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:28,693
one victim at the Collette home invasion,

388
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,594
one at the Tall-T Warehouse robbery.

389
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:31,553
Ferg?

390
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:37,160
All right, Greg Collette was shot with
a .38 by a single robber in his home.

391
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:41,981
Later that same morning, Lee McKinnon
was shot with a 9mm in his leg

392
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:45,501
while confronting a group of three
to four professional-looking thieves.

393
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:48,654
Now, McKinnon returned fire with his .38,

394
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:51,674
leaving these bullet holes
in the warehouse boxes.

395
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:58,264
So, you think these crimes are related?

396
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,184
They got to be related.

397
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,377
This is small-town Wyoming, right?

398
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:06,606
What are the odds that there are
two heist crews working out here?

399
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:11,301
Wait, you're saying that these
perps completely altered their M.O.s?

400
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:13,721
Why would they suddenly change
things up between crimes?

401
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:16,449
Maybe they want to
throw us off their scent.

402
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:18,767
[Walt] Zachary, what do you think?

403
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:23,022
I think these two .38 slugs
are maybe from the same gun.

404
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:27,192
Both got six lands and
grooves and a left twist.

405
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:28,503
[Premo] What does that mean?

406
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:33,407
That means that Zachary noticed
the same thing as Deputy Ferguson.

407
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:36,427
We're doing some further ballistic
tests, but there's a good chance

408
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:39,555
that Lee McKinnon's gun was used
at the Collette home invasion, so...

409
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,474
And did you recover McKinnon's gun?

410
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,668
No. McKinnon told us the robbers
took it after he was shot.

411
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,628
But Collette was shot first.

412
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:49,381
How would he be shot with
the security guard's gun?

413
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:51,008
[Travis] Easy.

414
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,551
The guard was in on it.

415
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:55,178
See, the security guard, he rips
off this Collette fellow first,

416
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:56,781
and then he goes to work his shift,

417
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:00,326
and then he stages a fake robbery to
make it look like it's a crime spree.

418
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:03,079
I mean, he's a security guard,
right? I hate those guys.

419
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:04,980
Fake wannabe rent-a-cops.

420
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,499
What are you doing here?

421
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:10,069
Just winning you over. I mean,
you never said no yesterday.

422
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,505
Okay, then. No.

423
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,157
Come on, you got to at
least give me a chance.

424
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,802
No, I don't.

425
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:20,889
Okay.

426
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:32,841
So, uh, there's another
way of thinking about this.

427
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:37,697
Maybe the warehouse was robbed first
before the Collette home invasion.

428
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:42,410
Warehouse thieves shoot Lee McKinnon,
steal his gun, hit the Collette house.

429
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:45,496
Well, then why did the 911
calls come in a different order?

430
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:49,667
If this security guard McKinnon
really is an inside man,

431
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:53,963
after the warehouse robbery, he lets
his cohorts shoot him in the leg.

432
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,341
Then he would have waited to
call 911 to let his crew get away.

433
00:24:57,408 --> 00:25:02,680
Meanwhile, they use Lee McKinnon's gun in
another robbery in another part of town.

434
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:06,101
Didn't Trey and Jelly have an inside
partner in their prescription-drug ring?

435
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:07,584
Yes, they did.

436
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:11,314
Paid off a pharmacist to give them
the names of people with prescriptions.

437
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,134
All four cases of stolen pseudoephedrine

438
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:17,636
showed up in the Dumpster
behind Durant Pharmacy

439
00:25:17,637 --> 00:25:20,823
right after you and I
questioned Jelly and Trey.

440
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,742
That's got to be enough for an arrest.

441
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:25,787
No. Everything we have
is still circumstantial.

442
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:29,415
Unless one of our shooting
victims can give us an I.D.

443
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:31,942
Greg.

444
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:33,044
Sheriff.

445
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,546
Are they taking half-decent
care of you in here?

446
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:37,781
Uh, no complaints so far, you know.

447
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,241
Uh... [clears throat]

448
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:43,078
Marc, this is Sheriff Walt Longmire,
who I was telling you about.

449
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,956
Sheriff, this is my friend
Sergeant Marc Van Zandt.

450
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:48,876
Actually, it's retired Sergeant Van
Zandt. Nice to meet you, Sheriff.

451
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:50,979
Greg tells me you're
hunting down the asshole

452
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,939
that shot him and stole Brandi's ring.

453
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:55,674
Well, I'm certainly working on it.

454
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,360
Did you know Brandi?

455
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:00,846
[Marc] Yes, sir. Very well.

456
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:04,450
If it was anyone other than Brandi
driving our supply truck through Basra,

457
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:06,018
I don't think I'd be here.

458
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,187
So when Greg called me and
told me about the robbery,

459
00:26:08,188 --> 00:26:11,666
I drove up from Fort Collins to make
sure they were taking care of him.

460
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,275
No.

461
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:15,253
We're doing everything we can, so, uh...

462
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:20,157
I got a couple of suspects
I think might be involved.

463
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:24,870
Greg, if you feel up to it, you want
to take a look at their mug shots?

464
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:25,996
Yeah, sure, let's...

465
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:27,556
Here you go. [clears throat]

466
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,085
Only a mother could love them, huh?

467
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:33,771
[Greg chuckles] Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:37,608
You recognize either of them?

469
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:40,094
I don't know.

470
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:42,179
Like I said, I was sleeping
when they busted in.

471
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,990
They had their faces covered.

472
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,992
I wish I could, but sorry.

473
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:48,435
No, no, makes sense. Um...

474
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:53,166
If you could hear the robber's voice,
you think that may make things easier?

475
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:55,210
It might, right?

476
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,252
Yeah.

477
00:26:56,861 --> 00:26:57,986
Okay.

Hey, who you taking me to see?

479
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,242
It's a guy named Greg Collette.

480
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:06,429
He was also shot during
a robbery yesterday.

481
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:16,130
[Walt] Mr. McKinnon, thanks for joining us.

482
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:18,632
I was hoping that you and Mr. Collette here

483
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:22,862
could go through some of the
details of your assailants with us.

484
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,408
That way, we might be able to
piece together a description.

485
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:31,287
Do you recognize either of these two men?

486
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:36,399
You know, it was dark, and
the fellas kept their masks on.

487
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,463
I don't think I could really
recognize any of the people involved.

488
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:45,260
Not even the one who sewed
up your gunshot wound?

489
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,851
How long did it take for you
to call 911 after you got shot?

490
00:27:55,337 --> 00:27:58,005
Pretty hard to pin down. Um...

491
00:27:58,006 --> 00:28:00,524
You know, I think I blacked
out in there somewhere.

492
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:04,636
I don't even remember being sewn up.

Well, in a crisis, our brains can
only handle so much information.

496
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:15,438
Our memory of the details
gets all fogged up.

497
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,500
I saw it happen all the time in Iraq.

498
00:28:25,908 --> 00:28:28,369
There was something weird
going on in there, wasn't there?

nervous around Sergeant Van Zandt.

501
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,227
[Walt] I don't know.

502
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,254
McKinnon's injury isn't severe.

503
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:41,464
When's he scheduled to be released?

504
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:42,674
[Ferg] Tomorrow.

Yeah, he offered me six figures.

517
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,717
I turned him down, of course,

518

so that I could do some background
checks on my dad's deputy applicants.

I thought he'd give me a chance.

- You have a record, Travis.
- Misdemeanors.

549
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,185
Dumb mistakes. Or maybe
you don't have any of those.

550
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:43,438
You know, I might not come
from money like Branch did.

551
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:46,400
But I'll tell you one thing... I'm
a much better person than he ever was.

552
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:47,650
And Walt hired him.

But would you have made a better deputy?

554
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:57,202
You know, me and Branch, we played
football ever since we were little kids,

555
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:58,703
and he was always the starting QB.

556
00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:00,973
And me, I was just a blocking back.

557
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,666
But when we graduated from high school,

558
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,061
guess who went on to
play Division I football.

559

It sure as hell wasn't Branch Connally.

00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:10,632
And why's that?

561
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,467
Because I played harder than he did

562
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:16,263
and because I cared more about helping
my team than padding my own stats.

So, I've, uh, been thinking
about this warehouse robbery.

574
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:14,195
Maybe the pseudoephedrine
wasn't actually the target.

575
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:16,739
You think they were after the Zoloft?

576
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,159
Yeah, well, I Googled it last night.

577
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,537
Zoloft is prescribed a
lot for people with PTSD.

578
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:24,706
If somebody knew about
Brandi's Collette's condition,

579
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:27,935
they might have assumed that she
was on Zoloft while she was alive.

580
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:31,397
And a cabinet full of pills
after she wasn't, so...

00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:32,398
Right.

00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:48,414
to try and peddle off some baggies
of Z-loft on us at like half-price.

586
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,190
I didn't send anybody to do that.

to the terms of your probation.

If you've got any questions
about the legality of all this,

595
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:16,066
we can call your probation officer
right now and go over the details.

It's nice weather, huh?

597
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:34,543
Once you slide that bag my way,
I will take it and walk away.

598
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,881
You will find an envelope full of
money under the bench, as discussed.

599
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:02,095
Shit.

600
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:05,867
You seem to be in a hurry to
sell off those pills for cheap.

601
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:11,563
Most street dealers I know make their
money just selling a little bit at a time.

602
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:13,833
I'm not a dealer. I'm an idiot, and a...

603
00:35:19,905 --> 00:35:23,050
And a broke vet with too many bills.

604
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:25,761
Think that makes it okay
to peddle illegal drugs?

605
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,805
I was desperate, okay?

606
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:31,266
Every single job I apply for, every
single job, you know what they tell me?

607
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,669
They say I don't have the right
education or the right experience.

608
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,339
Apparently, my military service, well,
that's just a black mark on my résumé.

609
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,569
They all think that I've got PTSD,
TBI, or some other alphabet soup

610
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:44,071
that's gonna have me shooting
up the place or something.

611
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:48,516
So, your solution is to steal
some Zoloft pills and sell them?

612
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:51,018
I didn't... I didn't steal them.

613
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,162
I found them.

614
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:55,999
- Yes, like Columbus found America.
- No, seriously.

615
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:59,002
I heard about this church on highway 12,

616
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,506
and they had a stash of free
anti-depressants for vets in need.

617
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:05,241
So I went to the church,
I dug around. I found some.

618
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:09,412
Hey, everybody assumes that
I'm this traumatized vet anyway.

619
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:11,807
I might as well profit from it.

620
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:14,560
So, who's distributing
these pills for free?

621
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,211
I don't know.

622
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:19,147
I just kind of assumed it was Hector.

623
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:21,609
Hector is dead.

624
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:23,802
No, he's not, man.

00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,628
You do surveillance like this often?

627
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,339
Whenever Walt tells me to.

628
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,950
Yeah, and he sounds like a boss
that you don't want to cross.

629
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:49,386
[Ferg] What do you mean?

630
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:55,183
Didn't he hunt down and gut the guy that
murdered his wife Charles Bronson-style?

631
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,211
He was under federal
investigation for it, right?

632
00:36:58,212 --> 00:37:00,522
And cleared of any wrongdoing.

633
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:01,690
Right.

634
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,925
Hey, sorry, Ferg.

635
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:06,302
I just want to know what
I'm getting myself into.

636
00:37:06,303 --> 00:37:07,404
You know what I mean?

637
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,931
My instructors at the academy,
they were really by-the-book.

638
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:12,827
Here, you can drive whatever you
want. You can wear whatever you want.

639
00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:17,689
Hell, it's like the sheriff cares
more about books than physical fitness.

640
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,083
- You know what I mean?
- That's the third time.

641
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,420
- Third time what?
- Third time that truck's driven past us.

642
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:26,823
Is it a blue pickup with
Colorado plates, right?

643
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:27,758
Yep.

644
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,283
Yeah, we've been made. [sighs]

645
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:31,595
What, you think someone's
trying to get at Lee McKinnon?

646
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:35,474
Well, if they are, they're not gonna do
it with me sitting here in my uniform.

647
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,417
Look, I'm gonna drive off,

648
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:40,211
but I'm gonna leave one of you here
to see if that truck comes back.

649
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:41,254
Yeah, I got it.

650
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:48,177
Uh, don't take this the wrong way,
Monte, but you look exactly like a cop.

651
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:49,596
[chuckles]

652
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:50,931
Zachary's got this one.

653
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,033
[Zachary] All right.

654
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,517
- Got to let him out.
- Sorry.

655
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:55,828
Push it up.

656
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,748
[Ferg] Zachary.

657
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,692
Take this.

658
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,945
Pretend you're getting
signatures for a petition.

659
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:06,028
All right.

660
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,131
[engine turns over]

661
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,104
[Vic] So, this Dwight Brisco guy said he
got the anti-depressants from inside here?

662
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,692
He also said Hector's still alive,
so I'm not sure how reliable he is.

663
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:32,114
So, you're taking this
search pretty seriously.

664
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:35,475
Of course I'm taking it seriously.

665
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:37,870
Two people have been shot.

666
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:40,915
I was talking about the deputy search.

667
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:47,421
Well, can't get it wrong again...

668
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:52,217
and hire another deputy who can't
handle the strain of the job.

669
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:55,596
I noticed you've been pretty
quiet about the whole thing.

670
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:58,015
What do you think of the candidates?

671
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,226
I think I should just leave that up to you.

672
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,479
I haven't been the best
judge of character lately.

673
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:07,733
[notes play]

674
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:13,822
[piano key clicks]

675
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:37,012
So, we're looking for
a patriotic Robin Hood?

676
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,454
Yeah.

677
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:41,224
[boy imitating airplane]

678
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,445
Gather up all the pills that you find.

679
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:09,753
[indistinct talking]

680
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:27,813
Bible study?

681
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,607
Support group for Army wives.

682
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:33,276
Quack from the V.A. organized it.

683
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,238
[Rebecca] Gareth wasn't even eating.

684
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:40,516
He believes that tapeworms
were living under his scars

685
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:42,661
and feeding off of everything that he ate.

686
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:44,163
How is Gareth now?

687
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:47,899
Uh... better.

688
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,336
He came with me today,
and he's eating again.

689
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:53,088
Good.

690
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:58,260
I still... I still don't feel
comfortable leaving him alone with Eli.

691
00:40:58,326 --> 00:40:59,285
That's okay.

692
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:03,640
But, uh... he's better.

693
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,560
Good.

694
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:10,689
[Walt] You think these had something
to do with Gareth's recovery?

695
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:14,735
- What?
- [Walt] I found them in the chapel.

696
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:18,972
I'm guessing these are
the same anti-depressants

697
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,533
that were recently stolen
from a local warehouse.

698
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:26,121
Our husbands need those pills.

699
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:29,750
Our families need those pills.

700
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,543
Don't you wonder how you got them?

701
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,794
Why should we?

702
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:36,548
Do you think civilians wonder
where they get their freedom?

703
00:41:36,615 --> 00:41:40,910
No, they just assume it's always
gonna be there... for free.

704
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:43,204
[Rebecca] Whoever stole
those pills is a saint.

705
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:45,390
I'd like to thank them.

706
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:47,416
You should say your thank-yous now.

707
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,836
There's a good chance that
person is here in this room.

708
00:41:49,837 --> 00:41:52,630
Look, I don't see any
criminals in here, Sheriff.

709
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:54,775
Just some good people in need.

710
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,651
[Vic] So, this looks like it's all of them.

711
00:41:57,928 --> 00:41:59,971
We'll take them back to the station.

712
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:02,699
You, me, and Dr. Monaghan.

713
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:06,120
Is this really necessary?

714
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:19,258
Dr. Monaghan, you've already made it clear
that you're passionate about your work

715
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:22,785
and that you also feel
frustrated and helpless.

716
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:24,411
Providing you with clear motivation

717
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:26,747
to get the pills to the men
and women you feel need them.

718
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:29,935
Now we find you at the very church
where these pills are being given away,

719
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:31,627
not to mention that the gunshot victim

720
00:42:31,628 --> 00:42:36,216
at the warehouse where the pills were
stolen received very capable first aid.

721
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:38,425
As if trained by a medical
professional, right?

722
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:40,511
Yes, I got the implication.

723
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:44,407
Look, I understand your suspicions,
okay? But I am not involved in this.

724
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:47,077
Although, in all honesty,
you know what? I wish I was.

725
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:49,145
Because it's been such
a roaring success so far?

726
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,231
No, because if I was involved,

727
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:55,235
I could make sure that these people are
actually getting the right medication.

728
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:59,655
You know, it takes hours of testing
to make a proper diagnosis, okay?

729
00:42:59,656 --> 00:43:02,200
You don't just... just, you
know, do a couple Google searches,

730
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:05,245
kick back some anti-depressants,
and hope for the best.

731
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,621
You actually have to know
the person's medical history,

732
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:09,599
their family history,
you know, what kind of...

733
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:13,020
So, you don't support this
kind of psychiatric vigilantism?

734
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:16,463
No, I don't. I understand
it, and I sympathize with it.

735
00:43:16,464 --> 00:43:17,673
But, no, I don't support it.

736
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:20,676
I think it's dangerous and
short-sighted and reckless.

737
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:23,446
As reckless as breaking
in to Greg Collette's home?

738
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,306
You know, I have a colleague

739
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:28,952
who specializes in aggressive behavior
disorders, and I can give you his number.

740
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:32,331
Doctor, you know where Greg lives.

741
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:36,276
Come on, Sheriff, you
seem like a smart man.

742
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:38,628
I mean, really, do I strike
you as the sort of person

743
00:43:38,695 --> 00:43:40,780
who is gonna throw her medical license away

744
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:42,949
and bust into a patient's
house guns blazing?

745
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,866
I mean...

746
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:47,036
Well, I've seen things on
this job surprise me more.

747
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:48,871
You put someone in a bad enough corner,

748
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:51,165
they'll do just about
anything to get out of it.

749
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,393
[knock on door]

750
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,145
You're gonna want to hear this.

751
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:57,022
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

752
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:05,263
So, guess who showed up at Lee
McKinnon's house after he was released.

753
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:06,823
Sergeant Marc Van Zandt.

754
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,642
He was driving a blue pickup
truck with Colorado plates.

755
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:12,537
That Zachary identified.

756
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:17,024
McKinnon let the sergeant in before
he even had a chance to knock.

757
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:20,736
He was inside for just under five
minutes, and then Van Zandt left.

758
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:24,907
So, obviously, Lee McKinnon
isn't just a victim in this.

759
00:44:24,908 --> 00:44:27,827
It's starting to look like Lee
McKinnon and Sergeant Van Zandt

760
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:29,430
were in on this heist together.

761
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:51,826
Is everything okay?

762
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:56,605
Why would Lee McKinnon
and Sergeant Van Zandt

763
00:44:56,606 --> 00:45:00,693
break in to Greg Collette's house
and steal Brandi's engagement ring

764
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:02,463
if Greg's a friend?

765
00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:07,217
- [sighs]
- [footsteps approach]

766
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:12,955
Seems that the only thing that's
clear right now is the why.

767
00:45:12,956 --> 00:45:15,791
Whoever did this did it to help.

768
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:17,835
Which brings up another why.

769
00:45:17,836 --> 00:45:19,962
Why do we got to break our
backs to solve this thing

770
00:45:19,963 --> 00:45:23,549
when all the person was trying to do
is get medicine to people who needed it?

771
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,943
It's not like anyone was killed.

772
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:27,862
Not this time.

773
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,739
What do you mean?

774
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:31,783
We've confiscated all their pills.

775
00:45:33,268 --> 00:45:36,062
What's gonna happen when they hit again?

776
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:37,831
Because they will.

777
00:46:03,924 --> 00:46:05,359
What's going on?

778
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:08,320
My damn engine crapped out.

779
00:46:08,387 --> 00:46:10,197
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

780
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:13,033
Well, you can start by doing
exactly what I say when I say it.

781
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,327
Or you can take your
chances with that grenade.

782
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:17,329
Shit, man! Is that thing for real?

783
00:46:17,396 --> 00:46:19,080
You tell me.

784
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:21,315
- Hands on the wheel!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

785
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:22,917
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

786
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:31,784
Keep your eyes forward!
Don't look at my face!

787
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:34,787
You're gonna drive us about a quarter
mile down this road, you understand?

788
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:36,848
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Let's go!

789
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:52,012
We need to hurry this up.

790
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:54,115
Take few more cases,
and that's it, all right?

791
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:56,451
[Walt] Stop right there.

792
00:46:56,518 --> 00:46:58,161
Keep your hands where I can see them.

793
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,123
Get them up.

794
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,167
Off the truck.

795
00:47:05,986 --> 00:47:07,421
Back up.

796
00:47:08,238 --> 00:47:10,281
Move to the van.

797
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:11,716
Move it!

798
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:15,178
Turn away.

799
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:18,223
Keep them up.

800
00:47:18,957 --> 00:47:20,016
Keep them up.

801
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:32,613
Wrist in that hook.

802
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,448
One each.

803
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,033
On the hook.

804
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:38,910
Do it!

805
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,581
I figured you guys would
still want these pills.

806
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,916
You wouldn't hit the warehouse again,

807
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:48,420
so I've been riding every Zoloft
shipment the last couple of days.

808
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:51,548
You need to know, Sheriff, we
never meant for anyone to get hurt.

809
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:55,176
Is that right? Tell that to Greg Collette.

810
00:48:03,126 --> 00:48:04,478
Greg?

811
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:08,856
I thought you were Lee McKinnon.

812
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:10,966
I'm sorry, Sheriff. I...

813
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:13,027
Lee McKinnon didn't have
anything to do with this.

814
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:16,615
Why'd you go to McKinnon's
house after he got released?

815
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:19,559
We went to his house to make
sure we had our stories straight

816
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,286
and to thank him for not turning us in.

817
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:23,354
Lee was supposed to be
on break at that hour.

818
00:48:23,355 --> 00:48:28,335
When he came up on us, I panicked,
then I fired, then he fired back.

819
00:48:29,486 --> 00:48:31,754
That's why you got shot
with Lee McKinnon's gun.

820
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:32,797
Yes, sir.

821
00:48:32,864 --> 00:48:35,074
[Marc] After Greg left the warehouse,

822
00:48:35,075 --> 00:48:37,927
I cleaned up all his blood,
I took care of McKinnon's leg.

823
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:42,039
Gave me an opportunity to talk to him,
explain why we were after those pills.

824
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,141
He agreed not to talk.

825
00:48:50,006 --> 00:48:54,110
So, the home invasion was just a
cover-up for your gunshot wound.

826
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,448
No drugged-up robber. No fight for a gun.

827
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:01,576
No stolen engagement ring.

828
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:03,852
I just thought that if I could make sure

829
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:06,564
that the other soldiers
got what Brandi didn't,

830
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:12,754
if they got the help that she didn't...
I'd have something to live for.

831
00:49:20,828 --> 00:49:21,888
Right.

832
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:24,849
So, it was just you two at
the warehouse robbery, right?

833
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,268
Yes, sir. That's right. It was just us.

834
00:49:27,335 --> 00:49:28,770
Except it wasn't.

835
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:31,255
Greg just got shot.

836
00:49:31,256 --> 00:49:33,858
I don't think you drove
yourself home from the warehouse

837
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:36,737
and staged that break-in by yourself.

838
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,137
Marc didn't drive you.

839
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:39,864
He was busy sewing up Lee.

840
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:42,057
- So who helped you?
- I did.

841
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:44,703
Put your gun down and let these men go.

842
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:47,372
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

843
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:52,234
I can set down my gun down.
I can't let these men go.

844
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:54,570
Look, just take his gun and leave.

845
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:56,297
We agreed nobody else gets hurt.

846
00:49:56,364 --> 00:49:59,659
I'm not leaving you
behind. Put your gun down.

847
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,052
Put it down!

848
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,143
And the other one.

849
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,271
Put it down.

850
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:19,028
Then move over there.

851
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:21,448
Move!

852
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:26,077
He hasn't seen your face. He
can't identify you, so just leave!

853
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:27,495
Leave now!

854
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:29,122
Rebecca, what are you doing?

855
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:31,773
I'm not going anywhere without those pills.

856
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:34,109
Gareth won't even talk about
seeing someone at the V.A.,

857
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,697
and I'm terrified he's gonna
end up just like Brandi.

858
00:50:37,698 --> 00:50:39,633
Eli needs a father.

859
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,050
Eli needs his mother, too.

860
00:50:41,117 --> 00:50:45,012
If you shoot me, my deputies will find you,

861
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,665
arrest you, and put you away
for the rest of your life.

862
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,559
Now, you haven't crossed that line yet.

863
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:51,478
You can still have a
life with your husband.

864
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:53,754
Not without those pills, I can't!

865
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:55,607
Turn around and get on your knees.

866
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:00,987
Get on your knees.

867
00:51:02,013 --> 00:51:03,406
Now.

868
00:51:05,058 --> 00:51:07,494
Get on your knees.

869
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,050
When I lost my wife...

870
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:28,431
I just about gave up on everything.

871
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:34,354
You can see how losing
Brandi has affected Greg.

872
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:37,982
Do you think Gareth will be
able to make it without you?

873
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:40,067
Shut up!

874
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:53,707
Did you ever read Of Mice and Men?

875
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:58,294
There's a scene at the end of the book.

876
00:52:00,238 --> 00:52:03,800
A man named George shoots
and kills his best friend.

877
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,468
It's beautiful.

878
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:11,808
George kills Lennie to
save him from being lynched.

879
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:19,774
When I read the book, I didn't realize
how any act can become an act of love.

880
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:21,943
- [gun cocks]
- Rebecca, no!

881
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:31,393
You think if Gareth could see
your act of love right now...

882
00:52:31,394 --> 00:52:33,788
he might go get the treatment he needs?

883
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:38,793
Maybe he doesn't even need to see it.

884
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:41,504
He just needs to hear about it.

885
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:52,473
If you set your gun down, Rebecca,
we could call Gareth right now.

886
00:52:56,837 --> 00:52:59,522
It'd mean more if he
heard it from you, I think.

887
00:53:11,476 --> 00:53:12,869
[gun clicks]

888
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:20,877
[sobbing]

889
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:07,381
[Walt] Sorry to keep you
waiting. [clears throat]

890
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:09,592
It's been a long week.

891
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:13,304
It's been a long year.

892
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:20,478
Anyway, um, clearly, you're the
two best candidates for this job.

893
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:26,233
I'm not sure either one of you has
demonstrated what I need to see.

894
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:30,971
[Monte] Really?

895
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:33,432
So, you're not gonna offer
the job to either of us?

896
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:35,910
[Walt] No, I'm not.

897
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:38,019
Maybe I rushed into
this process too quickly.

898
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:43,149
Maybe... Maybe I'm holding
you to unrealistic standards.

899
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,046
Yeah, well, maybe you don't
know what the hell you're doing.

900
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,364
I don't know if you realize this.

901
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:52,075
I was doing you a favor by
even applying to this job,

902
00:54:52,076 --> 00:54:54,679
going through this
whole ridiculous process.

903
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:57,473
It's no wonder your last deputy
ran against you as sheriff.

904
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:02,020
If I wasn't so afraid I'd end up dead
like him, I'd do the same damn thing!

905
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:05,147
It's a joke.

906
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:08,401
[door slams]

907
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:19,412
Um... before I leave, um, can
I ask you what I can improve on?

908
00:55:22,732 --> 00:55:27,987
Well, it's not so much there's
any one thing you need to work on.

909
00:55:27,988 --> 00:55:32,050
- It's just...
- It's the assault, isn't it?

910
00:55:32,116 --> 00:55:34,075
It must have come up in
your background checks.

911
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:35,261
I get it.

912
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:38,204
Last deputy didn't respond
too well when he got shot.

913
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,725
No. No, he didn't.

914
00:55:45,672 --> 00:55:48,274
You mind talking about
what happened to you...

915
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:52,361
four years ago?

916
00:55:55,306 --> 00:55:56,866
Yeah, uh...

917
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,327
Um...

918
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:07,026
My brother Phil and I were walking
home one night after a movie

919
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:10,588
when a dark sedan pulled up.

920
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:16,636
The next thing I remember, I
was waking up in a hospital room.

921
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,600
The nurse told me I'd been shot
three times and that Phil was dead.

922
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:27,396
I'm sorry.

923
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,608
That must have been hard.

924
00:56:30,675 --> 00:56:35,696
Yeah, I went through every stage.

925
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:41,577
Anger, guilt, denial, back to anger again.

926
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,648
Then I ran into one of
my brother's work buddies,

927
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:51,253
and, um... he introduced me to tai chi.

928
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:54,757
And it saved me.

929
00:56:54,824 --> 00:56:56,676
How so?

930
00:56:58,285 --> 00:57:00,221
I like to put it like this.

931
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:04,142
I went to church a lot as a kid.

932
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:07,561
And we were always taught
to love our enemies.

933
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:15,402
Tai chi taught me something new...
To love the enemy inside me, as well.

934
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:21,617
So I don't look at peace as
the absence of conflict anymore.

935
00:57:22,435 --> 00:57:25,830
I see it as the acceptance of conflict.

936
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,089
I finally finished your book.

937
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:39,385
Glad I did.

[Walt] So, what would you have done?

939
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:51,814
To keep George from shooting Lennie?

940
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:57,886
I think George shot Lennie 'cause he
felt it was the only option he had left.

941
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:01,199
I'd like to get there before
things ever got that bad.

How about Monday?

944
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:35,733
For what?

945
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,484
First day on the job.

946
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:41,030
Yeah, Monday works for me.

947
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:51,207
So... was that the last test in there?

948
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:54,168
To see which one of us
could handle adversity?

949
00:58:54,986 --> 00:58:56,254
Maybe.

950
00:58:59,323 --> 00:59:00,841
Thanks, Sheriff.
