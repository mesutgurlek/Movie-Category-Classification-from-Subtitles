1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,217
[grunts] Damn it.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,428
Boots are all dirty.

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,889
Now what am I gonna wear out?

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,267
Well, that's what you
get for only having one pair.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,020
You always need four
pairs of boots, Colt.

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,105
One pair of working boots,

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,567
one pair of drinking boots,
two pair for knocking boots.

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,448
The only reason you'd
need two pair of knocking boots

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,117
is if you're doing
it outside on all fours.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,831
No, man.

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,624
You need 'em for when you
gotta jump out of the window

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,917
and leave a pair behind.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,837
If you think you might get caught,

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,274
why don't you just leave the first pair

15
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,419
of boots outside the window?

16
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,653
Damn, Colt, you just changed the game.

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,015
Man, Dad was being a
real hard-ass today, huh?

18
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,100
Yep. [grunts]

19
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,435
I heard him utter every
curse word known to man,

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,855
but I ain't never heard him take
John Deere's name in vain.

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,109
He's just pissed 'cause
Mom didn't wanna move in.

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,649
I haven't seen him that mad since

23
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,302
Obama released his birth certificate.

24
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,703
Wait, what the hell's the
deal with Mom and Dad, man?

25
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,205
I... You know, they seem
like they're getting along so well.

26
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,249
Yeah, I've seen this over and over.

27
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,584
Mom and Dad are like Brooks
& Dunn, you know?

28
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,003
They get back together every few years,

29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,797
and every time they do, it
just gets worse and worse.

30
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,885
- [Colt] Oh, hey, Dad.
- Hey, Pop.

31
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,137
How far did you get with the fence?

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,180
Uh, we got to the west creek.

33
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,099
Both of you,

34
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,019
all day, got to the west creek?

35
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,938
There any chance you're saying that

36
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,338
'cause you're just so impressed?

37
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,777
Closed the gate on the way out?

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,570
Yeah.

39
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,824
Yeah, we closed it.
[stutters] I remember it, 'cause I said,

40
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,201
[stammers] "It's awfully windy out,

41
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,287
make sure that gate's
closed tight, Rooster."

42
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,497
[Rooster] Oh, yeah, that's right.

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,861
And then I closed it and I said,

44
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,251
"Hey, Colt, make sure
you go lock that gate."

45
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,671
And then you said to me,

46
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,897
"Oh, man, I'm Colt Bennett.

47
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,530
I don't gotta make sure of nothing."

48
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,341
And then you were like,

49
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,302
"Man, Dad's a real jerk, ain't he?"

50
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,595
[Colt] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,683
[stammers] And then
I said, "Just kidding.

52
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,102
'Cause Dad is not only my father,

53
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,353
he's my best friend."

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,588
But, Dad, you know what, I'm gonna go

55
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,049
check on that gate on Colt's behalf.

56
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,484
Oh, no.

57
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,403
You boys relax.

58
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,030
You've had a long day.

59
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,281
I'll go check on it.

60
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,163
And when I get back,

61
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:40,309
I'll give each of
you a nice foot massage.

62
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,832
I know he's kidding...

63
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,292
but I bet them strong
hands could work wonders.

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,880
Where are you goin'?

65
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,256
Go help Dad.

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,313
You might wanna leave

67
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:56,283
an extra pair of boots outside the barn.

68
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,682
Yeah, I'll come help. [grunts]

69
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,893
[Beau] Son of a bitch!

70
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:05,947
I've missed 15 years,

71
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,004
I can miss one more
night. [clears throat]

72
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,733

74
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,800
- Hey, Hank. Mom.
- Colt.

75
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:18,884
Hey.

76
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,677
How's, uh, life in the Airstream?

77
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,387
Oh, it's good.

78
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,681
Though, ever since I heard what
you and Heather did in there,

79
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,017
I haven't been able to
eat off my kitchen table.

80
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,446
If that's the case,

81
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,046
you might not want to eat off this bar.

82
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,110
Seriously though, you doing okay?

83
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,112
Yeah, I'm good.

84
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,676
I'm more concerned about your father.

85
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,782
How's he holding up?

86
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,701
Today he told me I
make terrible coffee...

87
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,370
told me I can't bale hay for shit...

88
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,756
then he went on a one-hour
rant about how

89
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:52,733
they don't make dirt like they used to.

90
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,715
Look, I'm sorry if what's
going on with your father and I

91
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,633
has made life harder for you.

92
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,510
Hey, who am I to be mad?

93
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,721
You came home, stirred
shit up, and left.

94
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,697
That's a move right out

95
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,348
of the Colt Bennett Playbook. [chuckles]

96
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,685
- Hey, Colt.
- Mmm. Hey, Ab.

97
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,769
Hey, Mrs. Bennett.

98
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,271
Hey, darlin'.

99
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,564
I got you a little
something for your trailer.

100
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,358
Kind of a re-housewarming gift.

101
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,484
Oh.

102
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,693
Really?

103
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,176
I think I warmed it up pretty
good with that fire. [chuckles]

104
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,449
I got it, it's too soon. I'm sorry.

105
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,994
[Maggie] Well, isn't that sweet.

106
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,371
And it's sharp and spiky.

107
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,165
I think I'll put it on my kitchen table.

108
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,086
You just love gifts, don't you?

109
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,210
What're you talking about?

110
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,882
You give my mom a housewarming gift,

111
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,091
you tell me to get Heather a gift,

112
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,635
which gifted me the
greatest gift of all...

113
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,970
a girlfriend.

114
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,556
Aw, that's cute.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,410
You guys gonna hold hands

116
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,666
when you pick her up from junior high?

117
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,102
[laughs sarcastically]

118
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,785
I ain't dating someone from junior high.

119
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:55,712
She's kidding, Hank.

120
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,232
I'm not here to judge.

121
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm telling you,
things were going great.

122
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,588
Now she's in my phone as "Heather"

123
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,637
with two heart emojis.

124
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,699
She used to be in my phone as "Hannah?"

125
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,869
Colt, when is the last time

126
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,312
you were in a real relationship?

127
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,539
Oh, you know what,

128
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,487
I was in a serious relationship

129
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,317
with this girl named Jessie.

130
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,170
- Oh.
- And on our first anniversary,

131
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,712
her husband walked in on us.

132
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,800
Should have left a pair of
boots outside the window.

133
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,511
What?

134
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,847
Ah... [scoffs] Nothing.

135
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,892
I guess, uh, you set the
bar pretty high, girl.

136
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,603
Well, that's very
sweet. It's also very true.

137
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,856
I was your last serious girlfriend?

138
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,826
[stutters] Well,
who are you to be giving

139
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:42,801
relationship advice anyway?

140
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,986
You only been with Kenny.

141
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,864
No! I dated lots of people.

142
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,283
I went out with Steve Williger.

143
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,828
- [tittering] You... Steve Williger?
- What? Yeah.

144
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,247
That guy wore a Star Wars
T-shirt every single day!

145
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,114
[imitating Yoda] "Fashion
sense, I have none." [chuckles]

146
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,422
All right, you can keep going,
dating a cavalcade of women, or...

147
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,382
- Stop.
- It means a parade.

148
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,508
Thank you.

149
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,007
Or you could commit to a relationship

150
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:11,038
and see what it's like to be an adult.

151
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,975
All right, so, you're telling me

152
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,935
that you think I
should commit to a woman

153
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,578
that you think I'm immature for dating?

154
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,813
I'm not talking
about Heather specifically.

155
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,691
I'm talking about the fact that
you're a 34-year-old man

156
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,694
who hasn't had a serious
girlfriend since he was 18.

157
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,448
Yeah.

158
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,493
You know what? You're
right. I need to grow up.

159
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,621
I'm gonna text Heather to tell
her that I'm gonna break up with her.

160
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,625
Oh, my God! No, you cannot
break up with her over text.

161
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,503
True, true, that could get messy.

162
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,299
I'll just wait for her to text me

163
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,489
and then write back,
"New phone. Who dis?"

164
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,680
All right.

165
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,642
If you insist on doing it this way,

166
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,891
at least let me write the text

167
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,486
so you don't seem like a total asshole.

168
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,521
[hesitant groan]

169
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,066
Well, that seems like the
easy way out. Here you go.

170
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,029
But make sure you misspell some
words so she believes it's me.

171
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,448
- "Heather, it's been great seeing you..."
- Oh, oh,

172
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,659
spell "great" G-R-8.

173
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,455
[sighs] "But now is
not a good time for me."

174
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,374
- Yeah.
- "You're a real special girl

175
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,543
and I know you'll find someone great."

176
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,005
- G-R-8.
- G-R-8, yeah. I got it. Gotcha.

177
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,466
- Okay.
- Yeah.

178
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,926
That's perfect. [chuckles]

179
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,636
I should let you break
up with all my girlfriends.

180
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,555
- Send that.
- [chuckles] Yep.

181
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,183
- Bingo. [laughs]
- Yes!

182
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,644
"Heather, I'm coming over.

183
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,102
There's something I need
to tell you in person."

184
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,604
Oh, what the hell?

185
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,148
Welcome to adulthood.

186
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,777
Where are you
going? Hey, come back here!

187
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,235
New phone. Who dis?

188
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,162
Thanks for coming on
such short notice, Dale.

189
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,663
Good to see you.

190
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,790
It's never good to see me, Beau.

191
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,085
The last three times,
it was a cow in labor,

192
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,463
a bull insemination, and
Carol Palmer's wedding.

193
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,550
All of which took three
hours longer than they should have.

194
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,345
Hey, Doc, how's your daughter doin'?

195
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,306
As far as you're
concerned, she's a lesbian.

196
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,728
She sure wasn't in high school.

197
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,443
So, what's going on with the calf, Dale?

198
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,654
[shouting] Damn it, Dale, I said

199
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,472
what's going on with the calf?

200
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,950
Why are you shouting at me?

201
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,954
Because you need a hearing aid, old man.

202
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,874
I do not need a hearing aid.

203
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,128
You need to stop mumbling, Grandpa.

204
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,338
I don't mumble.

205
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,965
Telling me I
mumble... [mumbling indistinctly]

206
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,469
Yeah, yeah, you're both old.

207
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,681
So, uh, Doc, what do you
think's going on with this calf?

208
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,809
Well, looks like a bacteria infection.

209
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,438
Probably brought on by
drinking standing water.

210
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,982
- Son of a bitch.
- Are we gonna lose him?

211
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,734
Not necessarily.

212
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,780
You'll know in 24
hours, one way or the other.

213
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,573
What're our options?

214
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,573
[shouting] For the love of God!

215
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,186
What are our options, you old coot?

216
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,196
Our options are that you adopt

217
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,690
a civil tone with me or I'm leaving!

218
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,794
You're right. I'm sorry.

219
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,712
[softly] Jackass.

220
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,005
Jackass?

221
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,381
Oh, that you can hear!

222
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,543
[sighs] Well, the best thing you can do

223
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,621
for this calf is to start him on...

224
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,849
a series of antibiotics.

225
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,227
But that's gonna cost you money...

226
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,896
and I know you for
being a cheap bastard.

227
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,442
How much you gonna gouge me?

228
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,486
Oh, the whole series will
be about, uh, 250.

229
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,108
250? What, are you taking Charlene

230
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,307
to Rome for your anniversary?

231
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,160
Can you guarantee it's gonna work?

232
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,787
[laughs] You know the answer
to that as well as I do.

233
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,622
It may work, it may not.

234
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,750
"May." Always hated that word.

235
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,086
It's only when my
birthday is, but whatever.

236
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,174
Well, the shots are
cheaper than losing the calf.

237
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,884
Especially this close to market.

238
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,428
Not if we're gonna lose him anyway.

239
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,180
Then we're down 250, plus
1,200 for the calf.

240
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,809
So, what's your professional opinion?

241
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,020
Well, if it was up to
me, I'd give the calf shots.

242
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,148
Of course you would. You
get paid to give shots.

243
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:35,570
You know, I got kicked in the
chest by a mule this morning

244
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,072
and that visit was
pleasanter than this one.

245
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,159
What's it gonna be, Beau?

246
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,455
Look, Dad, if there's no
guarantee it's gonna work,

247
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,098
we should save the money and not do it.

248
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,125
Rooster, nobody asked you.

249
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,627
We're not gonna do it!

250
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,796
Suit yourself. You know the drill.

251
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,091
Push the fluids. Electrolytes,
if you got 'em.

252
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,093
Thanks, Dale.

253
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,805
If you need me, you can
call, I'll be in the neighborhood.

254
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,141
I'm stopping over at the Anderson ranch.

255
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,144
That old man is a bigger
pain in the ass than you are.

256
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,481
I wish that mule had kicked you harder.

257
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,815
What?

258
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,026
Damn it. Get your ears fixed, old man!

259
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,362
I can't even insult you anymore!

260
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,365
Hey, Doc, before you leave, um...

261
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,575
you check out a rash?

262
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,161
Is it on an animal?

263
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,914
Yeah. It's... it's on a rooster.

264
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,586
Well, say "what up" to
your daughter for me.

265
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,130
You know, I do castrations, too.

266
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,393
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey.

267
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,520
So, I got your text.

268
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,646
What'd you want to talk about?

269
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,690
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

270
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,069
look, you know, I know you
liked that lingerie I got you...

271
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,030
No, I loved your gift. I'm
wearing it right now.

272
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,533
Well, not the bottoms.

273
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,285
Oh, good Lord.

274
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,370
Um...

275
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,289
Yeah, look, about that, um...

276
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,877
You know, it's been
real great seeing you.

277
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,341
And you're a super special
girl and I'm sure you'll find a...

278
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,134
motorcade of great guys.

279
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,848
Wait, are you breaking up with me?

280
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,142
- Yeah.
- Oh.

281
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
Okay.

282
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,360
That's it? You ain't gonna cry?

283
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,695
You're not mad? I wore...
I wore this cup for nothing?

284
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,991
Colt, look, I'm just
happy you did it in person

285
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,451
and not over text
like my last boyfriend.

286
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,037
[scoffs] What an asshole, that guy.

287
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,914
Um...

288
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,167
All right, well, cool. [stutters]
You're... sure you're okay?

289
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,170
Colt, I'm not looking to get
married or anything. I'm young.

290
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,263
I thought you wanted to be

291
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,839
in a relationship, you're the old one.

292
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,636
Trust me, it's no big deal.

293
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,430
All right. Wow, this is...
That's... This is really cool of you.

294
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,765
All right. Good.

295
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,767
So, uh...

296
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,019
guess I'll see you around then.

297
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,730
Yeah. Or we could keep having sex.

298
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,941
I am so glad I didn't
break up with you over text.

299
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,989
Hey, how's he doing?

300
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,574
[Beau] Fine.

301
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,661
I brought you some soup from the bar.

302
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,163
Hank threw in some deer jerky.

303
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,874
Although I saw the front
of his car was smashed in,

304
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,709
so eat it at your own risk.

305
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,961
Not hungry.

306
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,089
You gotta take care of yourself.

307
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,508
I'm doing all right.

308
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:48,471
Okay, we're up to three-word
answers. That's progress.

309
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,600
Why are you here?

310
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,440
Because you're my husband.

311
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,112
I'm not sure that word means
the same to both of us.

312
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,114
Beau, I love you.

313
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,034
I'm just not sure that
I can live with you.

314
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,120
What man doesn't want to hear that?

315
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,374
I don't want to hurt you. It's
just the way it has to be.

316
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,658
That's the last thing I say to my steers

317
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:21,987
just before I take
them to be slaughtered.

318
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,047
Not you.

319
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,010
I just don't understand what's
wrong with what we have.

320
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,471
Are you kidding me?

321
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,557
We are a husband and a wife and
we live in separate houses.

322
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,059
Might as well live in California.

323
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,354
It's worked for us for years.

324
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,773
Well, it's not working for me anymore.

325
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:45,987
Really? 'Cause, right now, I only
see you about 10% of the time,

326
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,615
but when I do, I have
100% of your attention.

327
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,157
If I move back in,

328
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,578
I'd have 10% of your
attention 100% of the time.

329
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,247
I got zero percent for you right now...

330
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,937
'cause I gotta worry about this calf.

331
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,127
Oh, come on, Beau.

332
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,505
I worked this ranch
with you for 30 years.

333
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,257
I know there's nothing to
do for that calf but wait.

334
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,426
You're just using it as an
excuse not to talk about this.

335
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,679
Then why are we still talking?

336
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,141
[scoffs] You know, your
attitude has made me change my mind.

337
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,145
I'd love to move back in and
have every day be just like this.

338
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,690
Thanks for the soup.

339
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,651
Thanks for nothing.

340
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,197
What? She started it.

341
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,040
Hey, Mom, where you goin'?

342
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,876
You okay?

343
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,711
Yeah, I'm fine.

344
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,046
What happened? Did the cow die?

345
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,675
Did Dad die? Did you kill Dad?

346
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,928
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.
- [engine starts]

347
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,176
Are you sure you're all right?

348
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,676
You want me to come down to the bar?

349
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,786
Not to drink, but, you know, to talk.

350
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,165
Although I'll probably still
have a drink, I mean, it is a bar.

351
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,939
No, just stay with your dad.

352
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,357
Love you, Jameson.

353
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,320
Love you too, Margaret.

354
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,158
I don't know why I said your
first name like that.

355
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,829
You did it and it felt right, then
I did it and it felt really weird.

356
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,710
Love you, Mom! [chuckles]
There it is! That's better!

357
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,339
Hey, Dad, what happened with
Mom? Why is she so upset?

358
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,635
Dad? Beau?

359
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,096
That was weird.

360
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,681
Drake, where you going?

361
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,850
Hey, where you going?

362
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,394
Why won't anybody answer me?

363
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,900
Hey, what's going on?

364
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,988
I'm calling the vet. I'm
getting the antibiotics.

365
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,250
I thought we decided that
was too expensive.

366
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,993
I changed my mind.

367
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,663
What? You don't change your mind.

368
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,498
You still think left-handed people

369
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,667
just haven't learned how
to use their right hand yet.

370
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:09,421
That calf will bring $1,200
if we can get it to the sale.

371
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,882
I'm gonna make the gamble.

372
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,677
Well, $250 is a lot of money right now.

373
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,822
What the hell are we supposed to do

374
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,038
if something else goes wrong, huh?

375
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,618
I mean, Colt's already burned
down the barn and Mom's Airstream.

376
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,351
Who knows what he's gonna torch next?

377
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,353
It's not a discussion, Rooster.

378
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,938
It's just one calf.

379
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,775
Did I miss the part where
I asked for your opinion?

380
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,945
I think you're letting your
emotions get the better of you.

381
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,989
I'm saving that damn calf!

382
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,490
Fine! Call the vet!

383
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,076
You win, Dale.

384
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,955
I'll buy your damn drugs if you
think it'll save my fucking calf.

385
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,207
Oh!

386
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,543
I am so sorry, Charlene.

387
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,050
I am not a reckless driver.

388
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,391
I'm just saying, you were staring at me

389
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,911
and you almost ran into
that convertible.

390
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,097
[chuckles] Yeah, well, you
both had your top down.

391
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,018
Why is there a light on in your barn?

392
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,102
Oh.

393
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,230
Dad's probably still out
there with that sick calf.

394
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,524
Oh, no, that's sad.

395
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,168
Should we go see if he needs some help?

396
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,071
Oh, no. No. My dad's not big on help.

397
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,198
Pretty sure if he was
stranded on a desert island,

398
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,522
he'd write a message in the
sand that said, "I got this."

399
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,494
Colt, come on.

400
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,979
We should at least go check on him.

401
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,916
If you do, I won't make
you snuggle me after sex.

402
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,753
But I like that part.

403
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,218
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mr. Bennett.

404
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,553
- Hi, Heather.
- How's he doin'?

405
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,432
Well, he's got a bacterial infection.

406
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,643
- I just gave him a dose of antibiotics.
- Poor guy.

407
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,856
Same thing happened to my calf in 4-H.

408
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,441
You were in 4-H? I didn't know that.

409
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,737
To be fair, we don't do a
lot of talking. [chuckles]

410
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,865
I was in 4-H when I was a kid.

411
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,366
I didn't know that.

412
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,036
To be fair, we don't do a
whole lot of talking either.

413
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,834
I loved 4-H. I named
my first calf The Duke,

414
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,252
after John Wayne.

415
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,756
I named mine Dairy
Potter, after Harry Potter.

416
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,924
That's cute.

417
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,801
At least I think it is.

418
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,346
I had a gerbil named Warren Moon.

419
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,060
- You still remember the pledge?
- [chuckles]

420
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,022
"I pledge my head to clearer thinking.

421
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,689
My heart to greater loyalty."

422
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,276
[both] "My hands to larger service...

423
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,820
and my health to better living."

424
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,072
That was really cool.

425
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,365
[both] "For my club..."

426
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,909
Oh, good, there's more.

427
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:47,246
[both] "...my community,
my country, and my world."

428
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,749
Amen. [chuckles]

429
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,919
[clears throat] Okay, this is great.

430
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,378
Heather, do you wanna head inside?

431
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,338
Did your calf survive?

432
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,507
Yeah, he did.

433
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,844
It was a rough 48
hours, but he pulled through.

434
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,888
Well, that's what we need here.

435
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,058
Two weeks later, he was
mauled by a mountain lion. [chuckles]

436
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,225
Oh, shit.

437
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,105
Warren Moon choked on
a piece of Lite-Brite.

438
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,235
Tried to give him the
Heimlich. Crushed his vertebrae.

439
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,780
Real sad.

440
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,577
You know, Mr. Bennett,

441
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,581
there's nothing much
more you can do for him now.

442
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,998
You should probably just
try to go get some rest.

443
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,750
Yeah, you're right about
that. But I'm fine here.

444
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,087
You guys go have a good night.

445
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,463
Come on, Heather.

446
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,884
You know...

447
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,428
it's just bad luck, really.

448
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,056
Happens to even the
greatest ranchers. Obviously.

449
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,142
Well, I appreciate you
saying that, sweetheart.

450
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,435
[Heather chuckles]

451
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,856
- Good night, Mr. Bennett.
- Good night. Say hi to your mom.

452
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,773
Good night, Dad.

453
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,194
Right.

454
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,154
Good luck.

455
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,284
Dad took quite a shine to you.

456
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,870
Well, yeah, he's so
easy to get along with.

457
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:09,954
[laughs]

458
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,914
Oh, you're serious.

459
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,582
Oh, no, he's not.

460
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,585
I can't believe he hugged you.

461
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,088
'Course he only hugged
me twice in my life...

462
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,923
and one time, I think he just tripped

463
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,300
and grabbed me to keep from falling.

464
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,501
Guys do that to me all the time.

465
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,580
Except they always land like this.

466
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,395
Honestly...

467
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,314
I never took you for the 4-H type.

468
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,775
What type did you
think I was? [chuckles]

469
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,695
- I don't know. Hot cheerleader?
- [both chuckle]

470
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,614
Yeah, well, I wasn't.

471
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,909
Doesn't it make you
mad when people assume

472
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,872
you're just a really
attractive football player?

473
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,996
No. It's awesome.

474
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,248
[chuckles]

475
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,334
Yeah, well, I was a tomboy. It's
what got me competing in rodeos.

476
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,836
Whoa, hold on. You were in rodeos?

477
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,797
Yeah! Still am.

478
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,264
Me and my cousin were Colorado

479
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,950
All Girls Roping Champs last year.

480
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,428
Wow. You guys must've been really good.

481
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,388
Hell yeah, we were good.

482
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,432
I mean, you think you've got a
lot of trophies up in your room,

483
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,635
just wait till you see mine.

484
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,236
[chuckles]

485
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,918
I even got a picture
with the president.

486
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,979
Really? W?

487
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,855
- Obama.
- Oh.

488
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,448
So, uh, what's up, you still compete?

489
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,451
Yeah. Got a roping in a couple weeks.

490
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,329
Cool. I'd love to come
down and see you ride.

491
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,871
Really?

492
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:38,125
Yeah. But just know, if you
mess up, you will be heckled.

493
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,418
Boo!

494
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,380
[chuckles] I'd like it if
you came out and watched.

495
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,631
I work really hard at it.

496
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,799
Yeah.

497
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,472
Maybe afterward we could
get dinner or something?

498
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,224
Sure. I think that'd be fun.

499
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,516
I think it would.

500
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,935
So, we're still having
sex tonight, right?

501
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,104
Fuck yeah.

502
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,565
[sighs]

503
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,317
So, roping, huh?

504
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,861
Tied up a calf, you ever tie up a colt?

505
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,034
And the boy's crying, "Shane! Shane!

506
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,870
Come back, Shane."

507
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,958
Then Shane rides off into the night.

508
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,381
I don't know why, but it
gets me every time, too.

509
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,050
I remember that movie.

510
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,387
We watched it on our honeymoon.

511
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,430
Three times.

512
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,600
You drive all the way back out here

513
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,853
to tell me that I ruined our
honeymoon, too? [sniffles]

514
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,813
No. I didn't go home.

515
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,525
I've just been driving around, thinking.

516
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,361
I... I came up here
before to see if I could help you,

517
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,321
I didn't wanna add to your problems.

518
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,074
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

519
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,910
I should have taken
the time to talk to you.

520
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,557
If it makes you feel any better,

521
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,190
I burned my tongue on the soup.

522
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,794
[chuckles] Actually, yeah. It does.

523
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,006
Beau, I... I wanna be with you.

524
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,509
I want to be with you too, Mags.

525
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,179
But I want a lot of other things, too.

526
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,556
I want my bar.

527
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,183
I want to travel.

528
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,935
And I want my
Airstream. It's my retreat.

529
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,229
It's where I think, and
dream, and, I don't know,

530
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,236
get high and listen to Bonnie Raitt,

531
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,131
and cook burritos naked. [chuckles]

532
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:30,112
I just don't know if I can do those
things if we're living together.

533
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,531
Well...

534
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,991
I suppose I can get to
like Bonnie Raitt, but...

535
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,162
the burritos are a deal-breaker.

536
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,789
What about you?

537
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,791
Aren't there other things you want?

538
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,418
Here's what I want, Mags...

539
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,878
I want you...

540
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,424
me, and the ranch.

541
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,302
The boys are optional.

542
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,764
Well, you have all that.

543
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,892
I'm 70 years old.

544
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,188
I don't know how much time I have left.

545
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,734
I want to live under
the same roof as my wife.

546
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,655
I like my life the way
it is. I like my space.

547
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,658
You like it more than being a family?

548
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,951
We are a family, Beau.

549
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,829
We haven't been a family since you left.

550
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,917
And if there's no
chance in changing that...

551
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,963
then maybe we oughta call it quits.

552
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,593
Are you talking about a divorce?

553
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,264
I guess so.

554
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,099
Wow.

555
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,186
There it is.

556
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,745
Hey, where you been?

557
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,249
Dropping off Heather. What
are you guys still doing up?

558
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,795
- [Rooster grunts]
- Calf's dead.

559
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,589
Shit.

560
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,344
Sorry, Dad.

561
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,764
Well, I should've listened to Rooster.

562
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,891
Could have gone either way.

563
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,228
Don't ever apologize for
not taking Rooster's advice.

564
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,232
It's been a lousy couple of days.

565
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,986
And all I got to show for it
is a vet bill for a dead calf.

566
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,240
How's things with Ma?

567
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,409
I don't wanna talk about it.

568
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,535
You sure?

569
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,786
Yeah.

570
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,283
All right. Let's get the tractor

571
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:52,069
and put that calf in the ground.

572
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,215
We can take care of that in the morning.

573
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,550
No.

574
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,634
Today sucked.

575
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,887
Let's get it over
with, put it behind us.

576
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,640
He's right.

577
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,342
Plus, Colt's volunteering for work.

578
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,878
We can't miss this opportunity.

579
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,774
Yeah, it's not like I'm going
to sleep tonight, anyway.

580
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,617
Thanks, boys.

581
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,162
Look... Dad, I'm just glad you...

582
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,373
[grunts]

583
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,048
I feel so safe.

584
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,552
Dude, that does not count.

585
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,681
I'm still up four hugs to two.
