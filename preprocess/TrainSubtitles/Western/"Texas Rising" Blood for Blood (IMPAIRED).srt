00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,333
I just fight for the liberty of my people.

172
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,195
(Man): Your Excellency.

173
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,179
You are needed.

174
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:23,392
I'm sorry. It's important.

175
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:52,146
They are frightened.

176
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,759
Lorca, they say, have risen from
the dead of the Alamo and Goliad.

177
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:57,485
They believe his spirit comes for you

178
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,438
and brings death to everyone around you.

179
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,607
It's a stupid Indian legend.

180
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:05,076
It's a peasant superstition.

181
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,325
But it's taking hold.

182
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,038
<i>Señor, por favor.</i>

183
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,257
<i>Señor.</i>

184
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,288
On your feet.

185
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,588
This is not the work of a ghost

186
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,890
or a demon!

187
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,286
This is the work of a man!

188
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,770
Just a man.

189
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,773
Get those men down from there.

190
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:55,459
(Speaks Spanish)

191
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:57,783
(Speaks Spanish)

192
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,501
(Metal scraping)

193
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,393
(Woman): We need to talk
to him. We need his help.

194
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,511
- (Man): Don't worry.
- (Woman): I'll come with you.

195
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:17,487
- We'll talk to him right now.
- (Woman): All right.

196
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,920
Beg pardon.

197
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,481
But I gave these people my word

198
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:29,443
I'd take them across the Sabine.

199
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,632
Thing is, Comanche are on the
war trail to the north of us,

200
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,793
and the Mexican army's
loose between the coast

201
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:38,719
and God-knows-where,
coming this way.

202
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,360
We believe we'll be
better off with you, sir.

203
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,630
On our own, I'm afraid
these people might die.

204
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,335
I kill Mexicans.

205
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,241
It's hardly a one-man job.

206
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,160
If we got to die, we'd
prefer to go down fighting.

207
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,348
My word is absolute.

208
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:07,918
No argument from me.

209
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,628
I'm Cole Hornfischer.

210
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,311
I... I never caught yours.

211
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,480
Well, we thank you, sir.

212
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,413
We thank you.

213
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,454
(Indistinct chatter)

214
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:38,196
(Doc Ewing): Yeah, we were right.

215
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:41,366
Ankle's sprained, not broke.

216
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,591
Cuts and bruises about all healed up.

217
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,738
Told you the doc could fix you up.

218
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,915
Yeah, pretty soon you'll be able
to run away from this feller.

219
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:53,517
He was very gallant trying
to relieve me of my embarrassment.

220
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:56,581
Well, I hope you stay around awhile.

221
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,548
I could use all the help I can get.

222
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:03,196
Thanks, Doc.

223
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:10,812
Pardon me, nurse.

224
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,093
(Doc Ewing): Sarah!

225
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:15,552
I got this real bad ache
I want you to look at.

226
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,521
Have to be in private, though.

227
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,758
- (Doc Ewing): Sarah?
- I can't talk to you.

228
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,443
Hey.

229
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,700
I ain't gonna bite you.

230
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,502
Boy!

231
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:30,859
Boy, your rudeness appalls me.

232
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,940
Under no circumstances

233
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,720
are you to even look at my daughter.

234
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,338
You understand me?

235
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,674
(Whistles)

236
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,844
Unless you're in dire
need of medical attention,

237
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,188
I suggest you just go
on about your business.

238
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,219
I thought this is a free country, sawbones.

239
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:51,853
Least that's what I'm fighting for.

240
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,989
Just get on out of here. Go on.

241
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,948
Clear out of here!

242
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,700
(Whistling)

243
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,926
(Upbeat fiddle music)

244
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,344
Hey, you're a Ranger.

245
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,018
Reckon you know all about guns.

246
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,547
I know about a lot of things.

247
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,849
Who the hell are you?

248
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,217
You don't remember?

249
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,852
Name's Colby Pitt.

250
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,221
You and the Rangers swum me
and my sister across the Lupe.

251
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,341
Swum half of Texas across that river.

252
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:30,115
You trying to break that pistol?

253
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:32,247
No, sir. It's my daddy's.

254
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,302
Reverend's been keeping care of it.

255
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:38,538
But seeing as how I'm of age
and my daddy being dead,

256
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,383
he gave it to me to keep.

257
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,569
But the lock won't stay cocked.

258
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,239
You tried taking it to the blacksmith?

259
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,616
You know where I can find him?

260
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,410
Over in that tent there,

261
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,546
snorting like a peach orchard boar.

262
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,797
What do I tell him?

263
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,500
"Fix my damn gun, you lazy son of a bitch."

264
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,252
(Karnes): Tell him you
ride with the Rangers.

265
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,337
If he hears that, he'll fix
your pistol straightaway.

266
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:01,806
(Knowles): Or else, that man...
let me tell you something...

267
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,918
he will know that he can count on

268
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:06,450
a thoroughbred ass-whupping.
You understand?

269
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,701
- Go on, get.
- Go on.

270
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,750
- Go on.
- Go.

271
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,985
(All laughing)

272
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,738
What happened?

273
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,855
He thinks Houston's a blacksmith.

274
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,411
- He's going in there.
- Wait, wait, wait.

275
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,569
Watch, watch, watch.

276
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,096
- Wake up.
- What is it?

277
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,787
I need you to fix this here weapon.

278
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:35,507
There's something wrong with the mechanism.

279
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,425
Without delay?

280
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,294
I'm a Ranger. Could be
called upon at any moment.

281
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,985
Could use it for the common defense.

282
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,599
Go on, you son of a bitch, fix it!

283
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,023
- General awake?
- General? General Houston?

284
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:53,813
That's the only general we have, son.

285
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:55,610
(Man): Boy!

286
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:57,391
(Laughs)

287
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:00,732
- That was quick!
- How'd it work?

288
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:04,466
- Get it clean?
- He don't look happy.

289
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,456
General Houston, I thought...

290
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,142
I mean...

291
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:11,659
I'm bust-out sorry and shame-faced

292
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:15,063
for disturbing your sleep
like a dumb, stupid idiot.

293
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:18,508
And I'm prepared to take
the whuppin' I deserve.

294
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,552
Only, um...

295
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,778
Only what?

296
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,199
I'd like my gun back.

297
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,408
Seeing as it was my daddy's
and he was shot down by outlaws.

298
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,940
It's the only thing he left me.

299
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,859
Pawl needs adjusting.

300
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,167
Come back later. You'll
find it serviceable.

301
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,615
Go on.

302
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,655
Shoo!

303
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,621
(Distant laughter)

304
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:06,082
Since you fine gentlemen have
so much extra time on your hands,

305
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:07,632
I have an assignment for you.

306
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:10,183
(All): Sir.

307
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:11,988
Mount up.

Damn it, Beans, why ain't
you pack more vittles?

Didn't have none to pack.

they won't even tell us.

335
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,216
Tired of all this waiting around.

336
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:41,611
Y'all been chewing on what we talked about?

337
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,938
I don't want to hear no more about it.

338
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:47,188
You ain't got to make up your mind
till we get to Galveston, Kit.

339
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:48,726
Already decided.

340
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:50,528
I ain't no bank robber.

341
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,411
(Gunshot)

342
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:56,703
But I ain't no damn snitch neither.

343
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,341
(Scoffs)

344
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:05,543
(Pleasant music)

345
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:10,631
(Bigfoot Wallance): "Only law
west of Victoria except God

346
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:14,168
"can serve as a preacher in a pinch.

347
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:16,142
"No shooting,

348
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:17,555
"no cussing,

349
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,173
no fighting, and..."

350
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:22,780
(Hays): "And absolutely no
spitting on the god damn floor."

351
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,065
That's my horse.

352
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,647
(Bigfoot Wallance): I wonder if that
bitch with my damn wrist cuff is in there.

353
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:28,849
(Hays): You go right, and I'll go left.

354
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,102
(Bigfoot Wallance): All right.
I go right; you go left.

355
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:33,810
- Ow! Whoo!
- That's my girl!

356
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,100
(Man): Whoo!

357
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,959
(Upbeat fiddle music playing)

358
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:39,710
(Curls): Yeah!

359
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,178
- Play faster!
- Play better!

360
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:42,546
(Man): Play it, fiddle man.

361
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:44,932
(Curls): Whoo! Drinks on me, boys.

362
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,367
(Man laughs)

363
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,643
Give me my wrist cuff, bitch.

364
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:57,895
(Gunshots)

365
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,286
(Man): Why, you son of a...

366
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,735
(Both grunting)

367
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:16,395
(Shrieks)

368
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,967
(Both grunting)

369
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,272
(Metallic clattering)

370
00:24:22,302 --> 00:24:25,089
(All grunting and smacking)

371
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,552
(Panting)

372
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:33,764
(Glass shatters)

373
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:34,899
(Horses whinnying)

374
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,517
(Curls): Move your ass, Roy!

375
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,102
- Come on, Curls!
- We got to get out of here!

376
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,937
My horse.

377
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,105
Whoo!

378
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,966
They got my damn horse.

379
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:55,086
(Children laughing)

380
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:57,588
- Lucas!
- Watch it now.

381
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,707
- Hey, Nate.
- Stop it!

382
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:02,435
The first thing we got to do
when it stops raining...

383
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:05,129
we got to clean out that root cellar.

384
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,131
And we're gonna fix that door.

385
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,432
You and me.

386
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:10,634
Yes, sir.

387
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:13,673
All right.

388
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:17,024
Clean the cellar?

389
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,819
With all the work to be done?

390
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,946
Well, my woman wants her jams and jars

391
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:24,982
fresh and cool in the summer.

392
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,576
Ain't that right?

393
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:31,705
Not in front of the children.

394
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,793
Y'all come out of the rain. Supper's ready.

395
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,557
Aw, Ma! Now?

396
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:39,485
Just keep running.

397
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,544
You do realize, sir, as Secretary of War,

398
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:07,074
you are empowered to
assume command yourself.

399
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:10,914
You certainly made me aware
of that, Private Lamar.

400
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:25,589
Get yourselves a bite to eat.

401
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,467
Well, Rusk will dig Houston's grave now.

402
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,603
I'm most anxious to see his face

403
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:38,771
when Rusk tears those stars off his uniform

404
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:41,388
and sends him away.

405
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:44,478
- Good riddance.
- Good riddance.

406
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:46,564
Yes.

407
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,490
Sam?

408
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:58,375
Figured if it wasn't Santa Anna out there

409
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,935
causing all that ruckus, it had to be you.

410
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:04,548
(Groans)

411
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:06,550
Come to relieve me, Tom?

412
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:09,136
It has been discussed.

413
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,921
Well, that's a surprise.

414
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,263
By Burnet?

415
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:15,476
By just about everybody.

416
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:19,145
Then do it, then, you son of
a bitch. Let's be done with it.

417
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:23,517
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

418
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:26,070
I can't think of one.

419
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:29,133
'Course I thought you'd defend me.

420
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:34,497
I have been defending you for
weeks, but nothing's changed.

421
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,584
Sam, the problem is you.

422
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,670
Relieve me of my command, Mr. Secretary,

423
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:46,340
but do not insult me.

424
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,709
Whoever you put in my place

425
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:51,044
will still be left

426
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,964
with untrained, undisciplined soldiers

427
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,351
and impudent, disloyal officers.

428
00:27:57,436 --> 00:28:00,220
Sam, you said you'd hold
at Gonzales; you didn't.

429
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:02,639
You said you'd fight at the Colorado;

430
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,391
you didn't.

431
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,226
You swore to Burnet

432
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:10,731
that the Mexicans would
never cross the Brazos.

433
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,232
They did.

434
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:14,618
Burnet, now, there's the man

435
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:18,071
with all the vision of a rotten stump.

436
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:22,292
What matters to me, Tom,
is how do you see it?

437
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,574
Do I still have your trust or not?

438
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,416
(Chuckles)

439
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:32,336
If all you're gonna give
me are excuses, well, yeah.

440
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,888
You leave me with very little choice, Sam.

441
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,399
Thief ever come back or what?

442
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:42,429
(Wilkins): I'm still hungry.

443
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:45,232
(Anderson): Yeah? Take this.

444
00:28:45,317 --> 00:28:48,268
Thistle wort, dried chickweed,
bergamot, sassafras...

445
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:51,605
brew it up, drink it,
you will not feel hungry.

446
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,325
Phew, what the dickens is that right there?

447
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,611
That sassafras will clear your liver

448
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,029
and make you shit like a goose.

449
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,219
That a good thing?

450
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,165
Yeah.

451
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:06,670
So what's this big secret mission?

452
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:08,622
Well, we've been ordered to rendezvous

453
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,290
with a couple twin sisters

454
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:11,708
and escort them back to camp.

455
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:12,998
(Elwood): Sisters?

456
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:14,083
Hoo-whee!

457
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,444
Now, finally a task I can get behind.

458
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:19,116
(All laugh)

459
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,420
Well, I'll be damned!

460
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:25,801
(All laughing)

461
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,300
That enough to stop your whining,
get you back to work?

462
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,933
- Yes, cap'n.
- I think so.

463
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:31,462
Light up a fire and chow down!

464
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:33,298
Hot damn and hallelujah.

465
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:34,736
Vern?

466
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,398
Hard ground must be awful rough

467
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:40,476
on those big feet of yours.

468
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:42,703
You sure you don't want to take
a turn on Ol' Faithful here?

469
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,948
I'd sooner ride on a spotted river turtle.

470
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:48,554
We ought to be hightailing to
join up with Sam Houston's army.

471
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:51,520
Why the hell are we going to Victoria?

472
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,216
I told you.

473
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:55,958
We need to report them killings
to the proper authorities.

474
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:57,104
What for?

475
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:58,689
Somebody's gonna find them soon enough

476
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:01,456
without us getting all mixed up in it.

477
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,660
We're already mixed up in it.

478
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:05,829
Besides, you want to get your
horse back, now, don't you?

479
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,582
You think the law is gonna do that for us?

480
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,443
Why not?

481
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:11,876
It's their job, isn't it?

482
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:16,173
Hardcase. You got a lot to learn.

483
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:17,758
How are them blisters?

484
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:19,012
(Scoffs)

485
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,711
Come on, hyah! Let's go.

486
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:24,047
It's best we just head out
to meet up with Houston's army.

487
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:27,854
Huh... right after we
settle up in Victoria.

488
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:38,316
I'll bet you boys come
from Buckley's way station.

489
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,974
There was a shooting.

490
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:42,731
(Chuckles)

491
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,784
And you gonna tell me you're
all just innocent bystanders.

492
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,628
(Chuckles)

493
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:00,519
(Wilkins): I'll bet them sisters

494
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:02,521
are getting all gussied up to meet me.

495
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:05,445
(Elwood): They gonna catch sight of
you and run a country mile, Beans.

496
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:07,981
(Gator): Y'all think they're daughters
of some big Texas politician or something?

497
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:09,284
(Gator): How old are these girls?

498
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:11,846
- Brand spankin' new!
- Whoo, I like 'em young!

499
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,149
(Gator): Aw, Vern, you like
anything as long as she's breathing.

500
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,806
- (Laughs)
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

501
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:17,885
(Gator): Yeah!

502
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,003
(Man): Where they at?

503
00:31:19,055 --> 00:31:20,945
- Who?
- They meeting us here?

504
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:22,248
The hell you talking about?

505
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:25,009
The girls, damn it!

506
00:31:25,094 --> 00:31:26,227
Boys,

507
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:27,845
meet the twin sisters,

508
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,647
all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio.

509
00:31:29,732 --> 00:31:31,682
Let me introduce...

510
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:32,772
Daphne

511
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,719
and her equally pretty sister,

512
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:35,942
Penelope.

513
00:31:35,972 --> 00:31:39,862
- (Man whistles)
- (Laughing)

514
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:41,532
(Coughs)

515
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,946
Well, hello there, Daphne.

516
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:47,271
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

517
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,150
Aw, that there's Penelope, and she's mine.

518
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:50,701
Hyah!

519
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,204
Mexican supply convoy heading this way!

520
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:54,648
What are they hauling?

521
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,105
Couldn't really tell.

522
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:57,942
Vittles, maybe. Medicine. Gunpowder.

523
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,810
- Whiskey?
- Well, all right, then.

524
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:03,331
Let's see how fast we can
get one of them sisters ready.

525
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:15,962
Tamp it down, Vern.

526
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:18,762
Little more.

527
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:25,772
- Yeah!
- Got 'em!

528
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:30,724
That... that's him!

529
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:32,176
You hanged him.

530
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:34,261
Well, where's that
curly-haired bitch he was with?

531
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:36,347
Took off... while this
snot-nosed miscreant

532
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,182
was shooting up the town.

533
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,850
So you know we're telling the truth.

534
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,439
Don't know no such thing.

535
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:42,853
You two could be part of the gang.

536
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,772
Well, where's the silver
wrist cuff he was wearing?

537
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:47,024
Wearing what he got on.

538
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:49,994
Did you question him?

539
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,061
I don't believe in a lot of blabber
between catchin' and hangin'.

540
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:58,090
For a lawman, you possess
a bewildering sense of due process.

541
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,788
I make no apologies for frontier justice,

542
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:04,103
if that's how I'm gonna
keep my town in order.

543
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,259
Ghost town?

544
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,261
Oh, they'll be back.

545
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,713
Soon as Santa Anna whups Sam Houston's ass

546
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:12,257
and squashes this senseless revolt.

547
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,975
You support Santa Anna?

548
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:19,306
That explains your idea of law and order.

549
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:21,739
You gonna hang us too?

550
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:24,895
Not till you confess.

551
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:28,955
We did nothing wrong.
We ain't confessing to anything.

552
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:31,061
We'll see about that.

553
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:33,836
(Shouts)

554
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,213
(Man): Whoo! We're drinking tonight!

555
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:44,999
(All speaking at once)

556
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:47,918
(Man): Got a special delivery
from Santa Anna hisself!

557
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:51,922
(All speaking at once)

558
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,807
(Man): Yeah, we got a case of Mezcal...

559
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:55,426
(All speaking at once)

560
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:57,344
(Man): Yeah, come get
your provision right here.

561
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,930
(Wilkins): We got powder. We got shot.

562
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:01,765
- Yes, indeed.
- Whoo-hoo!

563
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:03,770
(Wilkins): What do you need? We got it.

564
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,737
Compliments of the Mexican army.

565
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:07,905
(Man): Come here, boys!

566
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,657
Ho to the master-at-arms!

567
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:10,991
(Man): Your new weapons, gentlemen.

568
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,243
(All speaking at once)

569
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:14,995
Compliments of the Mexican army.

570
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:16,747
(Man): This ought to make you smile, boys.

571
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:17,948
(Woman): Is there any molasses?

572
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,834
(All speaking at once)

573
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,032
I reckon you boys can use
these on the front line.

574
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,254
(Man): Yeah, we got us a
piece of ordnance here!

575
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,672
(Man): This is gonna turn the tide.

576
00:34:26,702 --> 00:34:28,539
Papa!

577
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:33,964
(Houston): You have me
engage Santa Anna's army

578
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,245
with almost no chance of victory.

579
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,515
No, Sam.

580
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:39,770
I regard you too highly.

581
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:41,718
But they would.

582
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:44,091
Boy came into my tent.

583
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:47,349
Given the circumstances, he didn't
recognize the commanding officer

584
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,315
and ordered me to repair this.

585
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,968
My point being,

586
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:58,204
despite his blunder, he
came to the right place.

587
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,558
His faith, regardless that
it was initially misplaced,

588
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:04,311
will be rewarded nonetheless.

589
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,734
I ask for your trust, Tom.

590
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:09,091
That young boy gave it to me.

591
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,568
(Baker): Uh, Mr. Secretary.

592
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:15,481
Uh, what are your orders, sir?

593
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,078
Ask him.

594
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:24,164
He's your general.

595
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:25,382
Deaf,

596
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,084
I need to send some Rangers out tonight...

597
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,386
three of your best riders.

598
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,477
- Colonel Baker, Colonel Sherman.
- Yes, sir.

599
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:34,169
I hereby order you to serve
in rear guard capacity.

600
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,392
Sam, that's a very bad idea.

601
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,837
You're most likely gonna engage Santa Anna.

602
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,255
Most likely I will, sir.

603
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,349
Pass it along!

604
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:44,268
Tomorrow, we march!

605
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,770
(All cheering)

606
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:49,022
(Houston): Get a good rest tonight, men.

607
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:52,442
Prepare to face your enemy
on the field of battle.

608
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:57,080
(Cheering continues)

609
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,646
(Man): Santa Anna's gonna bleed!

610
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:10,344
(West voice-over): Lord,

611
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,991
I come to you alone...

612
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,048
weak,

613
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,418
sick at heart,

614
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:19,469
and awful stained.

615
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:26,026
Why... why you put me
in this time and place

616
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,717
when so many suffer?

617
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:32,366
As a child, we had bad eating...

618
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:37,413
stale bread and rotten meat
fed to us in troughs like hogs.

619
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:40,579
Rough, smelly men...

620
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:42,275
they came to me in the dead of night

621
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:45,551
when I still slept with rag dolls.

622
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:50,250
You made those men covet me.

623
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:53,025
Made me beautiful.

624
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:55,188
That's a curse.

625
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:57,357
A plain black woman lives by her labors,

626
00:36:57,443 --> 00:36:59,893
has some kind of home.

627
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:02,612
A husband and children who love her.

628
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:06,033
Help her endure.

629
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:08,151
This beauty...

630
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:10,120
it bring me plenty of men,

631
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:13,629
but not one who loves me.

632
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:19,129
Not one who walks beside me in this world.

633
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,682
Learning me to read and
write's supposed to lift me up,

634
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:23,973
make me better.

635
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:26,330
Tain't so.

636
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,056
My heart grows so cold.

637
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:34,394
I don't feel nothing.

638
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:38,348
I'm burning alive in
the fire of my own rage.

639
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:42,469
I don't live.

640
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,285
I survive.

641
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:46,397
I exist.

642
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,529
But if my brother Jupiter

643
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:55,565
loved Texas enough to die for it,

644
00:37:55,951 --> 00:38:00,003
least I can do is my part to liberate it.

645
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:03,240
No matter what it costs me.

646
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:06,243
On earth and in heaven.

647
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:12,799
I have become what you made me.

648
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:16,386
I do not ask for forgiveness.

649
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:19,089
The worst I must do

650
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,317
lies yet ahead.

651
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,679
In the good book, you
say there's a time to heal

652
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,565
and a time to kill.

653
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,818
I know which time it is for me.

654
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:35,397
I'm asking you for the
strength to see it through.

655
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:39,704
You owe me at least that much.

656
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,407
Judge me as you will.

657
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:46,499
Amen.

658
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:01,348
Beautiful.

659
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,924
Did you enjoy the cockfight?

660
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,803
I won.

661
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:09,132

01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,207
just to test them.

1162
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:15,113
Yes, sir.

1163
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,598
(Horse neighs)

1164
01:17:31,637 --> 01:17:33,470
General.

1165
01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:36,807
I understand you're a better
military strategist than I.

1166
01:17:36,892 --> 01:17:39,415
But before we're outnumbered,

1167
01:17:39,445 --> 01:17:42,029
why don't we attack?

1168
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:45,833
'Cause I'm not ordering one.

1169
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:48,119
You may reconnoiter with
your cavalry after sundown,

1170
01:17:48,204 --> 01:17:50,626
but under no circumstances
are you to engage.

1171
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:53,657
Is that clear?

1172
01:17:53,793 --> 01:17:56,393
Tom, why don't you ride along with him?

1173
01:17:58,863 --> 01:18:00,581
Check.

1174
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:03,476
(Laughs)

1175
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:11,772
(Santa Anna): Almonte, dispatch.

1176
01:18:12,028 --> 01:18:13,900
Find out where General Cos is.

1177
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,012
(Almonte): Right away, sir.

1178
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:17,381
Dispatch.

1179
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:19,850

You heard his Excellency.

1181

Find General Cos.

1182
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:32,518
Kill me or let me go.

1183
01:18:34,554 --> 01:18:35,771
Yes, sir.

1184
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:38,875
I done deserve a whuppin'.

1185
01:18:38,905 --> 01:18:42,509
But none of my previous
masters used their fists.

1186
01:18:42,539 --> 01:18:45,846
They all had the decency to use the whip.

1187
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:51,805
If I was gonna kill you, I
had many opportunities to.

1188
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:09,675
You know the only time a
bull survives in the ring...

1189
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:15,859
is when he has been extremely brave.

01:19:39,845 --> 01:19:42,079
To join me in my tent.

1195
01:19:43,104 --> 01:19:44,769
You choose.

1196
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:47,159
