- That's none of your business.
- That's not how I see it.

If it relates directly to the assault
on Chris Sublette...

313
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,401
...I believe it is absolutely my business.

And obviously your duty
to tell me about it.

I know you heard about me being
supposedly drunk at the crime scene.

There's only two people
could have told you that.

Vic or Julia Sublette.

Are you sleeping with the victim's wife?

No.

Hell, no.

Do you know the victim's wife?

No.

Never met her.

A cappuccino?

wanna pretend this is a social call.

I doubt we have the same definition
of "affair."

- Be as specific as you want, Barlow.
- All right, then.

We're having sex
and we're not telling people about it.

344
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,095
- That's pretty close to my definition.
- Yeah, but I know you.

345
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,824
Your definition's a little sappier.

346
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,993
And it would mean
that I somehow have reason...

347
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,140
...to beat the crap
out of poor Chris Sublette.

And then she goes home.
Why would I wanna mess with that?

We were in Ranchester
when she got the call about the burglary.

in a court of law?

See? Right there.

456
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:30,061
Hot-Shot's connected to this thin wire that
ran to the saddle. It provided the charge.

457
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,463
Afterwards, he gets off his horse,
he disconnects...

458
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,401
...and he and the Hot-Shot walk out

- No.
- It's important.

I got the Hot-Shot and I waited.

594

And when my dad left...

595
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:04,006
...I went to the house, rang the doorbell,
and Mr. Sublette answered.

596
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,772
He said something to me. He called me...

597
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,611
He called me "son."

598
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,614
I just... I flipped out.

599
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,380
- You have to stop this.
ZAC: He hit the security alarm...

600
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,957
...and the alarm went off,
but I had the Hot-Shot.

601
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,557
And it just took him right down.

602
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,122
And then I started kicking him
and beating him...

603
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,565
...until he just stopped moving.

604
