1
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,611
Time we took off, too.

2
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,781
What do you think, Whisky?

3
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,677
Mmm!

4
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,101
You little sugar-eater.

5
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,146
There, that's a good girl.

6
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,031
That's a good girl.
You're beginning to learn.

7
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,660
Try not to make a fool of yourself

8
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,121
the way you did yesterday, huh?

9
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,557
Oh, you're cute. You're
real cute, you are.

10
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,517
Yes, you are.

11
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,353
You stop that now. Come on.

12
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,693
Don't you...

13
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,237
Now, you stop that.

14
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,994
That's a baby.

15
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,126
That's right. You're doing just fine.

16
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,883
That's a real nice girl.

17
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,514
That's a real nice, sweet girl.

18
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,184
Come on over here. Come over here.

19
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,227
All right, you're
starting it again, huh?

20
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,604
Okay, baby.

21
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,191
Well, let's get it out of your system.

22
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,445
Come on.

23
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,945
Turn right!

24
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,554
What do you think you're doing?

25
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,944
You did fine, little girl.

26
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,532
You gotta remember, when I
say, "Hup," you better hup.

27
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,869
You'll learn, pretty little fuzztail.

28
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,581
What I'm trying to teach you is
a little horse sense. Now, hup.

29
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,708
That's it. Now, come on.

30
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,267
Hi.

31
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,438
Welcome home.

32
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,525
Been a long time.

33
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,822
Still painting.

34
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,369
I was expecting you, Jack.

35
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,705
Isn't that odd?

36
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,250
I heard a horse, and I
knew it was your horse.

37
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,877
It's a new horse.

38
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,920
Three-year-old mare.
Part range stock,

39
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,882
part appaloosa, still
a little bit spooky.

40
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,385
Well, must get it from you.

41
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,891
Well, don't just stand
there. You give me a kiss.

42
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,735
I must say, you haven't changed a bit.

43
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,280
You, either. Thanks.

44
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,909
Well, come on. Let me
get you something to eat.

45
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,994
There's coffee there on the stove. Good.

46
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,579
I'll take about six fried eggs.

47
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,998
If you got some ham to put
under them, so much the better.

48
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,750
Coming up. Hup.

49
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,420
What've you been doing with yourself?

50
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,131
I was afraid you were gonna ask that.

51
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,300
Oh, not herding sheep again?

52
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,385
Herding sheep again.

53
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,180
You know, you keep that up, you're
gonna end up on a dude ranch.

54
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,640
Probably.

55
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,855
I'm glad you came, Jack.

56
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,566
God, I'm glad you came.

57
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,236
Picked up a paper, said Paul
was heading for two years

58
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,488
in the penitentiary.

59
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,698
Started riding the same day.

60
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,536
There's nothing you can do to help Paul.

61
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,787
Well, I'm not so sure of that.

62
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,330
I'll mosey down and
have a talk with him.

63
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,790
We'll work something out.

64
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,416
We always did.

65
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,671
No, they won't even let you
see him until visiting day.

66
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,256
That's Wednesday.

67
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,550
By then they might have
moved him to the penitentiary.

68
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,511
You can almost always
arrange to see a fella.

69
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,931
He finish his book?

70
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,182
Half of it.

71
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,185
The other half'll
have to wait two years.

72
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,062
Hey.

73
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,816
How about Seth?

74
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,568
Seth's in school.

75
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,488
Already in school. Why,
that poor little devil.

76
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,699
How come Paul got mixed up smuggling

77
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,993
those wetbacks across the border?

78
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,828
He didn't smuggle anybody.

79
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,788
He just helped them after they got here.

80
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,332
He hid them and fed them
and gave them directions

81
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,334
about where to find work, that's all.

82
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,836
Well, what's wrong with that?

83
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,589
Oh, nothing. Nothing. It's
just a crime, that's all.

84
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,509
The immigration people warned Paul
twice, but he just kept right on.

85
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,635
Good for him.

86
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,888
Oh, sure, good for him, and hoorah
for two years in the penitentiary.

87
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,349
I get so mad I could kill him.

88
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,477
The reason you get mad at Paul
is you don't understand him.

89
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,939
Understand him? Just how
long is that supposed to take?

90
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,192
I've only been married
seven years, you know, Jack.

91
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,570
Yeah, but, basically
you're still an Easterner.

92
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,322
What are you talking about, Jack?

93
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,448
Told you, you didn't understand.

94
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,866
A Westerner likes open country.

95
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,367
That means he's got to hate fences.

96
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,828
And the more fences there
are, the more he hates them.

97
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,580
I never heard such nonsense in my life.

98
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,165
It's true, though.

99
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,251
You ever notice how many
fences there are getting to be?

100
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,461
The signs that they got on them.

101
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,463
No hunting, no hiking, no admission,

102
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,424
no trespass, private
property, closed area,

103
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,510
start moving, go away,
get lost, drop dead.

104
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,929
Know what I mean? I
don't even want to know.

105
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,224
Then they got those fences
that say, "This side's jail."

106
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,020
Or that side's the street. Or
here's Arizona, that's Nevada.

107
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,147
Or this is us, that's Mexico.

108
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,858
Hey, you're so hot, my ham's burning up.

109
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,652
Plate's there on the table.

110
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,278
Now, that one between here and Mexico

111
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,447
is the fence got Paul into trouble.

112
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,240
He just naturally
didn't see the use of it,

113
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,909
so he acted as if it wasn't there.

114
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,243
So when people sneaked across it,

115
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,536
he just felt they were still people,

116
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,163
so he helped them.

117
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,374
Jack, I'm gonna tell you something.

118
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,043
The world that you and
Paul live in doesn't exist.

119
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,670
Maybe it never did.

120
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,254
Out there is a real world.

121
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,132
And it's got real
borders and real fences.

122
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,301
Real laws and real trouble.

123
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,805
And either you go by
the rules or you lose.

124
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,682
You lose everything.

125
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,559
You can always keep something.

126
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,478
I don't know.

127
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,980
I don't understand men anymore.

128
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,734
Paul had a choice and he chose
jail instead of his family.

129
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,903
Why, Jack?

130
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,407
Doesn't he need us as
much as we need him?

131
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,082
You forgot the salt and pepper.

132
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,254
Now, you talk about that jail
sentence as if it was another woman

133
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,672
he was going out with.

134
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,090
Isn't it?

135
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,217
Maybe it is.

136
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,927
Maybe he had to have
one more fling with her

137
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,596
before the old man with
the white hair moves in.

138
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,223
Fling with who?

139
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,517
Girl Paul and I grew up with.

140
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,353
Kind of a wild-eyed
little mountain girl.

141
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,858
Her name is Do-What-You-Want-To-Do-And-
The-Hell-With-Everybody-Else.

142
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,736
Probably an Indian girl,
they all got names like that.

143
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,487
Men are idiots.

144
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,158
You're an idiot, Paul's an
idiot, you're all idiots.

145
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,869
These eggs are gonna be rock-hard,
Jack. Come on and sit down.

146
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,954
You make me nervous.

147
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,884
Is there anything else you want?

148
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,427
A bath.

149
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,220
I'm beginning to smell
like a wild animal

150
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,555
that hasn't even been rained on

151
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,515
for about five years.

152
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,429
Hey, you're not going to
Coffeyville, Kansas, are you?

153
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,973
No, I'm hauling privies
to Duke City, New Mexico.

154
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,892
You're hauling what? Privies.

155
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,644
Hundred and fifty-six privies.

156
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,939
High-tailing down the road at 70
miles an hour. How do you like that?

157
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,440
What kind of emergency do you suppose

158
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,443
they got in Duke City, New Mexico?

159
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,644
I feel about four pounds lighter.

160
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,732
It's always hard to get
'em on over clean socks.

161
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,151
Well, you got awful big feet, Jack.

162
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,903
No, that's not it.

163
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,072
Your feet swell after a bath.

164
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,284
I'm not sure whether
it's good for 'em or not.

165
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,954
There!

166
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,379
Gotta give that little
mare a drink before I go.

167
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,176
Money in that bandoleer.

168
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,847
Want you to use it if
anything goes wrong.

169
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,311
What can go wrong?

170
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,897
Hard to tell. Probably nothing.

171
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,857
What are you gonna do, Jack?

172
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,442
Already told you.

173
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,278
I'm gonna give that little mare a drink.

174
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,492
Give her some grass in the
morning if I'm not back.

175
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,535
Do that?

176
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,745
Do that.

177
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,919
Tell Seth I'll see him later, huh?

178
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,212
Jack, what are you gonna do?

179
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,925
Well, about every six months I
figure I owe myself a good drunk.

180
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,344
Rinses your insides out,
sweetens your breath,

181
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,304
tones up your skin.

182
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,015
Well, then, buy a
bottle and drink it here.

183
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,351
Getting caught drunk in
public's about the easiest way

184
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,770
I know of breaking into jail.

185
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,772
It's more fun, too.

186
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,525
Be careful, Jack.

187
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,528
Don't make any trouble.

188
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,198
Trouble's what I came here to fix up.

189
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,742
You be a good girl, Whisky.

190
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,786
I'll be back pretty soon.

191
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,666
Okay, I'll be careful.

192
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,780
And keep the change.

193
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,248
Hey, watch it there,
fella, I almost spilled...

194
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,214
My fault, amigo.

195
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,716
I'm sorry.

196
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,622
Now, why'd you throw that bottle?

197
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,751
I never saw you before in my life.

198
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,921
Try and watch it, huh?

199
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,033
You sure you got the right fella?

200
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,786
We haven't even been introduced.

201
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,248
My name's Burns.

202
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,426
What's the matter, cowboy?

203
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,679
I only got one arm.

204
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,267
You ain't afraid to fight
a one-armed man, are you?

205
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,940
You know, a fella can get hurt
falling backwards off a chair?

206
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,442
Are you positive it's
me you want, amigo?

207
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,570
I'm not afraid of you, cowboy.

208
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,573
I don't give a damn
how many arms you grow.

209
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,325
If you're not satisfied
with the arm you've got,

210
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,660
why don't you chop it off?

211
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,954
I lost that arm in Okinawa.

212
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,706
What did you do?

213
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,168
Oh, I didn't do anything.

214
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,628
Let's have a drink and talk it over.

215
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,922
You're afraid, you cobarde.

216
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,760
Never call a man that, no
matter what. Never do it.

217
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,055
I might kill you for
calling me a thing like that.

218
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,642
Just stand where you are, boys.

219
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,978
This fella wants action,

220
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,439
I'll be glad to accommodate him.

221
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,358
Do it one arm behind my back.

222
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,237
If any of you boys
interfere, I use two hands.

223
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,157
All right, maldito.

224
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,367
Use your left arm, amigo.

225
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,969
BARTENDER: Give me the police.

226
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,734
Listen to me, you...

227
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,719
Not two hands!

228
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,345
One arm, amigo.

229
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,544
You fight with your left hand,
just like him. See, mister?

230
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,047
MAN: He had to use both hands.

231
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,652
That's him. The cowboy on the bottom!

232
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,655
Okay, the fight's over. Break it up.

233
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,743
Hey, I'm down here. Hurry up, will you?

234
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,661
JACK: Geez! Come on.

235
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,246
All right, cowboy, let's go.

236
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,083
I thought you guys never would get here.

237
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,794
MAN 1: Okay, cowboy.

238
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,385
MAN 2: Come back again, amigo!

239
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,935
Okay, Joe, can him.

240
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,979
Cell blocks are full. Have
to throw him in the tank.

241
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,940
This way, Pop. Just
because I got no money,

242
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,149
that's a crime?

243
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,401
Called vagrancy.

244
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,528
All it does is fill your belly
and keep you off the streets

245
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,113
for a night or two. Yeah, yeah.

246
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,407
King of England don't
carry no money, either.

247
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,535
Would you arrest him if he showed
up in this stinking gut-trap

248
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,247
cesspool of a pest house
passing for a town, would you?

249
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,427
Can it talk?

250
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,011
I can talk all right.

251
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,096
Identification?

252
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,764
He hasn't got any.

253
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,183
Tobacco, matches, $6 in bills,

254
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,980
38 cents in change, pocket
knife, and a dried-up ear.

255
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,106
An ear?

256
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,941
Yeah, looks like a bull's ear.

257
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,278
You mean to say you got
no identification at all?

258
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,487
That's right.

259
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,115
No draft card, no social security?

260
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,242
No discharge, no insurance,
no driver's license?

261
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,326
No nothing?

262
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,411
No nothing.

263
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,789
Look, cowboy, you can't go
around without identification.

264
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,250
It's against the law. How are
people gonna know who you are?

265
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,879
I don't need a card to figure
out who I am. I already know.

266
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,464
Okay, who are you?

267
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,299
John W. Burns.

268
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,009
Jack for short.

269
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,594
You sure of that?

270
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,472
Sure enough to bet you
can't prove I'm anybody else.

271
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,307
Where do you live?

272
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,434
Anywhere I feel like.

273
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,603
Now, what the devil does that mean?

274
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,563
Well, it means I don't have any address.

275
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,191
You've got to. Where do your folks live?

276
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,567
Missouri.

277
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,278
Occupation?

278
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,988
Sure.

279
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,365
Well, what is it?

280
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,535
Cowhand.

281
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,455
You a veteran?

282
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,041
Wasn't everybody who could stand
up straight for five minutes

283
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,918
without falling over backwards?

284
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,753
Yeah, just about.

285
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,046
What's the charge? Drunk?

286
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,255
And disorderly.

287
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,633
Meira's Bar on North Highland Road.

288
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,717
Fight?

289
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,427
Him and Lopato. Good one.

290
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,429
That one-armed guy?

291
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,057
Cowboy here was using one arm, too.

292
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,518
You shouldn't have tangled
with that fella, cowboy.

293
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,103
He's mean. He could have stuck you.

294
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,730
That all you got against him?

295
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,482
That's it.

296
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,735
Look, we're loaded today.
Even the tanks are full.

297
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,571
This fellow's sobering up pretty quick.

298
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,697
What do you say we turn him loose?

299
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,783
Okay by me. Let him go, Phil.

300
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,535
PHIL: Okay. DEPUTY: We
just answered a call.

301
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,328
You mean you're going to turn me loose?

302
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,871
When I'm in a condition like this?

303
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,164
That's right, cowboy.

304
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,958
Look, you just go wherever
you're staying and sleep it off.

305
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,334
Okay, but first I'm going back there

306
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,920
and I'm gonna kill that one-armed
leftover from a pig litter!

307
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,381
Get your arms off me, flat foot!

308
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,760
MAN: What's he doing?

309
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,389
Hey!

310
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,559
Tobacco,

311
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,272
$6.38,

312
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,818
one pocketknife,

313
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,282
one dry ear.

314
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,326
MAN 1: Oh, you son of a gun...

315
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,537
MAN 2: Get your foot out of my...

316
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,332
JACK: You guys are supposed to be...

317
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,168
MAN 1: He wants it the hard way.

318
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:33,507
One dry, pointed ear.

319
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,725
Here's a receipt for what
you brought in. Can him.

320
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,809
Tank?

321
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,352
Yeah. Run him through the showers first.

322
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,271
You know something, buddy.

323
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,274
From a ten-day common drunk,
you've built yourself up to a year.

324
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,067
Congratulations.

325
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,270
Good afternoon, Miss Kennedy.

326
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,648
Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson.

327
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,232
Oh, Mrs. Johnson called.

328
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,444
She wants you to remember that
shopping list she gave you.

329
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,945
All right.

330
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,781
Busy, Floyd?

331
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,874
Sure gave me a start, there, Sheriff.

332
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,793
Put that comic away.

333
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,171
Remember that girl on Lead Hill
they found belly-down in the road

334
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,549
with a knife in her back, and
the coroner called it suicide?

335
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,635
Sure. Day before yesterday.

336
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,137
I want you to drive out and
serve a writ on that coroner,

337
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,473
then turn around and come straight back.

338
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,433
Don't I get to stop
off for a bite first?

339
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,560
No, and button your pants.

340
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,108
Hi, Morey.

341
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,150
Harry.

342
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,873
That dog.

343
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,293
Same fire plug, same time every day.

344
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,547
You'd think he was under contract.

345
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,430
Red light's going, Harry. Have
you got any time for the machine?

346
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,014
Machine? Right.

347
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,770
This is CS-1, over.

348
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,693
Roger, Highway Patrol. CS-1 out.

349
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,784
Yep.

350
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,663
Got Caruso's new barber
pole third day in a row.

351
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,458
It's on the route now.

352
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,669
Don't know how he does it.

353
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,177
What was that signal, Harry?

354
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,722
Signal? State Highway
Patrol. Just a routine check.

355
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,141
Locate McNeill, wherever he is,

356
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,809
send him out for chewing gum.

357
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,561
McNeill? Right.

358
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,523
When I tell you to watch
that machine of yours,

359
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,942
you say, "Machine? Right."

360
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,905
When I give you a message for
McNeill, you say, "McNeill? Right."

361
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,865
There's something about the
way you make a question of it

362
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,826
and then say, "Right,"
that gets on my nerves.

363
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,244
Nerves?

364
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,080
Right.

365
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,174
Head count.

366
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,393
GUARD: Open it up, Bob.
Got another customer.

367
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,195
GUARD: Right in here.

368
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,910
Okay, boys, relax.

369
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,258
When is suppertime around here, anyway?

370
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,553
Brother, if I was in your condition,

371
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,763
I would pay less attention to the flesh

372
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,850
and more to the salvation
of my eternal soul.

373
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,520
REVEREND: And believe me, I
know whereof I'm talking about,

374
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,189
you poor abandoned Philistine, you.

375
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,776
The temptations of the flesh.

376
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,987
I fought 'em my whole life through.

377
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,406
Then how come you're in here, Reverend?

378
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,826
I said I fought 'em. I
didn't say I fought 'em off.

379
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,870
Sometimes I lost.

380
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,623
But believe me, it takes a
lot more to tempt a preacher

381
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,126
than it does you stumblebums in here.

382
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,212
When I lost, I lost big!

383
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,048
You a real preacher, Reverend?

384
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,718
REVEREND: Well, now,
let's look at it this way.

385
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,013
Always had the urge to preach.

386
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,641
And if you got the urge,
you're already halfway home.

387
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,436
What kept you from getting all the way?

388
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,027
My temptation was women.

389
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,534
You ain't a preacher any more
than I'm a sway-backed goose.

390
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,036
And I don't think
you've got sense enough

391
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,580
to pound sand in a rabbit hole.

392
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,916
You are not in a state of grace.

393
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,334
Hi, Paul.

394
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,671
Jack.

395
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,257
You old son of a gun.

396
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,135
Glad to see you, fella.

397
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,637
So am I.

398
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,056
What happened to your face?

399
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,183
Oh, a bunch of guys I ran into

400
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,268
down in some saloon gave it a new look.

401
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,687
Guess they didn't like the old one.

402
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,732
Come on, let's sit over here.

403
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,157
All right, let's have it.

404
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,369
You didn't get into a fight,
you picked one, didn't you?

405
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,621
Me, pick a fight?

406
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,748
You're a great guy, Jack.

407
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,541
Oh, sure.

408
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,337
The only man on Earth who'd break
in to jail just to see an old friend

409
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,047
off to the penitentiary.

410
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,842
Breaking into a jail's the
easiest thing a fella can do.

411
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,930
I guess you found that out for yourself.

412
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,431
Yeah.

413
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,393
See Jerry?

414
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,730
She's a little burned up right now,

415
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,858
but these things aren't
hard to straighten out.

416
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,029
What's outside that wall?

417
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,073
Bernal Boulevard.

418
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,867
Yeah, it would be.

419
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,208
Overlooks an alley in the
back of a department store.

420
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,298
You see Seth?

421
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,300
No, he was in school.

422
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,262
Darn, I wanted to see that little fella.

423
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,391
Come on, let's join the parade.

424
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,767
Okay.

425
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,770
Floor's harder than I thought.

426
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,397
Don't step on this Indian here.

427
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,025
I'm not sure, but I
think he carries a knife.

428
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,609
Smart Indian.

429
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,031
When do they begin shoving
supper through that slot?

430
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,240
Shouldn't be long now.

431
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,367
I'm so hungry, every
time I take a deep breath

432
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,120
my stomach squeaks like a wet balloon.

433
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,582
Okay, Cliff.

434
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,964
Hey, amigo. Look at
those mountains, huh?

435
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,674
Chow down!

436
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,179
Come on, let's get the
squeaks out of your stomach.

437
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,098
MAN: Chow. Chow!

438
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,992
Good afternoon, college boy.

439
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,164
Hey, you.

440
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,542
Too good to talk to me?

441
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,961
You too smart to have
anything to do with me?

442
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,713
What do you want?

443
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,134
Come here, college boy.

444
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,012
Come here!

445
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,600
Take it easy. Temper like
that, and one of these days

446
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,977
you'll find yourself riding through
town with your belly to the sun,

447
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,189
your best suit on, and
no place to go but hell.

448
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,318
Believe me, buddy, you better watch it.

449
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,778
Come on, let's sit over there.

450
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,239
Hey, cowboy, what's your name?

451
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,282
John W. Burns. Let's eat.

452
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,076
Jack, for short.

453
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,663
Okay, Burns.

454
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,544
Okay, John W. Burns.

455
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,754
GUARD 1: Open up.

456
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,407
There's not much music in these bars.

457
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,618
I'm afraid the sons of guns are solid.

458
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,038
Are you sure you didn't
get kicked in the head?

459
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,790
What do you mean?

460
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,711
You act like a man who thinks
he's going to break out of jail.

461
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,380
Come here, college boy.

462
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,814
You crazy fool.

463
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,610
Nothing crazy about
hacksaws in a jailhouse.

464
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,613
Do you know the penalty in
this state for jail breaking?

465
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,239
Never broke one in this state.

466
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,741
Five years.

467
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,412
It'll take 'em an awful
long time to catch us, amigo.

468
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,414
Don't worry about that.

469
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,042
You know,

470
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,794
a fella just might be
able to crawl through

471
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,131
by cutting only one bar just about here.

472
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,929
Go through on your side. One shoulder
at a time. Slow and easy, like.

473
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,931
Hey, when do these lights go out?

474
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,432
Around 9:00.

475
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,977
Guards?

476
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,484
They're gone.

477
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,402
Well, then let's get to work.

478
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,324
Jack, I've got two years as it is.

479
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,702
I'm not gonna break
jail and risk five more.

480
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,870
I mean that.

481
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,539
Sure, amigo, but give
yourself a fair shake.

482
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,168
Wait till we get one of
those bars cut, then decide.

483
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,586
Long time between now and sun-up.

484
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,921
You might change your mind.

485
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,464
Not a chance.

486
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,343
But I'm sure gonna change yours.

487
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,012
You were in a bar fight.
You'll get 30 days at the most.

488
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,306
You wanna risk five years
in the penitentiary for that?

489
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,767
Not 30 days, amigo. I'd get a year.

490
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,143
A year? I hit a deputy.

491
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,813
They charged me with criminal assault.

492
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,690
Criminal assault? How did you...

493
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,234
I had to. They wouldn't let me in.

494
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,531
I'm telling you, I won't
serve a year in this place.

495
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,032
I couldn't.

496
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,703
My guts get all tied up
just by thinking about it.

497
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,497
I'd go nuts. I'd kill somebody.

498
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,458
You know, amigo, I'd
kill somebody. Sure.

499
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,087
Yes. I guess maybe you would.

500
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,510
Look, amigo.

501
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,474
I've got two hacksaws.
It'll take two men.

502
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,020
You don't want to get involved.

503
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,787
Which one of these involvements is mine?

504
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,291
Come on. We'll work the same bar.

505
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,793
The same place. She'll cut fast.

506
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,218
Hombre, what do you fellas do?

507
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,387
Working our way through college.

508
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,056
Makes trouble for everybody.

509
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,099
Not if you don't see it.

510
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,104
MAN: Hey, you boys
sharpening your toenails?

511
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,441
Brushing our teeth.

512
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,651
You sure got bony teeth.

513
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,489
Hey.

514
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,241
If I hear somebody coming,
I'll give you the word.

515
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,826
Thanks, amigo.

516
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,257
She's all cut through, boss.

517
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,550
Good.

518
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,931
Let's see how this son of a gun bends.

519
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,749
Hand me that blanket rope.

520
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,042
PAUL: You can't get through that.

521
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,837
You'd be surprised how flexible
a man can be when he has to.

522
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,466
Let's hide all the gear. Come on!

523
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,807
GUTIERREZ: John W. Burns!

524
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,690
Yeah?

525
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,404
I want you!

526
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,250
Jack, what are you...

527
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,377
Nose of mine cracks easy.

528
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:32,173
Man gives me fair notice, no
reason I shouldn't prop up a little.

529
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,280
Telephone call.

530
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,991
In the office.

531
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,829
Who'd be calling me this time of night?

532
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,373
It's a surprise.

533
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,325
Come on.

534
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,690
I'm all right.

535
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,736
What a phone call.

536
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,572
What did he use on you?

537
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,949
Just his fists.

538
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,247
Lucky I had these.

539
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,809
Hate to lose those big ones.

540
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,415
Navajos took off, huh?

541
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,044
Well, time to get moving.

542
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,088
Daylight pretty soon.

543
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,013
Well?

544
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,648
Listen, amigo.

545
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,985
I know a place in Sinaloa
just aching to hide us.

546
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,070
Good cabin, lots of rain.

547
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,991
You'd write your book, I'd run
a cow or two, Jerry could paint.

548
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,909
And Seth, he'd learn.

549
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,746
Like we used to talk about. Natural man.

550
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,003
You got a bad case of something.

551
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,214
I don't know what it is, but it
sure loused up your good sense.

552
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,592
You think they should've given
you two years for what you did?

553
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,552
No. Then why let 'em win?

554
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,304
Nobody's winning.

555
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,266
I knew what it was going to cost
and I went right ahead and did it.

556
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,518
Now I have a debt to pay off.

557
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,396
You can pay off a third, amigo.

558
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,982
Jerry and Seth, they pay the rest.

559
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,317
I know.

560
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,782
In a half hour, Jerry'll be
frying eggs for both of us.

561
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,992
I'm not going to break jail.

562
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,829
You shouldn't have come
here in the first place.

563
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,748
I'm staying here.

564
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,042
Can't you understand that?

565
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,711
How many times do I have to tell you?

566
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,756
Okay.

567
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,468
Okay, amigo.

568
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,464
Jack.

569
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,552
You've gotta go. I know that.

570
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,303
But it's different with me.

571
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,347
I can take jail because I've got

572
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,182
two people out there waiting for me.

573
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,685
I've got something to go back to.

574
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,396
Don't you see? I...

575
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,400
I don't want Seth to grow
up and be the way we were.

576
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:46,445
I don't want Jerry and Seth to
have to run from anything, ever.

577
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,115
If I broke out tonight,
they'd be running alongside me

578
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,993
for the rest of their lives.

579
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,539
Do you understand, Jack?

580
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,796
Sure, I understand.

581
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,142
You grew up on me, didn't you?

582
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,813
No, Jack. I just changed.

583
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,858
Yeah, that's what I mean. You changed.

584
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,907
God.

585
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,083
God, Jack, I hope you make it.

586
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,669
I'll make it, all right.

587
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,589
You take a loner, he travels awful fast.

588
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,913
Who is it? Who's there?

589
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,206
Me.

590
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,375
I was hoping you'd wake up.

591
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,961
You were in jail, weren't you?

592
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,087
In and out.

593
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,296
Was Paul all right? Sure.

594
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,840
Has anything happened? Paul's just fine.

595
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,175
He sends you his love.

596
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,431
You broke out of jail, didn't you?

597
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,349
What else could I do?

598
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,018
Are the police after you?

599
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,561
Well, I hope not yet, but they will be

600
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,355
before that sun is very far up.

601
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,900
Well, if you're on the
run, you'll need some food.

602
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,861
You sure feed me good.

603
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,285
What did they do to you?

604
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,620
I got rousted a little.

605
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,668
Well, it's just lucky I
washed that shirt of yours.

606
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,670
You can't go anywhere that way.

607
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,172
Well, thanks.

608
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,218
You men just make me sick.

609
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,221
You just act like children, all of you.

610
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,724
Why, even Seth or that crazy
horse of yours out there

611
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,268
would have better sense than you do.

612
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,521
Here you are, all cut up and
running away from the police.

613
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,648
And there's Paul sitting there in jail,

614
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,942
and all you do is grin about it.

615
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,819
Believe you me,

616
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,655
if it didn't take men to make babies,

617
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,742
I wouldn't have anything
to do with any of you.

618
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,732
Well, at least you'll have some food.

619
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,859
Oh, thanks.

620
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,277
You know, those paintings of yours,

621
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,404
I never did understand
the darned things.

622
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,990
But whatever point they're
making, they sure make it big.

623
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,658
They're lousy.

624
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,536
I could use that ammunition
I left in that bandoleer.

625
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,538
I'll get it for you.

626
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,090
Thanks.

627
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,758
Here, I'll take part and you take part.

628
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,093
Oh, no, Jack...

629
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,928
That little mare, if she wants action,

630
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,222
she's sure gonna get it,
next two or three days.

631
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,307
I don't know.

632
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,975
Maybe you'd be better
off if they caught you.

633
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,103
Maybe, but I'd like to put it
off for as long as possible.

634
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,615
Jack. Hmm?

635
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,826
Will I ever see you again?

636
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,871
Sure will. These things blow over.

637
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:33,125
You'll see me some evening
when things are peaceful again.

638
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,919
Jack.

639
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,010
Jerry.

640
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,303
Jack! Jack!

641
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,892
I always missed you, Jerry.

642
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,812
I always will.

643
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,315
You wanted too much.

644
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,195
I didn't want enough.

645
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,490
I didn't want a house, didn't
want all those pots and pans.

646
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,909
I didn't want anything but you.

647
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,246
And it's God's own
blessing I didn't get you.

648
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,413
Why?

649
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,960
'Cause I'm a loner clear
down deep to my very guts.

650
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,046
You know what a loner
is? He's a born cripple.

651
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,841
He's crippled because the only
person he can live with is himself.

652
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,262
It's his life, the way he wants
to live it. It's all for him.

653
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,181
A guy like that, he'd
kill a woman like you

654
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,602
because he couldn't love you,
not the way you are loved.

655
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,649
You'll change someday, too, Jack.

656
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,570
I could have, maybe.
I can't now. Too late.

657
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,324
Paul did, though.

658
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,827
You know I tried to
get him to break jail?

659
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,495
I knew you'd try.

660
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,955
I was afraid he'd do it, too.

661
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,665
He turned me down cold.

662
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,792
And it's not because he
wants to spend two years

663
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,628
with that wild-eyed little
mountain girl you were jealous of.

664
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,423
You know, Do-What-You-
Want-To-Do-And-The-Hell-With-Everybody-Else?

665
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,050
Forget her. You've got
her backed off the map.

666
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,511
I don't know what you've
done to him, you and Seth,

667
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,265
but he's a good three times
bigger than he ever was before.

668
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,691
That sun's still coming up.

669
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,280
If I had a big kiss, I could probably
beat it to the top of that hill.

670
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,003
Thanks.

671
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,385
God keep.

672
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,917
Roger, CS-2, I got that fine.

673
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,378
This is CS-1, over and out.

674
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,755
Hey, Morey?

675
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,092
I got the report on that cowboy.

676
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,301
Yeah?

677
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,847
John W. Burns, Socorro, New Mexico.

678
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,850
He's born 1919, Joplin, Missouri.

679
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:22,229
He served seven months in a US
Army disciplinary training center

680
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:25,899
at Inchon, South Korea, for
striking a superior officer.

681
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,735
February 22nd, 1951.

682
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,946
February 22nd.

683
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,700
He was just celebrating
Washington's birthday, that's all.

684
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:39,246
Wounded in action, November 4th, 1951.

685
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,206
Election day.

686
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,001
Purple Heart, Distinguished
Service Cross with oak leaves.

687
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:48,964
Discharged at Fort Dix, New
Jersey, February 14th, 1952.

688
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,799
Valentine's Day.

689
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,178
(ASNAPS FINGERS)

690
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:04,313
Broke out of disciplinary
training center, June 14th, 1951.

691
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,441
Flag Day.

692
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,819
Anything on the two Navajos?

693
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,363
A couple of previous plain drunks.

694
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,994
Bill Hassler from the
news wants to see you.

695
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,662
That fathead. What does he want?

696
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,247
I didn't tell him you were in,

697
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,749
but the story on the jailbreak.

698
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,751
Then tell him I'm out.

699
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,470
There goes that dog again.

700
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,139
Atta boy!

701
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,350
Faithful Fido.

702
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,979
Now, cut across and
hit that barber pole.

703
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,773
CS-1, over. Go on.

704
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,692
Roger. I got Floyd.

705
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,236
Switch on the speaker.

706
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,862
Speaker? Right.

707
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,323
GLYNN: This is CS-4.

708
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,743
When do I get off for
lunch? Where's Johnson? Over.

709
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,828
I'll take that.

710
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,209
Floyd, the boys upstairs tell me that

711
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,710
the cowboy and Bondi were chummy.

712
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,713
Get over to Bondi's house and
see what you can find out. Over.

713
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,508
You want me to check or
have lunch first? Over.

714
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,011
Cut out the horsing around,
get over there now. Out!

715
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,736
I bet you're way above the
foothills already, cowboy.

716
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,448
I'll just bet you are.

717
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,942
Whoa! Whoa!

718
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,696
You little witch, when I
say "whoa", you better whoa.

719
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,415
You gotta have everything
first, don't you? Huh?

720
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,003
No danger of you bloating up.

721
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,090
Get about one good
swallow every five minutes.

722
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,476
Green grass, too.

723
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,397
You never had it so good.

724
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:58,505
Don't worry, Whisky, I'm
not going anywhere just yet.

725
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:40,922
Damn.

726
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,930
This is CS-1. Come on in, Floyd. Over.

727
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,224
GLYNN: I saw boot prints, Morey.

728
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,934
When you see boot prints,
you've got a right to assume

729
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,103
those high heels fit into a stirrup.

730
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,939
And I was right. I found a trail, Morey.

731
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,109
Then farther up, I come on a
place where somebody had cut a hole

732
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,695
in that barbed wire fence
at the edge of the mesa.

733
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,990
It was a new cut, no rust
on the end of the wires.

734
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,660
Trail goes straight east to
the mountains, Morey. Over.

735
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,246
Floyd, that's good work. Come
on in and get something to eat.

736
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,624
Over and out.

737
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,462
MOREY: Call the forest
ranger at El Sangre

738
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,797
and tell him to check on any campfires.

739
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,800
Get the relay station up on the
rim, tell 'em the same thing.

740
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:25,967
HARRY: Right.

741
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,974
Don't blow it all away. Feed's
gonna be scarce for a while.

742
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,436
Gonna have visitors, little gal.

743
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,652
See that rim up there?

744
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,614
It's a good long climb.

745
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,160
Once we get to the other
side of it, we're home, baby.

746
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,239
Judas priest!

747
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,915
Judas, Morey!

748
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,711
Well, don't stand there hollering
Judas! Keep on trying to get Glynn.

749
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,922
Okay.

750
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,974
CS-3 calling
CS-4. Over.

751
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,979
Hello, CS-4, this
is CS-3. Over.

752
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,983
They still don't get us, Morey.

753
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,486
Now, they'll be able to hear
us when they hit the rim.

754
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,279
Call them other fellas and see if...

755
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:35,490
What? What'd you say, Morey?

756
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,037
I said call them other fellas and
see if they're still on the road.

757
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,748
Tell 'em not to take the car up
the wash. They'll never make it.

758
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,209
Have 'em go south another mile.

759
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,796
And ask the State if we're
ever gonna get that airplane.

760
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,506
Airplane? Right!

761
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,297
Burns!

762
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,759
Come on back!

763
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,220
You can't get away!

764
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,057
Come back!

765
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,458
Whoa.

766
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:13,213
Stop that, Whisky. Stop that.

767
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,965
Come on.

768
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:38,488
Hi there, CS-4.
This is CS-3. Over.

769
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:43,743
Hey, I been trying to get you for
a while. I read you fine now. Over.

770
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,329
Yeah. Hold it. Here comes Morey.

771
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,289
Wait, I'll switch 'em on the speaker.

772
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,791
The general's been
calling you, too, Morey.

773
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:50,917
That you, Glynn?

774
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,002
GLYNN: Yeah. We're awful high up.

775
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,338
We're up here on the southeast rim.

776
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,340
I never saw such country, Morey.

777
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,593
I'm staying near the car where
I can see the whole works.

778
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,220
MOREY: Where's Gutierrez?

779
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,721
He's moving ahead along the rim trail

780
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,431
to see what he can find close up.

781
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,016
Okay, and out.

782
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,518
Now, what's this about a general?

783
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,771
From the air base. General
Desalius. He wants to talk to you.

784
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,356
Well, get him!

785
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,067
CS-3 calling...

786
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,821
Why don't you two do a little
scouting over in Bear Canyon?

787
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,823
Don't get lost.

788
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,367
Sheriff Johnson here to talk
to General Desalius. Over.

789
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,664
Hello. This is General Desalius.

790
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,500
Yes, sir. Just a moment, sir.

791
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,460
It's General Desalius.

792
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,383
This is Johnson. What
can I do for you, General?

793
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,510
We're pretty busy out
here right now. Over.

794
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,429
General Desalius here.

795
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,514
I understand you're
hunting an escaped convict.

796
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,641
We're only 12 minutes away.

797
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,102
Can you use a helicopter
and a brace of Air Police?

798
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,231
I'd like to give my personnel a
little practical experience. Over.

799
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,069
Thank you, General. We
don't need the Air Police,

800
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,655
but we sure could use a helicopter.

801
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,241
We're moving to the
bottom of the west wall

802
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,993
at the mouth of Agua Dulce Canyon.

803
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,016
Whoa there.

804
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,769
Now you stay here and behave.

805
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:35,063
I'm gonna take a look around.

806
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:43,232
Sorry, have to keep moving, baby.

807
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,649
There it is! There it is!

808
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,455
Now, this is CS-3 ground to helicopter.

809
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,457
Can you hear me? Over.

810
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,420
What's the matter? Can't you get 'em?

811
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,423
Well, yeah, but he's so close
we can't hardly hear him.

812
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,174
Give me that mike!

813
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,887
Ground to helicopter!
This is Sheriff Johnson!

814
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,889
Can you hear me? Over.

815
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,059
Yeah, he can hear you. See? He's waving.

816
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,269
All right.

817
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,147
Cruise up and down Bear Canyon.

818
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,857
That's the big canyon to the south.

819
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,193
And keep an eye out
for a lone man on foot

820
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,320
or leading a horse or riding.

821
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,614
Report anything you see. Over.

822
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,241
Observer to Sheriff Johnson.

823
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,244
Do you want us to drop
down and pick him up? Over.

824
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,288
You can try if you want to.

825
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,748
If you can't land, just stay with him

826
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,126
until we can get there. Okay? Over.

827
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,629
We can pick him out of
a treetop if we want to.

828
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,111
You'd think we were chasing a ghost.

829
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,573
Invisible horse, invisible cowboy.

830
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,411
Harry, throw me that canteen.

831
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,998
I haven't got enough spit
left to wet a stick of gum.

832
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,712
Roger, CS-1. This
is CS-3. Over.

833
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,551
CS-3 out.

834
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,637
That was the State Police, Morey.

835
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:20,640
They got two patrol
cars in Scissors Canyon.

836
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,893
They're moving four men into
Bear Canyon, and two to the rim.

837
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,855
And they're sending that
airplane just as fast as they can.

838
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,401
Let's get out of this stinking arroyo.

839
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,695
I got a feeling we're being left behind.

840
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:57,987
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, baby.

841
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,907
Whoa, baby.

842
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,089
Whisky! Whisky!

843
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,434
Come here, girl. Come on.

844
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,856
Steady, Whisky.

845
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,613
Come here, girl. Come on, Whisky.

846
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,868
Come on. Come on. Come on.

847
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,416
Whoa, baby.

848
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,258
Whisky!

849
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,886
Whoa, baby. Whoa.

850
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,655
Whisky! Hold it! Hold it!

851
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:26,200
Hold it! Hold still!
Damn you, hold still!

852
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:34,208
Take it easy, Whisky. For
God's sakes, take it easy!

853
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,212
Come on.

854
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,267
Looks like they couldn't make it, Morey.

855
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:54,812
They must be walking
the rest of the way.

856
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,938
Hey, something's coming in, Morey!

857
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,732
Plug in the speaker!

858
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:43,068
PILOT: We got him! We got
him! He's right below us.

859
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,571
Man with a gray hat leading a horse.

860
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,823
Never mind that. Give me the binoculars.

861
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,700
He's trying to hide in the rocks.

862
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,495
He can't make it. We got him, all right.

863
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:15,100
Can't land here. No room for the prop.

864
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:20,481
We'll lower a rope ladder.
I'll climb down and get him.

865
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,867
Looks like they're getting
some practical experience.

866
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,936
Hey! Somebody's shooting!

867
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,105
Get out of his line of fire.

868
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,898
PILOT: He's not mad
but he's awful smart.

869
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:06,318
He's trying to hit the tail
rotor. Let us down easy.

870
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:13,450
He got the tail rotor, all right.

871
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,453
Get a fix on us,
Sheriff! We're going down!

872
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,135
Judas priest!

873
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,308
Get that, that General
what's-his-name.

874
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,392
Tell him to send an ambulance.

875
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:23,646
Tell him his personnel just got a
belly-full of practical experience.

876
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:24,730
Hurry!

877
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:26,273
Where are those binoculars?

878
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,026
CS-3, calling Air Base. Over.

879
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:33,572
CS-3 calling Air Base. Over.

880
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,200
DEPUTY: See it crash, Morey?

881
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,661
No wind, no nothing!

882
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:41,246
It just sank like a rock in a well.

883
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,707
It didn't sink, you fool.

884
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,001
Our cowboy's just shot down
the Air Force, that's all.

885
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,670
Get over there and
help 'em. Both of you.

886
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:49,964
Hurry up! HARRY: This is CS-3.

887
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:53,425
I just wanted to report to you that...

888
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,510
What a mess!

889
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:58,305
...the helicopter you sent us has
been shot down by the fugitive,

890
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:01,100
and has crashed just below us. Over.

891
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:10,067
Yes, sir, General
Desalius, just a minute.

892
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,986
I'll get Sheriff Johnson. Over.

893
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:14,571
Now if I can only spot that cowpoke.

894
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:18,283
That general sure wants
to talk to you, Morey.

895
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:21,996
Well, get him!

896
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,288
I've got him.

897
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:26,542
I'm gonna get him on the
speaker. He's awful hot.

898
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:29,086
Sheriff, this is General Desalius!

899
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,088
What have you done with my helicopter?

900
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:40,431
I didn't do anything with it,
General. The fugitive shot it down.

901
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:42,224
Your men aren't badly hurt,

902
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,559
but you'll have to
haul that flying machine

903
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:45,519
out of here piece by piece. Over.

904
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:48,480
Do you know how much my
helicopters cost, Sheriff?

905
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:51,442
Do you? Do you have any notion at all?

906
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:56,697
No, I don't know,
General, and I don't...

907
01:23:56,781 --> 01:24:00,993
$120,000! $120,000!

908
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,578
You didn't let me finish.

909
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:06,165
I don't know what it cost and I
don't give a damn! Over and out!

910
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:08,000
Turn that thing off!

911
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,505
I'm going over there
and set for a while.

912
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,632
Call the State and have them
put armor plate on that plane

913
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:18,052
they ain't sent us and ain't going to.

914
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,929
Call Glynn and see how Gutierrez
is doing on the rim trail.

915
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:23,015
Call Herrera and ask if
he's sleeping or tracking.

916
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,727
Keep calling 'em all. Keep
'em talking. Keep 'em moving.

917
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,855
CS-3
calling CS-4.

918
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:35,944
For two bits I'd call
the whole thing off.

919
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,281
HARRY: Morey wants a fix on Gutierrez.

920
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:41,825
Get on 'im, will you? Over and out.

921
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:08,519
Son of a gun!

922
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,525
Heading straight for the
rim, aren't you, cowboy?

923
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:19,404
You know, I believe if you'd turn
loose of that horse, you'd make it.

924
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,907
Harry! Get me Glynn and
Gutierrez up on the hill.

925
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,784
Get 'em quick! Right.

926
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,760
Find a way outta here.

927
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:44,072
It's all over, John W. Burns.

928
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,243
I know where you are.

929
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:52,164
So step out beside your horse

930
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:56,668
and put your hands up, John W...

931
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:22,236
Please.

932
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,239
My treat.

933
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:55,329
Now, hold still, you little whey-belly!

934
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:59,541
You been nothing but trouble
since the first day I found you.

935
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,253
You're no good and you know it.

936
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:08,383
Besides, there's no way
up there for both of us.

937
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,594
Unless you can climb a rope.

938
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:13,722
Just stay here and eat.

939
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,060
They'll pick you up when they
find that gorilla over there.

940
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:26,068
Just take it easy.

941
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,661
You're worse than a woman.

942
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:20,956
What the hell!

943
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,614
Whoa, whoa.

944
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:48,793
All right, come on.

945
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:50,462
Come on.

946
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:05,852
Come on, come on.

947
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,827
All right, girl.

948
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,999
Oh, Whisky, girl.

949
01:33:15,047 --> 01:33:17,048
You gotta listen, Whisky.

950
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:20,427
You stop playing.

951
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:22,929
Stop playing.

952
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:33,815
MAN: Hey, Bob! That's
Gutierrez down there!

953
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,443
There's something wrong with him!

954
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:37,819
Let's go!

955
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,897
Take it easy, Whisky.

956
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,460
The biggest stand of
timber I ever did see.

957
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:19,671
All right, Whisky, girl!

958
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,673
Just another 50, 75 yards

959
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:23,967
and we got pine trees
rolling all the way to Mexico!

960
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,301
Hup! Let's go!

961
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:28,805
Come on! Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

962
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:35,687
Come on, Whisky. Make an effort!

963
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:37,313
Just one more effort! Come on!

964
01:35:58,043 --> 01:36:00,420
GLYNN: There they are, boys! Up there!

965
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:28,865
Run, you little devil! Run,
beauty! Run, sweetheart!

966
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:08,822
You son of a gun, you did it.

967
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,741
Yep, you sure did.

968
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,869
Crazy fool.

969
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,605
Huh? What's that?

970
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,274
Got any gum?

971
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,693
What'd you say, Morey?

972
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,444
You got any gum?

973
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,743
No, no, I don't buy gum. I don't use it.

974
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,871
Then stop hunting for it.

975
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,804
Whoa, whoa.

976
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,806
Whoa there, girl. Whoa.

977
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,283
Well, son of a gun.

978
01:38:57,681 --> 01:38:58,890
Well...

979
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:03,645
Well, Whisky, girl. You're
gonna be of some use after all.

980
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:12,236
Whoa, come here.

981
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:23,766
Okay, baby.

982
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:34,110
Think I'll cut across to Highway
60. Stop off at Banake's Diner.

983
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:35,820
You could use a good
steak, couldn't you?

984
01:40:35,904 --> 01:40:37,405
Steak? Right!

985
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:21,407
You pay attention, you sweet,
brainless little cayuse.

986
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:26,245
Manzano Mountains on the
other side of that road.

987
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:30,249
Lead us straight to Mexico
on a carpet of pine needles.

988
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:34,837
Now, when I say "Hup..."
Whoa, whoa! Not yet, baby!

989
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:38,633
But when I say it,
you just better do it.

990
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,054
Hup!

991
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,740
Come on, Whisky.

992
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:11,040
Oh, my God!

993
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,795
Hup! Hup!

994
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:26,430
God help me.

995
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:37,608
You're all right, buddy.

996
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:44,866
Blankets! Blankets! Somebody
get me some blankets, quick!

997
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:47,660
I've got some in my car! Just a minute!

998
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:55,459
Take it easy, buddy. Take it easy.

999
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:58,629
Gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

1000
01:42:59,464 --> 01:43:00,673
Just take it easy, buddy.

1001
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:03,509
I'll go on ahead and call an ambulance.

1002
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:05,803
You're gonna be all
right, buddy. All right.

1003
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:09,473
You're gonna be all right,
buddy. You just take it easy.

1004
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,977
Here. Here, gimme.

1005
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:16,230
Just take it easy. Gonna be all right.

1006
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,815
You just take it easy,
buddy. I'll put this up.

1007
01:43:17,941 --> 01:43:19,901
Thank you. Take it easy.

1008
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,920
Keep that traffic moving, John!

1009
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:40,671
WOMAN: Want to put him in my car?

1010
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:42,215
No, better not move him.
He's gotta take it awful easy.

1011
01:43:42,299 --> 01:43:44,592
What happened? Did you hit him?

1012
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:50,681
Somebody's gone for
an ambulance, Officer.

1013
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:07,406
Why doesn't somebody put that
poor animal out of its misery?

1014
01:44:11,161 --> 01:44:12,286
Check that horse.

1015
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:13,454
Sure, Morey.

1016
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,209
Excuse me.

1017
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:21,128
TROOPER: Hello, Sheriff. Hi.

1018
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:32,431
Is this the man you've been looking for?

1019
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:47,530
I can't tell.

1020
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,950
Man I'm looking for, I
never saw him this close.

1021
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,260
All right! Everybody stand
back and let the ambulance in!

1022
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:53,721
Move back! Cut it over!

1023
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,640
All right, stand back.
Give him a chance.

1024
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:58,684
He's gonna be all right.

1025
01:46:02,272 --> 01:46:04,982
HINTON: Just take it
easy. Sure you are, buddy.

1026
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:08,652
I killed her, Morey.

1027
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,908
Let's go home.

1028
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:21,707
TROOPER: Let's get
back to the cars, folks.

1029
01:46:23,585 --> 01:46:25,419
MAN: Now slide him in easy.

1030
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:27,838
He ain't gonna die, is he?

1031
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,340
How do I know?

1032
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:32,009
We got a report to make out. Come on.

1033
01:46:37,557 --> 01:46:39,100
TROOPER: Drive it through!

1034
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:44,063
All right, come on! Let's go!

1035
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:47,149
Keep it moving! Come on! Faster!

1036
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:52,405
Faster, faster! Come on!

1037
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:55,574
Let's go!

1038
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,661
Come on! Keep moving!

1039
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,372
Faster! Faster!
