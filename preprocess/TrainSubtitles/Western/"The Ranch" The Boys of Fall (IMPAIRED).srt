00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,301
You see the way I gathered them cattle?
It was like a master class.

4
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,889
Cows are probably like,
"Man, did you see the way he gathered us?

5
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:21,432
And how ruggedly handsome he is?"

6
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:26,145
"Yeah, and did you see how he slammed
his dad's hand in the tailgate?"

7
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:29,733
I'd have told you
to rub some dirt on it, but...

8
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,026
that's what you did.

9
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:35,947
- Hey-o.
- Hey.

10
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,157
- How was practice?
- Practice?

11
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:41,995
What, are you pretending to be the girls'
high school volleyball coach again?

12
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,414
No, man, they got wise to that.

13
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:47,834
Defensive backs coach
for the football team.

14
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,587
I get more 18-year-old cheerleaders now
than I did in high school.

15
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:55,634
- I never figured you for a coach.
- Yeah, me neither.

16
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,551
But Dad will only give me
time off for two things.

17
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:59,846
- Funerals and football.
- Exactly.

18
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,599
So, five years ago,
when the defensive backs coach died,

19
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:03,892
I got both.

20
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,270
- We got a team this year?
- Oh, hell yeah, we got a team.

21
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,397
So, what's the deal?
We gonna beat Norwood or what?

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,817
God, I hope so.
Can't stand Norwood.

23
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,944
They act all high and mighty
with their Super Walmart

24
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:16,445
and their second stop light.

25
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:20,867
The John Deere store is in Norwood.

26
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,746
Last year, some kid offered me
a loser's discount out of pity.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,082
I paid full price.

28
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,460
Yo, I'm telling you guys,
we got a hell of a team.

29
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:34,088
Quarterback... got an arm like a shotgun.

30
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:35,423
Calling him the next Colt Bennett.

31
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:39,052
Does that mean he's gonna be
livin' at home when he's 34 years old?

32
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:43,181
"The next Colt Bennett." [scoffs]

33
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,183
Yeah, they say that every year.

34
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,601
There ain't never gonna be
another Colt Bennett.

35
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,646
Remember that guy that came after me?
Was it Dubanowski?

36
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,898
What's he doing now?

37
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,442
He's a surgeon.

38
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,111
He separated Siamese twins.

39
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,032
So what? He separates shit.

40
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:05,829
I brought a whole town together
and won State. All with this arm.

41
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:09,207
Remember who you got that arm from.

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,167
You got your mother's.

43
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:15,922
I thought you were a linebacker, Dad.

44
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,549
In my day, we did it all.
We played both ways.

45
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,802
Yeah, that means something
different nowadays, Dad.

46
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:23,179
All right, let's run a play.

47
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,681
Dad, you hike me the ball.
Rooster, go long.

48
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,767
- Hell no, man. I know that trick.
- What trick?

49
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,936
The one where you tell me to go long,
then go longer,

50
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,064
then you run inside, lock the door,
and dunk your balls in my Cheerios.

51
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,316
It's dinner.

52
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:38,194
I ain't gonna dunk my sack
in your hot soup.

53
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:41,072
You only make that mistake once.

54
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,742
What the hell's wrong with you two?

55
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:47,078
I grew up with two brothers.
Never saw nut one.

56
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:49,372
Rooster, go long.

57
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,040
Let's go. All right. Here we go.

58
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,375
Hut, hut!

59
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,835
[groans]

60
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,421
- You okay?
- Do I look like I'm okay?

61
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,384
Well, you look like
you're about to play both ways.

62
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,976
Couldn't just let me drive.

63
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,770
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,856
Every time you made a right hand turn,
you sounded like a female tennis player.

65
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,358
[grunts weakly]

66
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:24,908
Beau, what's wrong? You're walking
like you have an actual stick up your ass.

67
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:27,368
Threw his back out.

68
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:30,579
You know what's good for a bad back?

69
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:31,748
Pilates.

70
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,793
Not helping, Hank.

71
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:38,838
Excuse me for bringing
a little culture to this bar.

72
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:43,676
- You know you have to see someone, right?
- I'm fine.

73
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:47,138
You're fine? All right. Here, boys.

74
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,222
Thanks, Mom.

75
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:52,726
And, Beau, since your back is fine
and you don't need to go to the doctor,

76
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,771
here's your beer.

77
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,565
Pick it up.

78
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,734
Go see a doctor.

79
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,989
And fork over $200 for a co-pay?
No, thanks.

80
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,534
If it ain't feeling better next week,
I'll go to the vet and get some pills.

81
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,288
Rooster, will you pick up my beer?

82
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,581
Yup.

83
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:17,460
Jameson, you touch that beer,
you'll never drink in this bar again.

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,754
Sorry, Dad.

85
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:26,219
I love you,
but I love free beer more, so...

86
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,138
Colt?

87
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:42,944
What are you gonna do, chase me?

88
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,575
Oh, my God.

89
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:51,035
Kenny.

90
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,788
Oh, man. You trying to avoid him
'cause he's banging your ex-girlfriend?

91
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:57,666
- Yeah, big time.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

92
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,335
Hey, yo, Kenny, what's up, my man?

93
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,505
Hey! Rooster! Colt!

94
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:05,299
Yo, man. You buying meth again
from Shaggy over there?

95
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,052
I had a feeling you might be here.

96
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:10,721
You know, because it's your mom's,
not because you have a drinking problem.

97
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:14,683
Two beers. That's cool.

98
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,687
So, Kenny, how's things with you and Abby?

99
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:22,733
They great? Because you guys
make a really, really cute couple.

100
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,485
Yeah.

101
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:25,861
- She's the best!
- Yeah.

102
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,071
She just gets me.

103
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:28,239
Yeah, that's great.

104
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,283
Hey, you know what?
I think Dad wants to get out of here.

105
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,701
No, I don't think he does.
[clears throat]

106
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:36,330
Uh, so, you know, I know
all the reasons why Abby loves you,

107
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:39,125
but why don't you tell me and Colt
all the reasons you love Abby.

108
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,210
Uh, yeah, I mean...

109
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:43,796
- She smells like vanilla.
- Whoo!

110
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:45,839
You hear that, Colt?

111
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:47,633
Vanilla!

112
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,886
Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard,

113
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,183
but I was recently elected president
of the Garrison football booster club,

114
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,351
and we're kicking things off,
pun intended,

115
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:59,770
with a, uh, spaghetti dinner.

116
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,481
I was wondering if you'd come by
and maybe say a few words.

117
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,525
No, thank you.

118
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,986
Pun intended.

119
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,283
Okay. Um... then maybe you could
donate something for our raffle?

120
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,203
I'd love to get an autographed picture
of you and the new quarterback.

121
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:17,246
Yeah, okay. I can do that.

122
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,957
Hey, you know, if you want,

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,126
I'll even do that, uh,
"Win a date with Colt Bennett" thing,

124
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,295
as long as it's rigged
and I get to pick the winner.

125
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,673
Yeah, man.

126
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:29,383
No fatties. No flatties.

127
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,723
Oh, okay.
Like I'm the only one thinking that.

128
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,102
[country music playing]

129
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,644
[music fades]

130
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,687
Hello, Mr. Bennett.

131
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,564
Where's Dr. Boyd?

132
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:27,691
I'm Dr. Boyd.

133
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,485
No, the real Dr. Boyd.

134
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,737
Oh, you're thinking of my dad.

135
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,031
When's the last time you saw him?

136
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,574
Oh, I don't know.
A year or two, maybe.

137
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,368
He died 12 years ago.

138
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,870
Maybe it was longer.

139
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,125
I took over his practice. But don't worry,
you're in good hands with me.

140
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,295
So, how long has your back
been bothering you?

141
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,754
None of your business.

142
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,383
Oh! Beau Bennett!

143
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,593
Okay, yeah! [chuckles]

144
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,637
I'll tell you what, I'll examine your back

145
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,140
and take a couple x-rays
and see what we're dealing with.

146
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:00,724
And while you're here,
we'll do a quick checkup.

147
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,644
I don't need a checkup.
Everything else is fine.

148
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,105
You haven't been to the doctor
in 12 years.

149
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,607
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't give you an examination.

150
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:11,360
On the plus side,
since I've become a doctor,

151
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:13,362
I've only killed three patients.

152
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:16,449
Oh, good. You're funny, too.

153
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:19,368
Are we done here?

154
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:20,994
How about this.

155
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,955
I'll give you a prescription
for your back.

156
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,713
Feel free to pick it up
and walk out of here anytime.

157
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,091
But if you can't, then I'm doing an exam.

158
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:36,510
You've been talkin' to my wife.

159
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,477
Staring at your old trophies, huh?

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,936
That's a little vain.

161
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:49,857
- Actually, I was staring at my reflection.
- [laughs]

162
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:51,817
So, what're you doing here?

163
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,946
Uh, they asked me to come
take a picture with the new quarterback.

164
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,866
- Oh.
- You got a couple hot teachers over there.

165
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,659
Looks like someone's got some competition.

166
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,079
Those are both students.

167
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:06,290
Even better.

168
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,959
All right. [chuckles]
I gotta get to my class.

169
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,505
Oh, look at that!
Are you in Miss Henderson's old room?

170
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:14,006
- [Abby] Yeah.
- Oh, man.

171
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,341
You know, she was my favorite teacher.

172
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:18,094
Of course. 'Cause instead of teaching us
about World War II,

173
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,264
she just put on <i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>
sat at her desk,

174
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:22,848
drank out of her "water bottle."

175
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:27,228
I don't know who won World War II,
but I know we got Matt Damon back.

176
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,771
[laughs]

177
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,231
[school bell rings]

178
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,400
Hey. You better get in there.

179
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,735
You know, if the teacher's not in the room
in the first five minutes,

180
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:36,069
the whole class gets to go home.

181
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:38,572
Wasn't a thing then, not a thing now.

182
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,659
Oh, and, uh, we beat the Germans.

183
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,870
[scoffs] Yeah, nice try.
I know that was World War I.

184
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,626
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey.

185
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,253
Check out these new teachers?

186
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,462
Actually, they're students.

187
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,131
Whoa.

188
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,507
Thanks for the heads-up.

189
00:10:58,467 --> 00:10:59,718
You think they're seniors?

190
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,388
Here he is.

191
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:04,723
Bennett. Long time no see.

192
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,142
Hey, Coach Fitz.

193
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,602
Have you met Josh? He's gonna take us
to our next State Championship.

194
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,563
- Hey. Nice to meet you, bud.
- You, too.

195
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,356
You're the reason
I started playing football, sir.

196
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,816
[chuckles] "Sir"?

197
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,026
Come on, save "sir"
for when you meet your girlfriend's dad

198
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,321
or you're getting pulled over
for your first DUI.

199
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,738
Good advice, Colt.

200
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:21,365
[clicks tongue]

201
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,326
You know, my dad taped over
my first birthday party

202
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:26,119
- to record your State Championship game.
- Oh.

203
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:28,206
You remember that last play?

204
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,748
Nah, not really.

205
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:33,043
Seven seconds left.
Down by three.

206
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:36,004
On the other team's 20.
I'm staring at a cover two defense.

207
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:40,050
This hot chick in the second row
just going to town on a corn dog.

208
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,263
This guy... [chuckles]
wants me to play it safe.

209
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:46,765
Get a few yards, so he can
put the kicker in and tie the game.

210
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:49,101
- [chuckles]
- So I audible to a pass, right?

211
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:53,606
I take the snap, I drop back,
and my primary receiver falls down.

212
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,733
Okay? So I roll out to the right.

213
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,026
Their all-state linebacker's
coming down on me, right?

214
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,111
I know this guy.

215
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,029
He wants to rip my head off
'cause I banged his sister.

216
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:04,617
Wilson was wide open in the end zone.

217
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,744
[chuckles] Like I'm gonna
throw the ball to Wilson.

218
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,037
The only thing he caught
that season was crabs.

219
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,914
Linebacker's sister.
I got 'em, too.

220
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,377
She got 'em from me.

221
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,880
So I hurdle for the end zone,
ball outstretched.

222
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,466
Zebra puts his arms up.
Game over.

223
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,343
State Championship. Boom!

224
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,720
Aaron Rodgers stole that from me.

225
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,557
Discount double check my ass.

226
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,519
It was a great day for the whole town.

227
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:34,062
I puked on a cop car...
[chuckles] and no one even cared.

228
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:37,525
Hey, you know, if you want,

229
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:39,902
I could come down and help you out a bit.

230
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,905
- What do you say, Coach?
- Sounds great.

231
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,908
You gotta tell that story
at the spaghetti dinner.

232
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:51,246
Yeah, I think I could come down
and say a few words.

233
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,374
Sweet! The guys will be stoked.

234
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,751
You really were the best.

235
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:57,920
Aw... yeah.

236
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,007
Well, Mr. Bennett...

237
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:05,177
I have to say, for the most part,

238
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,012
you're in impressive health
for a man your age.

239
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:10,599
You know, when I take my truck in
and there's nothing wrong with it,

240
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,184
they don't charge me.

241
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:18,065
Take these until your back pain subsides,
and, um, you should be fine in a few days.

242
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:21,777
Sounds good.
I'll see you in 12 years.

243
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,946
I'm not done.

244
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:25,573
We have to talk about
your high blood pressure.

245
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:26,907
What?

246
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,743
You're at risk for stage two hypertension,

247
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:32,663
which could lead to heart attack,
stroke or kidney failure.

248
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,457
Unless you make some lifestyle changes.

249
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,334
I'm not doing Pilates.

250
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,004
I think we can start with your diet.
I'd like you to cut back on red meat.

251
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,089
Pass.

252
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:44,132
You're also going to have
to cut down on your drinking.

253
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,551
Try again.

254
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:48,220
What about stress?
What do you do to reduce it?

255
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:50,222
Eat steak and drink whiskey.

256
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,809
Mr. Bennett, come on, this is serious.

257
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:57,813
My stress will come down
when I sell my calves.

258
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:00,065
Well, in the meantime,
you need to cut back on salt

259
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:01,359
and eat more vegetables.

260
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:03,986
Okay, I think we're done here.

261
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:11,785
Yeah. If I had receivers like you,
I'd have won four State Championships.

262
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,704
Drop it. All right.

263
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,206
Now give me five yards and a slant.

264
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,334
That's 35 in dog yards.

265
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,210
Hut. Hut. Hike.

266
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:23,714
- Hey.
- Hey.

267
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:24,798
How was practice?

268
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,468
We ran corner blitzes,

269
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,554
I confiscated one kid's pot,
sold it to another kid.

270
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,682
Overall, a pretty good day.

271
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,975
Yeah.

272
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:38,812
Hey, you know what?
That Josh seems like a pretty good kid.

273
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:39,938
I think I can really help him.

274
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:41,649
Yeah, about that.

275
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:44,151
I'm not sure the coach wants you
hanging around the team.

276
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,778
Why would you say that?

277
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:48,321
Because the coach told me, "I don't want
Colt hanging around the team."

278
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:50,449
Why not?

279
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,951
Well, he said you have
a disrespectful attitude.

280
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,120
Fuck that asshole.

281
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,122
Clearly, he's out of his mind.

282
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:59,417
I won that guy his only State title.

283
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,169
Colt, you came in there
and told a five-minute story,

284
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:05,047
and the moral was, "Don't listen to Coach
and you win a State Championship."

285
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,215
What kind of message
does that send to the team?

286
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:11,053
One that ends with,
"You win a State Championship."

287
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:14,222
You know what?
It's fine. It's Coach's loss.

288
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:15,849
Team's loss. Town's loss.

289
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:19,437
- I'm sorry.
- Don't feel sorry for me.

290
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,604
Feel sorry for the coach.

291
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,815
And the team.
And the town.

292
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,694
You're being a baby.
And a tool.

293
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:27,861
And a douche.

294
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,993
Well, Maggie, I hope you're happy.

295
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:36,995
I am.

296
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,832
How are you gonna ruin it?

297
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,668
You gave me high blood pressure.

298
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:47,005
- What?
- I went to the doctor, like you said.

299
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,633
Now I have high blood pressure.

300
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:54,262
High blood pressure is manageable.
You know, it's not the end of the world.

301
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,932
I'm prepared for the end of the world.

302
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,101
I've got a shelter full of beef jerky.

303
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,731
Yeah, I know. You took me there
for our 20th anniversary.

304
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,234
Look, all you have to do
is take more walks,

305
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:10,320
drink more water,
and switch from bacon to turkey bacon.

306
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,824
Yeah, and I'll trade my truck
in on a Prius.

307
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,952
If it'll help, I'll diet with you.
How's that?

308
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:23,000
Why can't you just be like a normal wife
and not care if I live or die?

309
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:26,378
Don't worry about it.
You stay healthy,

310
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:28,464
you're looking at another 30 years

311
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:31,424
of wakin' up at dawn
and workin' that ranch with your sons.

312
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,761
Sweet Jesus, take me now.

313
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,937
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey.

314
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:46,607
Abby. What are you doing here?

315
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,860
Well, I thought you might wanna
wear this to the spaghetti dinner.

316
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,406
- What is that? My old letterman jacket?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,741
You still got it, huh?

318
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:59,036
Yeah, you know, I thought maybe,
you know, after we broke up,

319
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,831
you'd become famous
and I could sell it for a lot of money.

320
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,208
Anyway, here.

321
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,588
- Look at that.
- [chuckles] Nice.

322
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,089
- Wow!
- [laughs]

323
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,761
Do I look as good as I think I do?

324
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,014
Don't think that's possible.

325
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,018
I heard about the coaching thing.

326
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:26,021
Oh, yeah.
It's not a big deal.

327
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,356
I was just offering a favor.

328
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,693
I mean, heck, if Blake Shelton
wants to teach you how to sing,

329
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:33,779
you don't go with Shakira, right?

330
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,824
Well, for what it's worth, Coach is crazy.

331
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:40,243
I mean, who knows more about getting
Garrison to State than Colt Bennett?

332
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,372
I guess you haven't heard
about the new Colt Bennett.

333
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:47,042
You know, I'm driving. [chuckles]

334
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:51,129
Yeah, I have. Josh, you know,
he's just another read-option clone.

335
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,965
I mean, he can hit the short crosses

336
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:55,425
and extend plays with his feet,
but he stares down his primary receiver

337
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,970
and that is just begging
to be intercepted.

338
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,389
Okay, now I'm offended
they didn't ask you to be the new coach.

339
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:04,267
Well, actually, they did.

340
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,394
I just had a full class schedule.

341
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:09,732
- That's why they hired Rooster. Shh.

Ah... [scoffs]

344
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,032
No. What do I miss?
Two-a-days, and the ice baths, and...

345
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:23,245
however many concussions I had.

346
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,957
Actually, I don't miss it at all.

347
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,877
You'd be a lot more convincing
if you weren't sitting there

348
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,837
holding a football and wearing
a letterman jacket.

[chuckles]

But I'm sure it must be hard.

351
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:41,554
I don't even know why
I came back to this stupid town.

352
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,808
What? I'm glad you came back.

353
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,019
I mean, as bad as you think
this place is with you,

354
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:48,771
it's even worse without you.

355
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,440
You're about the best thing here.

356
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,028
There you go.
You found something good.

357
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:59,364
Yeah, I did.

00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:02,117
Whoa, Colt. What are you doing? No.

What?

360
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,328
I have a boyfriend.

Yeah, Kenny.

making excuses to come out here?

You know what? Forget it.

Who's the best high school football team
in the state of Colorado?

[all] Garrison!

00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,162
Oh, come on!

474
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,498
You're arresting me
for sticking my hands in your butt?

475
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,126
Man, I'm not arresting you.
I'm just gonna get you home.

476
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,710
- Come on.
- Really?

477
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,879
You're a good guy, Beer Pong.

478
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,053
- What is this? A Glock?
- Gimme that!

479
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:02,060
Say what you want,
those kids are gonna remember that speech.

480
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,564
We need to sit and talk with him.

481
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:09,859
Well, I'm at a loss.
I've tried everything.

482
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,570
You've tried yelling at him
and kicking him out.

483
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:15,282
Like I said, I've tried everything.

484
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,036
Here comes Beer Pong.

485
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,289
Well, if someone had to find him,
I'm glad it was Billy.

486
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:24,374
[sighs]

487
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,169
[exhales deeply]

488
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:29,087
What's up, Beer Pong?
You got that 50 bucks you owe me?

489
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:33,675
You still sellin' weed
to high school kids, Rooster?

490
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:35,302
All right. Even Stevens.

491
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:41,683
I'm serious.
I can beat my high score.

492
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:44,686
It's not a video game, Bennett.
It's a breathalyzer.

493
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:49,066
[imitating Billy] "It's not a video game,
Bennett. It's a breathalyzer."

494
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,818
You used to be so chill, Beer Pong.

495
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:52,985
Thank you, Billy.

496
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,281
Picked him up on Route 68.
That's where you'll find your tractor.

497
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:58,491
Our tractor's in the barn.

498
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:01,828
Damn it.

499
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:05,665
Shh!

500
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:06,749
What's up?

501
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:10,878
- I stole Billy's Taser.
- [both laugh]

502
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:14,549
Not funny, dude.

503
00:26:14,632 --> 00:26:17,051
If I lose another one of these,
I'm off the force.

504
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,682
- Colt, sit, we need to talk.
- [slurring] Mom, I don't wanna hear it.

505
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,726
I already know
what everyone is gonna say.

506
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:28,938
[imitating Maggie] Colt,
I'm worried about you.

507
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:33,193
[imitating Beau] Colt, I'm mad at you.

508
00:26:34,652 --> 00:26:37,489
[imitating Rooster]
Colt, blah, blah, blah...

509
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,325
Something sarcastic.

510
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:43,870
The last one was you.

511
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:46,456
Blah, blah, blah.

512
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:47,957
[retches]

513
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,753
That's you in about two minutes.

514
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:52,962
[chuckles]

515
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,089
Yeah. Colt Bennett doesn't...

516
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,174
[retches]

517
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,411
Morning.

518
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:26,246
Damn it. [clears throat]

519
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,083
All right.

520
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,295
You're pissed.

521
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:35,797
I'm sorry.

522
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,634
I just made an idiot out of myself.

523
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:42,762
I embarrassed you,
and I embarrassed our family.

524
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:46,933
You also drove the Millers' tractor
through the Dairy Queen drive-thru.

525
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,564
All right. You know what?

526
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:54,566
You're gonna yell at me,

527
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:57,151
so why don't we just go ahead
and get that over with.

528
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:59,654
That hasn't done much good so far.

529
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:02,156
What?

530
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:05,785
You know, when I got back from Vietnam,

531
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:08,538
I had absolutely no idea
what I was gonna do.

532
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,166
Twenty-two years old.

533
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:15,670
I was a soldier.
It was all I knew.

534
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,591
Lost boy come home from the war.

535
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:24,011
Only thing I had was right here.

536
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,680
So I came back home.

537
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:32,687
Grandpa bitch at you
for living at home, too?

538
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,359
No, I don't think he did.

539
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:41,321
He was just glad to have another hand.

540
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:42,905
One he didn't have to pay.

541
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,285
We were all just thankful
I came home in one piece.

542
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,415
Wasn't long after that
grandfather died.

543
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,335
Momma was all alone.

544
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,505
Outta nowhere.

545
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,552
But the work didn't die with him.

546
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:08,931
And I knew right there who I was.

547
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:12,935
I was a rancher.

548
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:16,273
And for me, that was just right.

549
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:24,364
I ain't sure
that ranching is just right for me.

550
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:31,663
You know, Colt, I'm not smart enough
to tell you how to live your life.

551
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,584
That's for you to figure out.

552
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,129
But I do believe that one of these days

553
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,341
you're gonna wake up
and know exactly who you are.

554
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:48,220
I just hope I live long enough
to see that.

555
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,517
In the meantime...

556
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:55,812
you got a place you belong

557
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,855
and work you can take pride in.

558
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:03,736
Appreciate that.

559
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:08,950
Or...

560
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:13,746
you wake up one day
and find yourself eating quinoa.

561
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,962
Whatever in the fuck that is.

562
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:23,548
