00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,991
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.

152
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:05,830
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.

153
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:08,113
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.

154
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:11,315
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.

155
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,873
I'd take only what I set out to get.

156
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,392
Even if there was still $500,000 worth...

157
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:18,469
lying around, waiting to be picked up.

158
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,867
I've dug in Alaska
and Canada and Colorado.

159
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,791
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home...

160
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:26,392
and almost enough over
to cure me of the fever I'd caught.

161
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:30,073
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.

162
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:32,832
Yeah. I know what gold does
to men's souls.

163
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:36,151
MAN #2: You talk as though
you struck it rich sometime, pop.

164
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,512
How about it?

165
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,866
Then what are you doing in here,
a down-and-outer?

166
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,188
That's gold. That's what it makes us.

167
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,746
Never knew a prospector yet
that died rich.

168
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,671
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it
trying to find another.

169
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,749
I'm no exception to the rule.

170
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:56,077
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now
but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.

171
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,554
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe
if anybody's willing to share expenses.

172
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,833
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.

173
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:05,308
But you got to have a stomach
for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.

174
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,708
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.

175
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,631
Partners accusing each other
of all sorts of crimes.

176

[Sighs]

177
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:16,396
As long as there's no find,
the noble brotherhood will last.

178
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:20,630
But when the piles of gold begin to grow,
that's when the trouble starts.

179
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,435
I wouldn't mind
a little of that kind of trouble.

180
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,829
DOBBS: I think I'll go to sleep...

181
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,472
and dream about piles of gold...

182
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,914
getting bigger and bigger.

183
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,951
Do you believe what the old man...

184
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:43,313
who was doing all the talking
at the Oso Negro...

185
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:44,990
said the other night...

186
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:48,627
about gold changing a man's soul
so that he ain't the same kind of a guy...

187
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:51,186
that he was before finding it?

188
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,030
Guess that all depends on the man.

189
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,995
That's exactly what I say.

190
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,349
Gold don't carry any curse with it.

191
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:01,477
It all depends on whether or not
the guy who finds it is the right guy.

192
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,146
The way I see it...

193
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:05,832
gold can be as much of a blessing
as a curse.

of the Hotel Bristol.

196
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,072
Is that Pat McCormick
or am I seeing things?

197
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,312
It's him.

198

go and buy me something?

00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,188
I could use a new pair of shoes.

Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.

- López.

to come and have a drink with me.

to attend to with these men.

Where have you been?

00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,794
I've been looking all over for you.

210
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,517
Three shots of rye.

CURTIN: Make mine brandy, Three Star.

212
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,712
DOBBS: Two brandies.
McCORMICK: Rye is good enough for me.

213
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,149
I suppose you're wondering
about that money that's coming to you.

214
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:05,196
The fact is I haven't been paid off
on that contract myself.

215
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,271
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.

216
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,952
It will come through by Monday
and we can set out Friday.

217

CURTIN: Better come across.

I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25°/o.

I guess I can make it 30°/o.

You'll be carried out.

Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?

226
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,593
Two more brandies.

Why not try gold-digging for a change?

It ain't any riskier
than waiting around here for a break...

The longer it lasts, the greater our chance
of digging something up would be.

COD Y: Professional?
CURTIN: Yeah.

COD Y: What all do you hunt?

763
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,906
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.

764
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:56,113
How long did you say
you'd been in these mountains?

765
00:50:56,198 --> 00:50:57,233
A few months.

766
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:00,116
Ever seen anything
that looked like pay dirt?

767
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:01,427
No.

768
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,669
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods
up in those mountains.

769
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:07,474
No, I know
the whole landscape around here.

770
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:09,992
If there'd been gold,
you can bet I'd have seen it.

771
00:51:10,078 --> 00:51:11,875
There's nothing doing here for gold.

772

I can look at a hill five miles away...

773
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,393
and tell you if it carries
an ounce or a shipload.

If you haven't found anything...

775
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:20,430
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.

776
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:22,873
There's indications in the valley,
lots of indications.

777
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,188
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge...

778
00:51:25,278 --> 00:51:26,791
washed down by the tropical rains.

You gotta hand it to the Mexicans
when it comes to swift justice.

783
00:51:37,198 --> 00:51:39,314
Once the federales get their mitts
on a criminal...

784
00:51:39,398 --> 00:51:42,515
they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.

785
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:43,667
When he's dug deep enough...

786
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:47,228
they tell him to put the shovel down,
smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.

787
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:50,988
In another five minutes he's being covered
over with the earth he dug out.

788
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:53,831
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.

I'm ready to start

which wouldn't show the tracks.

796
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:34,708
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.

I guess it's only a matter of time
till he shows up here.

798
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:41,507
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.

799
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:45,193
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent
and then report us to the officials.

800

Once they come, we can't stay
or take our goods with us if we left.

There's nothing else to do
but kill him the minute he appears.

No crime to visit these mountains.

803
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:56,070
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.

804
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:57,989
If you were to shoot him
it might come out.

805
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,830
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.

806
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:02,830
We can push him off a rock
and claim it was an accident.

807
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:04,749
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?

808

it's a great joke played on us...

by the Lord, or fate, or nature,
whatever you prefer...

certainly had a sense of humor!

I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned
as a medicine man.

1581
01:58:26,742 --> 01:58:28,733
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want...

1582
01:58:28,822 --> 01:58:31,495
roof over my head,
and a drink now and then to warm me up.

1583
01:58:31,582 --> 01:58:34,221
I will be worshipped, fed,
and treated like a high priest...

1584
01:58:34,302 --> 01:58:38,011
for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.

1585
01:58:38,102 --> 01:58:39,694
Come and see me sometime, my boy.

1586
01:58:39,782 --> 01:58:42,580
Even you'll take off your hat
when you see how respected I am.

1587
01:58:42,662 --> 01:58:45,495
The day before yesterday,
they wanted to make me their legislature.

1588
01:58:45,582 --> 01:58:46,810
Their whole legislature!

1589
01:58:46,902 --> 01:58:50,497
I don't know what that means. I think
it's the highest honor they can bestow.

1590
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:53,255
Yeah, I'm all fixed
for the rest of my natural life.

1591
01:58:53,342 --> 01:58:55,378
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?

1592
01:58:55,462 --> 01:58:56,975
I haven't got any idea.

1593
01:58:57,062 --> 01:59:00,657
You're young. You've got plenty of time
to make three or four fortunes.

You know, the worst ain't so bad
when it finally happens.

1595
01:59:03,982 --> 01:59:06,780
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be
before it happens.

1596
01:59:06,862 --> 01:59:09,092
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.

All I'm out is $200
when you come right down to it.

No, all places are the same to me.

1601

and the hides'll bring...
