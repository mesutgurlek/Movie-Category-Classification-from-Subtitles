He's yours too,
if you want to be here, all right?

191
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,656
Well, life is a mystery.

192

I'll give you that, Bohannon.

193

Citins appear to be complying with the ban.

195
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:06,636

What the hell do you think you're doin'?

00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,517
I'm reading <i>the Cheyenne Leader.</i>

We could have been killed!

for the construction of a roundhouse.

206
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,454
You can't tear down a Government building!

207
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,457
And you can't muscle
into the casino business.

Yet here we are.

What we are building here,
Mr. Campbell, is a roundtable.

It was the best day of our lives.

333
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,700
It was June of '64,
and we come across this empty train

334
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,153
at a whistle stop in backwoods Virginia.

335
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,989
It was the definition of a sitting duck.

336
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,992
But when we get inside...
Now, you're gonna love this part...

337
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,828
When we get inside, it's a medical train.

338
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,298
And it's not empty.
It's piled up with Yankees.

339
00:21:57,332 --> 00:22:00,301
They all hobbled up on cots.
They're cryin' to their mamas.

340
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,053
They ain't got a gun, nothin'.

341
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,473
We jump a couple sentries,
and then it's just bam...

342
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:08,009
Bam... bam...

343
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:09,677

All dead.

345
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,183
That's finished. The war ended.

Um, whiskey?

352
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:56,591
I've been tasked to bring order to this city

353
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,860
by the next President of the United States.

354
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,562
You say you bring order,

355
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,933
yet men hang from saloon
rafters and lampposts.

356

Lynch, burn, bludgeon, or bury...

357
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:13,608
I will do whatever's necessary
to rid this city of corruption,

358
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,610
then seize your railroad.

Huh?

362
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:27,421

363

Forgive me, I have a degree in ophthalmology

from Albany Medical College.

You see, ocular malformations

366
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,603
can inhibit mental processes,

367

leaving one delusional.

369

was on man tangled with Mexicans.

Then you spoke like you done
at dinner in front of my wife?

My time as father of this ward...

500
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:42,341
It's already fostered a miracle.

501
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:45,811
My miracle is Cullen Bohannon...

502
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:48,681
A man who cast me out,

503
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,517
tried to kill me,

504
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,353
was brought to this ward

505
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,406
by the hand of God to be saved.

506
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,692
And after a winter of spiritual healing,

507
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:03,579
this gentile, sinner, killer, slaver

508
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:07,333
fell to his knees

509
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:10,869
and begged for forgiveness.

510
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:15,341
If that is not

511
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:20,262
divine Providence of God...

512
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,549
Then, brother...

513
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,217
Hang me.

514
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:31,223
I believe father's lips
have not pursed at your ear,

515
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,525
nor his hands laid on your shoulders.

516
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,562
You appear nothing more
than a ravening wolf.

517
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:41,066
What you stand accused of,
spilling the blood of a Saint,

518
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,286
is a heinous, sinful crime

519
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,121
whose just punishment

520
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:49,908
must be of equal weight and measure.

521
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,997
Yes.

522
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,300
[Sighs]

523
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:03,088
And yet the spur line,

524
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,758
which proves essential to
the Saint's journey west

525
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,259
to the promised land,

526
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,062
has made twice the
progress under your tenure

527
00:39:10,096 --> 00:39:12,648
than it did under your predecessor.

528
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:16,101
You worked on the Gentile's road?

529
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,604
Under Thomas Durant, head of...

530
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:22,074
I know who he is.

531
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:25,177
What did you think of the man?

532
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,996
I hated him

533
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:32,367
with the fire of a thousand suns.

534
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:42,211
Perhaps Heavenly Father
has a use for you yet.

535
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:55,474
That man shot a child.

536
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,813
He'll know justice.

537
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:03,315
Our son was next.

538
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,653
Hey.

539
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,456
Hey.

540
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,959
I wouldn'tet that happen.

541
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,712
I thought you would have killed him.

542
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:33,510
I wasn't gonna shoot her, and you know it...

543
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:37,180
Same I knew you wasn't gonna shoot me.

544
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:39,065
Hmm.

545
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,017
I wished I had.

546
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:44,854
That ain't so, Bohannon.

547
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,157
Truth is, you even wish 
you were in here with me,

548
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:50,527
waitin' for someone like us to bust us out.

549
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,915
That's it, ain't it?

550
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,834
You miss it.

551
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:01,337
Nah.

552
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:03,506
I'll be glad to watch you hang.

553
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,709
I've been hung before.

554
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:10,079
Life sure is a mystery, ain't it, Bohannon?

555
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,655
[Door opens, closes]

556
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,075
Oh.

557
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:44,445
Any business with the Governor
will have to wait until morning.

558
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:48,449
- Tell me why you did it.
- Did what?

559
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,534
Jessup is dead.

560
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:56,507
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

561
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,714
I loved him.

562
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,304
You loved him?

563
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,443
Oh, I see.

564
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:17,979
Well, whatever it is you think I've done,

565
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,448
I can assure you, you are wrong.

566
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:23,034
Stop lying.
