paying you a visit soon.

157
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,334
Uh-huh.

158
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,359
You haven't said a word.

159
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,556
I don't know what to say.
I mean--

160
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,659
Well, I know what to say,
I just don't know how.

161
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,863
It must be all
very complicated then.

162
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,135
No, it's, uh,just all memorized.

[ Sam ]
I said it to my horse
and it sounded good.

165
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,312
I said it again to the trees
and it sounded better.

166
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,753
I said it to the moon
and it sounded perfect.

167
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,222
The moon
can't hear you, Sam.

168

but he never hears.

Well, I'm sure
gonna miss her.

00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,395
Is she goin' somewhere?

173
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,364
Oh, every woman goes
somewhere sooner or later.

174
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,426
You don't expect her to stay
around here and take care of us
all her life, do you?

175
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,973
I hadn't thought about it.
I hadn't planned
on her goin' anywhere.

176
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,908
Well, you better get used
to the idea, boy.

177
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,540
Your sister's ripe
and the pickers are here.

178

Of course, I don't s'pose
you know what I mean,
do you, boy?

179
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,787

You get back up
to the house, boy.

183
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,290
Mr. Anderson, there's
a rumor around here...

184
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,020
that you have the coldest water
this side of the Shenandoah.

185
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,291
That's right,Johnson.
The best
east of the Mississippi.

186
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,629
Six foot deep, 2O foot down.
Come on, help yourself.

Dismount, Sergeant.

188
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,708
I'm glad you're here,
Johnson.

189
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,337
I've been meanin' to have
a little talk with your people
about those cannon of yours.

190
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,575
My chickens
have stopped layin',

Who do I send the bill to?
You might try Abe Lincoln.
They're mostly his.

192
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,280
When are you gonna take
this war seriously,
Mr. Anderson?

193
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,328
Let me tell you somethin',
Johnson, before you get
on my wrong side.

194
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,957
My corn I take serious
because it's my corn.

195
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:26,629
And my potatoes, tomatoes
and fences I take note of
because they're mine.

196
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,901
But this war is not mine,
and I take no note of it.

197
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:37,649
Well, maybe you'll take notice
of it when the Yankees drop
a cannonball in your parlor.

198
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,946
I might as well tell you
right now that I can't think
of another thing...

199
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,989
I wanna hear you say.

200
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,462
You have six sons,
don't you, Mr. Anderson?

201
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,630
Does the size of my family
have some special interest
for you?

202
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,675
As a matter of fact
it does.

203
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,372
We need men.
Two of these men here
are no more than 1 6.

204
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,008
Seems strange to quite a few
people around here that none
of your sons are in the army.

205
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,350
It don't seem strange to me
with all the work there is
to do around here.

206
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,222
I'll come right to the point,

to get my boys, huh?
Yes, sir, I did.

to say to 'em, go ahead.

There's a Yankee army
breathing down your neck.

You're town bred,

I've got 5OO acres
of good, rich dirt here.

and the sun shines,

cleared every field; and
we've done it ourselves...

of one slave.
So?

226
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,939
So? So, can you give me
one good reason...

227
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,106
why I should send my family,
that took me a lifetime
to raise...

228
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:55,152

of damn fools to do

Virginia needs
all of her sons,

That might be so,Johnson,
but these are my sons!

They don't belong
to the state.

When they were babies,
I never saw the state comin'
around with a spare tit.

We never asked anything
of the state,
and never expected anything.

for the right.

so worried about it,
I'll tell ya.

Ann, we're leaving,
and James is staying
with you.

603
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,961
I don't know how
these people dare
take a son of mine.

604
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:17,199
When I catch up with 'em,
it's gonna be
a horrible thing to behold.

605
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:21,004
The boy means
a great deal to you,
doesn't he, Papa Charlie?

606
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:24,376
All my sons mean
a great deal to me.

607
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,143
But the boy--

608
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,185
My Martha died the night
he was born.

609
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,345
I look at him,
I see her.

610
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,518
I'll pray
for you all.

611
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,686
I'm afraid it's too late
to do any prayin' for me...

You and James
decided on a name?
Martha.

She'd like that.

616
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:58,847
My Martha'd like that
very much.

617

I haven't told you,

618
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:10,185
but we're all mighty proud
to have you in our family.

you're goin'?
- Wherever you go, Papa.

From what these preachers
tell me,

where I'm goin',
you wouldn't like it there.

You may be on your way,
but you aren't there yet, Papa.

Just never mind that.
You're not goin' with us.

628
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:14,480
So unstrap, unhook, get out
of your brother's clothes.
You're a woman!

629
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:19,823
Yes, I'm a woman. But I don't
see anybody here that I can't
outrun, outride and outshoot.

630
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,693
I'll unstrap for you,

632

I'll even sit here
and watch you ride
out of sight.

- And then what?
- Then I'll follow.

634

That's what I thought.

Don't worry about
the place here, Pa.
We'll manage.

You just keep that
little Martha warm and fat.

637

She'll probably turn out
to be the only one
around here with a brain.

638

Bye, son.
Good-bye, Pa.

You the leader
of this band of fools?

Colonel Fairchild
is my name.

641
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,628
Whether or not
I'm the leader of fools...

642
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,596
is a question which
has often entered my mind.

643
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,598
To whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking, sir?

644
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,870
Charlie Anderson's
my name.

645
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:12,907
You better decide later,
Colonel, whether speaking
with me is a pleasure or not.

646
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:16,342
Got business with me,
Mr. Anderson?
Yes, sir, I do.

647
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:20,643
All right, Mr. Nelson.
What can I do for you,
sir?

648
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,719
You can return my son
for a start.

649
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:27,380
And then you can issue
some kind of an order,
whatever it is you do,

650
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,722
and instruct your people
to keep off my farm
and leave my family alone.

651
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:34,591
Your son?
My youngest son.

652
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,996
Your people came on my farm,
and they took him.
Why?

653
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,402
That's what I'd like to know.
But he's a prisoner,
and your army's got him.

654
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:46,839
He isn't a Confederate?
No, sir.

655
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:49,536
He's an Anderson,
and that's all he is.

656
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:53,672
How old is he?
He's sixteen.

657
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:05,316
Could you show me on the map
where your farm is?

658
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:08,659
Well, it's
Shenandoah Gap.

659
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,859
It shows here.
Right there.

660
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:16,563
It couldn't have been any
of my men who took your son,
Mr. Anderson,

661
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:19,732
because we haven't been
in your section.

662
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,811
But I think you
should understand something.

663
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:27,611
My men fought a battle
with rebels
who threw stones at them...

664
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:29,877
'cause that was all
that they had.

665
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:32,112
We took 1 ,5OO prisoners...

666
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:36,123
and there wasn't 5O rounds
of ammunition among them.

What are you tellin' me,
Colonel?

668
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,892
Only that what
you're trying to do
is nearly impossible.

669
01:01:41,997 --> 01:01:46,127
Every corps in our army
is taking thousands
of prisoners each day.

We sent them to the railroad
for shipment north.

give this slip to the officer
in charge, it may help you.
What is it?

01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,237
It's just a statement from me
that your son
was taken by mistake.

And that it would be considered
a personal favor to me
if he is released to you.

you send your prisoners to,
