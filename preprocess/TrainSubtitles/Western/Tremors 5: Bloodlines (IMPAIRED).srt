1
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,941
BURT: My name is Burt Gummer.
And I've been called many things.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,016
Gun enthusiast, monster-hunter,
doomsday-prepper.

3
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,584
I reject all these labels.

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,984
What I am is a survivalist.

5
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,713
I've scoured the dirt and dust
of Nevada and Mexico,

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,983
putting my life on the line to hunt
super-size subterranean

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,485
man-eating predators called Graboids.

8
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:56,723
Using a combination of local knowledge,
intuition and firepower,

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,758
I've managed to control
this deadly species,

10
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,769
and keep them confined
to the Northern Hemisphere.

11
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,537
Join me.

12
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:06,507
As I enter into and beneath
the Sands of Hell.

13
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,671
1500 hours. Moving through
the desert of Perfection, Nevada.

14
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,717
Ground zero for war with the Graboids.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,013
For those of you newcomers,
who don't have a clue about Graboids,

16
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,754
let me bring you up to speed.

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,748
The Graboid is a vicious
subterranean predator,

18
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,022
about 30 feet in length
with a semi-rigid internal structure.

19
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,153
It senses its prey seismically,

20
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,057
and employs three powerful,
snake-like oral tentacles

21
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,602
to ensnare its prey,
and pull it into the Graboid's gullet.

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,638
It is not a pleasant venue.

23
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,400
Trust me. I've been there.

24
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,500
If that weren't enough,
Graboids give birth

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,671
to three ugly spawn we call Shriekers.

26
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,872
Short, squat, and blind bipedal bad boys

27
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,942
that sense and hunt their prey
using infrared sensors.

28
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,378
These, in turn,
give rise to the Ass Blaster,

29
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,113
a winged, predatory carnivore

30
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,989
which uses a mixture
of volatile chemicals in its...

31
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,051
(CLEARS THROAT) ...nether regions

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,859
to blast into the air
and swoop down upon its victims.

33
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,391
Ass Blasters carry eggs that hatch
and become new Graboids,

34
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,559
beginning this hellish cycle anew.

35
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,031
I have survived a great many
skirmishes with Graboids,

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,577
along with their Shrieker
and Ass Blaster kin.

37
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,970
And that makes me uniquely qualified

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,643
to teach you how to survive
whatever life throws at you.

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,381
And remember, life and survival

40
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,222
starts here.

41
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,193
(RATTLING)

42
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:32,986
Who's hungry?

43
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,775
- BASSON: What're you doing?
- (SHUSHING)

44
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,479
Shut your blow hole.

45
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,651
I'm tracking.

46
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,924
You feel that?

47
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,518
The only thing you're gonna feel
is my boot in your bum.

48
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,427
Yeah, good luck,
with that gimp leg of yours.

49
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,289
This place is gut boring.

50
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,959
Yeah. And I'm tired, and I'm starving.

51
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,935
And the only thing we've seen all day
is a pack of spotted hyena.

52
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,871
JOHAN: Yeah, it's just
the nature of things, boet.

53
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,732
Yeah, well, talking about nature,

54
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,709
I'm gonna drop the kids off at the pool.

55
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,948
Looking northwest, over the Highveld.

56
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,385
All those reports about exotic animals,
there's no wildlife here.

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,087
Well, speaking of wildlife, I wonder
if my wife's gonna come back to me.

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,484
If she's got brains, definitely not.

59
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,190
BASSON: You're a complete
and utter idiot.

60
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,798
I mean, I'm hurting here. I'm in pain.

61
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,536
And you mock me.

62
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,731
Basson. You hear that?

63
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,742
I didn't hear anything.
I'm in conference.

64
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,468
It's right here. Here, here, here, here.

65
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,070
(RUMBLING)

66
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,619
Whoa! Whoa!

Basson?

70
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,136
Dreyer!

71
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,104
That's a long drop.

72
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,102
Didn't you see this gigantic hole?

73
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,508
I think I broke my butt.

74
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,975
I'm gonna grab a rope.

75
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,404
(FLUTTERING)

76
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,676
Bro!

77
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,445
I'm coming, man, relax.

78
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,473
- Basson?
- Yeah?

79
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,574
I'm gonna throw this rope down.

80
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,576
You grab onto it,
I'm gonna pull you up, all right?

81
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,316
Hurry up. There's something down here.

82
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,016
Okay, grab the rope.

83
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,451
Get me out of here,
there's something down here.

84
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,552
Just get me out of here.

85
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,962
Yeah, probably my ex-wife, Teresa.

86
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,389
Pull!

87
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,162
Yeah, just help me out man, come on.

88
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,737
You need to lose some weight.

89
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,311
Get me out of here. I'm pissing myself.

Oh, yeah.

BURT: Everything tastes better outdoors.

101
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,976
However, if one wants to enjoy
a source of sustenance out here,

102
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,745
one has to seize the culinary initiative

103
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,348
when it rears its ugly head.

104
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,326
So, let's review.

105
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,953
It took me 50 minutes to build
this improvised clay oven.

106
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,523
Thirty-two minutes to
fire up the scrub wood,

107
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,391
heat the interior,

108
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,494
feed in that snake and seal the door.

109
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,631
Now we wait as this little baby

110
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,371
turns snake into snack.

111
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,485
Whoa!

00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,087

Ah!

00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,401
And voilá!

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,806
One sizzling, succulent
piece of pure protein.

Brand Cactus Juice Marinade

118
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,773
will eradicate any trace of that

Kind of wish your website could do
the same for you, but I can help.

I beg your pardon?

I'm a big fan. You know,
possibly your biggest.

do you know? Huh?

I know one. Burt Gummer.

Last check, how many Twitter
followers did you have, huh?

157
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,779
Zilch.

158
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,682
Your opinion is duly noted.

159
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,586
It's what I'm here for.
To help build out the Burt Gummer brand.

160
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,463
I'm thinking, "Paranoid loner
meets charming whack job."

161
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,101
I can fix you.

162
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,870
I don't need fixing.

163
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,932
Yo, what happened to your dome, my man?

164
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,897
You binge watch Breaking Bad, again?

165
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,770
You trying to appeal to a younger
demographic, get a little Pitbull on us?

166
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,637
What I choose to do with my cranium
is none of your business.

167
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,476
All right.

168
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,420
This is snake, right, not rat?

169
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,649
Whoa!

170
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,254
That is a win.
That's a yummer from The Gummer.

171
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,822
You know what, you look
like you could use a cold one.

172
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,957
I know I can. You want?

173
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,060
Hey, I think we're vibing right now,
right, Pop? You feel it?

174
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,935
It's good talk. Where's your beer?

175
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,631
Hey.

176
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,239
Hands off my gear.

177
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,438
Lighten up, Pops.

178
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,672
You from the government?

179
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,542
Nope. Florida.

180
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,908
Grew up on the Gulf Coast.

181
00:12:56,008 --> 00:13:00,112
Panama City, Trampa, Pensacola.

182
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,850
- Pensacola?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,550
They got a great gun show.

184
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,357
Yeah, right off the Interstate.

185
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,397
I was there in '74.

186
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,722
You got that look.

187
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,058
What look?

188
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,229
The "I did some dirty
things in Florida" look.

189
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,634
Hey, I get it. It was the '70s,
free love, you were young.

190
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,064
(HONKING)

191
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,307
What now?

192
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,750
Looks like the IRS finally
caught up with you.

193
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,888
Mr. Gummer. Mr. Gummer.

194
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
(CHUCKLES)

195
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:40,990
You are way off grid, sir,
you're a very difficult man to find.

196
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,389
Evidently, not difficult enough.

197
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,324
I am Erich Van Wyk.

198
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,600
I'm with the South
African Wildlife Ministry.

199
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,932
South Africa? You with the government?

200
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,842
What? No, no. I'm a big fan of yours.

201
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,036
Go on.

202
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,144
Well, we have a rather pressing
situation in Gauteng.

203
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,544
Gauteng. The Cradle of Humankind?

204
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,045
Yes, that's right.

205
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,187
We have a confirmed sighting of what
you would refer to as an Ass Blaster.

206
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,119
That's impossible.
The species are confined

207
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,620
to the Northern Hemisphere.

208
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,257
Oh, well, then, I suppose
it's some other flying carnivore

209
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,328
that shoots flame out of its rear end
that we have wreaking havoc in Africa?

210
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,073
Is this a confirmed sighting?

211
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,006
Oh, yes, sir. Although the witness
is no longer alive.

212
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,911
- When do we leave?
- Excellent.

213
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,422
Slow your roll, there, Gums. Okay.

214
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,756
You're quite the fetching bushman,
Mr. Van Dick.

215
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,218
It's Van Wyk.

216
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,721
Van Wyk, right, okay. Um...

217
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,558
Mr. Gummer really isn't
in the monster business, anymore.

218
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,536
I'm what?

219
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,667
Give us a minute, will you?

220
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,429
What the hell are you doin'?

221
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,664
I'm working this dude for some paper.

222
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,832
Paper?

223
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,535
Cash. Listen.

224
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,774
You don't take the first offer.
Let me close this deal.

225
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,506
Request denied. I work alone.

226
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,141
Come on, but you need
a videographer, okay?

227
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,377
You need to take
the long view on this, okay?

228
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,253
Think about it. The Gummer in Africa.

229
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,416
This is our chance to catch you
on tape really doing what you do,

230
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,655
and really giving it
to those Ass Blasters.

231
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,759
Okay, that came out weird,
but you know what I mean, right?

232
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,768
This is real world, son.
You're a newbie.

233
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,661
Newbie?

234
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,530
Okay, stop being Burt for a second,
and just listen.

235
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,901
I may have not spent most of my life
fighting giant, blind worms,

236
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,513
but I spent the last 10 years
of my life deep in the shit.

237
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,609
Pulling gigs for CNN
and Fox in the sandbox.

238
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,219
Yeah, Afghanistan, Syria.
You know those places?

239
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,446
Yeah.

240
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,518
And as for firearms,

241
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,199
I just added this baby to my collection.

242
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,029
HK 91.

243
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,302
- Where'd you get that?
- Uh-uh-uh!

244
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,529
You punch my ticket to South Africa,

245
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:09,140
and will I hand over this beautiful,
semi-automatic Mr. Shotty to you.

246
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,373
Deal.

247
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,779
Erich. May I call you Erich?

248
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,308
Of course.

249
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,743
We really appreciate your offer,

250
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,381
but Mr. Gummer's monster-hunting
schedule's all booked up.

251
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,453
Sorry.

252
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,960
Oh, uh... That's a pity.

253
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,397
Bigfoot in the Ozarks.

254
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,229
Possible gremlin in Fresno.

255
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,435
Family of werewolves
in Peru we heard about.

256
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,504
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

257
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,846
I don't suppose it
would make any difference

258
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,683
if I offered to fully fund

259
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,024
Mr. Gummer's videos
for the next two years?

260
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,820
Four.

261
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,122
Three.

262
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,059
What time does your plane leave?

263
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,896
How quickly can you roll your tents?

264
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,567
Rolled.

265
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,711
Burt Gummer. In Africa.

266
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,946
MR. BRAVERS:
Africa's not for sissies, yeah?

267
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,816
We eat what we kill here, boet.

268
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,844
You mind if I call you boet?

269
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,010
Boet?

270
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,612
Yeah. It means brother.

271
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,992
So, you're the monster-hunter?

272
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,684
- Yeah, somethin' like that.
- (MR. BRAVERS LAUGHS)

273
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,129
BURT: This doesn't look like
any Ass Blaster I've ever seen.

274
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,230
- Strange attraction.
- Come again?

275
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,669
A man who hunts a monster.
It's a strange attraction.

276
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,041
Mr. Bravers, are you drunk?

277
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,303
(GRUNTS)

278
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,004
Not yet.

279
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,441
Mr. Gummer?

280
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,277
We're heading for a safari lodge,
just south of the river.

281
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,022
The owner's been kind enough
to let us base our operations there.

282
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,654
Hey, where's my bug-out bag
and the weapons I brought from home?

283
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,918
About that.

284
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,821
We have very strict customs laws
here in South Africa.

285
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,629
I should have warned you about
the three-day weapons quarantine.

286
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,725
Three-day what?

287
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,094
Don't worry about it.
I've procured us some weapons.

288
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,229
They're waiting for us at the lodge.

289
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,973
There, there it is, there, there.

290
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,400
Nice digs, Van Dyke.

291
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,175
It's Van Wyk.

292
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,369
- Hey, boet.
- Yeah?

293
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,971
I got a story for you.

294
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,607
Every morning in Africa,
a gazelle wakes up.

295
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,453
And he knows he's gotta run
faster than the fastest lion,

296
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,922
otherwise...

297
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,092
He gets killed.

298
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,264
Every morning, a lion wakes up.

299
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,156
And he knows he's gotta outrun
the slowest gazelle,

300
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,135
otherwise he's gonna starve to death.

301
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:58,067
So, it doesn't matter if you are
a lion or you're a gazelle,

302
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,871
in Africa, when the sun rises,
you better be running.

303
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,403
(CHUCKLES)

304
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,576
Hey, if you need my help,
call me on the horn.

305
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,110
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

306
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,211
(SPITS)

307
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,283
(LAUGHS)

308
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,021
- Now, you go well, boet.
- Thank you.

309
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,361
Chop-chop, Pops.

310
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,163
Stop calling me "Pops."

311
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,598
Got you.

312
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,109
Old man.

313
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,346
And we're clear!

314
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,771
What? I don't understand.

315
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,873
This is a seismic vibration monitor.

316
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,910
It's uplinked to the South African
National Grid of Seismology

317
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,080
and can detect Graboid movement
within a 50 square-mile area.

318
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,318
Next level type stuff.

319
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,816
Graboid? Worms?

320
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,156
Exactly.

321
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,852
This is Johan Dreyer.

322
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:58,123
He's my local field representative
and a safari guide in the area.

323
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,591
He's the one who witnessed
the fatal attack.

324
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,792
That's right.

325
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,806
And this towering hunk of dark chocolate
is my assistant, Thaba.

326
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,934
That's quite a gun you got there.

327
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,300
Rifle.

328
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,243
Bet it makes you feel like
you got a lot of power.

329
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,139
I can drop a charging
rhino at 100 meters.

330
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,510
You wanna go for a run?

331
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,015
How's life in the Thunderdome?

332
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,011
Well, you wouldn't know
what a rhino looked like

333
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,556
if it shoved its horn
through your throat.

334
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:27,262
Graboids and Ass Blasters are immune
to any known form of tranquilizer,

335
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,959
rendering your weapon useless against
the creatures we're hunting.

336
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,102
Capturing. Capturing,
that's the plan, right?

337
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,403
You don't capture these things.
You kill them.

338
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,598
Kill them, capture them, I don't care.

339
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,440
But what we have in Africa, sir,
is not Graboids.

340
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,180
If you've got Ass Blasters,
you've got Graboids.

341
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,569
Odontotermes baadi.

342
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,503
Yes.

343
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,140
But on a massive scale.

344
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,508
It has the same magnesium mandibles.

345
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,149
That explains the presence of formic acid
in the bedrock surrounding it.

346
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,186
It spits out the acid to soften the rocks,
while the mandibles chew through it.

347
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,454
This is a super digger.

348
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,065
We're going to be on the cover
of Science magazine.

349
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,090
Been there, baby.

350
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,232
I want National Geographic.

351
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,369
Whoo!

352
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,626
Ugh!

VAN WYK: Mr. Gummer.
Mr. Gummer. Over here.

354
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,072
Can you say, "Ballin'"?

355
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,284
Hey, what's the Zulu word for "ballin'"?

Hello, Baruti.
Taking the kids for a walk, I see?

358
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,783
Well, you know that these young ladies

359
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,625
are too high-class for the likes of you,
so, I guess somebody has to do it.

00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,957
Just act natural.

362

These men are here investigating
the impundulu attack.

363

Oh, right, the monster-hunters, right?

364
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,268
Ish. I'm still in training,
but I got, like, a credit away.

What's this?

373
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,922
The weapons you asked for.

374
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,093
A BSA .303 and a .30-06?

375
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,063
Well, there's also a Colt Peacemaker.

376
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,198
And a...

377
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,142
Ooh! The double-barrel thingy.

We might as well use a spit straw.

you requested.

BURT: No, what I requested was confiscated
by your mindless government lackeys.

381
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,555
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

But we're not all bushies.

386
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,989
Was that racist?
That sounded a little racist.

387

Rocky, the flying squirrel?

That .30-06 will drop
anything on this continent.

Anything.

No, I'll see you over there.

01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,353
Something's triggered these attacks.

975
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,022
Animals always go for the food source.

976
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,466
No, I don't think it's that.
There are other reserves here.

977
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,227
- So, they're targeting us.
- Yes.

978
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,462
Make sure all of our weapons
are loaded and the truck is ready.

979
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:54,597
We're going to the village.

980
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,438
- Safety in numbers.
- Yeah.

981
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,470
Those eggs have got themselves
the full protection package.

982
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:02,810
So, we punt?

983
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,051
Not so fast.

984
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,981
Our protection package has just arrived!

985
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,523

This is a bag of dicks.

01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,536
We're outta ammo
and we have to blow that cave.

01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,439
Come on, Gums. Don't lose faith.

1009
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:26,110
We are definitely F'ed up
beyond all recognition.

But we are not out of ammo.

damn pop gun, that's it.

The bag is full, and it's ready to blow.

Think outside the box.

- Oh, my God. You're right.
- Yeah.

1015
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,896
That'll scramble a few eggs.

1016
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:51,534
Oh, no. That'll make a big
frickin' omelet, is what that'll make.

Now, how do we get to the chopper
without gettin' eaten alive?

1018
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,939
There's a herd of cattle out there.

1019
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,042
If we run with them, we can get lost
in their seismic signatures.

1020
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,884
What? That's your
brilliant idea, to run?

you better be running."

01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,360
You better step on it.

1024
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:14,791
Consider it stepped on.

1025
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,513
Not too far, now.

- Scramble.
- My bad.

1034

Hello. These MiG pods hold 16 rockets each.
Looks like he loaded 10.

This is gonna ring their bells.

1036
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,787
It's a bit of overkill, don't you think?

If you're gonna give 'em the horn,
give 'em the horn.

Back to where?

01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,484
Back before I met your sorry ass.

1045

Spat you out?

of her belly a little bit.

about me and Florida.

1106
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,276
I know that you went
to a Grateful Dead concert once

1107

when you were there.

1108

How could you possibly know that?
That was 40 years ago.

Pretty sure I know who you went with.

What do you know about Jasmine?

Flower child meets heroin chic. Model.

Hated disco. Loved Hendrix.

1113
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:11,379
You were selling your dad's old guns.
She was in the parking lot.

1114
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,875
Burning her bra.

1115
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,886
Far left meets far right.

1116
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,018
They spend the night.

1117
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,056
Love's a bitch, huh, Burt?

1118
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:24,759
Who is she to you?

1119
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,695
I call her "Mom" most of the time.

1120
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,227
Boom!

1121
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,273
Well, that's gotta stir up
some shit, right? Huh?

1122
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,165
You mean, you and me are...

1123
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,677
That's right. Bloodlines.

1124
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:41,742
Feel the theme happenin', here?

1125
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,606
- No.
- Yes.

1126
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,109
No. Impossible.

1127
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,844
You're tellin' me.

1128
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,652
I don't believe it.
There's no way you're my offspring.

1129
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,117
What? Well, that's a dick thing to say?

1130
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,321
What, do you think
you're better than me?

1131
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:00,598
I just don't... I mean... Crud.
Look at you!

1132
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:02,924
Yeah, look at me.

1133
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,960
How could I be the son of Burt Gummer?

1134
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,698
A man of such towering importance.

1135
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,765
You know what? Forget it.

1136
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,000
We don't have to do
this whole Dr. Phil thing, okay?

1137
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,302
Let's just survive this
African worm invasion,

1138
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,643
and we'll go back to never speaking
to each other again. Cool?

- (CHITTERING)
- Son of a bitch!

1140
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:21,749
Let's get outta here.

1141
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:24,847
Let's boogie.

1142
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:32,321
Damn it!

BURT: Grabber's got us hooked!

1144
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,370
You've got a gun. Use it.

1145
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:41,863
Yeah, dawg!

1146
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,307
I want a paternity test.

1147
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:57,679
NANDI: What's this?

1148
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:58,951
I found it.

1149
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:01,983
- Amahle.
- What's going on?

1150
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,790
I think I know why we're under attack.

1151
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,166
Where would they go?

1152
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,643
The village.

1153
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:22,637
Safety in numbers.

1154
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,045
Let's go.

1155
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,600
Stay in the car, baby, okay?

Come on. Come on! Let's go!

Amahle? Amahle?

1162
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:35,637
Amahle?

1163
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,805
Amahle.

- Amahle!

Off the ground and on the truck!

1173
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,117
- No, she's my child. No!
- Let's go.

1174
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,889
- NANDI: It's gonna be okay, honey.
- BARUTI: It's okay. Wait right there.

Go, go, go!

- NANDI: It's gonna be okay, honey.
- Hold on!

1177
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:34,562
Let me get a shot on it.

1178
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,431
No, no, no. We can't
risk hitting the girl.

1179
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,099
What does she have in that basket?

1180
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,701
I think she's got an Inkanyamba egg.

1181
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,937
- That egg is the last of the bloodline.
- NANDI: Why do you say that?

1182
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,305
Because we blew up their nest.

1183
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,942
Look, we have a hostage situation.

1184
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,779
They're not gonna touch her
as long as she has the egg.

- TRAVIS: What's the worm count?
- One.

1186
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:55,027
And the queen bitch
is comin' for that egg.

1187
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,362
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1188
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,256
- BURT: You see what I see?
- TRAVIS: Yeah.

1189
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:04,292
Okay. One of us is gonna be bait
and one of us has gotta snatch the kid.

1190
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:06,394
- Who's it gonna be?
- I'll get her.

1191
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:12,270
- BURT: Hold on, baby.
- TRAVIS: Let's go.

1192
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:33,989
Stand still!

01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:58,755
Travis, here. Throw it!

1195
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,924
- It's okay. It's okay.
- BURT: You got her, you got her.

1196
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,242
Behind you!

1197
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,528
- I think I have an idea.
- Shoot.

1198
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:39,521
Amahle always uses her earthworm
zapper to catch worms.

1199
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,523
We can build one on a much larger scale.

1200
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:44,263
We have the worm.
What do you suggest we use for the zap?

1201
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:46,596
The lightning.

1202
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,309
We can use the pile rods from the drill rig
and wire them together.

1203
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,536
You can set your watch
to the lightning, right?

1204
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:56,571
Yes, and right now we've got 13 minutes.

1205
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:58,480
Let's hope the bride
doesn't get cold feet.

1206
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:01,843
What's goin' on?

1207
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,945
- Can you keep her busy?
- I can try.

1208
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:06,214
BURT: If we're lucky,
she'll follow your seismic signature.

1209
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,516
Send them to the river
and bring them back on my signal.

1210
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,562
- Your signal?
- I'll send up a flare.

1211
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,207
Give me some slack.

1212
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,388

Come on. They're headed our way.

Goodness, okay.

1216
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,209
Go, go, go, go!

1217
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,322
BURT: Come on, wherever you are.

1218
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:14,820

Here.

Ooh. Yeah, no, I know this is Africa,

1231
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,296
but I'm not gonna eat
what I just killed.

1232
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:17,298
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1233
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:20,174
Well, Travis, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

1234
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,082
You're a good man. Deep down there.

What, it's not on the surface?

It rarely ever is.
You've gotta dig deep.

1237
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:33,714
See ya.

1238

on the Burt train?

the long view, build the Gummer brand.

BURT: My name is Burt Gummer,

1259
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:51,492
Gun enthusiast, monster-hunter,
doomsday-prepper.

1260
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,421
I reject all these labels.

1261
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,967
What I am is a survivalist.

TRAVIS: And I'm Travis B. Welker.

1263

photographer, an adrenaline junkie,

01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,864
and hitting on hot 22-year-olds.

I'm guilty on all accounts.

and I live by them.

on the bizarre, the deadly, the weird.

1268
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:14,878
TRAVIS: It's a dirty job.

But dirty guys are sexy.

1270

BURT: We've cracked the code of survival.

1271
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:24,622
We are the cure that ails anything
crittery, creepy or crawly.

1272
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:29,123
TRAVIS: We are the knockout punch
to the shadowy world of monsters.

BURT: Go, go, go!

you unleashed in there.

for anything that goes

bang in the night
or fluff under your floor...

- It's over here!
- Watch your back!

and life starts here.
