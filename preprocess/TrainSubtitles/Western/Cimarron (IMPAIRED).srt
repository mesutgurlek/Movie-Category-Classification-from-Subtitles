This is my wife, Sabra.

315
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:28,447
Your what?

316
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,887
Well, ma'am, I'm pleased to meet you.

317
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,290
Mavis, come look
who's hooked himself a wife.

318
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:35,953
Oh, you poor girl.

319
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,031
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.

320
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,998
Just don't pay no attention
to her, because...

321
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:43,934
This is Jessie Rickey.

322
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,767
- How do you do?
- You know what he is?

323
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:49,843
He's one of the best printers in the
business, when he's sober he is, that is.

324
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,242
Well, you know the last time he smiled,
it caused an earthquake.

325
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:56,475
- You done pretty good in that fight.
- How do you mean, pretty good?

326
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:59,950
He almost got himself killed,
risking his life for an Indian.

327
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:06,417
Sorry.

328
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:11,123
Suppose we, uh, give this fellow a hand
here and get this wagon turned up.

329
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,233
Sir, do you mind if we help you?

330
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,062
Why don't you get on that side here.

331
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,932
- Sam Pegler.
- Yancey Cravat.

332
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:18,470
- Sol Levy.
- My wife.

333
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,302
Tom, suppose you go down to that end.
Now, watch it when-

334
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,273
- Tom Wyatt.
- Jessie Rickey.

335
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:25,640
MAVIS:
Sam, take good care of it.

336
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,441
SAM:
Yeah, I'll watch it.

337
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,944
YANCEY:
That's my wife.

338

340
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,837
- Why do they call you Cimarron?
- It's a long story.

341
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,636
He's mean and wild and crazy.
That's what the word means.

342
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,370
Come on, you wanna make her think
she married a wildcat?

343
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,014
She didn't marry a scat rabbit.

344
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:02,241
Do you know what you married?
A lunatic.

345
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,044
- He don't know what he wants.
- I do.

346
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:06,244
- Do you now? Now, do you?
- Of course I do.

00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,150
How many things you been already?

348
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:11,156
A gambler, a gunman, a lawyer.

349
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,521
Now you wanna be a farmer. Bah.

350
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,095
No. I don't wanna be
a farmer, I wanna be a rancher.

351
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,391
- I give you just two months.
- That's different.

352
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,762
You'll be pulling
your hair out with both hands.

353
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,632
No. No, not this time.

354
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,404
This is the first time in my life
I've seen a piece of land and I said:

355
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,339
"This is what I want. "

356
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,877
More than anything, this is what I want.

357
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,481
You know how long
I've been dreaming about that land?

358
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:35,877
You know how long?

359
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,611
Ever since I used to ride herds
through this country.

360
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,780
I used to lean down, pick up
a big handful of that earth and smell it.

361
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,983
It was so rich.

362
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,184
You know how you do?

363
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,488
It smelled so rich you felt like you just...

364
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:52,326
You just throw out a handful of seeds
and a whole crop of corn would sprout up.

365
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,161
Ten feet high.

366
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:55,934
That's what I wanna do.

367
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,562
I wanna grow my own food
and raise my own cattle.

368
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,765
Now, just a minute.

369
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:04,105
There's only one thing wrong
with that little dream of yours.

370
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,077
Corn just don't pop up 10 feet tall.

371
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:12,744
No, it's gotta have plowing and planting
and weeding and watering.

372
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,412
- And then along comes a drought. Ruined.
- Shh.

373
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,717
- All right.
- And as for that fictional cattle-

374
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:20,520
All right. All right. Ha-ha-ha.

375
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:22,925
Say, you really are something,
young fellow.

376
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,396
Come on, little lady.
We've got a rough day ahead.

377
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,626
I'll get out the bedroll here.

378
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,729
Good night. Good night.

379
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:35,103
Oh, ma'am, I don't want you to think
we meant nothing by what we were saying.

380
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,905
- We were just joshing him.
- Oh, I know.

381
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,606
Oh, there is just one thing, though.

382
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:44,616
You see, we kind of raised that lunatic.

383
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:46,549
He's kind of like a son.

384
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,713
Well, we never had any
children of our own.

385
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,327
And I was just thinking,
you being his wife and all...

386
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:56,521
...maybe you could talk him
into trying the newspaper business.

387
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,359
It isn't so much for ourselves.

388
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,024
Well, now, wait a minute, Mother.
That enters into it.

389
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,669
You see, a man hates to work...

390
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:06,364
...and have everything
that he stood for just disappear.

391
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,476
- Well, it's just that-
- Kind of like to pass it on to somebody.

392
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:12,909
Yeah. You see, we need
somebody to leave things to.

393
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,412
- Sam.
- And-

Listen, how many times...?
You never give up, do you?

395
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,448
I told you
I don't like the newspaper business.

396
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:22,613
I just don't like this business
of being a crusader all the time.

397
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,352
- It's an embarrassing thing, you know.
- Who's a crusader? I'm not a crusader.

398
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:29,326
You are, Sam, you are a crusader.

Just look out there,
look at all those people.

every one of them have some sort of dream.

some sort of a dream of some kind?

There they are out there.

or anything, anyplace.

and give those ranchers three days.

take advantage of a situation like this.

And in one day, this man loses everything
he spent all his life building up.

In just one day.

what happened to him, Sabra?

In four months,
he was shot for being a cattle rustler.

- Yes, all right.

Yes, and that the things
that are happening out there now are just...

most of my problems at all, really.

I don't think. Did it?

You don't expect me
to keep quiet about this, do you?

01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:28,414
You can do what you want, Yancey...

1084

...but I gotta tell you,
all you'll do is make enemies for yourself.

1085

If you love the Indians so much, you ought
to make your living from the Indians.

You start printing nonsense about this
and I'll pull out all my advertisements.

"President Cleveland proclaimed the opening
of the Cherokee Strip, September the 16th. "

1098
01:31:37,655 --> 01:31:39,782
- The Cherokee what?
- Six million acres of land.

1099
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:43,724
That makes that old puny run we were on
just look like a Sunday school picnic.

- Please don't say no, yet.
- No.

1104
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:51,427
I don't want to hear it.

Usually, we have a chance-

- We can discuss it, darling.
- I'm not interested.

Let's go.

1110
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:02,741
And leave everything?

1111
01:32:02,914 --> 01:32:05,542
Just when we were beginning
to get a little established?

1112
01:32:05,717 --> 01:32:06,741
For what reason?

1113
01:32:06,918 --> 01:32:09,978
To start all over again with the dust
and the mud and the shooting?

1114
01:32:10,155 --> 01:32:12,646
We've got a child now
to be responsible for.

1115
01:32:12,824 --> 01:32:15,224
I'll tell you what we'll do, then.
All right, fine.

1116
01:32:15,393 --> 01:32:17,361
We'll go
and we'll sort of take a vacation.

1117
01:32:17,529 --> 01:32:20,225
- What kind of a vacation?
- We'll just go and look at it.

1118
01:32:20,398 --> 01:32:24,095
This is the most important thing that's
happened in the history of the world.

1119

- You won't even go and look at it?
- I don't want to go.

1120

Who's going to take care of Cim
and run the newspaper?

1121
01:32:29,774 --> 01:32:32,971
All right.
All right, we'll take Cim with us.

1122
01:32:33,144 --> 01:32:35,476
- And Jessie, he'll run the newspaper.
- I don't-

1123
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:38,172
- He's done it before.
- I don't even want to discuss it.

- It's a lovely bearskin.
- What am I supposed to do with that?

Now, don't be rude.
You know better than that.

01:36:16,868 --> 01:36:19,098
It's not the gift,
it's the thought that counts.

01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:22,762
Now, be careful with the letter.
There must be a letter somewhere.

1183

I don't see any letter.

He's away on business, as you know.

It's difficult to foresee the complications
when you're away on big business.

There's love and there's love.

01:38:47,618 --> 01:38:52,749
But Yancey,
if you'll excuse the expression...

1223

01:39:04,302 --> 01:39:05,394
Oh...

Well, listen, women...

It all comes out in the wash.

1233

How can a woman walk like that?

1234
01:39:38,536 --> 01:39:40,060
You'd think she'd be embarrassed.

You go and do your work, just for once,
or I'll have to talk to your father about it.

Oh.

01:59:31,161 --> 01:59:32,355
- Hello.
- But-

1545
01:59:32,529 --> 01:59:35,521
- I'm Theresa Grayfox.
- I'm Sally Crowfoot.

1546
01:59:35,698 --> 01:59:38,667
- But she-
- Arita showed us what to do.

1547
01:59:38,835 --> 01:59:41,030
I hope we've got everything
the way you like it.

You take my coat away. Oh.

01:59:50,713 --> 01:59:52,044
Oh, Sarah.

1552
01:59:52,215 --> 01:59:54,206
- Looks like we're too early.
- No, it's fine.

1553
01:59:54,384 --> 01:59:56,944
It's just that everybody else
is a little late.

1554
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,179
You just walk right in.

Hyah.

- Yancey?
- What?

1558

It's almost 3 in the morning.

1559
02:00:29,986 --> 02:00:31,510
What?

1560
02:00:32,755 --> 02:00:34,382
Did you wake me up to tell me that?

1561
02:00:34,557 --> 02:00:37,025
I want to go out and get Cim.
He hasn't come home yet.

Oh, honey, leave the boy alone.

- It's 3 in the morning, fine.

1564

He's not a baby.

1565
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:46,359
But I don't want him out there
with those Indians all the time.

1566
02:00:46,536 --> 02:00:48,800
I'm worried to death
what's happening to that boy.

1567
02:00:48,972 --> 02:00:51,440
He has got no drive, no ambition at all.

And that girl, that Ruby.
I really think they're getting serious.

Well, they are, well, that's just fine.
It shows he's got good taste.

We have got one son.

That's all we've got in this world...

...and I see him drifting away from us
day by day.

And it's my fault, both of us.

Please, we've got
to do something about that boy.

Please, before it's too late.

- Please.
- All right. All right.

1579

You're really worried about him,
aren't you?

1580
02:01:24,407 --> 02:01:27,774
You promised that you'd make up
for all the things you never did for him.

Well, now is the time.

Please, Yancey.

to get him out of this town...

...into a different kind
of environment entirely.

I know we'll never be rich like everybody
else, but if we find money enough to-

Oh, my.

1589
02:01:59,008 --> 02:02:00,908
This could be the answer to everything.

1590
02:02:01,077 --> 02:02:05,707
Do you know what it could mean
for the boy to be the son of a governor?

1591
02:02:05,882 --> 02:02:08,715
It says they just want me
to come up and talk about it.

1592
02:02:08,885 --> 02:02:11,046
- But-
- It doesn't say that I've got it yet.

1593
02:02:11,221 --> 02:02:13,917
So you mean there's a chance
you might not get it?

Oh, you women.

1595

If you didn't have anything to worry about,
you'd worry about that.

Oh, but-

02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:26,491
It's something new.

1598
02:02:28,238 --> 02:02:29,500
And I'm so nervous.

1599
02:02:29,672 --> 02:02:31,401
Why? What have you got to be nervous?

1600
02:02:31,574 --> 02:02:32,768
How about that? Look here.

1601
02:02:32,942 --> 02:02:36,105
Oh, I guess I don't know
how to act among civilized people anymore.

1602

Look at that.

- We are invited to a party tonight.
- Fine, that's fine.

Not a party, the party.

- Anything else, sir?
- Hmm?

No, uh, thank you very much, son.

1610

Thank you, sir, and happy New Year.

1611
02:03:02,872 --> 02:03:04,737
- Happy New Year to you too.
- Same to you.

- Hmm? Yes, it is.

on the committee that recommends me.

I'm not sure, exactly.

1620
02:03:30,633 --> 02:03:32,498
What's he want to see you for
right now?

1621
02:03:32,669 --> 02:03:35,536
Well, it beats me.
Oh, my goodness, what next here?

1622
02:03:36,739 --> 02:03:38,263
Do you think something's wrong?

1623
02:03:38,441 --> 02:03:41,433
I don't know if there's anything wrong.
I tell you what I can do.

1624
02:03:41,611 --> 02:03:44,671
I can take a run upstairs
and find out what it's all about.

1625
02:03:44,847 --> 02:03:45,905
All right.

1626
02:03:46,082 --> 02:03:50,917

your nice, pretty party dress for tonight.

I don't know
how you've managed to do it.

1634
02:04:11,974 --> 02:04:13,965
You don't expect me to be noble
and deny it?

1635
02:04:14,143 --> 02:04:16,907
No, now, I want to tell you
something, though.

1636
02:04:17,313 --> 02:04:22,478
Tonight, being as it's New Year's Eve,
I'm gonna make a very special resolution.

1637
02:04:23,219 --> 02:04:25,119
You know what it is?

1638
02:04:25,555 --> 02:04:28,683
It's a resolution that I'm gonna try
to make it up to you.

1639
02:04:29,125 --> 02:04:31,025
I'm gonna try.

1640
02:04:36,099 --> 02:04:37,760
Say, honey, I need a shave. Yeah.

1641
02:04:37,934 --> 02:04:40,425
- Would you promise me?
- Maybe I don't need a shave.

1642
02:04:40,603 --> 02:04:42,696
- Yancey, would you really promise me?
- Yeah.

1643
02:04:42,872 --> 02:04:44,601
I know what you're gonna say.

1644
02:04:44,774 --> 02:04:51,145
All right, I promise that tonight I'll, uh,
try to behave like a perfect gentleman.

1645
02:04:51,314 --> 02:04:52,872
I'll try.

1646
02:04:53,049 --> 02:04:55,381
- You go ahead. You look fine.
- I wouldn't say that.

1647
02:04:55,551 --> 02:04:57,917
But you can't go with the cigar.
Give it to me.

1648
02:04:59,021 --> 02:05:01,615
- All right.
- Don't be too long.

1649

I won't.

- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What? What?

02:05:07,764 --> 02:05:09,288
- No, wait.
- Honey, that's nothing.

Darling, I can't see. Turn around.

- Honey, that's okay, all right?
- That's it.

All right, okay.

- Mr. Greer.
- How are you?

- And Mr. Hodges.
- How do you do, sir?

or a great American.

Here we have both,
right in the same person.

Yes, sir, and a great war hero to boot.

It sure is getting deep in here.

Hi, Yancey boy. How was the trip?

1670
02:06:17,567 --> 02:06:20,832
Well, now,
I didn't expect to see you here.

1671
02:06:21,003 --> 02:06:25,269
Well, that's the funny thing about this city,
always expect the unexpected.

1672
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:27,602
Yeah. So I see.

1673
02:06:27,977 --> 02:06:30,537
Everything all right? Your room all right?

1674
02:06:30,713 --> 02:06:33,739
Oh, yes, it's fine. Just fine.

1675

All right, sit down.
Why don't you make yourself at home?

1676
02:06:36,752 --> 02:06:38,242
All right.

1677
02:06:44,126 --> 02:06:47,926
Well, now, this looks like we're getting
ready for an all-night poker session.

1678
02:06:48,097 --> 02:06:49,257
What are the stakes?

1679

I just wanted you
to meet some of my friends.

Some of the boys you'll be bumping into,
once you're the governor.

1681

Gentlemen, it's like the fellow says:

"What's good for oil
is good for Oklahoma.

1683

What's good for Oklahoma
is good for the country.

1684

What's good for the country,
well, it's good for the whole wide world. "

without bringing tears to your eyes.

or see here in Washington, Mr. Cravat?

1688

I'd be more than happy to have my office
take care of the whole thing.

Let me fill up your drink, governor.

02:07:30,006 --> 02:07:32,668
It's just a little matter of signing
your name.

1692

- Yes, sir.

- If you say so, Tom.
- Right.

The thing is, Yancey...

1695

right now.

- Yeah.

My, would you look at that.
Two of them, huh?

1699
02:07:56,866 --> 02:07:59,858
You know something, when I see
the way you've sprouted up, Tom...

1700
02:08:00,036 --> 02:08:04,564
...you know, the way, all this-
My goodness, it's really something.

1701
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:05,764
Yes, sir.

And I ain't forgotten my old friends,
neither.

1703

You sure squeeze a man
into laying it on the line, don't you?

1706

I wouldn't say that, I mean I just want to
sort of try it out and see what happens.

Well...

Let me put it this way, Yancey.

1709
02:08:31,701 --> 02:08:35,398
Ain't nobody gonna ask a man
to do anything out-and-out dishonest.

Why, of course not.

But at the same time,
a little cooperation-

1712
02:08:39,976 --> 02:08:43,207
No cooperation,
and no governor, is that it?

1713
02:08:44,046 --> 02:08:46,708
I guess that's about it.

1721
02:09:23,419 --> 02:09:25,410
I just can't get over it.

I was so afraid you'd disappoint me.

I didn't even want to think about it,
your getting made governor...

on something, I'd only get disappointed.

But this time,
this time when I really didn't think of it...

Oh, Yancey,
I want you to know how grateful I am...

Sabra, there's something
I've got to talk to you about.

02:10:27,383 --> 02:10:30,614
I can't do it, Sabra. I can't, I'm sorry.

but I just can't go through with it.

02:18:17,019 --> 02:18:20,045
The thing is, Sabra-
You know I'm building a university?

1843
02:18:20,222 --> 02:18:24,283
With all the children I got, it's cheaper to
build one than to send them all to college.

1844
02:18:24,459 --> 02:18:29,158
Well, anyhow, I hired Mr. Krubechoff here
to put me up some kind of a statue...

1845
02:18:29,331 --> 02:18:31,799
...something that'll stand
for the Oklahoma pioneer.

1846
02:18:31,967 --> 02:18:33,696
- That's wonderful.
- We got to talking.

1847
02:18:33,869 --> 02:18:35,700
We all decided, the whole committee...

1848
02:18:35,871 --> 02:18:38,806
...that nobody stood
for the spirit of the pioneer like you did.

1849
02:18:39,408 --> 02:18:42,605
So that's how come we wanted
Mr. Krubechoff to talk to you and all...

1850
02:18:42,778 --> 02:18:46,270
...and we thought
maybe you'd pose and everything for him.

1851
02:18:46,448 --> 02:18:48,882
- Am I right, Sol?
- Yeah, yeah, yes, you know.

1852
02:18:49,051 --> 02:18:52,111
Something nice, like you and the little boy
in a covered wagon.

1853
02:18:52,287 --> 02:18:54,619
Something nice, very simple.

1854
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:56,587
But you're out of your minds.

1855
02:18:56,758 --> 02:19:00,751
I haven't decided yet
what should be the best to represent-

1856
02:19:00,929 --> 02:19:02,396
Whatever it is, the spirit...

1857
02:19:02,564 --> 02:19:06,398
...but I would appreciate,
maybe you'd talk to me.

1858
02:19:06,568 --> 02:19:07,967
Talk.

1859
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:12,101
I'm afraid they have given you
the wrong idea.

1860
02:19:12,274 --> 02:19:15,801
I was just sitting here thinking,
as a matter of fact, you know...

1861
02:19:15,978 --> 02:19:18,947
...nothing really has turned out
the way I thought it would.

1862
02:19:19,114 --> 02:19:21,344
My son and- Look at this.

1863
02:19:21,516 --> 02:19:23,347
That's my son.

1864
02:19:23,518 --> 02:19:27,079
My son, he had to run away to get married,
to do what he wanted to do.

1865
02:19:27,256 --> 02:19:29,349
They won't live
in the same state with me.

1866
02:19:29,524 --> 02:19:32,152
He won't even write me a letter
once in a while.

1867
02:19:33,095 --> 02:19:35,290
And my husband. This is my husband.

1868
02:19:35,998 --> 02:19:38,125
He had to run away too.

1869
02:19:38,634 --> 02:19:40,693
I haven't heard from him
in about 10 years.

1870
02:19:40,869 --> 02:19:42,860
- The newspaper, nothing, noth-?
- The news-

1871
02:19:43,038 --> 02:19:44,699
What's the newspaper? The newspaper.

1872
02:19:44,873 --> 02:19:48,274
Oh, my dear.
I've made it bigger, louder, more profitable.

1873
02:19:48,443 --> 02:19:51,105
Yes, I have made it more profitable.

1874
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:54,408
But it hasn't got the spirit it had
when my husband was here.

1875
02:19:54,583 --> 02:19:57,814
But, Sabra, please,
I mean, this whole thing-

1876
02:19:57,986 --> 02:20:02,446
And that's what you want to symbolize,
the spirit of the pioneer, with me?

1877
02:20:02,624 --> 02:20:03,818
Oh, Tom.

1878
02:20:03,992 --> 02:20:05,550
This is very sweet of you, Tom.

1879
02:20:05,727 --> 02:20:07,024
What Sabra means is-

1880
02:20:07,195 --> 02:20:09,459
I think he knows what I mean.
Don't you?

1881
02:20:09,631 --> 02:20:12,395
- Let's all go and have a cup of coffee.
- I have no time.

1882
02:20:12,567 --> 02:20:14,967
- I'm sorry, I have to-
- Have you got the editorial?

1883
02:20:15,137 --> 02:20:17,367
No, I haven't got the editorial, but-

1884
02:20:17,539 --> 02:20:20,667
I'm trying to squeeze out
something at least.

1885
02:20:20,842 --> 02:20:23,538
- Please forgive me-
- Look, this will take five minutes.

1886
02:20:23,712 --> 02:20:25,179
The newspaper will not run away.

1887
02:20:25,347 --> 02:20:27,542
- You will have a cup of coffee.
- That's enough.

1888
02:20:27,716 --> 02:20:29,081
You might as well go ahead.

1889
02:20:29,251 --> 02:20:31,344
- They've waited this long.
- What's happening?

1890
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,579
- Coffee will make us all think.
- Off you go.

1891
02:20:33,755 --> 02:20:36,485
- You are out of your mind, all of you.
- Come on.

1892
02:20:36,658 --> 02:20:37,784
What's come over you?

1893
02:20:38,193 --> 02:20:41,185
You know what I ought to run tomorrow,
in place of the editorial?

1894
02:20:41,363 --> 02:20:43,388
I was just thinking about it before.

1895

We just go down for a cup of coffee.

1896
02:20:46,201 --> 02:20:48,328
One little woman told me once-

1897
02:20:48,503 --> 02:20:50,300
You remember her, Sol, Jessie?

1898
02:20:50,472 --> 02:20:53,669
Her name was Mrs. Pegler
and she told me-

1899
02:20:53,842 --> 02:20:57,005
It was on the day when her husband
got killed in the land rush.

1900
02:20:57,179 --> 02:20:59,704
" It's not worth it," she told me.

1901
02:20:59,881 --> 02:21:01,280
"I'm a woman," she said.

1902
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:03,748
"Where are my children?

1903
02:21:04,052 --> 02:21:06,714
I'm a woman," she said.
"Where is my man? "

1904
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:10,781
"It's not worth it," she said.

1905
02:21:11,593 --> 02:21:14,289
And I'm beginning to think
that she was...
