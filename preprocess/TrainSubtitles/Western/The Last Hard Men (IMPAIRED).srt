641

We just get the girl
and leave the reservation.

642
00:59:11,117 --> 00:59:13,376
Ahem. I don't think you understand.

643
00:59:13,828 --> 00:59:15,422
That girl is his daughter.

644
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,674

We ain't about to change their minds.

I'm a sworn officer of the law.

647
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:32,872
As a sworn officer of the law,
I got no authority...

648
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:36,738
to go on the reservation
and hunt down Provo. My hands are tied.

649
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:40,255
Now, it gravels on me, captain...

650
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:42,946
I can't help you out,
but that's the way it goes.

651
00:59:43,066 --> 00:59:44,801
I'll ask you to come back with us.

652
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:48,584
Well, like you say,
you got no authority on this land.

653
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,141
You go on back if you have to.

654
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:53,084
I'll go where I have to.

655
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:55,353
I know where you're going,
six feet under.

656
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:58,356
That's where you're going.
They got seven guns to your one.

657
00:59:58,456 --> 01:00:01,308
Everybody's gotta die,
nobody's gotta give up.

658
01:00:01,918 --> 01:00:04,011
Look at you.
You can't even get on a horse.

659
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:07,032
You ain't been out three days,
you can't even ride.

That is, by God, enough!

If I don't keep after him,
he's got no more use for Susan.

662
01:00:13,805 --> 01:00:15,613
He'll turn his dogs loose on her.

663
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,460
He don't care nothing for her,
he wants me.

664
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,963
If I can't do nothing else,
I can offer him some kind of a trade.

665
01:00:22,063 --> 01:00:23,923
Now mount up!

666
01:00:24,023 --> 01:00:26,760
I'll ride with you
till we get out of sight.

667
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,285
Then I'll cut north
and pick up his trail.

668
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:43,026
I'm coming with you.

669
01:00:43,126 --> 01:00:45,111
Be damned if you are.

670
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:47,802
I wasn't asking your permission.

671
01:01:17,118 --> 01:01:20,587
We best step down, let the horses blow.

672
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:23,650
The deeper we get
into this reservation...

673
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,151
the rougher it gets.

674
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:27,593
It's nothing like Massachusetts.

01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:33,854
Yes, sir.

- What kind of work do you do?
- Hydroponics.

678
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:40,778
It's a special kind of agriculture.

679
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:44,421
Grow crops in sand.
Use chemicals for fertilizer.

680
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:46,613
We use horse manure.

You know,
you ought to let your hair grow.

683
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:55,915
Keep your head warm in the winter,
sun off your neck in the summer.

684
01:01:56,866 --> 01:01:59,422
Short hair ain't right for a man.

685

What about that there pistol?
You know how to use it?

686
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,191
Yes, sir.

687
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,847
I was once pretty good with it.
Targets, anyway.

688
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:11,781
- Never shot at a man?
- Never had cause to.

689
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:13,867
I guess there is a difference.

690
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:15,727
Man is generally a little bigger.

691
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:21,666
Those are horseshoe tracks. It's them.

692
01:02:21,766 --> 01:02:24,961
These mountains run about 30 miles
into deep gorge country...

694
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:29,507
Provo won't put his back to that.

695
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:34,095
He's gotta keep going northeast
till he makes a stand.

696
01:02:34,195 --> 01:02:36,205
Or an ambush.

697

- Sundown.

699

Sign's hard to read in the rocks...

700
01:02:58,178 --> 01:03:01,481
but they headed up that dry streambed.

701
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:05,627
They could double back
and set up a trap.

702
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,828
I don't see much point
in walking into it.

703
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:11,758
They're not far.

704
01:03:11,858 --> 01:03:14,719
Maybe two, three miles.

705
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,931
When we don't show,
Provo will send someone back...

706
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:20,123
to look for us.

707
01:03:24,329 --> 01:03:26,137

How's that?

709
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:48,503
That'll do. Yeah, that will do fine.

710

720
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,755
He might even think we're lost.

721
01:04:43,283 --> 01:04:45,422
He'll send out a stalking horse.

722

Send a what?

723
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,357

Did I?

730
01:05:12,437 --> 01:05:17,175
Provo is not a man about to bargain.

731
01:05:17,275 --> 01:05:20,162
Not when he's got all the chips.

732
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:24,099
No, he wants only one thing.

733

Me, alive.

734
01:05:28,578 --> 01:05:33,423
Then he'll find some mean way
to kill me.

735
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,473
He'll take his time...

736
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,429
because it will come on him...

737
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:45,078
