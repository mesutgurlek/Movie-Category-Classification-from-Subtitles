You can make it easy if you try.

162
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,199
Horses need rest.
So do we.

163
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,607
I ain't got enough
in the house to feed six men.

164
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,442
We got money, if that's
what's botherin' you.

165
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:20,177
I don't want your money.
I just want you to get outta here.

166
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:24,187
We aim to. Meanwhile,
we can't live on fresh air.

167
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,618
Now, listen, lady. I don't know why
I'm standin' here arguing with you.

168
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,459
There's six of us, and
we usually take what we want.

169
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,931
Not from around here.

170
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:44,707
All right, lady.
If that's the way you feel about it.

171
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,107
I don't like women
who act so high and-

172
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,838
Why, you dirty, little-

173
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:55,045
I wouldn't go stirrin' up no trouble
with that girl if I was you, young fella.

174
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,623
Quite a punch
you got there, ma'am.

175
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,217
Come in mighty handy
when you get married.

176
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,127
You're right, son.
She's as tough as a pine nut.

177
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,395
She oughta be.
She was raised with Apaches.

178
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:14,438
- Apaches?
- Yeah. Fine people if you understand them.

179
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,133
- Any of 'em around here?
- Oh, from time to time.

180
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,937
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Just a minute.

181
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,877
What about that food?

182
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,177
Do we get it peaceful
or don't we?

183
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,945
Well, we might arrange
for one night, Mike...

184
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,283
seein' what a lean belly he's got.

185
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,482
I'll send a couple
of the boys up after it.

186
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,063
You shouldn't have given in
to him like that, Grandpa.

187
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,098
I know what I'm doin'.

188
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,134
Don't feed 'em, and right away
they begin "suspicioning."

189
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,533
[Laughing]

190
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,869
Now, you act as if nothing
had happened and leave this to me.

191
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,618
What you goin' to all
that trouble for, Dude?

192
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,952
- You ain't hardly seen her yet.
- He's seen her all right.

193
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,515
Course, it was kinda worm's-eye view-
him right at her feet eatin' dust.

194
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,962
What do you reckon a girl like her's
doin' anyway livin' in a town like this?

195
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,330
The old man's
a prospector, most likely.

196
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:21,496
A little loony. Lots of old-timers
like him all through these hills.

197
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,337
- Yeah, but her?
- Somebody's got to look after the old fool.

198
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,579
Hmm. Look!

199
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,787
Kinda cute-lookin', ain't she?

200
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,856
Right nice swing to them hips too.

201
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:43,519
Yeah. And when she tucks in that shirt-

202
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,504
Better let me help you
with that bucket, ma'am.

203
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,743
- Looks heavy.
- I can manage.

204
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:11,049
Just the same, ma'am, somebody oughta help
you carry that bucket up to the house.

205
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,283
Well, now wait a minute, lady.

206
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,758
You don't mean you'd shoot
a big, handsome fellow like me?

207
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,625
[Laughs]
If you got to shoot somebody...

208
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,791
why, pick on Half Pint or Walrus.

209
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,028
They don't amount to nothin' no how.

210
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,439
I've told you once.

211
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,475
Well, as long as I'm goin'
your way anyhow-

212
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,476
[Stretch] You heard what she said.
Sit down.

213
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,409
- But I was just-
- Shut up.

214
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,481
- I got a right to-
- Shut up!

215
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,393
You gotta hit some people
in the head with an ax.

216
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,267
Now, listen, all of you. I'm figurin' on
layin' up here for three or four days...

217
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:04,330
till the horses get their legs back,
and I don't want any unnecessary trouble.

218
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:08,105
- Stay away from those people.
- Listen. You ain't-

219
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,979
Yes, I am. I ain't talkin'
just to hear my own voice.

220
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,983
I'm ordering you.

221
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,486
If I catch any of you messin' around
that house, somebody's gonna get hurt.

222
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,315
- Is that clear?
- That include you too?

223
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,522
That includes everybody.

224
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,726
There's an old saloon
down at the other end of the town.

225
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,736
We'll bunk in it.
Gets kinda cold around here at night.

226
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,389
[Snoring]

227
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,665
- Where you goin'?
- Outside.

228
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:11,765
I can't sleep nohow with this fathead
snorin' like a wounded buffalo.

229
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,868
- Turn over!
- [Muttering]

230
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,471
[Groaning]

231
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,347
[Snoring Resumes]

232
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,926
Sure is still tonight, ain't it?

233
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,201
I wonder what Dude's up to.

234
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,316
Brother, am I sure gonna throw a shoe
if he gets anyplace with that gal.

235
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,883
From what I saw, she'll tear him
in two if he tries anything.

236
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,391
[Coyote Howling]

237
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,185
What are you doin' here?

238
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,517
Lookin' for one of my men.

239
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,989
I told you if anybody came up here,
he was liable to get shot.

240
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,062
I wish you wouldn't keep
pointin' that thing at me.

241
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,462
Women got no business
carryin' guns.

242
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,763
- They're apt to shoot somebody
they don't mean to.
- Not me.

243
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,240
You know,
if you was prettied up a bit...

244
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,332
you might look almost like a female.

245
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,280
[Grunting]

246
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:39,482
[Muffled Shouting]

247
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,928
[Mike]
You-

248
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,367
[Grunting Continues]

249
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,771
[Whimpers, Panting]

250
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,038
[Grunting]

251
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,255
Just wanted to show you how safe
you'd be if I really wanted to get rough.

252
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,191
You smell. Even Apaches
are cleaner than you.

253
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,326
Why, you-

254
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,402
Didn't anybody ever tell you
before that you smell bad?

255
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,959
Mike! Mike!

256
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,970
What happened?

257
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,972
It's nothin', Grandpa.
It's just-

258
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,542
I just caught someone
prowlin' around out here.

259
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,407
Did you get him good?

260
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,209
Maybe I should have.

261
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,383
[Laughs]

262
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,079
Good thing she can shoot
as straight as she can, young fella.

263
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:21,318
Most women'd have lost their heads at a time
like this, and you'd have been done for.

264
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,951
Ain't every girl can miss
that close... on purpose.

265
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,998
- Do you need any help?
- No!

266
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,392
[Laughs]

267
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,404
Better be gettin'
back on inside, honey.

268
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,498
Ain't likely he'll bother
anybody else tonight.

269
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,442
He's gonna be kinda dizzy.
[Laughs]

270
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,652
Mike, how'd you
come to shoot him?

271
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,555
I don't know.
He grabbed me.

272
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,101
He made me feel-

273
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,704
I don't know.

274
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,572
I wish I'd let him die
of thirst when he came here.

275
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,501
[Coyote Howling]

276
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,526
[Coyote Howling]

277
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,196
What were you doing up there?

278
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,774
I was lookin' for you.

279
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,334
I guess you didn't hear what I said
about stayin' away from that girl.

280
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:52,644
[Chuckles] Looks like you didn't
even hear it yourself.

281
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,345
Anyhow, I wasn't bothering about her.

282
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,723
I was just nosing around,
following a hunch.

283
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:09,428
- What kind of a hunch?
- Gold.

284
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,459
It doesn't make sense-
that old man and a girl like her...

285
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,562
living up here just for their health.

286
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,440
Sure enough, they've got half a dozen cradles
and a big sluice box down in the canyon.

287
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:25,448
Well, how do you know it's not just old
equipment left around here like everything else?

288
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,110
Because there's a shack down there too.

289
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,551
Apaches been living in it.

290
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,419
I could smell 'em
the minute I opened the door.

291
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,287
Strong as a fox's den.

292
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:41,389
Well, suppose they have
found some gold, what of it?

293
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:46,061
Too much money layin' around in banks
for us to worry about any little dab they got.

294
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,638
Maybe it isn't so little.

295
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,140
Well, anyhow, we're not
sticking around to find out.

296
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,235
We're movin' on as soon
as the horses are fit.

297
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,871
Well, I don't know about you...

298
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:03,079
but I'm getting a little tired
of all this robbery business.

299
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,281
I've got a bullet floating
around in me, right here.

300
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,416
Some tinhorn gambler
who yelled like a stuck pig...

301
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,995
because he dropped
a few hundred dollars.

302
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,428
Claimed he'd been cheated.

303
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,592
Which he had, but that's
neither here nor there.

304
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,602
I don't know if I ever told you...

305
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,470
but I used to have
a big faro layout in San Juan.

306
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,874
Best-looking woman in camp
waiting on me hand and foot.

307
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,147
Then bang-

308
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,582
Along comes this tinhorn-
puts a bullet in me.

309
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,016
When I got on my feet again,
the money was all gone.

310
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,024
Her too.

311
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:47,261
She lit out with a fellow
who ended up beating her.

312
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:51,563
[Laughs]
Which wasn't a bad idea either.

313
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:56,038
As for me, I was just
a down-at-the-heels sharper...

314
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,132
with one bad lung,
looking for a stake.

315
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:06,010
But I told them
I'd come back, loaded.

316
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,512
That's why I joined up with you.

317
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,556
Maybe now's the time.

318
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,427
Not interested.

319
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,866
Just thought I'd mention it.

320
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,571
Need any help getting back to bed?

321
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,542
I'm staying here
for the rest of the night.

322
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,738
I'll send the kid
with your saddle and blanket.

323
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,812
By the way...

324
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,355
that woman I was telling you
about in San Juan-

325
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,651
Her name was Lucy.

326
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,023
This girl kind of reminds me of her.

327
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,028
Same figure.

337
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:47,207
Now wait a minute, boss. I ain't doin' nothin'
none of the rest of them ain't doin'.

338
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:51,145
- And what's that?
- Lookin' for the old man's gold, like Dude said.

339
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,950
Where are the old man and the girl?

340
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,385
They're up in the hills somewhere.
They lit out as soon as they heard us comin'.

341
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,390
- Put that down and come with me.
- All right, boss.

342
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,154
All right.

343
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,952
Get in there where I can
see what you're doing.

344
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,203
So you fellows figure
you got a new boss, eh?

345
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,406
- We want that gold.
- Dude said you wasn't interested.

346
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,878
- So we took a vote and-
- Decided that Dude's the leader. Is that it?

347
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,478
It just happens that votes
don't mean a thing to me.

348
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,951
You wanna get rid of me,
you've gotta run me out.

349
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:07,785
You ain't got no objections
to bein' rich, have you?

350
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,588
We ain't arguin' about that now.
We're talkin' about who's boss.

00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,576
[Chuckles]

352
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,704
Personally I don't care who's boss...

353
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,544
long as we get that gold.

354
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,448

[Gunshots]

356
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,658
No sense bangin' away like that, Mike.
You're just usin' up good bullets.

357
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,287
If I could just get one of 'em,
it might change their minds.

358
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,635
Looks like they got gold all right.

359
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,042
- Yeah, that's what we've been tellin' you.
- Let's get it.

00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,741
My way. Understand?

361
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,417
Gonna get mighty hot
up on that hill after a while.

362
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,256
Them two'll get good and thirsty.

363
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,262
All we gotta do is sit tight.

364
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,197
Sit tight?
Like a bunch of scared rabbits?

365
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,326
- Well, there's six of us. Let's root 'em out.
- Go ahead.

366
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,735
It couldn't be that you're worrying about
somebody else getting killed, could it?

367
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,079
You and Lengthy get in the house...

368
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,309
and see if you can find out
where they got the ammunition hid.

369
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,544
Cinch they couldn't
carry it all up there.

370
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,884

look around the barn.

Mighty hot sun.

Almost tempts a man
to drink water.

Well, I declare!

377
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,959
There's one of them
wavin' a flag of truce.

378
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,936
[Laughs]
Tryin' everything, I guess.

379
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,110
It don't seem exactly right
to shoot a man wavin' a white flag, Mike.

380
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,375
I'll teach them to come around here,
chasin' us out of our house.

381
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,382
Wait till he gets up a little closer.

382
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,714
You can always get him
if he gets nasty.

383

That's close enough.
[Voice Echoing]

It's the only white shirt we got
in the outfit. Belongs to Dude.

385
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,729
He's kind of particular.
Don't wanna get it dirty.

386
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,195
Look, I shaved.

387
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,895
Changed my shirt too.

388
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,903
Smell like a lily.

389
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,436
Even combed my hair, right
around the part you gave me.

390
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,774
What do you want?

391
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,943
I thought maybe you and me
could make a deal.

392
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,077
There's only one deal
we'll make with you:

393
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,748
Get out of Yellow Sky and stay out,
or we'll shoot the lot of you.

394
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,419
Them bullets of yours ain't gonna last
forever. We found your ammunition.

395
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,593
Soon as you use up the ones you got,
my boys are gonna come up and get you.

396
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,827
Well, at least you
won't be among 'em.

397
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,335
Oh, don't a flag of truce
mean nothin' to you?

398
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,201
With thieves like you?

399
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,501
Now, nobody's gonna hurt you
if they can help it.

400
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,043
But we know you got gold,
and we're gonna get it.

401
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:25,946
Come on back to the house and tell us where
it's hid. Maybe we'll cut you in for some.

402
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,847
You might as well be comfortable
while you're gettin' robbed.

403
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,781
Ask him what kind of a deal.

404
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,621
You can't make a deal
with him, Grandpa.

405
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,661
Fifty-fifty's better than nothin'.

406
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,696
Anyhow, it don't do no harm to ask.

407

Sit down and keep your hands in sight.

what we're gonna do with you.

Bull Run and Walrus, get up there.
Somebody's been hit.

00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,715
I sure hope it ain't that girl.

00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,847
Didn't even break no bone.

423
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,217
Don't look like you got
no lead to probe for neither.

424
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,115
Don't look like you got
no lead to probe for neither.

That's right. Just got
a hole in my leg.

426

a two-quart job.

You see, we're used to
men getting shot...

430
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,174
and the boys just haven't
stopped to remember...

431
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,874
that this is your grandfather
and the only one you've got.

432
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,447
Look, why don't you go?
Can't you see he wants to go to sleep?

433
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,524
I think we oughta get this deal
of ours settled right now.

434
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,820
- Where's the gold?
- He can't talk now.

435
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,488
Tomorrow when he's feeling better,
he'll tell you anything you wanna know.

436
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,624
- All right, Mike. Might as well get it over with.
- But, Grandpa, you're not-

437
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:02,000
If we don't, first thing you know,
they'll be twisting my arm for me.

438
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,302
Did you ever have a fellow
twist your arm for you?

439
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,675
It don't feel so good.
Get me my pipe.

440
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:23,452
I don't supposed it'd do
any good to tell you boys...

441
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,495
we haven't got any gold?

442
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,196
Yeah, that's what I thought.

443
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,832
You'd just keep hunting for it
until you'd made a nuisance of yourself...

444
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,876
until somebody got killed.

445
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,674
Now, wouldn't you?

446
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,345
Suppose I admit
that we have got some gold...

447
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,717
but don't tell you where it is?

448
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:56,225
Now, you wouldn't do a mean thing
like that to us, would you, Grandpa?

449
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,779
Let me give you boys
a little history of things here.

450
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:23,285
About 15 years ago, heavy silver
was hit here in Yellow Sky.

451
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,855
[Chuckles]
The town boomed overnight.

452
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,891
Me and Mike here-
Oh, she was just a baby then.

453
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,519
I was a young fellow myself-
not a day over 60.

454
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,756
[Laughing]

455
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,196
Well, we was late gettin' here...

456
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,035
and didn't manage to put our hands
on anything worthwhile anyhow...

457
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:49,238
so it didn't matter one way or the other
to us when the veins pinched out.

458
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,645
Well, it was right hard
goin' for us for a while...

459
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,843
but we finally hit
on what we were lookin' for.

460
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,889
Pretty soon we hired us
two or three young Apaches...

461
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,967
from the old chief, Colorado.

462
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,060
[Laughs]
Then things began to hum.

I'm still havin' trouble with my puffer.

465
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:34,423
Yeah. What was I talkin' about?

466
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,515
Gold.

467
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:42,655
Oh, yes. Yes.
Mighty dangerous thing...

468
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,327
if you want it
out of plumb greediness.

469
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,863
I've seen it ruin many a man.

470
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,870
Of course, I had good reasons
for wantin' it myself.

471
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:57,777
Now, Mike here-
I'm the only one she's got.

472
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,339
So, you see, I wanted to see her
took good care of before I died.

473
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,544
Come to the point.
What about our deal?

474
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,389
- What's your idea of a deal?
- Depends on how much you got.

475
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,987
- Well, now, countin' the dust-
- Don't tell 'em, Grandpa.

476
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,360
- Don't tell 'em anything more!
- Well, Mike, I thought-

477
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,559
I had to do something. I couldn't
let you stay up there and die.

478
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,229
- Now, listen, ma'am.
I've been tryin' to be patient with you-
- That money's yours, Grandpa.

479
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,069
I know how hard you worked
and sweated for it.

480
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,702
They got no right to it. Of course,
you can't understand that, can you?

481
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,474
'Cause you're no good.
None of you.

482
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:35,711
- You're just born takers.
- You still haven't said how much you got.

483
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:40,313
It ain't just the money.
Look at him. He's an old man.

484
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:43,756
All he's dreamed about is seein'
this town come to life again...

485
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,057
with people livin' here and
workin' and-and stores open.

from Alkali.

487
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,525
And all because of him
and what he done.

488
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,951
You see, Mike? They don't even
know what you're talkin' about.

489
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,758
Uh, how about 50-50?

490
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,559
How much?

491
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,434
Oh, 50,000.

492
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,729
Fifty thousand dollars?

493
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,876
[Grandpa]
Around that.

494
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,971
I think maybe we can do business.

00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,379

Mike?

498
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:06,131
It's cached in the mouth of that
old silver mine up under those big rocks.

499
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,236
When you came here this morning,
we went up and knocked out a few timbers.

500
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,315
It's buried now.

- Want it?

Oh, my back feels like it's broke.

That's what's bothering me.
He may keep too close an eye on her.

Why don't you shut up
about that girl?

509
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,687
Once you get your hands on all this gold, she
won't look no better than a broken-down squaw.

510
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,696
Well, that's a lie.

615
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:03,274
I hereby swear on this good book...

616
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:05,281
that I'm goin' through with our deal...

617
01:07:05,383 --> 01:07:07,408
to the letter.

618
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:11,488
Well, young man...

619
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:13,489
if you don't mean it...

620
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:16,321
I don't see no point
in you comin' here blasphemin'.

621
01:07:16,428 --> 01:07:18,453
Shake on it.

622
01:07:20,932 --> 01:07:22,832
[Stretch]
I guess I better be goin'.

623
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,280
Haven't you got
any better name than Mike?

624
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:41,451
Constance Mae.

Dawson's mine.
James Dawson.

626
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:05,773
Ah- I guess the war
has upset a lot of those boys...

627
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:08,744
and set them off on the wrong foot.

628
01:08:10,381 --> 01:08:13,350
You know, I've seen a lot worse fellows
than him keep their word.

629
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:21,649
I'll put out your light now, Grandpa.
It's time for you to go to sleep.

630
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,955
Yeah.
[Sniffs]

631
01:08:54,993 --> 01:08:56,893
Come on.
Let's get it.

632
01:08:56,995 --> 01:08:58,895
- Come on!
- Come on.

633
01:09:06,037 --> 01:09:09,666
Ah, we've been sold. Maybe the sacks
are buried around here somewhere.

634
01:09:18,383 --> 01:09:20,647
Here's one of them.
Here it is. I've got it!

[Coughing]

639
01:09:43,842 --> 01:09:45,810
I'm gonna get me some new clothes.

640
01:09:47,178 --> 01:09:49,078
Hey, look. What's that?

Looks like that old man
wasn't as... loony as we figured.

646
01:10:51,743 --> 01:10:54,735
Yeah. Let us dig his gold
out for him...

647
01:10:54,846 --> 01:10:56,837
then his Indians show up
just when we find it.

648
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:59,781
Maybe those folks are...
worse off than we are.

649
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:01,909
Aw, shut up, you jape.

650
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,454
They told us them Apaches
was friends of theirs, didn't they?

01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:11,593

Funny they haven't rushed us.

657
01:11:31,316 --> 01:11:34,615
Maybe they're waitin' for sunup.
Indians always like sunup.

658
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,619
We better try to find out
what they're gonna do.

659
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:39,588
- Wait a minute. What about all that gold?
- You carry it.

660
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,685
Maybe you fellas are givin' up
on that gold, but I ain't.

Well, that was
quite a little powwow.

670
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:35,568
Yeah. Apaches like
to hear theirselves talk.

671
01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:38,301
Looks like they ain't
the only ones around here.

672
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:40,309
All right, turn 'em loose on us.

673
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:43,972
They may finish us, but we'll get
our share of them before they do.

01:13:44,082 --> 01:13:47,574
Do you think I'd turn
crazy drunk Apaches loose on ya?

675
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:49,152
They're friends of yours,
ain't they?

676
01:13:49,253 --> 01:13:51,653
- Why, yes, but l-
- You sent for 'em, didn't you?

677
01:13:53,224 --> 01:13:54,953
Well, did you or didn't you?

678
01:13:55,059 --> 01:13:57,857
Why, I didn't know they was
within 50 miles of here...

679
01:13:57,962 --> 01:14:00,988
till some of the boys that used to work
for me slipped in here last night.

680
01:14:01,099 --> 01:14:05,934
Seems like they'd had some trouble over
at the reservation. They were out to kill.

681
01:14:06,037 --> 01:14:09,768
Took a lot of coaxin' on my part,
but I... finally got them to promise...

682
01:14:09,874 --> 01:14:12,104
to bring the big chief here
to talk to me.

683
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,644
You know, he's an old friend of mine.
[Chuckles]

684
01:14:14,745 --> 01:14:16,679
I just got through telling them...

685
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:19,511
that if they went back to the reservation
and behaved theirselves...

686
01:14:19,617 --> 01:14:23,951
I'd talk to the Indian agent myself
and have their troubles took care of.

687
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:27,286
Huh. Took a heap of arguing
on my part.

688
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:32,221
That's what they're gonna do.

689
01:14:33,564 --> 01:14:35,464
What about us?

690
01:14:35,566 --> 01:14:38,558

you was working for me.

the old man a good talkin' to.

01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:19,909
He's a great one for makin' deals.

695
01:15:20,011 --> 01:15:21,911
It's that honest face of his.

696
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,607

"By gum, there's an honest thief."

So let's stop shooting off our mouths
and start loading this gold.

01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:35,757
[Stretch] I wouldn't be in too big
a hurry about that if I was you.

[Walrus]
Where'd you come from?

702
01:15:37,862 --> 01:15:40,387
I told you to meet me behind
them rocks. You didn't do it.

703
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:43,956
- Well, you see, Dude here-
- I'm givin' the orders around here.

704
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:46,400
[Dude]
We'll talk about that later.

705
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:48,972
Right now, we wanna know
what those Indians are up to.

706
01:15:49,073 --> 01:15:51,234
The old man told 'em to move out.

707
01:15:51,342 --> 01:15:55,108
- For good?
- Huh. He must've been shot
in the head, not the leg.

708
01:15:55,213 --> 01:15:57,272
Well, come on.
Let's load up and git.

709
01:15:57,381 --> 01:15:59,440
Just a minute.

710
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,417
Before we talk about loadin',
there's one thing I wanna get straight.

711
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,149
- What about our deal with the old man?
- Well, what about it?

712
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:10,091
There's a fortune in there-
enough for everybody...

713
01:16:10,194 --> 01:16:12,128
includin' the old man and the girl.

714
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,755
[Laughs]
Now it comes.

715
01:16:14,865 --> 01:16:18,323
Up to last night, I figured
the same way you fellas did.

716
01:16:18,436 --> 01:16:21,997
I was just tryin' to save us a lot of trouble
when I said we'd split 50-50.

717
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:26,975
If it hadn't been for them Apaches
comin' in, maybe I'd still feel the same.

718
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:30,912
But the old man played it square,
stuck to his bargain.

719
01:16:31,015 --> 01:16:34,314
If it hadn't been for that, we'd all
be layin' around here dead right now.

720
01:16:34,418 --> 01:16:37,785
Whether you like it or not,
we're givin' 'em their full share.

721
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:42,120
If that don't suit you, you've got a fight
on your hands and you better get at it quick.

722
01:16:42,226 --> 01:16:48,096
It's a free country, ain't it?
Majority rules. I say we take a vote on it.

723
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:50,633
I told you once before.
I don't like votes.

724
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:53,829
We busted our backs
diggin' this stuff out, boss.

725
01:16:53,938 --> 01:16:57,135
We've been scared off by Indians,
shot at by an old desert rat...

726
01:16:57,241 --> 01:16:59,641
- and that he-girl of his.
- Throw down your guns.

727
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:04,313
It's five to one.

728
01:17:05,983 --> 01:17:10,386
Nobody's anxious to see you dead,
Stretch, but we want that gold...

729
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:12,388
and we want all of it.

730
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:17,223
There's plenty more left here. If that girl
and the old man want it, they can dig for it.

731
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:20,354
I've waited all my life
to make a killing like this...

732
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:23,627
and I'm not giving
half my share to anybody.

Give up now,
and we'll call it quits!

735
01:17:45,923 --> 01:17:48,653
You better do like he says, 'cause
we're gonna play billiards with you...

736
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:50,659
till we run you out of them rocks.

737
01:17:50,761 --> 01:17:52,922
Then we're gonna pick you off
like a turkey.

- Who cares what you think?

whether you like it or not.

Get down!

01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:26,655
Can you make it to the house?

- Well, we had him.
- [Half Pint] That fool girl.

with that buffalo gun of hers.

[Walrus] Come on! Let's go back
and load up and get out of here.

01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:49,445
And spend the rest of your days...

752
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:51,606
waiting for Stretch
to stick a gun in your back?

753
01:19:51,715 --> 01:19:53,945
Not me. I'm not leavin'
till we get him.

754
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:56,019
I wanna sleep nights.

755
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,035
- [Door Closes]
- What happened?

756
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:25,582
Oh, me and the boys
had a little... argument.

757
01:20:25,683 --> 01:20:27,082
About our deal?

758
01:20:29,253 --> 01:20:31,983
Couldn't see it your way, eh?

759
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:39,428
Huh. We figured that was it.
[Mutters]

760

Grandpa!
You shouldn't get out of bed.

761

Aw, a lot healthier down here.

762
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:53,242
Here.

763
01:20:58,816 --> 01:21:00,750
Thanks.

764
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,591
What'll they do next?

765
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:23,101
It's hard to say
with me not there to tell 'em.

766
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:32,777
You've got yourself
quite a granddaughter, mister.

767
01:21:32,883 --> 01:21:36,148
[Grandpa Chuckles]
I know that.

768
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:40,884
It's her future that's worrying me.

769

Yeah.

- [Horse Whinnying]
- Shh!

774
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,909
- Means they're leavin'.
- Might...

775
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:39,572
if Dude's got anything
to say about it.

776
01:22:39,683 --> 01:22:41,583
He's gold crazy.

777
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,420
Can't tell about Lengthy.

778
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,681
He's got other things on his mind.

779
01:22:52,162 --> 01:22:56,599
You, Walrus, Bull Run-
cover the back door.

780
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,362
I told Half Pint to take the front door
soon as he gets back.

781
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:03,839
I'll cover the window.
If he comes out...

782
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:09,072
- let him have it.
- Wait a minute.

783
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:14,116
Before anybody starts giving orders
around here, let's get one thing settled.

784
01:23:14,218 --> 01:23:17,119
I got first call on that girl,
understand?

785
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:20,213
- Ah, who cares about her?
- I do.

786
01:23:22,326 --> 01:23:24,226
All right.
Go ahead and take her.

787
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:29,261
All I want is that gold.

788
01:23:29,366 --> 01:23:31,266
Come on. Let's go.

789

You listening?

792
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,934
We know that if we try to blast you out,
some of us are gonna get hurt.

793
01:24:14,044 --> 01:24:18,606
On the other hand, if we run off
with the gold and leave you still alive...

794
01:24:18,716 --> 01:24:23,813
we've got sense enough to know that
you'll keep looking until you find us.

795
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:26,913
So we've decided
to do what you wanted-

796
01:24:27,024 --> 01:24:30,653
split with the old man and the girl.

797
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:34,219
Course it's not exactly
what we'd like to do...

798
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:36,424
but you can't have everything.

799
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:38,433
What do you say?

800
01:24:41,405 --> 01:24:43,305

Get in back!

801

That suits me! Come on in!

803
01:25:19,877 --> 01:25:21,777
Did you get him?

804
01:25:21,879 --> 01:25:24,973
[Lengthy] Yeah, I'm sure we did.
I saw him fall.

805
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,498

It's me- Walrus.

808
01:26:07,524 --> 01:26:12,052

He's bleedin' somethin' awful.

[Groans]
This ain't no trick, ma'am.

810
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:17,333
I got it in the belly.

811
01:26:19,203 --> 01:26:21,831
Looks like the kid's done for.

812
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:23,998
Let him in.

813
01:26:25,676 --> 01:26:27,576
Bring him in!

I hurt, Stretch.

821
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:16,285
I was kind of wantin'
to get back to see my folks...

822
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:19,895
but I hurt, Stretch.

823
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:23,932
Can't just let him lie there and die.

[Walrus]
Funny thing.

827
01:27:50,027 --> 01:27:53,963
He was the only one against
comin' here in the first place.

828
01:27:54,064 --> 01:27:57,227
What are they gonna try next?

829
01:27:57,334 --> 01:28:00,098
Guess they ain't gonna try nothin' but...

830
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:03,138
get each other and winner take all.

831
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,970
Where are they now?

832
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:10,240
Dude took a shot at Lengthy, tried
to get him in the back of the head...

833
01:28:10,347 --> 01:28:12,713
just when he thought he'd got you.

834
01:28:12,816 --> 01:28:16,752
Then he let out for town,
Lengthy after him.

835
01:28:16,853 --> 01:28:19,913
Guess they didn't figure
I was worth botherin' about.

836
01:28:20,023 --> 01:28:24,653
- Where are the horses?
- Down at the saloon, where we left the gold.

01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:28,925
- Half Pint's coverin' the front door.
- Tell him to get in here.

Hey, Half Pint!

839
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:49,383
Dude and Lengthy run off!

840
01:28:49,486 --> 01:28:53,422
Ain't either of them aimin'
to share that gold with nobody.
