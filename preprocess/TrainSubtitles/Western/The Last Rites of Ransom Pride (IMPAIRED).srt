00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,678
I was 11 years old

3
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,942
when general Batista
slaughtered half my village.

4
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,280
I watched him
torture my father

5
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,786
and butcher my mother.

6
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:25,619
The kids that survived,
I took to Juarez.

7
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,092
We roamed the streets
like wolves.

8
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,791
I came back the night
of the general's wedding.

9
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,629
Stole his straight razor.

10
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,002
The general awoke to the sound
of his own throat being cut.

11
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:45,703
While the general bled,
I sang to him.

00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:49,543
"'Tis better to whisper

There's two kinds of people
in the world, fellas.

16
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,153
There's the wicked...

17
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,423
And the righteous.

18
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,495
And it's
the wicked man's job

19
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,588
to get
the righteous man's money.

20
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,830
This righteous tool here
is used by the wicked

21
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:47,338
to get that money.

Sure, they're old.

But they shoot true.

25
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:01,385
Now, in the hands of a man
such as Louie Chama, well...

26
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,182
it could bring great wealth.

27
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,922
- Huh?
[chuckles]

28
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:13,191

The last thing Ransom Pride
said to me was,

''I was always a lover,
despite the killings.''

The body of Ransom Pride
belongs to me.

And I understand there's someone
here who believes otherwise.

Mescal?

47
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,155
You go on and tell
that broke-dick son of a bitch

48
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,592
he's mistaken.

Your Ransom...

60
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,180
he killed a priest.

61
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:04,189
This priest
was my brother by birth.

62
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,094
And although his faith
was misplaced,

63
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,691
he remains my brother
in death.

Therefore, the body
of Ransom Pride will be fed

66
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,274
to the devil's
black vultures,

67
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:27,718
for there must be
atonement.

68
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,724
He has a brother.

69
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:37,159
So this is your offer?

She's taken to me.

78
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,072
Maybe she thinks
I'm like him.

79
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:32,851
How is it you consider
yourself like Ransom?

80
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:35,919
I'm sorry, Pa.

81

I didn't mean
we're the very same.

No, you're not alike.

get on your knees

and thank the Lord in heaven
you're not like him.

See that you earn it.

170
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:26,788

171
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:27,956

179
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,836
Don't do that.

180

[coughs]

181
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,012
Well, well.

182
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,245
Welcome back,
Captain.

183
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:56,446
Or should I say
Reverend?

184
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,080
Ransom's whore got him killed
down in Mexico.

185
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,955
And now she come back
and took his brother.

186
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:04,688
The one who killed Edna
when he come out?

187
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,459
Graves...

188
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,967
you mention my wife again,

189
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,196
I swear to God,

190
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,535
I'll kill you
with that whore on your lap.

191
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,701
You're the one who put
the blame on him for that.

192
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:24,043
Whore got a name?

193
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,752
Yeah.

194
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,915
Juliette Flowers.

195
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,651
Goddamn, Captain.

196
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:38,252
I guess she's growing
a conscience.

197
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,833
Was a time she'd have
murdered y'all in your sleep.

198
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,103
Yeah, in certain parts
of Mexico,

199
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,900
they sing corridos
about that half-breed girl.

200
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,600
[sighs]
Yeah.

Quantrill and bloody Bill said
leave him for dead in Kansas.

210
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:32,214
He was shot up
too bad to ride.

211
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:35,514
What'd I do?

212
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,519
Did I leave you, Graves?

213
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,556
No.

214
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,853
I didn't leave you.

215
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:45,020
Stayed right there
with you.

216
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,496
There's a debt here

217
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,397
I guess I come to collect.

218
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:52,629
Asking for help...

219
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:55,229
oh, that's
a hard thing to do.

220
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:59,868
I guess you could ask God
to help you.

221
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:05,076
And maybe
the Christ Jesus.

222
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:14,349
I don't need God's help
for this, Graves.

223
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,097
I need a son of a bitch.

224
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,333
Mr. Graves
wants to see you.

225
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,902
[groaning]

226
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,943
Your uncle
has a job for you.

227
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,227
Captain, behold
the answer to your prayers.

228
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,352
How is it you're
still living, Matthew?

229
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,762
You know, you ain't
the only one that Jesus saves.

230
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,131
Matthew was the toughest
son of a bitch.

231
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:04,038
But the meanest
was Early Pride.

232
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,441
He had no conscience
whatsoever.

233
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:10,037
[breathing heavily]

234
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,481
God damn it,
you fucking whore.

235
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:15,109
- Who in the hell are you?
- That's my sister's boy.

236
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,950
Been here since she passed.

237
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,321
Well, he's disturbing.
I don't like the looks of him.

238
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,587
No, neither do I.

239
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,220
Son of a bitch is uglier
than a three-peckered goat.

240
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,323
But he don't mind
getting his hands bloody

241
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,764
when a man needs killing.

242
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,597
Or a woman.

243
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:34,399
A haIf-breed bitch
name of Juliette Flowers

244
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:36,770
took my boy to Mexico.

245
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,740
[chuckling]

246
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,505
I-I know her.

247
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,840
I know who that is.

248
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,142
That's that
Juliette Flowers.

249
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,410
She-she-she's that girl-

250
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,486
This is kin to you?

251
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:58,259
I don't care
what you do to her.

252
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:06,763
hell, you can stammer her
to death if you want.

253
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:08,100
But you just make sure

254
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:11,005
she ain't breathing
when you finish.

255
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:12,940
Now, get away from me.

256
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,991
I heard
he was barely 1 5 years old

257
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:37,694
when he and my uncle rode
into Northfield with McCIuskey.

258
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,532
- What, you heard?
- Yeah.

259
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:42,504
Hell, me and Early was barely
weaned from the tit

260
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:46,008
when we got recruited
by Quantrill.

261
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,976
Back then, Shepherd,
he seemed like a man,

262
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,479
but looking at it now, hell,

263
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,310
he wasn't much more
than a boy himself.

264
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,520
Well, we killed every man,

265
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,418
and we killed every chlid,

266
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,354
and we killed
every goddamn dog,

267
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:01,925
and we rode all the women.

268
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,551
And when they
couldn't ride no more,

269
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,254
we killed them.

270
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,290
Reverend's gonna ride down
on us like some kind of hell.

271
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,023
He'll put a strap to me,

272
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,100
but he'll kill you.

273
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,963
I doubt it.

274
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:47,038
It felt like
he always hated me.

275
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:48,936
'Cause of your mama?

276
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,803
It was like I was to blame.

277
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,246
Ransom said
it wasn't my fault.

278
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:02,876
The old man
would get whiskey-ed up

279
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,582
and start cussin' me.

280
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,658
Ransom would never let him
lay a hand on me.

281
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,595
After he'd pass out,

282
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,427
Ransom would always say,

283
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,592
''It ain't your fault.''

You'll want
to hear this.

Now.

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,028
Yeah?

00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,970
This man tells me that...

Ransom killed a priest
before he died.

What?

296
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,340
That priest
was the younger brother

297
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:39,541
of a woman they call
Maria la Morena.

298

in recompense.

first time they laid eyes
on each other,

when Ransom got throwed
in the same Mexican jall

00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,744
where they was holding
Juliette Flowers.

They was fixing
to hang her

Well, he got arrested
for being drunk

318
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:02,589
and pissing
on the statue of some saint.

Make sure she can't hurt us,
but don't kill her right away.

323
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,599
Just...just tie her up.

324

Tie her up
so she can't do nothing.

Why weren't you with him?

What the hell of a difference
does that make?

327

He was gonna come back
for you, you know.

Yeah, well, he never did.

00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:06,357
Patience is a virtue
I do not possess.

334
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:10,400
Yeah, well, you ain't much for
wisdom or temperance, neither.

335
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:27,083
I feel like I'm back in Glory
finishing up his chores.

336
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:28,686
For whatever reason,

337
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,550
he honestly believed
certain tasks were beneath him.

338
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,181
''A man with vision
can't be bothered

339
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:37,318
by pissant detalls.''

340
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,897
How many times
I hear that?

341
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,726
That goddamn ranch
in Michoacàn.

342
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,428
Never even been there,

343
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,869
but he'd get it in his head
we were gonna get it.

344
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,338
When we got it,
he was gonna get you

345
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,069
and bring you down here.

346
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:55,744
His pride
wouldn't let him get you

347
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,508
when he was hiding out,

348
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,243
sleeping in caves.

349
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:04,283
[exhales]

[vehicle approaching]

351
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:11,960
I'll hide the horses.

352
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,985
[breathing heavily]

353
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,424
You got any whiskey?

354
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,901
[gun cocks]

355
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,075
You got any whiskey?

356
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,750
I-I-I tell ya-

357
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,824
I'll tell ya
one thing, Matthew.

358
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,792
That Ransom Pride
was a lucky son of a bitch.

359
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:19,692
He killed a federal judge
back in Tyler.

360
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,458
He jumped out
a second-story window,

361
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,591
didn't even break his foot.

362
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,135
He was a lucky
son of a bitch.

363
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,760
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

364
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,430
Serves him right
for trying to do

365
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,202
a gun-running deal
by hisself.

366
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:33,777
Shouldn't go and do
something like that.

367
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,346
Whoa.

368
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,607
What?

369
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:40,685
You think they've been here?
They've been here, haven't they?

370
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,185
Hyah, hyah, hyah.

371
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,488
Wherever you are,

372
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,493
good enough place as any
to start over.

373
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,498
I'm ready to start over.

374
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,075
Now, how are you
gonna start over?

375
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:08,338
You ain't even
begun to start.

376
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,574
This is as good
a time as any.

377
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,217
If you're gonna
start something,

378
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,726
by God, you ought to...

379
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,065
You ought to finish it.
[gasping]

380
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,829
And whatever you do,

381
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:34,167
it better goddamn
be worth it.

382
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,162
[gasping]

383
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:43,211
'Cause when you-

384
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,511
when you make an investment,

385
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,677
a commitment...

386
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:53,181
You follow through.

387
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,723
You know the difference
between an investment

388
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,596
and a commitment?

389
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,534
Hmm? Yeah.

390
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,437
You take a plate
of ham and eggs.

391
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:13,874
Now, the chicken...

392
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,708
is invested.

393
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,577
The pig...

394
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:18,705
is committed.

395
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:20,478
[snickers]

[laughter continues]

398
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,932
If I had my life
to live over,

399
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,268
I would live very, very little
of it the same.

400
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,774
When you hear folks say

401
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,243
that they wouldn't change
their life,

402
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:52,077
I think they're either
liars or fools.

403
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:55,152
Life is about learning.

404
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:58,120
And if you respect life

405
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,656
and you learn from it,

406
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:05,786
you would, of course,
not do things the same way.

407
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,329
To start with,

408
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:11,128
if I had my life
to live over,

409
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,261
I would never say no
to a woman.

410
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,205
And I would do nothing

411
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:19,173
purely for money.

412
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:35,221
If we were to sell
them pistols in Tres Piedras...

413
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,193
How dare you heat me up
for the sole purpose

414
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,299
of selling
some shitty old gun?

415
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,696
We won't be in Tres Piedras
more than a couple of hours.

416
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,236
Oh, I ain't going.

417
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:49,499
Ride in.

418
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,235
We do the deal.

419
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,537
Then we ride out.

420
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:55,373
I ain't going.

421
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,741
Well, I gave him my word.

422
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:59,748
Yeah, you gave your word
to Louie Chama.

423
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,913
You gave him your word
before talking to me.

What'd he say?

426
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,199
He wasn't talking to you.

427
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:32,012

Juliette Flowers?

Oh, you're a pretty girl.

432
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,293
Yeah, I know you have,

Didn't say nothin'
about cutting her.

00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,198
He's in a lot of pain.

And this
is my brother Solomon.

Every equinox, we are obligated

511
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:26,462
to this festering parcel
of land,

512
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,326
where we perform

and pathetic whores,

514

There's a vicious,

wretched bones.

523
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,498
He'll expire first.

524
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,829
Then I will pass away.

525
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:10,835
And in those last few moments
before I die...

526
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:15,678
For the first time
in my life,

527
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,646
I shall be alone.

528

Now, I didn't mind killing
the little critters,
