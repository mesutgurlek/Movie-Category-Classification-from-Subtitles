and the girl says,

to tell me a story."

in their throat,

and all of a sudden,

275
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:25,428
at just the most

Why?

277
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,095
She says to the king,

278
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:34,262
“You want to know the end?

279
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,669
“I'll tell you tomorrow

"if you give my sister
one more day."

Now, the townspeople know
that mean, old king

282
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,248
is gonna kill them both
for sure,

283
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,117
but the king, needing
to know the end,

284
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,746
says yes.

285

she was telling?

about her telling it.

Well, the next day,

289
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,926
just as soon as the sister
finishes telling that story,

290
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,870
she starts another one.

291

before the best part.

292

there was this one shed
we wasn't allowed in.

had their jobs...

one for feed... one for tools.

01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,038
There was this one shed
we was told never to go in,

01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:33,742
not to play near it,
not to get curious.

Only thing in there
was a low cot and no windows.

so I'm sure, so sad,

supposed to know for so long.

[Moses breathes deeply]

683
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:07,415
Things could've been different.

684
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,153
But they...

685
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:23,599
And now that it's over...

686
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,432
the truth be told...

687
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,139
I'm heartened.

688
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:39,314
Don't think I'd know
my way home from here...

689
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:51,257
but I'd appreciate if
you showed me the way.

You about finished
with your drink?

693
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,720
Just about.

[Panting]

695
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:45,203
That was strange he showed up
here tooking like a Yankee.

696
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:58,252
Maybe he was free.

697
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,389
Then he came back.

698
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,561
I didn't know people
lock the same way

699

whether they was dead or alive.

He gone...

701
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:24,074
but He don't look so bad,

702
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,780
like he's sleeping, maybe.

703

He look dead.

704
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:42,258
But He look good.

705
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:51,275
You sure you don't want
to dig him another hole?

706
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,471
Ain't time.

go in the same place as them.
