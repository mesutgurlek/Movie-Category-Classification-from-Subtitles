Why do you think they didn't?

93
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:24,398
I think when they saw my condition,

94
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,627
they didn't think of
me as much of a threat.

95

They just took my crutches and
my phone and they left me here.

Hello, Mathias.

105
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,979
[Mathias] I've been wondering who's
been resurrecting the myth of Hector,

106
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:28,671
and I suppose it makes
sense it would be the guy

107
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:31,483
who was basically
responsible for his death.

108
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,551
I do not know what you are talking about.

109
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:34,862
[Mathias] Bullshit.

110
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,489
I know someone's been
picking up Hector's notes.

111
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,534
It looks like you are.

112
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,103
[Mathias] It's been about the only way

113
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:46,999
for me to find out what's
happening on the Res anymore.

114
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:54,381
So, is filling Hector's shoes
your way of atoning for your sins?

115
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,491
I am not here to pick up Hector's notes.

116
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,344
I am here to leave one for him.

117
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,682
This is private.

118
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:06,852
Between you and a ghost? Unh-unh.

119
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,439
As soon as someone started answering
these and breaking the law to do it,

120
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:12,983
this became my business.

121
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,175
You are assuming I am asking
Hector to break the law.

122
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:18,906
No, I'm assuming you're bullshitting me
and that really isn't a letter to Hector.

123
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,600
You don't strike me as one
of those superstitious Indians

124
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,078

125
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:29,374
But you do seem self-righteous enough to
think that you could take Hector's place.

126
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:32,252
You do not honestly believe I
am trying to be the new Hector.

127
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:36,256
The longer you refuse to show
me that letter, the more I do.

128
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:59,113
This new Hector copycat is
making my job even more difficult.

129
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:04,118
It's been hard enough to rebuild trust
after the way Malachi ran this department.

130
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:07,162
Now the people trust this
vigilante more than me.

131
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,123
I'm gonna shut him down.

132
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:13,567
But if he can take care of this first?

133
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:15,253
More power to him.

134
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,833
Whoa.

Yeah?

- I need you to take a statement.
- Okay. Whose?

142
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:45,408
Mine.

143

Saved a man's life.

145
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,541
Travis was the first witness
at the scene of a robbery.

146
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:57,152
One man's dead, and his friend's
at the hospital being checked out.

147
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,948
Ferg, victim's name was Peter Hoyt.

148
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,324
Here's his license plate number.

149
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:05,078
Find out what you can...
address, employer, next of kin.

150
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,245
I'd do it myself,

151
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,516
but I told the survivor I'd give him
a ride home after he's done at the E.R.

152
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,518
Got it.

153
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:17,816
So, uh, do you need me
to swear in or anything?

154
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,596
He all right?

155
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:27,117
[Walt] He's got a few scrapes,
maybe a little dehydrated.

156
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,184
Doctors got some fluids in him.

157
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,121
This guy's been through
a lot worse than that.

158
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,981
Yeah. Even so, he was pretty shaken up.

159
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,458
They, uh, gave him some sedatives.

160
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,276
[Jerry] Ah!

161
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:38,753
[groaning]

162
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,933
[Henry] I feel like I have lost a step.

163
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:11,393
I read that boxing is an
all-around great workout,

164
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,354
but I lack the discipline
to train on my own.

165
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:18,192
[Jack] You're in luck. I'm
running a midlife-crisis special.

166
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:23,215
For 100 bucks a month, I'll turn you
into the best over-40 boxer on the Res,

167
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,341
present company excepted.

168
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:27,994
I'll find you some gloves.

169
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,512
Here. Tape up.

170
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:37,145
So, Jack, maybe you can
help me settle a bet.

171
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,940
My friend and I were watching
a Burt Reynolds movie.

172
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:44,844
Burt popped a guy in the
mouth and knocked out a tooth.

173
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,406
My friend said that could not
happen. I disagreed. Who is right?

174
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:51,868
Depends on how bad the teeth
are and how good the punch.

175
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,104
Is there any particular technique,

176
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,582
any part of the mouth that
is especially vulnerable?

177
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,294
After you warm up, I'll show you.

178
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:02,087
[Walt] Henry.

179
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,381
What are you doing here?

180
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:06,699
Looking for you.

181
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,994
Hey, Sheriff, do me a favor. Warm him up.

182
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:12,347
I've got some things to
take care of in my office.

183
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,016
[chuckles]

184
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,627
Yeah. That sounds like the
Peter Hoyt I'm talking about.

185
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:20,796
Sure. I'll hold.

186
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:21,922
I still can't get over it.

187
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,924
You know, the guy, he can't walk,

188
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:26,361
and he dragged himself almost
three miles just to get help.

189
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:29,114
- I mean, most people would have quit.
- Okay, focus, Travis.

190
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,932
Right. Uh, sorry.

191
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,202
Is that Peter Hoyt's blood on you?

192
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,705
Wow. Um...

193
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,108
Yeah, I-I guess, uh...

194
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:45,630
I guess that's from when the sheriff and
I were moving his body over to the Bronco.

195
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,658
It could also be Jerry's because
I-I carried him over to my car.

196
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,679
He was pretty bloody, too.

197
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,350
You ever get used to it?

198
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,811
Dead bodies and all that?

199
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,816
After a few years, sure.

200
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,234
Don't listen to him, Travis.

201
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:12,157
If death stops getting
to you, you should quit.

202
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,078
[sighs]

203
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,294
So, what is the latest with the
case against those men who raped Gab?

204
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,903
There is no case.

205
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:29,424
Victim won't file charges
or talk, so nothing I can do.

206
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,994
Not to mention, I got a
mugging and a murder last night,

207
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,471
someone leaving that casino, so...

208
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:36,806
Is that why you are here?

209
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,334
No.

210
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,296
Actually, I had a very
strange dream last night.

211
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:44,731
Felt like it meant something.

212
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:48,026
[grunts] I am not much of a Freudian.

213
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:53,990
Well, I was looking for a more
traditional interpretation.

214
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:56,368
Didn't your grandmother
do a lot of that stuff?

215
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,703
What kind of dream was it?

216
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:02,832
I was looking for a shirt.

217
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:07,903
Were there any spirit
animals in your dream?

218
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:09,256
An owl? A wolf?

219
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,343
- Nope.
- One of your ancestors?

220
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:16,596
Nope.

221
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:19,724
Well, then I cannot help you.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

222
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,979
What happened to your nose?

223
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:28,132
Started bleeding.

224
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,468
So, what'd we find out
about our shooting victim?

225
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,804
Well, turns out the deceased, Peter Hoyt,

226
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,366
was just released from
prison a couple weeks ago.

227
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,392
Right.

228
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,644
So, what was he in for?

229
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:43,831
[Ferg] Assault in Sheridan eight years ago.

230
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,917
Served eight years?

231
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,279
That's just two years shy of
the max. Must have been serious.

232
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,215
Find any next of kin?

233
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,284
His parents live in Ranchwood.

234
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,804
The car's actually registered to them.

235
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,767
Well, someone needs to notify them.

236
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,836
I should probably head to Sheridan,

237
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:09,732
see if I can find any details about that
assault, might shine a light on this.

238
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,736
Um, I could go and see his parents.

239
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,203
Why don't you take the Charger?

240
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,374
It's no good doing a
notification in a Trans Am.

241
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:33,840
[door closes]

242
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:36,634
- [indistinct conversations]
- [telephone ringing]

243
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,351
Excuse me.

244
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,020
- Is Dr. Monaghan available?
- Do you have an appointment?

245
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,688
- No.
- Then no.

246
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:52,317
You need to call and make an
appointment. Unless it's an emergency.

247
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,111
Is it an emergency?

248
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,873
[Walt] Don't worry. It's not bad. Um...

249
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:13,963
I was in Sheridan on business, and,
um, I just dropped by to apologize.

250
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:15,756
Oh.

251
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:17,758
For what?

252
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:20,178
Accusing me of drug trafficking?

253
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,515
I guess that about sums it up, yeah.

254
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:25,641
Okay, well, let's hear it, then.

255
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:28,603
What?

256
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,690
Your apology for accusing
me of drug trafficking.

257
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,569
Didn't I just do that?

258
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,655
Is it hard for you to admit you're wrong?

259
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,618
Isn't it hard for everybody?

260
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,877
So [clears throat] I'm sorry that
I accused you of drug trafficking.

261
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:56,780
It's just, you know, there were
stolen drugs at your church meeting,

262
00:17:56,781 --> 00:18:02,720
same drugs that I saw here, and, uh,
well, you can see how that looked.

263
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,475
So, you're sorry but not really.

264
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,709
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,937
Completely.

266
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:15,816
You didn't deserve that, especially
given all the good you do.

267
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:21,030
Okay. Thank you, Sheriff.

268
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,912
[sighs]

269
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,378
Do you want an apology
receipt or something?

270
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,402
[alarm chirps]

271
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:04,031
[knock on door]

272
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:07,118
Mr. Hoyt?

273
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,453
Yeah? What do you want?

274
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,455
I need to talk to you
about your son, Peter.

275
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:12,398
Can you guys just leave
him alone, all right?

276
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:13,500
He's done his time.

277
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,168
It's... It's not it, sir.

278
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,528
He's not here. He went to visit his friend.

279
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,255
I don't know when he'll be back.

280
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,298
Sir.

281
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:24,093
Peter's not coming back.

282
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,099
Your son and his friend
were robbed last night,

283
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:35,962
and during the course of the
robbery, your son, Peter, he was shot.

284
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,482
[Thomas] Oh, God.

285
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,819
What about Jerry? Is Jerry okay?

286
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,722
Uh, Jerry's alive.

287
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,225
[sighs] Thank God.

288
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,328
Thank God.

289
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:55,982
So, I-I guess... I guess you know Jerry?

290
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:56,959
[Thomas] Oh, I do.

291
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,672
Jerry was our family's friend.

292
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:03,633
Maybe the best we've ever
had. You're sure he's okay?

293
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:07,803
I-I gather that he's a little shaken up.

294
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,931
But, yeah, he's... He's okay.

295
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:18,838
Uh, sir, I, uh... I know
that this is a shock.

296
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,652
Um, but I need you to understand.

297
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:26,989
Your son, Peter, he's dead.

298
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,308
[Thomas] Yeah, I know.

299
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,767
[liquid pouring]

300
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:35,623
Oh, it's just... You sound
more concerned about his friend.

301
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:41,045
It's terrible to say, but, um...

302
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,881
I think you're right.

303
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,260
Pete was in prison. He became a stranger.

304
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:50,954
Jerry was here... with us.

305
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,581
He lifted up our spirits.

306
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:56,770
He moved heaven and earth
to get Pete out of prison.

307
00:20:56,836 --> 00:21:00,022
That was just a couple weeks ago?

308
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,108
His fourth parole hearing.

309
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:07,346
And, uh, I-I don't think
Pete would have survived

310
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,348
if they'd made him serve his full sentence,

311
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:13,059
so thanks to Jerry...

312
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,564
he got to enjoy a little
bit of freedom before...

313
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:19,459
before he died.

314
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:31,328
[Schones] Peter Hoyt,
aggravated assault, 2007.

315
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,872
He entered a sporting
goods store with a .45

316
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,142
and told the manager to
hand over all the cash.

317
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:40,271
Got about 750 bucks, then he
shot the manager in the gut.

318
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:44,049
Then Hoyt shot him again... in the back.

319
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,385
- So a thief and a coward.
- Yep.

320
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:49,722
And the only thing that kept him
from being a cold-blooded murderer

321
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,741
is that the clerk somehow survived.

322
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,828
- Accomplices?
- Uh...

323
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:56,102
Nope.

324
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:59,332
He was just one of those guys who gets
a gun and feels like he ought to use it.

325
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,584
Anything unusual about the victim?

326
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:04,903
Besides the fact that
he survived two bullets?

327
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,088
No.

328
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:10,217
Working stiff, married, no kids.

329
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,638
What's his name?

330
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:16,516
Um... Jerry Napek.

331
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,576
[knock on door]

332
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:38,371
Hey. Can I come in?

333
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:40,874
I was just about to leave.

334
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,917
I can't keep doing this.

335
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,002
Doing what?

336
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,779
Waiting tables.

337
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,740
Waiting for the next
six-figure job to just show up,

338
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:52,909
Waiting for my life to
suddenly kick into gear.

339
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,222
I need to do something with my life.

340
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:58,432
How can I help?

341
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:01,668
Okay.

342
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:05,213
There's basically two
legal practices in Durant.

343
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:07,507
One of them doesn't need me,
and the other one hates me,

344
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:09,569
so I was thinking about the Res.

345
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,070
What about the Res?

346
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,888
I-I think I could do
really good work there.

347
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:16,325
I mean, I could help people like Gab.

348
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,226
And I was hoping that
you would introduce me

349
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:20,496
to whoever provides
legal services to the Res.

350
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,356
Henry, I don't care about the money.

351
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:25,084
I'll volunteer my time.

352
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:30,924
But at least then I'd be
doing something... important.

353
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,888
Do not waste your time.

354
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:39,790
The people do not trust
lawyers from the outside.

355
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,476
And anytime a well-intentioned
activist shows up,

356
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,127
it usually takes less than six months

357
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,105
for them to learn there
is nothing they can do.

358
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:51,110
- Henry, I'm willing to try.
- That is your choice.

359
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:55,848
But you and I have both seen how
the legal system serves the Res.

360
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:57,599
And I cannot in good conscience

361
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,370
encourage you to throw your life away
tilting at that particular windmill.

362
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,039
[scoffs]

363
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,887
[indistinct conversations]

364
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,267
[Jerry] Oh, hey, Sheriff.

365
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,436
Welcome to the Taj Mahal.

366
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:27,271
How are you, Jerry?

367
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:29,607
Well, I can't feel my legs.

368
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,693
Come on back.

369
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:41,393
So, I understand your friendship with
Peter Hoyt was a little complicated.

370
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,537
Oh. That.

371
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:45,980
Yeah. That.

372
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:51,570
So, you want to know how I could be
friends with a man who shot me twice,

373
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:56,216
permanently destroyed my digestive
system, and took away the use of my legs.

374
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:57,826
I do.

375
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,595
I had no choice.

376
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:01,663
I know that sounds crazy,

377
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:07,961
but you got to understand... I know
what it's like to live the other way.

378
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:12,340
During Pete's trial and
about three years after that,

379
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:16,970
I was so consumed with hate for him,

380
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,740
I didn't have room for
anything else in my life.

381
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:23,285
I lost my wife. I lost my job.

382
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:27,564
You know what it's like when
the only thing you can think of

383
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:30,442
from the second you wake up in the morning

384
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:35,381
until you medicate yourself
to sleep at night is hate?

385
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:38,342
I can imagine.

386
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:39,719
I don't think you can.

387
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,804
It's hell.

388
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:46,249
I would have killed myself if
I hadn't met Father Donahue.

389
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,977
He taught me about forgiveness.

390
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:52,839
He just made me understand that
as long as I hated Pete Hoyt,

391
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,317
he had control of my life

392
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:58,696
and that forgiving him wasn't weakness.

393
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:02,742
It was a gift I was giving to myself.

394
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,978
And when I stopped spending
all my time hating him,

395
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,748
I had time to focus on some other things,

396
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:13,669
like getting out of
this chair, like living.

397
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:21,534
So you advocated for his
release at his parole hearing?

398
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:22,762
I did.

399
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:26,933
He made a mistake, and he paid for it.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,978
Keeping him in prison wasn't doing
anything but keeping me from moving on.

401
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:35,691
Forgiveness can set
everybody free, Sheriff.

402
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:39,862
Well, it takes a big man to think that way.

403
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,973
Well, it doesn't happen overnight.

404
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:47,912
But when it does, it opens up
a whole world of possibilities.

405
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:54,919
I just wish that Pete had, um...
had more time to experience that.

406
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,048
Well, I'm sure he was grateful
for the time you got him.

407
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:03,260
You think?

408
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:04,804
I do.

409
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:11,268
Sheriff, can I ask you a
favor? And you can say no.

410
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:12,895
Go ahead.

411
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:17,298
I see people put these memorials
out by the side of the road,

412
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:21,302
and, uh, I made this for Pete.

413
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:24,389
And I was wondering if maybe
you had some time this week

414
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,310
that maybe you could drive
me out to where it happened

415
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:33,082
and I could, uh... I
could put this up for him.

416
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:36,710
I can do that.

417
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,091
You call Ruby at the
station. We'll set it up.

418
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:47,746
What the hell do you want?

419
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:51,041
Well, I was gonna offer my help,
but not if you're gonna yell at me.

420
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:51,976
Wait.

421
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,461
Sorry.

422
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:56,396
What?

423
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:58,774
The boss in?

424
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,653
This is not an isolated incident.

425
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,738
I've had three in the last two weeks.

426
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:06,723
How do you know they're related?

427
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:09,827
I don't, but it seems like
it's worth checking out.

428
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,270
Three people win big at the casino,

429
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:15,374
then as they're driving off,
they get pulled over and robbed.

430
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,984
- Anybody die?
- [Mathias] No.

431
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:20,796
All the victims describe
the attacks the same way?

432
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:23,115
Only one victim has come forward.

433
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:25,408
So, how do you know that
there are three crimes?

434
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,927
Well, that's a long story.

435
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,345
It's also not an answer.

436
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:30,139
Afraid it'll have to be.

437
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:34,751
Look, I'm trying to help you guys out.

438
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:38,856
We close your case, I close three of mine.

439
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,566
Except you only have one.

440
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:47,406
Sue Smart, last Thursday night.

441
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:51,952
Terry Thurlow, the Saturday
before that at 2:00 a.m.

442
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,915
And Joe Lone Elk, not sure
what day, but before dawn.

443
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:04,339
So, why do you need my help?

444
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,701
Because I'm having a harder and harder time

445
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:11,430
getting people to take
me seriously on the Res.

446
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:15,517
And you have a murder. People
pay attention to a murder.

447
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:22,566
Our surviving victim
was pretty traumatized.

448
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:25,152
Maybe these folks
remember some more details.

449
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,999
Maybe you and I ought to do this together.

450
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,512
Lone Elk.

451
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,017
I want to talk to you about what happened

452
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,603
when you were leaving
the casino a while back.

453
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,171
Yeah? What happened?

454
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:05,776
You went to the casino, and you won a
few hundred bucks, and you got mugged.

455
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,029
Well, the Lord giveth, Lord taketh away.

456
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:12,908
Wasn't the Lord, though, who ran you
off the road and robbed you at gunpoint.

457
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,935
How you know about that?

458
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,812
[Walt] Why don't you tell us what happened?

459
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,373
Why? You seem to know it all.

460
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,835
Not yet. How many of them were there?

461
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:26,172
Two.

462
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,299
- Can you describe them?
- Nope.

463
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:30,634
You didn't see them, or you
don't want to describe them?

464
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:33,220
Look, it happened. It's done.

465
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,183
Way I see it, I was being punished
for trying to take a shortcut.

466
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,667
What kind of shortcut?

467
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:41,002
Took out a loan at the casino.

468
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:43,981
Instead of working to try to
pay it back, I played craps.

469
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,525
What do you mean, you took
a loan out at the casino?

470
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,235
Exactly that.

471
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,363
It's easier than the
bank. There's no paperwork.

472
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:52,222
How big a loan?

473
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:53,657
$500.

474
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:56,369
Won it all back that night, too.

475
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:59,062
I should have paid off
that loan right away.

476
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:01,374
I should have known it
was too good to be true.

477
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,502
I'm not supposed to be
gambling. I'm in a program.

478
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,463
I was meant to work for that
money, which is what I'm doing now.

479
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,342
Hear you get $3 or $4
a pound for good copper.

480
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:20,458
[rock music playing]

481
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,043
Really?

482
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:23,687
That's interesting.

483
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:28,067
Okay, I will, um...

484
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:31,653
I will ask Ms. Smart about that when
I finally get a chance to talk to her.

485
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,097
- Okay. Bye.
- Wait. Come on. Please?

486
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:35,657
Sit down.

487
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:37,451
Hey, I could use the company.

488
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,894
I'm still a little freaked out
about what happened earlier.

489
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,372
I've never seen a dead guy before.

490
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:44,791
Please?

491
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:52,925
So, what's going on with my case?

492
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:55,386
I mean, have we found the
guy who killed Peter Hoyt yet?

493
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:59,348
Uh, no, we didn't catch anybody yet.

494
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:00,706
Well, what do you think, then?

495
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:02,875
I mean, do you think that
it was just a random thing,

496
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,878
- or did he actually know the guy?
- We don't know shit, Travis.

497
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:07,880
Only that it's probably
not an isolated incident

498
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:11,068
and that it most likely has something
to do with the casino and loan-sharking.

499
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:13,427
Wait. Loan-sharking?

500
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:15,948
You're saying there's loan
sharks here in Absaroka?

501
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:18,141
I guess. Walt just
interviewed one of the victims,

502
00:32:18,142 --> 00:32:20,077
and he said he took a
loan out at the casino.

503
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,939
Look, I am really tired,

504
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,669
and I have to interview a witness at
the crack of dawn, so I am gonna go home.

505
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:32,506
You know what? I should probably
go, too. I'll walk you out.

506
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:35,842
Please... don't.

507
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:48,921
Shit.

508
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:50,382
[Ferg whistles]

509
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:52,008
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

510
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,009
- How are you?
- Good.

511
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,362
- You want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

512
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,617
[Ferg whistles]

513
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:11,277
So, Sue Smart took out a
loan at the casino, too.

514
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:12,570
She say who she dealt with?

515

[knock on door]

516
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:17,658
Well, maybe Ferg will have more luck. Okay.

517
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:19,052
Thanks, Vic.

518
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:21,721
You're here early.

519
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:25,375
Yep. I guess I am.

520
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:27,102
There's a lot going on.

521
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:30,171
Murder and serial muggings, so...

522
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:32,065
[Ruby] Don't lie to me, Walter.

523
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:34,026
I know you slept here last night.

524
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,344
And the night before that.

525
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,553
Well, I never said I didn't.

526
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:40,890
And I know everything that's
going on in this office.

527
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,767
I know that. [clears throat]

528
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:46,121
So, I know you were using
my computer last night.

529
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,124
Well, actually, it's the
department's computer.

530
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,668
And you were Googling a
Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan.

531
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:55,172
- I was just doing some follow-up...
- No, you were doing an image search.

532
00:33:56,449 --> 00:34:00,410
Walter Longmire, what do
you think Martha would say

533
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,971
if she could look down
and see you right now?

534
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:07,809
She'd say, "I'm bored."

535

Sleeping in a jail cell,
brooding, never cracking a smile.

536
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:16,109
- I smile.
- If you like her, ask her out.

537
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,575
I won't tell anyone.

538
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,549
- [door closes]
- [Travis] Good morning!

539
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:39,865
What do you want, Travis?

540
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:42,094
Uh, I need to have a little
confab with the sheriff.

541
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:45,413
- Here I am.
- Hey, can we have a little bit of privacy?

542
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,540
[Walt] Nope. What is it?

543
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:52,605
Well, thought you might like to know
that you now have someone on the inside.

544
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:53,813
Inside of what?

545
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,065
The casino.

546
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,467
Well, I heard that you thought
that the Peter Hoyt murder

547
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:59,385
might have something to
do with loan-sharking,

548
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:02,822
so I, uh... I went down to the
casino and I took out a loan.

549
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:08,537
Who told you that the Peter Hoyt murder
had anything to do with loan-sharking?

550
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:11,123
I don't know that that's really
all that important right now.

551
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,334
I may have, uh, inadvertently
mentioned something.

552
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,967
Okay, Serpico. Tell me about your loan.

553
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:27,830
All right, so, I let it slip at the craps
table that I could really use a loan.

554
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,600
Around 3:00 a.m., this dude approaches me

555
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,126
and tells me he can put me
in contact with somebody.

556
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,564
Tells me to go to the second-floor men's
room, uh, third stall from the left,

557
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,941
and that my contact would
occupy the second stall.

558
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,569
You took out a loan in the men's restroom?

559
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:45,073
Yeah. $1,200 at, uh, 20% due next week.

560
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,866
20% in a week?

561
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:49,869
I know. Can you believe that
people actually fall for that crap?

562
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:52,289
- Well, you did.
- [Travis] No, I didn't.

563
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:53,624
I'm working as an informant.

564
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,959
Could you I.D. the man
that gave you the loan?

565
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:58,611
Well, um, see, our
transaction was stall to stall,

566
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:00,363
so I didn't see his face in the bathroom.

567
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,342
Did you get a name or a nickname, anything?

568
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:04,534
Not at that moment, but...

569
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:09,288
So, the information that you dug
up is that you can get a bad loan?

570
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:14,186
Look, I said I didn't see his face
in the bathroom, but I saw his boots.

571
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:16,712
They were ostrich, blue.

572
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:18,398
I mean, they made a statement.

573
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,859
And I recognized them from
earlier at the craps table.

574
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:25,572
They belong to this big Indian dude,
guy named, uh, Darren or... or Julius.

575
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:28,283
- Was it Darius?
- Yes. Darius.

576
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,618
Scary-looking dude.

577
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:32,978
So, um, how do I go
about getting reimbursed?

578
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:35,314
Do I talk to Ruby or what?

579
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:38,293
Why don't you just return
the money that you borrowed?

580
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,298
Look, I had to sell my
cover, so I, uh... I spent it.

581
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:46,009
What the hell did you spend $1,200 on?

582
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:48,094
Craps.

583
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,484
[Cady] Hi.

584
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,027
My name is Cady L...

585
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:07,531
Cady. Is Mathias here?

586
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,455
Some white girl to see you.

587
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,400
[Mathias] Let me see if I understand.

588
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:23,630
You want to help me clear
my case backlog for free.

589
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:27,199
I want to provide legal services to
people who otherwise wouldn't get them,

590
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,886
whether they need a
prosecutor or a defender.

591
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:31,179
For free?

592
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:33,766
Well, I'm... I'm not looking to get rich.

593
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:35,934
Then you've come to the right place.

594
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,297
Look, I'm trained as a
lawyer, and I'm tending bar.

595
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,775
And even if I weren't,

596
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:46,027
the more I learn about most law,
the more I realize it's not for me.

597
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:50,014
But the Gabriella Langton rape showed me
a way in which I could use my education

598
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:52,033
that won't make me hate myself.

599
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,122
You Longmires are a strange lot.

600
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:01,835
These are cases we forwarded to the feds

601
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:07,716
and that they declined to pursue,
either for lack of funds...

602
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:10,009
lack of evidence...

603
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:13,764
or just plain lack of interest.

604
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,890
You can have them for an hour.

605
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:18,226
Make copies, bring them back.

606
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:23,631
Thank you.

607
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:28,153
I should take a picture right now
and write "before" underneath it.

608
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:40,314
[Walt] It was right here.

609
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:42,751
[Jerry] Well, how can you
tell? There's no landmarks.

610
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,670
Sure there are.

611
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:46,987
See that bird's nest?

612
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:48,882
You want to mark the exact spot?

613
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:58,725
So, Jerry, you said you
were robbed by two men.

614
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,710
Could one of them have been Cheyenne?

615
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:02,020
[Jerry] I don't know.

616
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:03,980
Maybe.

617
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:07,425
Were they big men? Small?

618
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,110
Oh, big.

619
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:12,656
And one of them might have had long hair.

620
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:16,910
Did you or Peter take
out a loan at the casino?

621
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:17,976
I didn't.

622
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:20,747
What about Peter? Were you
two together the whole time?

623
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:23,249
Yeah, except when he went to the bathroom.

624
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:29,196
There's some other folks, also got mugged.

625
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:30,716
They gave us some details.

626
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,803
Could this man have been
one of your attackers?

627
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:39,015
Could be.

628
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:00,746
Can I help you?

629
00:40:02,063 --> 00:40:06,376
Do you have any pliers that are
a little more delicate than this?

630
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,152
Don't want your pliers too delicate.

631
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,154
Those there are guaranteed for 25 years.

632
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:13,258
Yes, but I need something
narrower to work in small spaces.

633
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:14,593
I may have some in the back.

634
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,429
[cell phone rings]

635
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:21,915
- Hello?
- [Ruby] Hi, Henry.

636
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,602
I'm putting Walt through.

637
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:26,044
Go ahead, Walt.

638
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:27,981
[Walt] Henry, I need to find someone.

639
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:29,983
Who?

640
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:33,361
Darius Burns, uh, Malachi's thug.

641
00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:36,573
Remember I told you I
have this robbery homicide?

642
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,184
Well, I just found out that
Joe Lone Elk was robbed, too.

643
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:42,936
He took out a loan from the
casino before he got mugged.

644
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:44,563
Turns out he got the cash from Darius,

645
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:48,609
and now Darius has been tentatively I.D.'d
as one of the gunmen by another victim,

646
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,964
so... any idea where I might find Darius?

647
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,507
As a matter of fact, yes.
My office at the Red Pony.

648
00:40:57,076 --> 00:40:58,553
Is he there right now?

649
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,414
I cannot say for sure. The door is closed.

650
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,893
But he is usually around
at this time of day.

651
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,896
Thanks, Henry. I'll see you in a few.

652
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,442
Sir?

653
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:25,622
I think these will do.

654
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,903
[Ferg] So, you can't describe
anything about them at all?

655
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,297
No, I didn't get a look at either of them.

656
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:39,845
Look, if you hear anything
else, do not hesitate to call.

657
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:41,220
[slots chiming]

658
00:41:52,257 --> 00:41:55,259
All righty, here we go. 3 on 13.

659
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,320
Not a problem there, boss man.

660
00:41:57,387 --> 00:41:59,638
22. Not a problem.

661
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,574
Here we go, guys. Here we go.

662
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:03,409
Red 30. Wise choice, boss.

663
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,787
All righty, no more
bets, guys. No more bets.

664
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:06,997
[Monte] Ferguson.

665
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:10,524
Monte.

666
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:11,793
What are you doing here?

667
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,528
I was checking out the new casino.
Got a little time on my hands.

668
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:15,446
What about you?

669
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,574
You guys still got two deputies
patrolling the whole county?

670
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,743
Uh, well, three.

671
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,596
Yeah, uh, Walt ended up
hiring Zachary Heflin.

672
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:24,747
Unbelievable.

673
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:27,458
He told Zachary and me both
he wasn't hiring either of us.

674
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:32,188
Is that usually, uh... [chuckles]
a part of his M.O., lying?

675
00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:33,732
Just probably a misunderstanding.

676
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,568
I was there. Clear as a bell.

677
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,153
Usually play those kind of head games?

678
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,700
Look, uh, the sheriff,
he's a secretive guy.

679
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:48,395
He doesn't always tell you what
he's thinking or doing or even why.

680
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:51,666
But, uh, he's a good man.

681
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:53,710
Really?

682
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,005
- [man] Black 26!
- [crowd groans]

683
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,177
I'm gonna get out your
hair. I'm bad luck for you.

684
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:08,808
[rock music playing]

685
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:19,193
Please make it fast, Sheriff.

686
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,930
Where were you two nights ago?

687
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:24,473
What time?

688
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:26,159
Between midnight and 3:00 a.m.

689
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:27,660
At the casino.

690
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:29,287
You didn't leave at any point?

691
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:31,039
Nope.

692
00:43:31,982 --> 00:43:34,191
You loan anybody money recently?

693
00:43:34,192 --> 00:43:35,501
No.

694
00:43:35,568 --> 00:43:39,422
So you're not loaning money at high
rates out of the casino bathroom?

695
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:45,137
No. That sounds both
illegal and unsanitary.

696
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:46,954
I have witnesses that say different.

697
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:50,391
[Darius] About my alibi or
about the bathroom loans?

698
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,186
Both.

699
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:56,815
Did they describe me?

700
00:43:57,423 --> 00:43:58,566
Yep.

701
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:04,948
Dark skin, long hair, scary-looking,
talked in an Indian accent?

702
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:06,849
Here's what they said.

703
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,852
They owed you money from illegal loans.

704
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:12,855
They won it back at the
casino on the way out.

705
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:17,275
They got mugged, probably by you
or one of Malachi's other guys.

706
00:44:17,276 --> 00:44:21,255
So, you got your money back, and
they still think they owe you.

707
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:23,240
And I'm guessing you
raised the interest rates

708
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,051
when they didn't make the payments on time.

709
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:26,785
"Guessing"?

710
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:28,304
Am I under arrest for something?

711
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,102
Then don't let the door hit you in the ass.

712
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,146
[Ferg] The sheriff, he's a secretive guy.

713
00:44:54,147 --> 00:45:00,753
He doesn't always tell you what
he's thinking or doing or why.

714
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,172
[clears throat]

715
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:47,133
Well, this is a funny coincidence.

716
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,596
Well, I knew that you, uh, had
your group, uh, today, so I, um...

717
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:55,516
All right, Sheriff. What is this, hmm?

718
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:59,544
I assume you have a reason for
tracking me down twice in two days,

719
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:02,481
but you seem to not
want to share it with me.

720
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:05,568
Well, earlier I was apologizing.

721
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:09,655
No. You weren't.

722
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:11,365
No, I was.

723
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:13,534
I wasn't. Uh...

724
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,078
I guess I, um...

725
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:21,667
I-I guess I really, um,
didn't, um... didn't, um...

726
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,615
I mean, I did, um, somewhere
in the back of, um, my mind.

727
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:31,910
But I, uh, was, um...

728
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:33,578
It's been a long time.

729
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:34,889
I'd, uh...

730
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:38,458
I just feel we got off on
the wrong foot, obviously.

731
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:41,128
Um, I was hoping you
would forget about that,

732
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:46,276
and, uh, I'd like to ask you if
you'd like to go for dinner with me.

733
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,553
There. I said it. [chuckles]

734
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:52,573
I mean, sometime soon.

735
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:57,245
My God, that was excruciating.

736
00:46:57,311 --> 00:46:58,937
Yeah. Tell me about it.

737
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:01,791
It was like watching you pass
a kidney stone or something.

738
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:04,252
It's been a very long time for me.

739
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:08,030
What do you say?

740
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,924
[clears throat] Well, I, um...

741
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,328
Well, I, um...

742
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,473
I think I'm gonna pass.

743
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,128
Oh.

744
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,858
Look, I know, um... I
know you must be mad at me.

745
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:28,609
No, no, no, that's not it. That's not it.

746
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:30,886
I know that you were just
trying to do your job, okay?

747
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:33,264
But, you know, I just... I-I spend...

748
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:38,227
I spend all day trying to convince
manly men like yourself that...

749
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:40,562
that, you know, they should
deal with their emotions,

750
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:46,460
and I just don't want to do
the same thing on my free time.

751
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:48,129
So...

752
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,174
But that was very sweet.

753
00:47:57,663 --> 00:47:59,391

[telephone ringing]

756
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:38,763
Hello?

757
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,498
The man who was mugged, you
said it was Joe Lone Elk?

758
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:43,083
[Walt] Yeah. Why?

759
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:45,144
'Cause he just walked into my office...

760
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:50,174
my former office... with Darius.

761
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,567
And he looked scared.

762
00:48:51,634 --> 00:48:54,636
Darius claims to have an alibi
for the time of the mugging.

763
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,114
Not that I believe him.

764
00:48:56,973 --> 00:49:00,659
There is someone else with
him... a man named Lane Potter.

765
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,329
He is not a very good person.

766
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:06,815
How do you know him?

767
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:09,543
[Henry] Only by reputation.

768
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,947
But the fact that he is friends with
Darius confirms what I have heard.

769
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:16,717
You think this Lane
Potter works for Darius?

770
00:49:16,784 --> 00:49:18,511
It certainly looks that way.

771
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:20,138
Thanks, Henry.

772
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,940
[Travis] Mom! Door!

773
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:37,304
- Well, look who's here.
- Ms. Murphy, I was, uh, wondering...

774
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:40,492
I'm surprised you have the nerve
to show your face at this house.

775
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:43,935
Do you have any idea how hard Travis worked

776
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:47,623
to get ready for your job
interview, how much it meant to him?

777
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,417
And you wouldn't even give him a chance.

778
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:52,819
- I appreciate your son's passion...
- Oh, you most certainly do not.

779
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,964
[Travis] Mom! Who is it?

780
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:57,509
[Mary Jo] Sheriff High Horse.

781
00:49:57,575 --> 00:49:59,034
[chuckles] Let him in.

782
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:02,555
Why? So he can come here
and trample your dreams?

783
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:04,581
Mom! Please!

784
00:50:04,582 --> 00:50:06,518
I'm sorry about that, Sheriff.

785
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:08,835
My mom can be, uh, a little overprotective.

786
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:10,396
There you go.

[police radio chatter]

So, uh, what's up?

00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:21,056
I just need to, um, clarify a few
things about your, uh... your notes.

Yeah, absolutely.

You wrote 12:22.

Is that the time you encountered, uh,
Jerry, or was that when he was attacked?

793
00:50:27,646 --> 00:50:30,065
Uh...

Maybe. Uh...

It says "car."

799
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:45,390
Did Jerry give a description of
the car that ran him off the road?

00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,393
Maybe?

Come on, Travis.

00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:58,218
Now I got a new suspect,
man named Lane Potter.

He drives a blue Honda.

804
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:03,282
Is there any chance that you
and Jerry talked about the car?

805
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:07,894
Okay. I remember now. Car.

806
00:51:07,895 --> 00:51:12,291
Um, he was just saying that it wasn't
the car that drove him off the road.

807
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:16,421
Well, that's what... He
wasn't talking about that car.

808
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,631
Okay. What was it?

809
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:22,075
Well, Jerry was saying that he wishes that
he'd have driven his own car that night,

810
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,453
that things might have turned
out a little bit differently

up having to drive him home.

No. You don't.

And after what happened with Gab,

That's why I was trying to do something.

832

So, what happens with a case like
Gab's when the victim will not testify?

Oh. Hey, Sheriff. I
didn't hear you drive up.

852
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,929
I parked up the road a bit.

Oh.

859
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:29,173
Anyway, I got to thinking that this
cross was a little too close to the road.

860
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,676
I was afraid somebody might knock it down.

I'm thinking I'm gonna
build a little grotto here

up, that's gonna be beautiful.

Can you hand me that cross there?

Why'd you lie to me, Jerry?

866

Why'd you say you needed a ride out here?

867
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:53,698
You got a car.

868
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:00,562
Those hand controls...

00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:01,854

Push down to brake, pull back
towards you to accelerate.

871

I just got it out of the shop.

872

You got a receipt for that work?

873

Your car wasn't in the shop.

You needed me... Not to drive you, to
show you where the shooting happened.

- No.

And when he came around to the

I shot him... right in the face.

For this?

until I erased him from this earth.

And then I got to thinking

that that $3,000 would come
in handy for my medical bills.

01:02:02,883 --> 01:02:05,468
I don't own a cell phone.

951
01:02:05,469 --> 01:02:07,196
[Donna] Really?

952
01:02:07,262 --> 01:02:08,655
Oh.

953
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:15,954
All right, well, if this isn't
an emergency, then what is this?

954
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:21,525
Well, I was just out for a walk.
Um, I was doing some thinking.

955
01:02:21,526 --> 01:02:25,839
I wanted to talk, so I
had Ruby call you for me.

956
01:02:27,324 --> 01:02:32,137
I see. Well, that's
very high school of you.

957
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:34,622
Tell you what, if you want to talk,

958
01:02:34,623 --> 01:02:37,559
why don't you try calling
and making an appointment?

959
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:42,689
I killed a man.

960
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:50,948
When?

961
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,617
Couple of months ago.

962
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,291
You ever read John Donne?

963
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:22,437
Mm-hmm. In college.

964
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:29,343
I remember a poem about a flea,
but it was really about sex.

965
01:03:29,344 --> 01:03:30,737
Different poem.

966
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:39,830
"Every man's death diminishes
me For I am involved in Mankind"

967
01:03:41,314 --> 01:03:43,458
It always made sense to me.

968
01:03:44,235 --> 01:03:45,752
Till a couple of months ago.

969
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:52,009
What was his name?

970
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:55,179
Barlow.

971
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:57,389
I shot him.

972
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:00,684
Twice.

973
01:04:01,793 --> 01:04:04,254
But his death didn't diminish me.

974
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:08,483
It... lifted a weight off of me.

975
01:04:11,553 --> 01:04:13,738
And you feel guilty about that?

976
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:18,576
Well, I feel guilty
about not feeling guilty.

977
01:04:24,357 --> 01:04:26,710
Why are you talking about this now?

978
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:33,967
I just met this guy who did something
wrong for understandable reasons, and...

979
01:04:34,034 --> 01:04:36,094
he has no regrets.

980
01:04:36,828 --> 01:04:38,055
None.

981
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:41,392
I wish I could feel that way.

982
01:04:49,007 --> 01:04:51,217
Did you do something wrong?

983
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:52,802
No.

984
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:54,029
No.

985
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,199
Man I killed deserved it.

986
01:04:58,475 --> 01:05:03,663
I feel better now he's
gone, lighter, more at ease.

987
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:09,002
This is you at ease?

988
01:05:09,069 --> 01:05:10,987
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

989
01:05:10,988 --> 01:05:12,714
This is me at ease.

990
01:05:14,116 --> 01:05:17,010
I even have dreams from time to time now.

991
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:19,888
Some pretty good ones.

992
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:29,189
So, you feel bad about feeling good, hmm?

993
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:31,566
Isn't that just feeling bad?

994
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:33,360
No, I don't think so.

995
01:05:34,761 --> 01:05:37,680
I think that you have forgiven yourself

996
01:05:37,681 --> 01:05:40,492
for something that you
consider unforgivable.

997
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:44,395
Well, it is unforgivable. To kill
another man, that's never okay.

998
01:05:44,396 --> 01:05:46,457
But you said he deserved it.

999
01:05:47,858 --> 01:05:49,084
He did.

1000
01:05:50,443 --> 01:05:52,504
Did you do anything illegal?

1001
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:56,258
The FBI cleared me, so...

1002
01:06:00,037 --> 01:06:01,472
Well, then.

1003
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:12,483
It feels strange.

1004
01:06:13,925 --> 01:06:15,486
Of course it does.

1005
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:19,239
Forgiveness isn't a natural
thing for most people.

1006
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:25,287
But... I guess you're not most people.

1007
01:06:41,578 --> 01:06:43,638
[engine turns over]

1008
01:06:51,255 --> 01:06:54,525
You were seriously just
gonna let me drive away?

1009
01:06:55,717 --> 01:06:57,902
You have no car.

1010
01:07:31,138 --> 01:07:38,264
