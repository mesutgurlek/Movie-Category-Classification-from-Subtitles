"Remember, he will wear
a large, white mantilla.

You get the idea, boys?

01:32:28,294 --> 01:32:32,094
The bandit's gonna try to escape tonight
in a girl's clothes.

1237
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:45,400
Well, this is empty.

1238
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:49,106
- You have more, eh?
- No, no. No.

1239
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:52,981
I have had... enough.

The job's finished, boys.

1241

I get my man tonight.
Get him alone.

You better let us
go with ya, Sarge.

No, sir.

1244
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:08,831
I've got a particular reason for wanting
to turn this trick all by myself.

1245
01:33:08,934 --> 01:33:12,097
So long, boys.
The old sarge has got a new gal...

1246
01:33:12,204 --> 01:33:14,104
and she's a pippin.

Nah, nah. Didn't I tell ya
he was the best shot in the army?

Oh, well-

1250
01:33:33,492 --> 01:33:37,223
I think it is getting
dangerous for me to stay here.

- I better go. I send for you. Adiós.
- No, no!

You must not go.
You must not.

I will not let you.
I will not let you.

You must stay here tonight.

01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:58,211
I am afraid to be here alone.

1256
01:33:58,317 --> 01:34:00,285
Tomorrow, you can go.

1257
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:03,446
But I will not
let you go tonight.

I could not refuse you...
anything. [ Chuckles ]

1262

Ay!
We should have gone...

1263
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:34,144
to Portugal tonight.

1264
01:34:43,796 --> 01:34:49,291
I better look around outside

Adiós, my beautiful angel.

That is what you are.

you stand outside
where I can see you...

and wave good-bye to me.

Then I know you love me.

If it is to be the end,
I want to know that...

you are thinking only of me.
