1
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:43,363
Listen to this! Listen to this,
you fellows! You fellows, listen!

2
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:47,406
General Grant chased the Rebs
out of Richmond four days ago.

3
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:51,117
And it's rumored that Lee's
already surrendered.

4
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,319
The war is over!

5
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,279
[GUNSHOTS]

6
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,562
- Here's the captain's papers.
- Get those Yanks out of here.

7
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:52,117
All right, you two,
get this body out of here.

8
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,642
Pardee, get
these men out of sight.

9
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,525
Now, come on,
let's go.

10
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,116
Hurry it up, Mike.
Hurry it up.

11
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,400
- Captain Cagle?
- Yes.

12
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,923
- Brevet Major Harris.
- We've been expecting you.

13
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,721
Here's the warrant for the payroll.

14
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:43,926
Well, you brought a very small
guard for this much money.

15
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:48,559
- There's no Rebs within 50 miles.
- What about Randall's Raiders?

16
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:54,085
We drove them clear out of Louisiana
with their tails between their legs.

17
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,720
Well...

18
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,117
...all right. Hand it down.

19
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:01,884
Where's the station agent?

20
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:05,921
He got taken sick. One of
the boys took him back to camp.

21
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,718
Where you going?

22
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,325
- Back to the train.
- Go ahead.

23
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,799
Stand beside it with your mouth
shut and get on when it pulls out.

24
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,527
I'll be watching you
from this window.

25
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,926
Sign this receipt. Get that
money to your camp in a hurry.

26
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,439
Stop them, major!
They shot the station agent!

27
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,316
Get after them, you fools!
They stole your payroll.

28
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,406
- You all right?
- Yeah. Get out of here.

29
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:52,723
Fire at them, they're rebels!

30
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:13,724
Hey, lieutenant. Ain't that a federal
offense, breaking open them boxes?

31
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:18,636
Ain't that a beautiful sight?

32
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:22,436
Makes you feel like a kitten
with a whole basin of milk.

33
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:27,920
- What a pity it don't belong to us.
- How much you figure it comes to?

34
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:32,525
$ 12,250.

35
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:37,757
Lieutenant, how about making
that a neat, round sum?

36
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:41,715
Say $ 10,000, and us fellows
dividing up the difference?

37
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,799
You thieving rat.
The Army would shoot us.

38
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,923
Well, who would tell?

39
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,960
- I wouldn't, for one.
- Me neither.

40
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:54,564
Look at us. A bunch of starved
scarecrows, whipped and dead broke.

41
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:58,242
All we got from this war is
shriveled guts and saddle sores.

42
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:02,036
You got a tempting argument.
I doubt if it's legal.

43
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,516
It ain't legal, Vance, or moral.

44
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,440
Confederacy can use
that money more than us.

45
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:12,158
You're right. Tomorrow we're taking
this money to General Randall.

46
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:16,764
Well, we tried anyway.
Let's get into this grub.

47
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,843
- Regiments broke camp and moved out.
- But where to?

48
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:35,044
General said they'd
wait for us right here.

49
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,801
Been away eight days.
Might've been attacked.

50
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,117
Or ordered away all of a sudden.

51
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,925
We better ride into
Claysville and find out.

52
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,599
VANCE:
What's your regiment?

53
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:08,801
Fifth Louisiana Rifles,
or what's left of them.

54
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,639
Where's Randall's outfit?

55
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,640
The cavalry disbanded
two or three days ago.

56
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,765
Scattered so as
not to give up the horses.

57
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:21,318
You fellows should do likewise
before the Yanks confiscate them.

58
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,242
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about? What happened?

59
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:28,240
What's happened?
You mean you ain't heard?

60
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:31,524
General Lee surrendered
to Grant five days ago.

61
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,520
Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia.

62
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:40,125
- Surrendered? You're crazy.
- No, that's a fact, lieutenant.

63
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:43,643
All of us gave up our guns
in Shreveport last Monday.

64
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,446
So war's over.
We can all go home.

65
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,922
MAN:
If you've got one left to go to.

66
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,840
Now that the brigade's scattered,
how we gonna find the general?

67
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,363
- That's just it. We can't.
- We gotta try, Vance.

68
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,962
- Why?
- Why?

69
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,516
To give him
the money, of course.

70
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:17,804
I don't know.
The surrender changes everything.

71
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,117
We gotta talk it over.

72
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,996
We can't take this money.
It don't rightly belong to us.

73
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,920
Then tell us who it
does rightly belong to.

74
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,802
It belongs to the Confederate
government, I suppose.

75
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:43,846
There ain't no more Confederate
government. It's finished.

76
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,156
That's the truth.

77
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:49,240
They'll hang Jeff Davis and
throw all the others in prison.

78
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,922
Well, then it must still
be Federal property.

79
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,398
You mean we ought
to give it back to them?

80
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,400
A minnie ball in my leg's
got to be paid for.

81
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:03,719
Your brother nearly died
of gangrene in a Yankee prison.

82
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:08,244
We didn't steal this money.
We took it in battle, fair and square.

83
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:12,116
It's called "spoils of war,"
like capturing a horse.

84
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,245
We and the Federals
didn't know it was over.

85
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,125
So it's still prize money.

86
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:22,520
It's ours. You don't have to take
your share, if it sticks in your craw.

87
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,516
How do you feel about this, Ray?

88
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,719
What Vance says makes sense.

89
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:32,243
If we got a right to it,
we're fools not to take it.

90
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,637
It's settled.
I got it figured out.

91
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:39,324
We got $ 1750
apiece coming to us.

92
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,921
Wait until I get
to Georgia with this.

93
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,806
I'll buy a hog, a dog
and a rocking chair.

94
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:48,243
We all three just gonna
sit there and scratch.

95
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,365
We'll fix us up the best
farm in east Texas.

96
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,758
You bet. But first...

97
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,441
...I'm gonna get married.

98
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:02,806
Cathy's been waiting four years.
It seems more like 40 to me.

99
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:09,721
And now, instead of going back
to her empty-handed, I got this money.

100
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,719
Yanks!

101
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,925
Look at them. All brave and
sassy now that they licked us.

102
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,365
Not us, Mike.
Maybe the South is licked...

103
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,325
...but not us.

104
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:55,322
Still, it's smarter if we
split up here and now.

105
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,997
- So long, Mike.
- So long, Vance.

106
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,843
Whenever you get to Texas,
you know where to find me.

107
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,443
I ain't ever gonna leave
that rocking chair.

108
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,645
- Goodbye, Brett. Lots of luck.
- Thank you.

109
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,718
- Goodbye.
- Sarge.

110
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,521
You're new here.
What happened to McComb?

111
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:49,841
Joined the Army. I'm minding the store
until he's back. If he's still alive.

112
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,282
You think Ma would
like this bonnet?

113
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:55,280
That's pretty. See
if there's a fancy one...

114
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:58,007
...with lace and pink
ribbons for Cathy.

115
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,558
That's the only one I got left.
Anyhow, who feels free nowadays?

116
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:06,038
He does! He's going
home to get married.

117
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,597
If we clean him up so his
sweetheart recognizes him.

118
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,396
Don't worry. Cathy would
know me a mile away.

119
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:20,325
Wish I could take her a real nice
present like a gold ring or bracelet.

120
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,724
Sorry. That's all
the female finery I got left.

121
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:28,159
Except this here bustle, which
I've been using for a mousetrap.

122
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,638
- Give us that too.
- Hey, Vance...

123
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:35,323
...now, this is fit and proper
for a bridegroom.

124
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:40,836
- It's just your size.
- This feels like real broadcloth.

125
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:44,556
Sure is. Probably the last
good suit left in the state.

126
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:45,716
How much?

127
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,447
With the pants,
that will cost you $ 14.

128
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,041
I'll throw in a pair
of galluses free.

129
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,960
Hard money!
No Confederate shinplasters.

130
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,721
This look hard enough for you?

131
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:02,439
A $20 Federal bill. I ain't
seen one of these since '63.

132
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,646
- That cover what we owe you?
- Sure, I'll go wrap them up.

133
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:11,886
Jethro! Well, I'll be
dad-burned if it ain't old Jethro!

134
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,238
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Old rascal.

135
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,967
How'd you stay
alive all these years?

136
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,642
What's the matter?
We ain't changed that much.

137
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:24,321
You look kind of
surprised to see us.

138
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:30,125
- We all heard you was dead, Mr. Vance.
- Well, he done near was.

139
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:33,160
That minnie ball misspelled
my name a little.

140
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:37,241
You mean, our folks
don't even know I'm alive?

141
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,997
No, sir. Nobody does.

142
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,840
We'll ride by Cathy's
house and tell her.

143
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:50,116
She ain't there no more. Her folks was
killed in the same raid your pa was.

144
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,317
- Where is she?
- Your place. Moved in with your ma.

Strange how things work out.

We go off and fight four years. But
they come and kill him here at home.

00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,723
My son!

152
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,118
They told me you were dead.

153
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,927
They were almost right.

154
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,761
But here's what's left of me, Ma.

155
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,319
Just think. All three of you.

156
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,325
Brett!

157
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,118
Ray.

158
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:43,520
All my sons. Home again.

159
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,605
Clint!

160
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,964
Clint!

161
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,959
Clint!

162
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:57,120
Clint, come running!

163
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,485
Cathy! Cathy!

164
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:18,326
Vance.

165
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,320
Cathy.

166
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:33,125
Let me have a good
look at you, honey.

167
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:38,845
Yeah, that's just how I've seen you
night and day for four years...

168
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,123
...except for those britches.

169
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:45,527
Clint! Clint!

170
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,835
Vance!

171
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,998
Oh, no!

172
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:02,722
This can't be the sprat!
Look at how he's grown and filled out.

173
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:07,438
- He's almost a man, ain't he, Cathy?
- They told us you were dead.

174
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:12,681
Yeah, I know. I know. Now, come on.
Come on. Tell me about you all.

175
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,644
We got a heap
of work to do.

176
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:18,846
First thing, get Cathy out
of those britches and into a dress.

177
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:23,523
I try, but she works harder than
a mule all day helping me and Ma.

178
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,161
Not anymore.
We got three farm hands.

179
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:30,719
Come on, I got
a bushel of things to tell you.

180
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:37,725
Vance? I don't reckon you
could have known about this...

181
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:42,523
...but me and Cathy got married
about three months ago.

182
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,923
Married?

183
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:03,758
Well, this is a...

184
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,680
This is a day of surprises all around.

185
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,683
I don't know what we'd
have done without Cathy.

186
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,481
Or her without us after
her folks died.

187
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,798
We had poor scratching
to keep body and soul together...

188
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,123
...waiting for the war to end.

189
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,921
Well, it must've been hard.

190
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,124
Well...

191
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:30,840
...congratulations, Clint.

192
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:36,764
We always did want Cathy
in the family, didn't we, Ma?

193
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,918
Yes, son.

194
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:41,918
Always.

195
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:49,722
Hey, Cathy.

196
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,923
Look at the nicks
on this saber.

197
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,157
How many Yankees
did you all get?

198
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,841
- We didn't stop to count.
- Whole bunch?

199
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,965
Most of those nicks
came from butchering pigs.

200
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,199
I'll bet. A blue one
with the brass buttons.

201
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,198
Wish I would've been there.

202
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,881
I bet you I would've gotten my share.

203
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,244
He ranted and raved whenever
we got news of a battle.

204
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,558
You did right to stay here,
Clint. You did fine.

205
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:19,517
I love my bonnet. You boys shouldn't
have spent what little you got on me.

206
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:24,085
That's a mighty poor gift,
Ma, for all you've given us.

207
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,724
CLINT:
Hey! Look here.

208
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,519
A brand new Sunday-go-to-meeting suit.

209
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:36,559
That's a present for you.
From all of us.

210
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:40,163
For me? It must've cost a fortune.

211
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:43,644
- Where'd you get money?
- We had some saved up.

212
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:47,641
- We still got a few dollars left.
- That's more than we got.

213
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,196
Sit down while everything's hot.

214
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,723
Come on, Clint.
You're hungry, aren't you?

215
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:11,562
Dear Lord, I thank you most kindly for
bringing my boys home safe and sound.

216
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:34,123
It's sure good
to hear him sing.

217
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,847
It sure is. All we're
missing now is Pa.

218
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,726
Remember we all used
to sit here and sing?

219
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:42,526
Indeed. Brings back
a heap of good memories.

220
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:44,723
Vance used to sing the loudest.

221
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,117
This one was his favorite.

222
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:30,842
If we wanna get to work before
sunup, we better turn in.

223
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,601
A lot of things around
here need fixing.

224
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:44,759
What's troubling you, Vance?
You ain't your old self tonight.

225
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,918
Oh, I'm all right.

226
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:50,921
A little tired, I reckon.

227
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,319
Vance...

228
00:27:55,127 --> 00:28:00,565
...I know you and Cathy used to be
kind of fond of each other, but...

229
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:04,606
You ain't got no hard feelings
against either of us, have you?

230
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,726
Hard feelings? Me?
Why, of course not.

231
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,561
You really mean that?
Down deep?

232
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,162
- Listen, did I ever lie to you?
- No.

233
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:19,959
All right. Oh, I liked Cathy,
sure. But we all did.

234
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:24,041
But I was never
in love with her.

235
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:28,644
We were just real good friends.

236
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,526
And that's how it still is.

237
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:34,765
So don't you ever
think nothing else.

238
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,520
Why...

239
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:40,326
...I'm just happy for both of you.

240
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,041
I hoped it'd be that way, Vance.

241
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,522
We're so much in love.
I could never tell you.

242
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,359
You don't have to.

243
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:59,635
It's written all over your
face. And hers too.

244
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:12,485
You go on to bed.
I'm gonna lock the barn.

245
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:16,526
There's a lot of stragglers.
They might steal our horses.

246
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:21,522
You can't even trust a Reb nowadays.
I'll see you in the morning.

247
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:47,963
Vance, you've gotta
let me talk to you.

248
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:50,960
You never said
one word to me tonight.

249
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:53,960
- Please let me explain.
- Nothing to explain.

250
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,119
Oh, but there is.
Please let me...

251
00:29:57,367 --> 00:30:00,325
Give me a chance to tell you...

252
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:03,523
Coming to bed, Vance?

253
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,883
Vance?

254
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:49,562
How soon you figure we can tell folks
about the money?

255
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:54,198
A couple months. We'll spend a little
at a time so as not to start talk.

256
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,880
You're the boss, Vance.

257
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:59,926
We gotta buy seed if we hope
to get a good crop this summer.

258
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:01,759
The crop'll have to wait.

259
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:05,840
The money we got hidden in here
is a lot better than seed.

260
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,446
Vance.

261
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:43,040
Your mare worked her shoe loose.

262
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:45,163
It's all right now.

263
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:49,957
Please, I've been trying to see you
alone for over a week now.

264
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:54,598
Won't you even try and understand?

265
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,202
No one asks why a woman
gets married.

266
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,642
You do. You ask me with every look.

267
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:02,446
You've no right to think
I was faithless.

268
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:06,122
I waited for you,
just like I promised.

269
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:11,361
I thought about you all day long,
and prayed for you every night.

270
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,725
Then that letter came
saying you were dead.

271
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:17,845
I didn't want to live myself anymore.

272
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:21,795
I loved you, Vance.

273
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:24,083
With all my heart and soul.

274
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:27,922
You know I did.
How can you doubt it?

275
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,841
That's what hurts the most, Cathy.

276
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,966
I know. And I can't forget it.

277
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,360
We got to, both of us,
or we can't live under the same roof.

278
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,643
I know that too.

279
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:46,558
Maybe time will take care of it.

280
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,403
I want you to be happy.

281
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:54,477
I never will be unless you are, Vance.

282
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:59,479
I hear you lying awake at night.
I know what you're thinking about.

283
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:03,037
Me and Clint, side by side.

284
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:07,282
Why'd you tell him there was
never anything between us?

285
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:14,483
- You want me to tell him the truth?
- He already knows it. I told him.

286
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,396
Why?

287
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:19,877
Because I don't like
living with a lie.

288
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:23,244
He believed you when you said
you never loved me.

289
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:28,037
He'll believe you because he loves you
just as much as he loves me.

290
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:33,645
So if he's big enough to forget
what's past, then you can too.

291
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:38,080
Please, Vance.
Please try for my sake.

292
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:20,679
Cathy?

293
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,563
What you doing?

294
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:29,725
- Something wrong?
- No, Clint. Nothing. I was...

295
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:34,563
Cathy, you're crying.
What are you crying about?

296
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:36,319
I don't know, Clint.

297
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:40,366
I had a bad dream, I guess.
The war and everything.

298
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:44,486
Don't cry. We're all safe again.

299
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,081
There's nothing to worry about.

300
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,044
I hope not.

301
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:23,076
But to have to lose you again so soon.

302
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:28,397
I knew this was gonna happen, son.

303
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:32,243
I could see the heartbreak
growing in you.

304
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,558
I reckon what you're doing is right.

305
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:39,241
There's no other way, Ma.

306
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:42,763
I tried to hide it,
but I can't stay on.

307
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:45,395
Sooner or later Clint would see.

308
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,843
- He might guess now anyway.
- No, he won't.

309
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:52,966
I'll tell him I'm going out
to California for a few months.

310
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:55,118
He'll believe it.

311
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,359
And the rest of you'll never tell him.

312
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,246
When you planning to go?

313
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,325
Tomorrow.

314
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:07,641
No, Ma. The quicker the better.

315
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:11,522
Tomorrow we'll go to the raising
of the new schoolhouse.

316
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:16,283
I'll tell Clint and Cathy there,
and leave before they can stop me.

317
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,915
They'll both be mighty upset, Vance.

318
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:24,241
Maybe so, but they won't make a scene
in front of all of our friends.

319
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:27,126
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

320
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:32,595
Clint thinks the sun rises
and sets in you.

321
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,883
I know, Ma.

322
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:39,086
That's just why I'm going.

323
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:56,956
What's wrong?

324
00:36:57,127 --> 00:37:00,756
My, you girls look pretty.
I have to keep an eye on you.

325
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,519
Go on, Clint.

326
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:07,602
Ray, tell the fellas to hurry it up.
We don't want to miss any of the fun.

327
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,085
Ninety, ninety-five, two.

328
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,681
How come you're only taking 200?

329
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,315
You all need it more than I do.

330
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:21,076
Give Ma the rest of my share.

331
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:24,523
Tell her how we got it
and that it's rightfully ours.

332
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:29,158
- It isn't fair, giving up everything.
- Come on, take more than $200.

333
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,636
You gotta have a stake out West.

Don't worry.

What do you mean, going away?
Where?

351
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:23,597
An old army friend
has a ranch out in California.

352
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:27,521
He needs a partner.
I've been getting restless anyway...

353
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:30,360
That's not your reason, Vance.

354
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,485
You're leaving because
of me and Clint.

355
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,679
Maybe so.

356
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:41,121
I can't meet his eyes
after what you told me.

357
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:45,237
We don't want you to go.
This is your home. We love you.

358
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,639
A home can be full of too much love.

359
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:52,925
Then one night it burns up,
and everybody in it.

360
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:57,522
I can't face the others,
knowing you left because of me...

I guess you'll have to learn.

You can't go. You know how I feel.

- You know that...

Even if it's true, don't say it.

Not ever.

Cathy? What's the matter?

369

What's wrong?

370
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:52,764
- What's wrong?
- I told her I was going away.

371
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:55,077
And I was coming to tell you.

372

- Vance! Ray! Brett!

and this gentleman's Mr. Siringo.

- We hope.

I've been engaged to recover property
lost or stolen during the war.

Well, that's good news.

No, we've got our own.

Three of you brothers were
members of Randall's cavalry...

382
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,198
...a unit of which attacked
a railroad station...

383
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,723
...on the morning of April 10, 1865.

384
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,686
Eight weeks ago.

385
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:55,442
By impersonating soldiers,
you took an Army payroll...

386
00:44:55,607 --> 00:45:00,886
...amounting to $ 12,250 from
an officer who was on the train.

387
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:03,766
Those may have been your orders...

388
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:06,282
...but the war was already over...

389
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:09,923
...and had been since noon
of the preceding day.

390

- Any idea what he's talking about?
- No.

He's got us mixed up.

392
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:19,039
We found one of the men
who got away with you...

393
00:45:19,207 --> 00:45:22,199
...and we recovered his share
of the money.

394
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:25,325
- He told us who stole the rest.
- He's lying.

395

since you was knee-high.

If you got the money, give it back.

Well, that's possible,
but we mean to make sure.

who took the money.

Too late. They arrested them

They had it timed to the split second.

I can agree with you.

Why didn't you tell me the truth?

We felt we had
a right to it, Clint.

We did have a right to it.

01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:38,999
I ran into Jethro. He said Vance
came to his place after daylight.

612
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:42,842
Kincaid's men were watching.
Jethro fetched the money...

613
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:45,726
...and Cathy took it and went
to meet Vance.

614
01:08:45,967 --> 01:08:50,085
- Is that the girl in the farm?
- That's right. She's my wife.

615
01:08:51,487 --> 01:08:54,126
- Your wife?
- She was Vance's girl.

616
01:08:54,367 --> 01:08:57,404
Go ahead, Clint.
What else did old Jethro say?

617
01:08:57,567 --> 01:09:00,286
Soldiers jumped him.
He made a run for it.

618
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:02,403
- Didn't Cathy come back home?
- No.

619
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,081
GAVIN: Probably rode a long
way by this time.

620
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,807
In any direction.

621
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,198
- What do you mean?
- He's got the money, ain't he?

622
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:14,882
Are you saying that Vance
would double-cross us?

623
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:19,524
Not only us. Didn't you know
he was crazy about your wife?

624
01:09:19,727 --> 01:09:21,683
BRETT:
You're wrong, Mike.

625
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:26,318
- He liked Cathy once, that ended...
- What are you lying to him for?

626
01:09:26,487 --> 01:09:29,047
He carried her picture
through the war.

627
01:09:29,247 --> 01:09:30,726
FLEMING:
He was gonna marry her.

628
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:33,924
GAVIN: It's time you opened
your eyes. He wanted her.

629
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:37,477
- Now he's run away with her.
KELSO: And with our money.

630
01:09:37,727 --> 01:09:40,878
They probably had
it all figured out.

631
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:47,926
Clint! Wait a minute!

632
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:52,080
Come on, Ray. We've got
to find them before he does.

633
01:09:58,687 --> 01:10:01,884
They could all be in on this.
Come on.

634
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:25,197
Nobody knows about this place except
Brett and Ray.

635
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:29,280
We used it on hunting trips.
You'll be safe here.

636
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:34,282
I'm worried about you. You got no way
of knowing what Siringo told Clint.

637
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:35,960
If it's no, they'll kill you.

638
01:10:36,127 --> 01:10:40,166
It's a chance I gotta take.
Clint will be waiting at the mill.

639
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:44,286
- What if he isn't?
- Go to town, give him back the money.

640
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:50,483
So you stay here and I'll send
someone for you by nightfall.

641
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:02,280
Vance?

642
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:28,247
What makes you sure
they're headed west?

643
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:31,797
You ain't in cahoots on this,
by any chance?

644
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:36,404
Then you lose us and join them.
That could be the plan.

645
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:39,479
You think I'd send my
wife out to get shot?

646
01:11:39,647 --> 01:11:44,243
Maybe not. If her and Vance is
put on, you've got us to settle with.

647
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:48,281
Ain't nothing put on with them.
They put one over on us.

648
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:50,722
Shut up. I don't
wanna hear no more.

649
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:55,677
- Then find them. And fast.
- Don't worry, I've got more reason.

650
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:59,402
If he finds them, he won't
listen. He's half crazy.

651
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:03,799
Vance wouldn't run out on us.
He's probably hiding out until...

652
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:08,085
Hey, hold on. I know where
he might be. Let them ride on.

653
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,281
I was right.
That's Cathy's mare.

654
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:50,521
Then he went to the mill,
taking the money with him.

655
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:54,043
When he doesn't find you,
he'll go into town alone.

656
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:56,084
We figured that's how it was.

657
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,715
Something's come up
you gotta know about.

658
01:12:58,927 --> 01:13:01,885
- Clint thinks you run off with Vance.
- I did...

659
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:06,677
No, I don't mean like that.
He thinks you left him for good.

660
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:11,323
That's not true.
Whoever put that idea in his head?

661
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:15,116
Gavin's bunch. They think
Vance took the money and you.

662
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:19,439
I tried to reason with him.
He wouldn't listen. He's jealous.

663
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:22,963
If he finds Vance,
there's no telling what he'll do.

664
01:13:23,127 --> 01:13:26,961
- Let me talk to him. Where is he?
- Come on, we'll find him.

665
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:32,600
What proof do you want?
Your brothers cut loose to join them.

666
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:36,396
They was all in this together.
This one's leading us on.

667
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:38,319
You'll see if I am.

668
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:42,276
All I want is to find them if it
takes the rest of my life.

669
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:17,679
Clint...

670
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,443
- Where is he?
- Better listen careful to her, Clint.

671
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:24,723
You believe what they told you?

672
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:28,323
I reckon I've always known.
This just plain showed me.

673
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:31,479
- Let me tell you. Listen...
- Quit lying to me!

674
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:34,036
I believed your lies
like you wanted.

675
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:37,165
Like the night you stood
at our window crying.

676
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:40,759
When you ran from me
because of what Vance said.

677
01:14:40,927 --> 01:14:42,599
No, listen, and let me...

678
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:46,522
- Give her the chance!
- For what, to deny it? She can't!

679
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,804
Go on, say I'm lying!
Say he weren't your lover!

680
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,640
Say you ain't laid
awake thinking of him!

681
01:14:52,807 --> 01:14:56,163
Wishing I was Vance!
Wishing you'd never married me!

682
01:14:56,327 --> 01:14:57,999
Shut up! None of it's so.

683
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:00,806
Tell me he hasn't held
you or kissed you.

684
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:04,596
- You're hurting me!
- You can't say it because it's true.

685
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:08,686
- You're lying! You love him!
- No! Stop it!

686
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:11,122
- You're lying! You love him!
- Stop!

687
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:15,798
- I know you do! I ought to kill you.
- You're crazier than a mad duck!

688
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:18,322
You would've killed her!

689
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:21,081
You know what you meant to each other
as well as I do!

690
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:23,556
You're just trying to protect her.

691
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:29,885
Hold it, Ray.

692
01:15:31,087 --> 01:15:32,884
Come on.

693
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:35,685
You're going home.

694
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,283
Go back where we found you.

695
01:15:42,447 --> 01:15:47,077
Wait for Vance in case he returns.
Warn him. Tell him to stay there.

696
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
Now, get out of here.
Go on.

697
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:57,158
I sent her home. Now, you're going
into town with us. Get mounted.

698
01:15:57,327 --> 01:15:58,885
Hold it, Brett.

699
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:02,157
They're lying about her going home.

700
01:16:02,327 --> 01:16:05,399
She's heading back to him.
We gotta follow her.

701
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:08,798
That's a lie!
Vance is on his way to find us.

702
01:16:09,047 --> 01:16:11,277
With the money to meet Siringo.

703
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:13,717
You think we're
gonna swallow that?

704
01:16:13,887 --> 01:16:15,684
Pardee, get their guns.

705
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:23,483
Give Clint back his gun.

706
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:27,078
You can do what you want.
We're trailing her.

707
01:16:27,287 --> 01:16:30,882
You're right.
They're still trying to throw us off.

708
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:37,886
Now, you two can go back
to the mill or to Hades...

709
01:16:38,087 --> 01:16:41,875
...but don't follow us.
Let's go, boys.

710
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:49,363
We gotta find Vance, but where?

711
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:54,157
If he's not at the mill, we'll try
to catch him before he gets to town.

712
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:33,004
GAVIN: What'd I tell you?
She led us straight to him.

713
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:49,282
- Where is he?
- Don't know. Brett told you the truth.

714
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:53,486
- You're protecting him!
- Leave her alone. That ain't helping.

715
01:17:53,647 --> 01:17:57,003
He wouldn't have left her
unless he was coming back.

716
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:00,477
So we'll just sit here
until he walks in.

717
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,885
VANCE:
Ray! Brett!

718
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:34,439
So now they're gunning
for you. Clint with them.

719
01:18:34,607 --> 01:18:36,837
They think you
double-crossed them.

720
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:41,683
Maybe we can knock some sense into
their heads before anybody gets hurt.

721
01:18:42,767 --> 01:18:44,883
First we gotta get rid of this.

722
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:50,204
Ray, ride into town. Give it
to Siringo, tell him what's happened.

723
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,482
Where are you going?

724
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,683
We'll get to the cave and wait.

725
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:57,283
You bring what help you can.
Now, get going.

726
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:03,724
Vance? He'll never give you
the chance to explain now.

727
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:08,404
We tried. So did Cathy.
Clint came near to killing her for it.

728
01:19:08,647 --> 01:19:09,966
He'll listen to me.

729
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:13,881
I'm warning you.
He's more dangerous than any of them.

730
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:25,081
That's him. With Brett.

731
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:29,122
Get out of sight. Watch her.

732
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:31,278
Wait until they get up close.

733
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:38,082
- They got here ahead of us.
- They're up there with her.

734
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,482
They must've seen us coming.

735
01:19:46,647 --> 01:19:49,286
You stay here.
This is my job.

736
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:52,724
Any one of them
is liable to shoot you.

737
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:57,518
Not Clint. He couldn't.
And he'd stop the man who tried.

738
01:19:57,767 --> 01:20:00,281
You haven't seen his face.

739
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,680
Clint!

740
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,683
Can you hear me, Clint?

741
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:23,677
I know what you're thinking, Clint!
But you got it all wrong! Dead wrong!

742
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:31,718
All Cathy did was
to bring me the money!

743
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:36,085
There's nothing else between us!
I swear it! Nothing at all!

744
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:39,477
Well, I know different, don't I?

745
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:46,599
I was going away, Clint!
And I'm still going, for good!

746
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:50,396
I had to square things
with Siringo first. I've done it!

747
01:20:50,567 --> 01:20:55,482
He couldn't have. He ain't had
time to get to town and back.

748
01:20:56,287 --> 01:20:59,040
It's a scheme.
He's trying to draw us out.

749
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:03,883
Listen to me, Clint! Ray's going
in to take Siringo the money!

750
01:21:04,127 --> 01:21:07,278
That'll give us clean hands,
all of us!

751
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:13,804
Unless one of you loses his
head now and adds killing to it!

752
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:19,679
He's lying to you about the money.
He's still got it on him.

753
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:24,557
He only came back for her.
And she knows it.

754
01:21:31,647 --> 01:21:34,207
Why don't you answer me, Clint?

755
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:38,281
What's stopping you?
Can't you see he's just stalling?

756
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:41,081
Working closer until he can jump us?

757
01:21:41,847 --> 01:21:44,725
Probably got Ray and Brett

VANCE:
What's troubling you?

759
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:49,606
Well, go on.
You asked for him. Take him.

760
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:55,125
I got no reason to lie to you. I only
came to tell you our trouble's over.

761
01:21:55,367 --> 01:21:57,722
We can go home with nothing to fear!

762
01:21:57,967 --> 01:22:02,882
Go home.
Go home to what?

763
01:22:05,447 --> 01:22:09,486
Well, go on. Take him.
Now! Or I'll take him myself.

Vance!

Come on! Let's get
the money and get out of here!

767
01:22:42,967 --> 01:22:46,880
Get away from him!
Leave him alone!

Hey, don't move.
Just lie still.

Cathy, where's Vance?
I got to talk to him.

772
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:41,326
- Right here, Clint.
- Vance, I didn't mean it.

773
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:44,399
I know you didn't.
You don't have to tell me.

774
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,683
Everything's gonna be all right.

775

Everything's gonna be all right.
