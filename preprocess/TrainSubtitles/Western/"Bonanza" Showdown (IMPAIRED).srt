1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,562
(hushed):
Hurry up, Sam!

5
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,597
We set one.

6
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,327
Let it go.

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,815
Hurry it up!

8
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,842
Make it fast,
this whole town ain't deaf!

9
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,698
Well, it looks like
we made it clean, Pardo.

10
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,068
They sure sleep sound
in Virginia City, don't they?

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,127
Let's go.

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,621
Sam...

13
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,357
the Ponderosa is over
in that direction.

14
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,692
I reckon I can find it.

15
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,195
You know what you're gonna do
when you get there?

16
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,564
We've been over it 97 times,
Pardo.

17
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,798
Just once more.

18
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,133
All right.

19
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,469
I go to the Ponderosa
and I hire on as a hand,

20
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,070
and I keep my ears open.

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,738
And if a search party comes down
this way,

22
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,940
I'll let you know first.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,809
Especially if it's a platoon
from the Army.

24
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,444
Then what?

25
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,679
Well, when things quiet down,

26
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,671
I come on back
and we light out.

27
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,419
Mark that big old dead tree.

28
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,689
We'll be a mile-and-a-half south
of here.

29
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,491
You'll see
a big granite boulder,

30
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,992
leads into a box canyon.

31
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,061
That's where we'll be waiting.

32
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,396
You just let
old Sam take care of it.

33
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,398
You're my eyes and my ears.

34
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,901
I'm depending on you, Sam.

35
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,199
Let's go.

36
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,186
Sam, cover up those hoofprints.

37
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,523
They'll probably want to know
where you came from.

38
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,592
Tell them about that ranch
you used to work on;

39
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,695
that fella that was always
talking about the Ponderosa.

40
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,796
That ought to convince 'em.

41
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,598
What if it doesn't?

42
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,766
What?

43
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,235
What if somebody starts getting
extra nosy?

44
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,761
You got a gun, haven't you, Sam?

45
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,395
(theme song playing)

46
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,076
(horse whinnying)

47
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,817
Hey! Ride him, cowboy!

48
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,718
Come on, stick with him, Adam!

49
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,121
HOSS:
Ride him, Adam!

50
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,090
LITTLE JOE:
Come on, Adam!

51
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,786
- Fan him! Fan him!
- Come on!

52
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,866
You know, I told you he was
too much horse for you, Adam.

53
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,703
Well, you're next, bronc buster.

54
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,071
That's what they call me.

55
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,507
Hey, Joe, you ain't been making
no rash promises

56
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,808
to Ellie McClure, have you?

57
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,310
I haven't had a chance.

58
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,412
You sure?
Because there comes her Pa

59
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,980
and the sheriff right now.

60
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,108
Whoa.

61
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,921
Hey, I wonder what they want?

62
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,590
I don't know, but now, me,

63
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,792
I always sort of went
for June weddings

64
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,193
with lots of apple blossoms
and...

65
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,029
Yeah, well, you know,
a fellow could do

66
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,397
a lot worse
than Ellie McClure.

67
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,667
Oh, excuse me all to pieces.

68
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,037
ADAM: Well, are you gonna
ride this thing or not?

69
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,597
Coming up.

70
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,279
If you'll excuse me, ladies,

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,981
it's time
for your riding lesson.

72
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,142
(Adam, Hoss clear their throats)

73
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,988
(horse whinnies)

74
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,127
Now we'll see some fun.

75
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,969
HOSS:
Ride him, Joe! Ride him, baby!

76
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,631
- That a boy!
- Ride him, Joe!

77
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,909
Keep his head up, Joe!

78
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,177
- HOSS: Ride him, baby!
- ADAM: That a boy!

79
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,778
HOSS:
Ride him, Joe!

80
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,213
HOSS: Keep his head up!
That's a way!

81
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,382
- That's a way!
- Get him!

82
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,551
ADAM:
Come on, boy!

83
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,020
Ride him! Stay with him, boy!

84
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,555
Ride him!

85
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,080
HOSS:
Ride him, Joe!

86
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,559
(both laugh)

87
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,549
I told you.

88
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,113
Well, I'm glad
somebody enjoyed it.

89
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,749
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it showed.

90
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,050
What can we do for you?

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,452
Well, you wouldn't happen
to have an easy job

92
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,920
in a cool place, now would you?

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,490
Yeah, but my brothers and I take
all of those.

94
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,258
What else do you do?

95
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,860
Well, I've accidentally managed

96
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,227
to break a horse or two
in my day.

97
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,665
Yeah, well, we just happen
to have one on hand.

98
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,658
Yeah, well, I was hoping
you'd take my word for it.

99
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,277
ADAM:
Now what's this?

100
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,746
Cowboy wants to try his luck
on that hammerhead.

101
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,550
You ever busted
any broncs before, bubba?

102
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,218
One or two, I guess.

103
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,087
Well, if you ain't for sure,

104
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,823
right now would be
a real good time to back out.

105
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,520
No, I don't reckon
I'd want to do that.

106
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,937
You think
we should let him do it?

107
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,238
Well, it's his hide.

108
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,299
Some fellers have to learn
the hard way, Joe.

109
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,514
(horse whinnying)

110
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,192
Come on, nag!

111
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,856
No!

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,236
Hyah!

113
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,905
Mule! Hi!

114
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,703
Hah! Hi!

115
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,405
Hyah!

116
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,481
MAN:
Get out of there!

117
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,647
(indistinct shouting, goading)

118
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,655
Now that's what
I call riding a horse.

119
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,658
Well, you got to admit
I tired him out a little bit.

120
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,527
Well, you might
as well face it, Joe,

121
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,860
some people are just better
with horses than others.

122
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,904
Nice ride, kid.

123
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm Adam Cartwright.

124
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,240
Sam Kirby.

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,342
These are my brothers, uh,
Hoss and Little Joe.

126
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,443
Howdy.

127
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,444
Hi.

128
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,845
Pleased to meet you.

129
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,514
You, uh, looking for a job, Sam?

130
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,849
Well, Ed Lemp said you might be
hiring some hands.

131
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,784
Ed Lemp-- you a friend of his?

132
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,786
Well, he ramrodded an outfit
I worked for

133
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,388
down in Arizona--the Bar-B.

134
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,389
I see.

135
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,857
Ed give you
a letter to show?

136
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,095
Well, yeah, I, uh, I got it
packed in the saddlebag there,

137
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,097
if you really want to see it.

138
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,165
If you say you got it,
you got it.

139
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,233
How's old Ed, anyhow?

140
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,902
Oh, he's meaner than ever.

141
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,004
Still thinks mighty high
of the Ponderosa, though.

142
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,007
Well, we pay $30 a month,
bunk and beans.

143
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,704
Well, you just hired yourself
a hand.

144
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,448
Now, as far
as posses are concerned,

145
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,685
we got them here,
here, and up here.

146
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,287
Looks like you're well-covered.

147
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,821
Now, I've been on the telegraph

148
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,156
to every lawman
in the territory,

149
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,525
so I believe we got him
pretty well sealed in.

150
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,360
That is, within
this general radius.

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,361
Yeah.

152
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,096
Oh, boys, come in, please.

153
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,265
You know Mr. McClure,
Sheriff Coffee?

154
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,366
- Hello, Sheriff.
- Little Joe.

155
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,401
Howdy.

156
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,835
Hi, Mr. McClure.

157
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,171
Ellie getting all set for that
birthday party Sunday?

158
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,835
I'm hoping we'll be able to have
a birthday party, Little Joe.

159
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,511
Well, why?
What's the matter?

160
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,777
Well, Mr. McClure's bank was
robbed last night.

161
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,285
I thought that bank was pretty
near robber-proof.

162
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,486
Yeah, so did I.

163
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,988
How much did they get away with?

164
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,389
Just about all there was.

165
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,791
Right now, we'd be lucky

166
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,026
if we could pay off five cents
on the dollar.

167
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,263
Boys, that information is
not to leave this room.

168
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,231
You mean the people
don't know about it?

169
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,001
Well, they know we've been hit,
but they don't know how bad.

170
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,503
We can't afford to have a run
on the bank right now.

171
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,440
If we can get that money back by
the first of the month,

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,175
we got a chance to weather it.

173
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,209
You'll be fine, Tom.

174
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,712
Any idea who did it, Sheriff?

175
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,714
Yeah, it could have been
the John Pardo bunch.

176
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,383
He pulled a job just about like
this up in Butte last year.

177
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,085
Well, what are we waiting for?

178
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,453
Now, wait a minute, Joe.

179
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,588
The sheriff has plenty
of help up north.

180
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,523
He's holding us responsible
for the Ponderosa.

181
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,759
Chances are they'll hole up for
a while, anyway,

182
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,194
till this thing
cools down a bit.

183
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,963
And we're to see to it that they
don't hole up on our land.

184
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,299
So keep your eyes open
for anything unusual.

185
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,235
You know, smoke, tracks
that hadn't ought to be there,

186
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,471
drifters that got a lot more
money than they ought to have,

187
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,872
anything like that.

188
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,541
Well, we'll let you know
if we see anything, Roy.

189
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,909
Ah, much obliged to you, Ben.

190
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,212
More than likely they won't come
down this way at all,

191
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,147
but it don't do no harm
to make sure.

192
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,215
- BEN: No, it doesn't.
- Bye.

193
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,883
So long.

194
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,351
Mr. McClure, I sure hope

195
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,520
Ellie can have
that birthday party.

196
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,389
I hope so too, Little Joe.

197
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,658
We're waiting
to hear from Fort McKay.

198
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,993
We're trying to get help
from the army.

199
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,561
Well, I'm sure they'll want
to help.

200
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,654
So do we, Tom.

201
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,704
Ben, when I think about some of
the small ranchers around here,

202
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,373
I... I'm just not man enough
to tell them

203
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,276
that they've worked five, ten,
15 years for nothing.

204
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,412
It's a tough thing
to face up to.

205
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,614
Now, now, Tom, that's enough
with that kind of talk.

206
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,382
They'll find Pardo
and his outfit.

207
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,984
You mark my words.

208
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:25,985
I hope so.

209
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:26,975
Thank you, Ben.

210
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,224
So long, Ben.

211
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,317
So long, Roy.

212
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,006
Want us to finish breaking
those horses, Pa?

213
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,141
No, forget about the horses
for now.

214
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,243
There's still time
to do some looking

215
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,945
before it starts getting dark.

216
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,214
You boys saddle up
and tell Hoss and the men.

217
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,183
Hey, Pa, I was, uh,
I was just thinking

218
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,051
about what the sheriff said
about drifters.

219
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah. What about 'em?

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,622
Well, we just hired one
a little while ago.

221
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,124
I just thought I'd mention it.

222
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,294
Now, come on, Joe,
just because he outrode you,

223
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,662
doesn't mean he's a bank robber.

224
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,597
Look, I told you
to stop kidding me...

225
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,232
BEN: Wait a minute, now.
Wait a minute.

226
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,202
Now, what about this new man?

227
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,303
Well, Ed Lemp sent him.

228
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,838
He's all right.

229
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,272
Fella over there by the corral.

230
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,574
Sam Kirby.

231
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,509
In the gray shirt.

232
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,778
Well, if Ed Lemp
vouches for a man,

233
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,379
that's good enough for me.

234
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,371
Tell Hoss and the men
to saddle up.

235
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,130
Well, we'll cover more ground
if we split up in twos.

236
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,032
Joe, you take the arroyo
and everything east.

237
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,234
Right, Pa.

238
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,702
- Hoss.
- Yes, sir?

239
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,471
You go down south
as far as the wash.

240
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,106
Adam and I will
take the west part.

241
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,875
All right, take a man
and let's get busy.

242
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,576
Okay?

243
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,378
Yeah, let's--we'll
bird-dog them out of there.

244
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,368
Come on.

245
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,972
BEN:
Come on!

246
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,337
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.

247
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,505
I don't know about you,

248
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,007
I think I'm gonna
stretch a little.

249
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,708
Well, uh, don't you think
it's getting kind of late?

250
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,943
Shouldn't we get back?

251
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,038
Yeah, after I work out
a few kinks.

252
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,320
Wonder how the others are doing.

253
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,088
I don't know.

254
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,853
I hope they're doing
better than we are.

255
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,360
(groans)

256
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,504
That's funny.

257
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,573
You find something?

258
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,107
Yeah.

259
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,099
This bush here.

260
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,881
It's been broke off fresh.

261
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,616
You reckon
how that come to happen?

262
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,381
Well, uh, a stray, maybe.

263
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,791
No, I don't see no tracks.

264
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,225
It's peculiar, ain't it?

265
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,763
Well, it, uh...
that's-that's deer brush.

266
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,565
Maybe some Indian
took it for his fire.

267
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,200
Maybe.

268
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,362
Let's me and you
take a look around, anyhow.

269
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,509
LITTLE JOE:
Hoss!

270
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,959
What's the trouble, Joe?

271
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,362
Ah, nothing I guess.

272
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,131
From back there, it looked like
he was drawing down on you.

273
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,767
Who? Ol' Sam here?

274
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,802
Well, I-I just heard
somebody coming.

275
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,204
I-I just wanted to be sure.

276
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,332
Joe, you're letting
this whole thing spook you, boy.

277
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,409
Yeah, I guess so.

278
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,379
I reckon you was right
about that deer brush.

279
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,211
Come on,
let's get on in for supper.

280
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,835
A sure fine supper tonight.

281
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,705
I never had roast beef that good
in my whole life.

282
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,206
Get your gear stowed away?

283
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,509
No, I... I better get to it.

284
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,510
Want some help?

285
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,711
No. Thanks.

286
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,513
I don't have that much.

287
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,505
If you need anything, Sam,
just holler.

288
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,893
(door closes)

289
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,043
Do you, uh, suppose
it's something serious?

290
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,078
I don't know.

291
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,147
I think the cat's
got his tongue.

292
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,349
No, I was just thinking.

293
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,150
About Ellie McClure, no doubt.

294
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,685
Uh, no doubt.

295
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,055
No, I was thinking
about Sam Kirby.

296
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,292
Well, now, you can't still be
stewing about him

297
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,626
breaking that horse
this morning.

298
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,729
I told you that had
nothing to do with it.

299
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,630
Ah, it's like I was telling you
before supper.

300
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,632
He's all bothered because
he thought he caught ol' Sam

301
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,401
drawing down on me
out there in the wash.

302
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,569
Forget that, Joe.
He told you

303
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,570
how that happened, didn't he?

304
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,473
Yeah, he told me.

305
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,738
What's the matter with you then?

306
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,945
(sighs softly)

307
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,714
I don't know, there's just...

308
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,706
there's just something
about him.

309
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,963
Well, on Friday, we-we covered
the south and the west part.

310
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,831
Then yesterday,
we took the east.

311
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,900
And this morning,
we split up and swept north.

312
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,934
No luck, huh?

313
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,269
Nah, not unless
Adam found something.

314
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,671
I didn't.

315
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,006
What kept you?

316
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,642
Well, Sam saw some, uh, smoke
up around Bitter Creek.

317
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,010
Turned out to be
Ollie Ludlow's posse.

318
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,111
Ah.

319
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,704
Ollie's been watching
the Dayton Road.

320
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,884
Don't I know you, son?

321
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,286
I couldn't say, Sheriff.

322
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,788
I don't think I know you.

323
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,457
Roy, this is Sam Kirby.

324
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,925
He's working for us now.

325
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,660
Since when?

326
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,495
Since Friday.

327
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,630
Hired on Friday, huh?

328
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,198
Where were you
Thursday night, Sam?

329
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,033
You mean the night
the bank was robbed?

330
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,034
Mm-hmm.

331
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,269
I was on the trail.

332
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,037
You can prove that, of course?

333
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,506
Not unless you want to take
the word of my horse.

334
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,508
Sam's all right, Sheriff.

335
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,677
He-- Ed Lemp sent him up here
from the Bar-B.

336
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,045
Oh.

337
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,046
How's old Ed?

338
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,916
Meaner than a snake.

339
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,784
(laughs)

340
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,952
Well, I guess, Sheriff, that...

341
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,986
RUDY:
Sheriff?

342
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,155
Got a message
for you from Fort McKay.

343
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,190
Thanks, Rudy.

344
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,624
Get my glasses.

345
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,793
Come to town for the picnic,
Mr. Cartwright?

346
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,495
Oh, you mean, uh,
Ellie McClure's birthday party?

347
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,397
I heard that was being
called off, wasn't it?

348
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,766
Well, it looks like
they called it back on again.

349
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,734
You know about ladies
and parties and such.

350
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,137
They say it's going to be
a real do!

351
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,338
Hot dog!

352
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,207
That's what I call
real good news.

353
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,675
And here's some more good news.

354
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,744
The army's going to bust loose

355
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,480
with a whole troop
of horse soldiers.

356
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,048
Says they'll be here
tomorrow afternoon.

357
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,317
Tomorrow? Well, that is
good news, Sheriff.

358
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,852
That changes things
considerably.

359
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,354
Now we can organize a search
that'll really mean something.

360
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,152
Well, Tom McClure will be happy
to hear about that.

361
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,426
What's up, Rudy?

362
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,727
Who's that young feller
in there, Joe?

363
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,028
That's the new hand
we hired. Why?

364
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,563
Well, nothing.

365
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,099
I just thought maybe I saw him
in town with two other men

366
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,267
the night the bank was robbed.

367
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,902
Are you sure?

368
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,439
Well, he sure looks like
the feller I seen.

369
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,574
Well, maybe you ought to come
in there and tell the sheriff.

370
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,742
Oh, now, wait a minute.

371
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,677
I ain't <i>that</i> sure.

372
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,045
Anyway, it was kind of
a dark night that night.

373
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,095
Well, I'll see you back at
the Ponderosa, Mr. Cartwright.

374
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,363
All right, Sam.

375
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,864
Aren't you going
to the picnic, Sam?

376
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,965
No.

377
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,534
No, I'm not much good
at picnics.

378
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,302
Well, you ain't never seen
the kind of picnics

379
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,637
we have around here.

380
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,572
Well, I think I'll just ride on
back to the ranch, Hoss.

381
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,640
Oh, why don't you come on.

382
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,641
It'll do you good.

383
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,042
Well, some other time.

384
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,211
Ol' Joe and me are gonna look
pretty silly

385
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,079
packing you all the way
over there, now, ain't we?

386
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,105
No, maybe he's got
something better to do, Hoss.

387
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,019
All right, you win.

388
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,020
I'll go.

389
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,288
Come on.

390
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,621
Hope she's got some of
that blueberry pie.

391
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,961
Yes, sir, I sure relish
a couple of them

392
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,396
blueberry pies 'fore supper.

393
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,082
Now for the team of
Adam Cartwright and Troy Fuller,

394
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,550
Adam Cartwright.

395
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,885
- Come on, show 'em, Adam.
- (clapping, murmuring)

396
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,221
- Got nothing to worry about...
- Get 'em in there.

397
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,822
- That's it.
- Get it in there.

398
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,923
There we go!

399
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,892
- (crowd murmuring)
- Easy one, easy one.

400
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,893
Easy, easy!

401
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,961
- Ah!
- (crowd murmuring)

402
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,829
Hey, that's a fancy swing there,
you got.

403
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,097
All right, player, come on, boy.

404
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,765
- Take good care of that.
- See what you got here.

405
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,766
(murmuring continues)

406
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,235
- (horseshoe clanks)
- Ah!

407
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,903
Hey, that's a fancy swing there,
you got.

408
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,172
All right, player, come on, boy.

409
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,707
(murmuring continues
in distance)

410
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,609
Ellie, I wouldn't do
all this work for just any girl.

411
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,177
I hope you know
how much I like you.

412
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,379
You mean I'm the only girl

413
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,615
you ever carried a picnic basket
for, Little Joe?

414
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,883
Well, let's just say

415
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,478
you're the only girl
I'd carry one for now.

416
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,556
Little Joe Cartwright!

417
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,224
Right in front of
all these people.

418
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,319
Yeah, well, y-you know,
we could go behind that wagon.

419
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,330
All right! All right.

420
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,322
I'll get the rest
of the groceries.

421
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,335
The pickle fork.

422
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,336
Pickle fork.

423
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,929
Where did I put the...

424
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,710
Hoss Cartwright!

425
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,280
Ma'am, uh, there was
a great big ol' horsefly here,

426
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,414
and I-I was just...

427
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,982
I know what you was just.

428
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,084
You Cartwrights!

429
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,253
If it isn't one thing,
it's the other.

430
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,223
There'll be no refreshments
served until after the games.

431
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,892
Yes'm.

432
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,229
Miss Ellie, ain't that
your pickle fork over there?

433
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,731
I don't see any--

434
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,534
Hoss Cartwright!

435
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,503
Remember, ma'am,
I'm just a growing boy.

436
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,273
Hey, Sam.

437
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,936
Hey, Sam, come here.

438
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,450
What you doing sitting
off over there all by yourself?

439
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,618
I'm just watching.

440
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,620
Well, that ain't no way
to do at a picnic.

441
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,889
You got to get around here and
meet some of these pretty gals.

442
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,023
Oh, no, don't bother.
I'm-I'm fine.

443
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,325
Yeah, but you'll be a lot finer

444
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,993
when you meet some of these
gals-- come here.

445
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,662
Miss Ellie, Miss Ellie, I-I want
you to meet a friend of mine.

446
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,863
This here is Sam Kirby.

447
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,231
How do you do, Mr. Kirby.

448
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,733
It's my pleasure, ma'am.

449
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,670
Uh, you better be nice to Miss
Ellie; her father owns a bank.

450
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,694
Is that so?

451
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,677
Well, if you two will excuse me,
I better find Pa and Adam

452
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,547
and learn 'em something
about shooting them horseshoes.

453
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,749
Do you like picnics, Mr. Kirby?

454
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,752
Well, I don't exactly know.

455
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,887
You don't know?

456
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,257
You see, this is the first one
I've ever been to.

457
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,793
Didn't they have picnics
where you grew up?

458
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,794
Not hardly.

459
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,731
What kind of a place was that?

460
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,500
I don't think you'd much
want to hear about it.

461
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,070
I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean
to be inquisitive.

462
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,338
It's-It's my fault.

463
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:57,175
I... I didn't mean to give you
a short answer.

464
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,508
That's all right.

465
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,583
If you'll excuse me, I've got to
finish setting this table.

466
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,685
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

467
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,085
Thank you.

468
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,591
I didn't think I was going
to have a party today at all.

469
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,792
That so?

470
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,295
Well, you heard about
the bank being robbed.

471
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,399
Yeah, I heard.

472
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,334
Papa's been awfully upset.

473
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,636
And mama and me, too, naturally.

474
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,805
I guess you would be.

475
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,941
So many people trusted Papa.

476
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,110
The Wilsons and Ludlows.

477
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,945
Even the Cartwrights.

478
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,938
I think it would just kill Papa
if they were to lose everything.

479
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,690
Well, I-I don't see
where it's his fault.

480
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,694
He feels responsible
to his friends.

481
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,329
Doesn't matter now, anyway.

482
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,165
We had some
real good news today.

483
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,234
Suppose you mean about
the army coming in.

484
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,170
Yes.
Isn't that wonderful?

485
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,071
Yeah.

486
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,840
Wonderful.

487
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,175
WOMAN:
Ellie?

488
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,776
Have you seen the napkins?

489
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,911
Yes, Miss Shoemaker.

490
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,846
They're in that basket
over there.

491
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,348
Well, come on, girl,
the party can't wait all day.

492
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,650
Mind setting them out?

493
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,318
Course not, Miss Shoemaker.

494
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,955
It was nice meeting
you, Mr. Kirby.

495
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,523
I hope to see you again.

496
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,193
Thank you, ma'am.

497
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,996
Well, as a matter of fact,
there's a dance next Thursday.

498
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,665
Doesn't amount to much,

499
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,266
but the Cartwright boys
usually come.

500
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,936
Why don't you come
along with them?

501
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,405
Well, thank you, ma'am.

502
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,106
I think I'd like that.

503
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,209
Thursday then.

504
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,609
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,045
Oh, let me get that.

506
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,319
LITTLE JOE: What are you
trying to do, Kirby?

507
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,627
I wouldn't say I was
trying to do anything.

508
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,096
Now, Little Joe, Mr. Kirby
and I were only talking.

509
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,764
Yeah, sure, I saw the way
he was talking.

510
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,266
It looked to me like
he was trying

511
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,634
to put his arm around you.

512
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,469
Joe Cartwright!

513
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:08,540
What business is this
of yours, Cartwright?

514
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,408
I'm making you my
business, Kirby.

515
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,211
Just because I've gone out
with you once or twice,

516
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,446
it doesn't give you the right

517
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,214
to think of me
as your personal property.

518
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,649
Now, you stay
out of this, Ellie!

519
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,051
There's a lot of questions I've
been wanting to ask you, Kirby.

520
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,720
Now is a good a time as any.

521
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,922
Well, I'm not answering
any questions.

522
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,223
Yeah, well, you're going to
answer this one:

523
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,124
Where were you Thursday night?

524
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,228
Joe!

525
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,936
Mr. Kirby, please!

526
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,689
Break it up, fellas.
Break it up, break it up.

527
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,124
Break it up!

528
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,787
When I say break it up,
I mean break it up!

529
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:12,971
It's all right, folks.

530
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,906
Everything's all right.

531
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,008
The boys were just getting
a little hungry, that's all.

532
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,244
I think Mr. McClure
would like us to adjourn

533
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,812
to the tables for a little food.

534
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,379
Yes, friends.

535
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,847
Over here.

536
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,482
We have fried chicken.

537
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,252
Sam...

538
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,355
Sam, we didn't mean no harm.

539
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,382
We-We didn't know your back
was scarred up like that.

540
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,996
You suppose it'd be all right
if I went along now?

541
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,165
Where do you want to go, Sam?

542
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,668
Back to the ranch...
if it's all right.

543
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,365
Of course it's all right.

544
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,041
Sam...

545
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,745
Little Joe
didn't mean nothin'.

546
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,914
We just wanted you to have
a good time, that's all.

547
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,177
BEN:
Hoss.

548
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,088
Sam...

549
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,290
put this on.

550
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,850
It'll cover your back.

551
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,026
Well, it wasn't much
of a picnic for him.

552
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,327
HOSS:
Pa?

553
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,461
Hmm?

554
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,623
You reckon what would do
a man's back like that?

555
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,101
About the only thing I could
figure is... a bullwhip.

556
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,221
What are you all looking at?

557
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,625
Aw, forget it, Joe, ain't
nobody looking at you.

558
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,560
All right, what was
I suppose to do?

559
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,328
You didn't have to poke him.

560
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,730
Oh, I didn't have to poke him.

561
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,598
Look, he's the one
that threw the first punch.

562
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,000
Come on, now.

563
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,836
You've been down on him ever
since he rode that horse.

564
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,706
I told you that's got
nothing to do with it.

565
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,407
Well, what is it then, Joe?

566
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,042
What have you got
against that boy?

567
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,243
All right, I'll tell you.

568
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,245
Rudy told me he saw him
in town Thursday night.

569
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,580
I wouldn't be surprised

570
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,606
if he had something to do
with the bank robbery.

571
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,088
Hey Joe, that's going a bit
too far, ain't it, boy?

572
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,290
That's a pretty
serious charge, Joe.

573
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,919
You have any real evidence
to support it?

574
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,230
Now, Rudy told me
he thought he saw him in town.

575
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,100
He thought he saw him in town.

576
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,160
And you call that real evidence?

577
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,873
Well, I guess not.

578
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,343
I'm sorry, Pa.
I should have known better.

579
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,178
All right.

580
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,646
Look, maybe I better
ride after him,

581
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,215
tell him I'm sorry.

582
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,013
Yeah. Good idea.

583
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,357
Come on, Cochise.

584
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,033
It's me--Sam.

585
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,454
(hoofbeats approaching)

586
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,872
Oh.

587
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,040
Hello, Sam.

588
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,241
How's the boy?

589
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,009
Just fine, Pardo.

590
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,544
Things quieting down?

591
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,214
No.

592
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,815
They're getting hot.

593
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:54,219
There's an army troop of cavalry
headed in from Fort McKay.

594
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,553
Yeah, when?

595
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,921
Well, they're due
in Virginia City

596
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,956
tomorrow afternoon.

597
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,224
What time?

598
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,925
I'm afraid they didn't say that.

599
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,327
(chuckles)

600
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,097
Oh, well... we'll
have plenty of time.

601
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,233
Where are the posses?

602
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,401
Well, I got them all spotted.

603
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,569
Yeah? You sure?

604
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,471
I had a good long look
at the map

605
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,906
in the sheriff's office.

606
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,641
In the sheriff's office?

607
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,676
They must have trusted you
pretty good.

608
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,079
Yeah, they trusted me fine.

609
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,647
Why?

610
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,315
No reason.

611
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,217
Where'd you get the new vest?

612
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,588
Adam Cartwright.

613
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,957
He, uh... he gave it to me.

614
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,159
He gave it to you.

615
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,928
I gotta hand it to you.

616
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,630
You sure got a way
with you, Sam.

617
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,132
Yeah.

618
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,269
All right, we'll take outta
here in the morning,

619
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,371
before the cavalry pulls in.

620
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,006
(chuckles)

621
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,207
Now, what's so funny?

622
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,810
That Cartwright feller,
giving you his vest.

623
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,802
(laughing)

624
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,480
Ramos!

625
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,610
There's one thing still left
for you to do, Sam.

626
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,546
I want you to go back
to the Ponderosa

627
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,783
and spend a little more time
with your friends.

628
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,518
Why?

629
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,721
Well, for one thing, you might
want to return that vest.

630
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,857
If you're thinking of turning on
me, Sam, you better forget it.

631
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,726
Now, what makes you say that?

632
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,563
I don't know, I just said it.

633
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,998
Now get back to that ranch

634
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,092
and find out which way the
soldiers are coming in.

635
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,006
Pardo, do I have
to go back there?

636
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,507
Yeah, you have to go back there.

637
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,170
(horse whinnies)

638
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,184
PARDO:
Where'd you find him?

639
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,052
Looks like he was trailing Sam.

640
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,254
Ramos and me thought you
might be interested.

641
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,889
Do you know him?

642
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,393
Yeah, it's Joe Cartwright.

643
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,762
It's a small world,
ain't it, Kirby?

644
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,431
I thought you said
you had them fooled.

645
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,934
No, not all of us.

646
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,902
What's that mean?

647
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,304
Nothing.

648
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,772
Just keep him here.

649
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,365
I'm going back to the ranch.

650
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,448
- Eh...
- Leave him alone!

651
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,447
Are you going soft, Sam?

652
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,689
Go ahead, tie him up.

653
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,190
Get on back to the Ponderosa

654
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,216
before those Cartwrights
get suspicious.

655
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,130
And find out which way

656
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,498
those horse soldiers are
coming in, you hear?

657
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,491
I hear you.

658
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,945
ADAM:
That you, Little Joe?

659
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,573
No, it's me--Sam.

660
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,281
Oh, I thought, uh,
Joe'd be with you.

661
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,688
Well, you thought wrong.

662
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,359
That's funny, he rode out of
town right after you did.

663
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,495
He felt kind of bad about what
happened at the picnic today.

664
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,432
He went after you
to tell you he was sorry.

665
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,333
Oh?

666
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,906
Well, you tell him
I said not to lose any sleep.

667
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,241
Sam, I haven't known
you for very long,

668
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,310
but I count you as a friend.

669
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,778
Let me tell you something:

670
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,380
A man's only got one friend,

671
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,615
one guy in the whole world
he can count on

672
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,284
who'd go out
on a limb for him--

673
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,752
and that's himself.

674
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,955
All right.

675
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,523
The sheriff's inside.

676
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,792
The sheriff?

677
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:58,196
Wants to talk to you, Sam.

678
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,186
But why me?

679
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,398
Why don't you ask him
that yourself?

680
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,612
That Ed Lemp--
I tried to convince him

681
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,514
to stick it out in this
territory, but...

682
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,952
He never did think this country
would amount to much.

683
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,286
Hired out to Arizona.

684
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,088
He did pretty well out there.

685
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,724
He had all that gold and silver
right here under his feet.

686
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,659
Yeah, and the lumber and cattle.

687
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,651
(door opening)

688
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,595
Hello, Sam.

689
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,403
Come in.

690
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,305
You know the sheriff.

691
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,864
- Yeah.
- Sam.

692
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,810
Sit down, Sam.

693
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,479
No, thanks.

694
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,850
Sheriff tells me he has some,
uh, some information about you.

695
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,953
I thought you'd want to be
here when he told us.

696
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,456
That's nice of you,
Mr. Cartwright.

697
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,326
Seems Sheriff Coffee here
got to worrying about you

698
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,962
this morning,
after we left his office.

699
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:08,332
Well, that was real nice
of you, too, Sheriff.

700
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,468
I sent a telegraph message
about you

701
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,970
down to Bar-B Ranch,
Old Ed Lemp.

702
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,740
Here's the answer.

703
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,976
It says they let you go
more than six months back

704
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,275
on account of your
prison record in Texas.

705
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,316
Did you check on that, too?

706
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,151
Didn't have to.

707
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,949
He sent the whole story.

708
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,159
Funny thing about a prison
record, Mr. Cartwright--

709
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,629
they say you do your time
and you pay your price...

710
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,791
but don't you believe it.

711
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,535
Sam, did you
serve your time out?

712
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,937
Eight years.

713
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,005
And I was pardoned.

714
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,041
I suppose they left that out!

715
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,043
It's all there.

716
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,478
Now, Roy, what's all this about?

717
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,583
Since when do we hound a man
that's paid for his mistake?

718
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,153
It wasn't exactly a mistake.

719
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,222
Now, just what does that mean?

720
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,057
He murdered his father
in cold blood.

721
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,055
Is what he's saying true?

722
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,699
Yeah.

723
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,567
Some.

724
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,569
He was my stepfather...

725
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,401
and he needed killing.

726
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,274
Nobody <i>needs</i> killing.

727
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,842
He did.

728
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,778
I was six years old
when my mother died.

729
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,282
You know what he did when
we come back from the funeral?

730
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,084
He took a whip to me.

731
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,653
"Just to show ya," he says.

732
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,889
"Just to show you things are
gonna be different from now on."

733
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,585
That was my stepfather.

734
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,661
I see.

735
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:48,399
From then on, he beat me
every day I can remember.

736
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,732
Except when he was too drunk!

737
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,040
Then it was he who...

738
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,376
who did that to your back.

739
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,140
He did.

740
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,815
So I waited.

741
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,115
I waited till I figured
I could handle him.

742
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,291
And I waited till
he was stone-cold sober.

743
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,993
I wanted him to know
what was happening

744
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,029
and who was doing it.

745
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,031
SHERIFF:
That's premeditated murder.

746
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,590
Yeah!

747
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,671
And then, one night,
he came for me...

748
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,739
and I <i>was</i> ready.

749
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,731
And I killed him.

750
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,780
I was 14 years old.

751
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,239
And that's what you served
your sentence for?

752
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,276
For ten years.

753
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,456
I served eight.

754
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,225
I think you'd better
come along with me, boy.

755
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,626
Sheriff, I'm not going
anywhere with you.

756
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,658
SHERIFF: Kirby, you haven't got
a chance against the four of us.

757
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,402
Sam...

758
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,612
Sam, put... put up your gun.

759
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,604
Put it away.

760
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,323
All right... now,
what's the charge against him?

761
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,325
No charge; don't need any.

762
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,461
He can't prove where
he was Thursday night,

763
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,129
and he's got a prison record.

764
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,597
That's enough to take him in.

765
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,930
No, it's not enough
to take a man off this ranch.

766
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,737
Now, what does that mean, Ben?

767
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,839
Roy, half the people
in this territory

768
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,007
couldn't prove where
they were Thursday night.

769
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,043
And as for a man
having a prison record,

770
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,774
once he's served his sentence,
his debt is paid, and that's it.

771
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,516
The boy stays here.

772
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,852
You're refusing
to cooperate with the law?

773
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,053
BEN:
I'm refusing to allow you

774
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,688
to lock the boy up
without a valid reason.

775
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,987
No law in the world
says you can do that.

776
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,560
I could deputize some men.

777
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,995
Well, Sheriff,
I reckon you better

778
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,657
get you a whole bunch of 'em.

779
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,934
All right, Ben.

780
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,003
But he's your responsibility.

781
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,139
Ben, you're stickin'
your neck out a country mile,

782
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,507
because if you've made a mistake

783
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,135
you're gonna have
to account for it.

784
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,640
(Ben sighs)

785
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,696
Well, Sam, it looks like
Little Joe and the rest of us

786
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,031
owe you a new shirt.

787
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,568
Yup. You go down and get
the best one you can find, Sam,

788
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,437
with pearl buttons and all.

789
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,598
BEN:
Sam....

790
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,008
...now what's been said here
has been said,

791
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,509
and that's the last of it.

792
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,279
I want you to know that you have
a home here on the Ponderosa

793
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,577
for just as long as you want it.

794
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,485
Uh, Pa, you'll
have to excuse Sam.

795
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,589
He, uh, has some theories about
people going out on a limb.

796
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,158
Guess they kind of
fell apart, huh?

797
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,693
(Ben chuckles)

798
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,062
That's where you're mistaken.

799
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,399
You all just made me see
how right I am.

800
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,069
So I got a home
on the Ponderosa, have I?

801
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,405
Well, I can't use it!

802
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,806
Sam!

803
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,708
Now, look, what did we say...

804
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,210
Forget it!

805
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,313
Just don't you do me any favors.

806
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,612
And don't you expect any!

807
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,801
Now, what got into him?

808
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:48,072
I guess he's not used to being
treated like a human being.

809
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,607
Mm.

810
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,743
I wonder why Little Joe
didn't come back with him?

811
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,712
Aw, Pa, he probably
got halfway out

812
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,581
and decided to go back
and make up to Ellie.

813
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,352
Mm. Should've
been home hours ago.

814
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,522
Strange boy, that Sam Kirby.

815
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,625
(chuckles softly) Well...
I guess that's what happens

816
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,394
when you've never been
given a helping hand.

817
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,930
Yeah, he got himself
so far out on that limb

818
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,667
he didn't quite know how
to get himself off.

819
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,603
(yawns) Well...
it's been a hard day, Pa.

820
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,138
Better get to bed.

821
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,308
Don't worry about
Little Joe, Pa.

822
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,310
He can take care of himself.

823
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,312
Yeah.
Good night, Hoss.

824
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,047
- Good night, Adam.
- Good night.

825
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,039
Good night, Pa.

826
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,120
He's sure enough worried
about Joe, ain't he?

827
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,955
Yeah, well, you know
how he always is about him.

828
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,294
Hey, where you going?

829
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,995
I'll be right back.

830
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,331
Do you think
you'll need any help?

831
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,993
Nah.

832
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,497
(door opens)

833
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,628
Couldn't even wait
till morning, huh?

834
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,331
Why you so touchy, Sam?

835
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,365
No reason.

836
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,801
I just want to get out of here.

837
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,136
(sighs)
So nothing my father said

838
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,905
made any difference to you, huh?

839
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,740
Why don't you Cartwrights
leave me alone!

840
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,976
I'm full up to here!

841
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,777
And here's your vest!

842
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,245
I don't want it!

843
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,048
Sam, is it really the kindness
that's killing you,

844
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,617
or is it something else?

845
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,320
I just don't like a lot
of people asking me questions.

846
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,956
Why not?
What have you got to hide?

847
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,258
Who says I got anything to hide?

848
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,761
Little Joe right
about you all along--

849
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,627
is that what's
bothering you, Sam?

850
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,898
(quietly):
Okay.

851
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
(grunts)

852
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,776
Adam?

853
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,424
Adam, are you around?

854
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,086
(door opens)

855
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,368
- What's the matter?
- I got hit in the head.

856
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,337
Kirby slammed into me
and ran off.

857
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,339
I guess he had us all fooled.

858
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,341
Yeah, and particularly me.

859
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,777
I think the sheriff
was right about him.

860
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,714
Little Joe, too.

861
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,049
He might have the answer
to Joe's whereabouts.

862
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,218
Now, let's get Hoss
and get saddled up

863
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:24,620
and pick up his trail
as soon as it turns light.

864
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,049
(punch lands)

865
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,564
All right, once more.

866
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,566
You're wasting your time.

867
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,900
Which way?

868
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,062
(hoofbeats approaching)

869
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,675
About time you
were getting here.

870
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,176
We gotta get moving.

871
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,812
What are you doing to him?

872
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,447
What'd you find out?

873
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,183
Did you find out which way the
horse soldiers were coming in?

874
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,186
No. I didn't get a chance.

875
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,989
Well, maybe we
still have a chance.

876
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,959
He probably knows
which way they're coming in.

877
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:05,262
Why don't we just
have you make him tell us.

878
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,424
Yeah, why don't
you make me talk, Sam.

879
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,235
Go on.

880
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,103
After all, you're
practically one of the family.

881
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,501
Well, what are you waiting for?

882
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,478
You ask him.

883
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,747
That living with the Cartwrights
is making you go soft.

884
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,216
It's his kind that put you
in jail and took eight years

885
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,818
out of your life--
you forgetting that?

886
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,953
No, I'm not forgetting that!
But I know the Cartwrights

887
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,622
well enough to know
that he won't talk.

888
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,324
Now, if we stay here any longer,
we'll never get out of here.

889
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,559
Let's get going now.

890
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,661
LITTLE JOE:
You'll never get out of here.

891
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,464
When my pa and brothers find out
I didn't come home all night,

892
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,432
them and the cavalry'll be
all over the place.

893
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,268
You're not gonna make it.

894
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,337
Maybe we won't, but you
won't be alive to know it.

895
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,572
Kill him.

896
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:49,840
Hold it, Linc.

897
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,209
Now, he just gave us the answer.

898
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,577
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

899
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:54,978
Take him with us.

900
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,581
Joe Cartwright
riding out there in front.

901
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,583
And if we get trouble from
any of the other Cartwrights,

902
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,211
he gets a bullet
right in the back.

903
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,322
Might work.

904
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,857
PARDO:
Ramos!

905
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,460
Go get Andy
and saddle up the horses.

906
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,096
Linc, get the money
out of the cave.

907
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,621
All right, Pardo.

908
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,097
Pardo!

909
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,253
You sure waited long enough.

910
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,355
You took ten years off my life.

911
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:42,417
Well, I just hope I didn't take
ten years off my life, too.

912
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,966
(sighs)
Eh, don't worry.

913
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,801
You got friends now.

914
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,633
Friends that'll stick by you.

915
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,273
Yeah, I know that.

916
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,798
I'll be all right.

917
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,946
What about those other two?

918
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,108
Yeah, let's pick 'em up.

919
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,385
Well, it looks like Little Joe
didn't wait for the army.

920
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,986
Hey, he's got Sam with him.

921
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,088
Looks like we was
wrong about Sam, Pa.

922
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:49,226
Yeah. Looks like we were
<i>all</i> wrong about Sam Kirby.

923
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,194
Hyah!

924
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,351
ANNOUNCER: <i>This has been</i>
<i>a color presentation</i>

925
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,946
