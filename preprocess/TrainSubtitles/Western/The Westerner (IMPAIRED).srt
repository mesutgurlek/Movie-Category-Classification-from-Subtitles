It's against the law to
build fences hereabouts.

- Mine.

You're no more a judge than I
am. Just call yourself a judge.

91
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:30,754
I wouldn't say that if I was you. I
might consider it contempt of court.

92
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,765
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

in the horse, Chickenfoot.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.

00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,246
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

108
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,839
All right, Judge, there he is.

109
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,149
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you

110
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:26,448
that the larceny of an equine is a
capital offense, punishable by death,

111
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,914
but you can rest assured that, in this court,

112
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:32,513
a horse thief always gets a
fair trial before he's hung.

113
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:37,319
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...

114
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,948
Can you prove it's your horse?

115
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:43,823
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it by Pete himself that he's my horse.

116
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,094
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?

117
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:51,421
Ownership of horse clearly
established. It belongs to Chickenfoot.

118
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,190
That's my ruling.

119
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,025
Well, I don't contest it, Your
Honor. Maybe the horse does belong

120
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,998
to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.

121
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,794
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.

- That's all.

125
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,798
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

126
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,803
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you
was summoned as a witness in this trial.

127
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,360
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner

128
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,132
isn't even allowed to
have anybody speak for him?

129
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:17,230
You an attorney, Miss?

130
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,330
I'm as much an attorney as you are a judge.

131
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,737
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.

132
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:22,035
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...

133
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:23,700
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.

134
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,470
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

135
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,306
and in this jurisdiction,
that's prima facie evidence.

136
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:32,812
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

137
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,808
The courtroom will now
be cleared of everybody,

138
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:41,905
excepting the judge, the jury,
the prisoner, the witnesses and...

139
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,040
I guess that means you.

140
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:47,312
All right, I'll go. I
don't want to see anymore.

141
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,417
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.

142
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,578
This man hasn't got a
chance, and you know it,

143
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:54,416
but you never give anybody a chance.

144
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:57,717
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

145
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,483
You thought you'd starve the
homesteaders out, but you didn't.

146
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:03,752
You can pester us and rob us and
kill us, but you can't stop us.

147
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,382
'Cause there'll always be
more coming. More and more.

148
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:11,415
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of
you, and your courtroom and your killers!

149
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:15,328
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.

150
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,919
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

Giddap.

152
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:42,028
You heard the case against
the accused, pro and con.

153
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:45,867
Now I guess maybe you'd better
retire to consider a verdict.

(HORSE HOOVES CLOPPING)

155

Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

156
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,166
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

157
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,210
And while you retire, there'll be
a recess for them that's thirsty.

158
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,248
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.

159
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,516
It's got to be strictly understood

160
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:20,076
you ain't making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

161
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,678
- Certainly not.
- There you are.

- Jury to the rear!

- Don't mind if I do.

with the bullet in her face.

Well, that's a long story, Judge.

182
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,552
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink, huh?

183
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,389
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?

184
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,796
- Rub of the brush. Go on.
- Rub of the brush?

185
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,423
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.

186
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:27,265
I said, did you get to know her real well?

187
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,434
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

188
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:37,496
Who said it's a barroom? This is a courtroom.

189
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,670
Say, tell me, is she as
pretty as them pictures?

190
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,400
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

191
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,206
Is she good-natured?

192

An angel.

203

You been down around Lanno Bay, ain't you?

206
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,372
Sure.

207
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,375

208

exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.

running in the bright sun?

217

- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.

218
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,184
In the daytime.

219
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:01,895
You mean it's different at night?

220
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:05,361
Well, not different,
but just sort of more so.

221
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,696
- How so?
- Well...

222
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:14,823
Well, you know how it is at dusk when you
see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

223
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:21,430
A sort of a deep... A
beautiful kind of blushing...

224

- Red?
- Red.

225
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:29,732
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.

226
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,035
I got a lock of her hair.

(JUDGE BEAN STUTTERS)

228
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:44,543
You mean to tell me you actually
got the real... From her head?

229
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,108
I don't suppose you'd ever
part with that lock of hair,

230
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:55,911
no matter what a man was willing to give?

231
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,074
A man don't trade things like that.

232
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,179
You see that sword up there?

233
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,382
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

234
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,753
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...

235
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:16,521
Would you really like to have it?

236
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,719
I'd rather own it than the state
of Texas. Let's have a look at it.

237
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,417
I haven't got it with me.

238
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:30,185
Where's it at?

239

It's with my stuff in El Paso.

- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:43,896
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.

- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.

247
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,445

of hair for anything in the world.

- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

There's only one thing I can do.

254
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,827
You're sentenced to hang, that's my ruling.

- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.

257
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,132
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,

258
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,831
but the court didn't say when. So
long as there's reasonable doubt...

259
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:20,600
What reasonable doubt, Judge?

260

- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!

262

I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.

263
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:36,273
Stands to reason no friend of Lily
Langtry goes around stealing horses.

264
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:38,142
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.

265
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,305
You mean, you're setting
aside your own ruling?

266
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,439
That ain't what I said. When
I make a ruling, it stands.

267
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,142
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.

268
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:47,045
His sentence is suspended

269
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:49,743
for a couple weeks until I can
look into the matter further.

Pardon me, you don't happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,997
No, not me.

278
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:51,165
Well, you'd better pay
me that money you owe me.

<i>You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.</i>

You owe me $60.

man that sold me the roan horse.

Then, he's the man that stole...

$84 and 6 bits.

Now, you men get some rope and string him up.

String him up? Why, he's dead already.

don't we? String him up!

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,872
Now, jerk it quick.

306
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:15,969
(CLICK)

307
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,510
Thank you. It's my neck.

308
00:30:21,482 --> 00:30:25,246
You see I was hung once, but
my friends cut me down in time.

309
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,548
Now when I don't live right,
why, the crick comes back on me.

310
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:39,088
(WHISTLING SOFTLY)

311
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:52,623
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?

312
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,087
Why, don't you remember?

313
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,891
Why, I'm the fellow that
filled the inside straight,

314
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,759
and won Chickenfoot's horse.

315
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,656
So long, Judge.

316
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:18,901
Hey, Pete, are you glad I
won you from Chickenfoot?

317
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:21,260
Well, that makes it nice.

318
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:22,871
Here.

319
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,413
Wait!

320
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:19,882
Wait!

321
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:11,400
That lock of hair, Lily's hair,

322
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:18,706
you promised to write to El Paso for
it. Don't you remember? We drank on it.

323
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:21,833
When are you going to do it?

324
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:29,377
Huh?

325
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,806
- You ain't going to crawfish?
- No, the first post office I come to.

326
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,279
Straighten her out, would you, son?

327
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:43,480
Thank you.

328
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,779
You mangy old scorpion, you
might have got us both killed.

329
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:01,214
(LAUGHING)

330
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:13,055
- What you want to go to California for?
- See the Pacific Ocean.

331
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,924
It's just like the gulf down at Lanno Bay.

332
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,626
It's bigger.

333
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:21,695
Why don't you stay around Vinegarroon awhile?

334
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:25,596
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...

335
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,429
No, I'm on my way.

336
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,361
Listen,

337
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:36,294
it's a great country here, west of the Pecos.

338
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,996
A fellow could really
make something of himself.

339
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,868
Why, when I first come
here, I didn't have nothing.

340
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,429
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.

341
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:47,767
Well, that's mighty fine, Judge.

342
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,809
You know, I cottoned to you
the first time I seen you.

343
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,900
Why don't you put in with me?

344
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:57,206
Well, I tell you, Judge,
it's nice of you to ask me,

345
00:35:57,278 --> 00:36:03,304
but I'm heading for California, and
nothing short of hanging can stop me.

346
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:09,077
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.

347
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,309
- Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.
- Huh?

348
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,373
You're under suspendence, anyhow.

349
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:16,577
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain't looking for you?

350
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:21,416
You're under arrest for disorderly
conduct, for disturbing the peace, vagrancy,

351
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:24,751
and you're on the way back to
town with me, and that's my ruling!

352
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:26,345
So long, Judge.

353
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:50,122
By gobs, he stole my gun.

354
00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:02,529
We hired out for farm
work, Miss, not a civil war.

355
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:04,571
This ain't no fit place to homestead in.

356
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:06,662
Land's no good when there's
always lead flying over it.

357
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,500
If you'd shoot back, maybe
they'd stop bothering you.

358
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:09,664
We did shoot back.

359
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,935
And so did Shad Wilkins, and
he ain't trying it no more.

360
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,906
What about your own quarter section?

361
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,534
- If you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.

362
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,304
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

363
00:37:19,377 --> 00:37:21,900
we'll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

364
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,171
Not me.

365
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:29,374
Henry, if we only had one
man, it'd be a big help.

366
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,175
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

367
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:42,048
JANE ELLEN: Call themselves men.

368
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:52,181
Wade, what do we do?

369
00:37:57,225 --> 00:38:01,784
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.

370
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,724
Don't even think of it.

371
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:08,461
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?

372
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,362
I'll be back.

373
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,460
Well, they left.

374
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,435
Of course they have. What did you expect?

375
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:30,333
My hands quit, too. You
can't blame them for leaving.

376
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:32,394
There won't be a hired man
left in this part of the country

377
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:33,904
if we don't do something about it.

378
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:36,303
We hire new hands, same thing will happen.

379
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,272
What's old Mathews going to say about it?

380
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,307
He keeps passing the
buck to the Lord Jehovah.

381
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,308
I say, let's do something about it ourselves.

382
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,206
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.

383
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:47,676
Let's give the judge the same
thing he gave Shad Wilkins.

384
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:52,202
Maybe if some of us went down and
appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

385
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,441
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

386
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,174
The man didn't have a chance.

387
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,272
- I wonder if they hanged him.
- Don't they always?

388
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,282
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

389
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,943
I've kept on seeing his face all day.

390
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:12,153
(EX CLAIMS)

391
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,485
What is it, Daughter?

392
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:20,115
The man I told you about,
the one that was hanged.

393
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,249
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

394
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:30,254
You're seeing things, Jane
Ellen. There's nobody out there.

395
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,486
I saw his face, I tell you.

396
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:35,428
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

397
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,453
Come in.

398
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:41,887
Good evening.

399
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:52,399
Pardon me for intruding like this.

400
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:57,960
(STAMMERING) Oh, no, you're not. It's
just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.

401
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,437
Well, I guess you're partly to blame I'm not.

402
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:06,463
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...

403
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:10,031
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

404
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:12,069
Glad to meet you.

405
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,306
Oh, Mr. Harden, this is
our neighbor Wade Harper.

406
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,876
This is the man I told you about.

407
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,812
You mean to tell me Bean
tried you, and let you go?

408
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,780
Well, she was my lawyer. I guess
she's the one that got me off.

409
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:28,179
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.

410
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,414
How did you know that?

411
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:34,508
I just knew.

412
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,043
Are you working anywhere?

413
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:41,910
No, I'm heading for California.

414
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:48,182
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

415
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,247
You must stay for supper.

416
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:57,219
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.

417
00:40:57,294 --> 00:41:00,318
Matter of fact, we had some
company that just disappointed us.

418
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,794
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd
show up to take their place.

419
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:07,092
Make yourself at home,
now. Make yourself at home.

420
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,729
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

421
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:29,067
CALIPHET: Oh, Lord, for that which
thou hast sent us in our hour of need,

422
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,031
make us truly grateful.

423
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:37,307
Bless this food to our use and
ourselves to thy service. Amen.

424
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,801
Let me help you.

425
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:43,335
How about some hominy?

426
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:45,072
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.

427
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:46,908
Give him some milk.

428
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,879
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.

429
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,381
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.

430
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,214
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He's so big and strong.

431
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:02,684
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.

432
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,379
Now, Jane Ellen, we'll
leave you alone with him,

433
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:07,683
and you kind of add on a little more welcome.

434
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,347
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.

435
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:15,152
And, Daughter, if it should come up natural
- like,

436
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:18,521
you might hint what a handsome man he is.

437
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,386
Handsome?

438
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,656
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

439
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,693
We need him terribly bad.

440
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:29,127
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.

441
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,493
Look out.

442
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:34,395
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?

443
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:37,262
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. Now, I'll go see about your bunk.

444
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:40,129
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

445
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:55,570
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.

446
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,969
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.

447
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,576
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

448
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:06,270
Well, what do you do about
the dishes when you're home?

449
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:08,504
Home? What? You mean in a house?

450
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,777
Well, you live in a house, don't you?

451
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:16,313
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

452
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:21,314
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.

453
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:26,376
Well, I guess California's
your next stop, huh?

454
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:31,852
California, but I don't
stop. Oregon next, I guess.

455
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,145
Well, all places aren't just the same.

456
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:38,814
Wouldn't you rather stay a
little longer in some places?

457
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,618
No, they're all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

458
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:45,356
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

459
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:47,825
If I had to build me a
house, I'd have it on wheels.

460
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,786
Not me. I'd want my house so
that nothing could ever move it.

461
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:56,125
So down deep that an
earthquake couldn't shake it,

462
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:59,888
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going by.

463
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:06,224
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"

464
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:10,763
And I say, "I hope you'll
be very happy in your house. "

465
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:24,369
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.

466
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:25,771
What?

467
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:28,206
I'll bet I know something we could agree on.

468
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:29,367
What's that?

469
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,376
Well, in about a week now,
we're going to husk the corn,

470
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,169
and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.

471
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:36,245
(EX CLAIMS QUESTIONINGLY)

472
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:39,508
Well, you know, I think husking
corn's the greatest fun in the world.

473
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:42,838
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!

474
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,943
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.

475
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:54,248
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.

476
00:44:57,587 --> 00:44:59,144
Oh, Mr. Harden.

477
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,553
What a handsome man you are.

478
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:13,859
(SIGHS)

479
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:16,227
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.

480
00:45:16,294 --> 00:45:19,659
Well, I hope I see you in
the morning before I leave.

481
00:45:27,032 --> 00:45:29,191
Get out of here! Hey!

482
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,394
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

483
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,461
with a lot of cows...

484
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,102
If we had some men that would ride fence,

485
00:45:48,174 --> 00:45:51,073
there wouldn't be any cows in the cornfield.

486
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:55,869
You were sure cute last night.

487
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:58,675
Now you're making fun of me.

488
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:02,337
Well, that's... That's
more fun than picking corn.

489
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:11,445
Hey, look at your father. I wonder what's up.

490
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:21,810
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

491
00:46:21,886 --> 00:46:22,885
Wade!

492
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:25,512
Yes, yes. It's the wrong
and lawless thing to do.

493
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:29,249
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?

494
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:31,653
Wade Harper has rounded up some of the men.

495
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:33,884
They going to town to lynch Judge Bean.

496
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,788
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

497
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,189
They took our wagon.

498
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:37,013
Thunder and lightning! You
back from California already?

499
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:38,878
You got to get out of here,
and don't stop for nothing.

500
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,949
Did you write to El Paso?

501
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:42,313
Listen, just get on your horse
and get, because they're after you.

502
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:44,977
Did you write? Who's after me?

503
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:47,278
The homesteaders. They're
going to string you up.

504
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:49,615
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!

505
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:52,154
They're outside right now,
a whole wagonload of them.

506
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,417
A wagonload? Why, I can
handle a train load of them.

507
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:57,880
I'll tear their livers out.

508
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,363
What'll it be, gentlemen?

509
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,460
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

510
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:29,830
He's out for a while.

511
00:48:31,237 --> 00:48:34,398
That's because you came
down here and warned him.

512
00:48:48,276 --> 00:48:50,436
Make a move and I'll kill you.

513
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,103
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

514
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:01,913
uncork them rifles now and set
them down this end of the bar,

515
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:02,981
easy-like.

516
00:49:04,616 --> 00:49:06,242
Go on.

517
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,945
Get back. Get back.

518
00:49:33,394 --> 00:49:35,485
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

519
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:20,476
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

520
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,808
We're not drinking with
you, Harden, nor him, either.

521
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:31,443
I ain't serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

522
00:50:31,516 --> 00:50:33,813
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge,

523
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,515
we don't want any harsh words to spoil
this friendly little get-together.

524
00:50:37,585 --> 00:50:38,779
JUDGE BEAN: Get-together?

525
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:43,246
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

526
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:47,386
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

527
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:52,013
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there's always two sides to any question.

528
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:54,783
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

529
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:57,052
We're not asking you to speak for us, Harden.

530
00:50:57,193 --> 00:50:58,353
JUDGE BEAN: No, nor me, either.

531
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:02,888
Well, that makes it unanimous. I'm
going to talk for the both of you.

532
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,925
There's a law here against fencing land

533
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:09,963
that seems nothing short of
murder to people raising crops,

534
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:12,264
but it's common sense to men running cattle.

535
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:16,290
I've seen this kind of war before.

536
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,697
It's happening now, back
in Kansas and Nebraska.

537
00:51:19,635 --> 00:51:21,294
The cattlemen came in first,

538
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:24,097
then the homesteaders moved
in and fenced them out.

539
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,399
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

540
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:30,232
so the homesteaders moved out,

541
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,738
and the rush and thistle and jimson moved in.

542
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:35,672
And the big spaces were all broken
up by little quarter sections,

543
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:37,934
and the homesteads left empty,

544
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:41,271
and the houses caved in, and the
land, no good for man or cattle.

545
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:44,139
You spoiled the land, then you
came here to spoil this land.

546
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:45,610
This here's a big country.

547
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,908
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

548
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,276
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.

549
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,638
All right, Bean, we're going.

550
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:01,042
We're going back to build our fences.

551
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,013
If you do, you better build
coffins along with them. Now, get.

552
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,729
You sure told them off, son.

553
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,670
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.

554
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:03,003
I'm sorry I stopped them from lynching you.

555
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:05,099
They got a right to defend their homesteads.

556
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:07,868
You know this ain't homestead
land. You just said so yourself.

557
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:11,274
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.

558
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:14,471
Judas Priest, I don't see how you
can talk up for scum like that.

559
00:53:14,546 --> 00:53:16,672
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

560
00:53:16,747 --> 00:53:18,441
When you make war on them, you're making war

561
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:20,708
on their women and kids, too.

562
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:22,806
Those people were starved out last year.

563
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:25,873
I heard about those cattle
being stampeded over their crops,

564
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,883
and there's too many strays running
loose in that valley right now,

565
00:53:29,118 --> 00:53:30,914
only they're not strays.

566
00:53:32,486 --> 00:53:34,214
What do you want me to
do? Arrest them cattle,

567
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:36,719
and fine them a couple
dollars apiece for trespass?

568
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:39,188
Now, look,

569
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:44,490
those people don't take up much room with
their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

570
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:48,322
Why don't you be a real
judge for all of the people?

571
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,093
Why don't you try to see their side of
it, and help them instead of fight them?

572
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:56,754
Make peace around here instead of war.

573
00:53:57,563 --> 00:54:01,758
There's plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody'd look up to you.

574
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,530
And then someday, maybe they'd put
up a statue out there in the street,

575
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:14,390
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge. "

576
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,163
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

577
00:54:20,738 --> 00:54:22,035
I guess I'm wasting my time.

578
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:24,334
Hold on, wait a minute. You
write that letter to El Paso yet?

579
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:27,305
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.

580
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:30,533
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

581
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:32,939
You did? Well, why didn't
you give it to me then?

582
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:37,440
You old bullhead, if I'd have
given it to you, you'd have hung me.

583
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,000
Wouldn't you?

584
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:42,678
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.

585
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,737
Suffering, bleeding
Chickamauga! Where's it at?

586
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,241
I left it over at the Mathews' place.

587
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:48,812
- How is she?
- Huh?

588
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:51,178
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.

589
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:54,712
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?

590
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:57,046
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?

591
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,280
When the last steer's out of the valley.

592
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,578
All right, I'll pass the
word around to the boys.

593
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,315
No, you don't. You're going
to help run those cattle out,

594
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,618
and I'm going along with
you to see that it's done.

595
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,880
Don't you trust me, Cole?

596
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,987
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.

597
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:17,390
I was fond of it, but I
wouldn't turn my back on it.

598
00:55:18,761 --> 00:55:20,387
(LAUGHING)

599
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:21,825
You're all right.

600
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:25,757
I'm going back now, and gathering
my stuff for the roundup.

601
00:55:28,164 --> 00:55:31,359
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

602
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:46,431
WADE: He defended Bean. He said he was right.

603
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:49,704
Said the homesteaders spoiled this
land for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

604
00:55:49,773 --> 00:55:51,467
JANE ELLEN: I don't care what you heard.

00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,302
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.

606
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:56,299
If he took Bean's part, he
only did it to stop trouble.

607
00:55:57,409 --> 00:55:58,875
Miss Mathews,

608
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:03,242
looks like every time I get into
trouble, you always speak up for me.

609
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:05,778
They're trying to tell
me you spoke up for Bean.

610
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:10,108
Well, I did try to tell
them Bean's point of view.

611
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,180
There you are.

612
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:14,641
It's always been my experience

613
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:18,114
that when you know the other fellow's
point of view, you usually get together.

614
00:56:18,817 --> 00:56:21,284
Well, why didn't you tell
him our point of view?

615
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:22,750
I did, and we got together.

616
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,052
You won't have to patrol
your fields any longer.

617
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,178
Judge gave me his word they'd
round up all cattle in this valley

618
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,346
and take them out of here.

You think he'd keep his word?

621
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:36,817
Well, I'm going along with
him to see that he does.

622
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:39,756
Well, what makes you
think we'd take your word?

623

Take it or leave it.

00:56:45,394 --> 00:56:46,724

625
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:50,320

00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:53,272
- Well?
- How's Wade?

632

He's fine, just fine.

You know, you're not the
prettiest girl I ever saw.

634
00:59:06,415 --> 00:59:08,575
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?

635
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,739
But you've got the prettiest hair I ever saw.

636
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,610
Why do you like to make fun of me?

637
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,419
'Cause I like you, I guess.

638

- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.

- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.

Go on, Cole. Go on.

650
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:37,829
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,

651
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,529
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

652
01:02:43,032 --> 01:02:46,023
And she said to me... She said,

653
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:51,995
"No. " Said she loved the
United States too much.

654
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:53,659
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here

655
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,829
for the rest of her life.

656
01:02:57,572 --> 01:03:00,505
She told me that when she got all
through her work in the theater,

657
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:03,267
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

658

away from all the lights and the crowds.

661
01:03:15,378 --> 01:03:17,810
She kept asking about Texas especially.

662
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:25,710
She says that ever since she was a
little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

663
01:03:27,216 --> 01:03:31,275
and it'd always been the dream of
her life to have a home here someday.

664
01:03:32,384 --> 01:03:34,943
- She did?
- She did.

01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:50,395
A lock of her own hair!

671
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,429
It's kind of dark, ain't it?

672
01:06:00,176 --> 01:06:02,870
Yeah, she uses lots of shampoo on her hair.

673
01:06:02,976 --> 01:06:03,975
She does?

674
01:06:05,011 --> 01:06:07,569
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

675
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:12,811
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

676
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:19,312
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?

677
01:06:20,383 --> 01:06:22,247
I ain't going to keep it.

678
01:06:23,118 --> 01:06:25,107

homestead land in the whole country.

704

and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.

Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.

707
01:09:18,685 --> 01:09:20,743
Yeah, look at the feed on
those slopes over there,

708
01:09:21,353 --> 01:09:24,684
and that strip along the bottom
is just fine for wheat or corn.

little knoll right there,

it's just begging for a house.

- No, how?

right things in it, too.

760
01:20:01,601 --> 01:20:04,363
Sure you will, and me, too.

761
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:07,034
I don't want you.

762
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,931
I don't want any of Roy
Bean's friends around.

763

Wade Harper was right. I didn't
believe it then, but I do now.

You knew we were going to be burned out.

765
01:20:18,673 --> 01:20:19,969
That's why you herded all the cattle out,

766
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,405
so they wouldn't be burned with our crops.

767
01:20:24,876 --> 01:20:29,436
No, I don't need your help. Not now.

768
01:20:31,146 --> 01:20:33,044
I can do what I have to do alone.

769

Why, Cole!

773
01:21:22,765 --> 01:21:24,823
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.

774
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,196
Why, I never wanted to see a
man so much before in my life.

775

- What for?
- What for?

776
01:21:28,734 --> 01:21:31,429
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.

777
01:21:31,701 --> 01:21:34,533
- Lily Langtry's coming to Fort Davis.
- Langtry?

778
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,795
Langtry, yeah, and you and me
are going over there together.

779
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:39,667
You're going to introduce me to
her. By gobs, I'm going to meet her.

780
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:41,602
- I just can't believe it.
- I want to talk to you, Judge.

781
01:21:41,672 --> 01:21:43,696
Yeah, all right. And look what
I got to tell her when I see her.

782
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:47,673
Langtry, that's the name of this
town, a great town after a great woman.

783
01:21:48,008 --> 01:21:50,237
- I said I wanted to talk to you, Judge.
- Sure.

01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:53,868
Cole, it's a great day.

785
01:21:53,944 --> 01:21:56,740
I tell you, it's the greatest
day in the history of Texas.

786
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:03,207
- Some fire, huh?
- Yeah, wasn't it, though?

787
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:05,839
- Yeah, too bad.
- Yeah.

788
01:22:07,082 --> 01:22:08,081
Yep.

789
01:22:08,616 --> 01:22:11,606
- I wonder who was behind it?
- Oh, a fire don't need nothing behind it.

790
01:22:11,684 --> 01:22:14,480
Fire has a way of moving
on its own. Here's how.

791
01:22:17,386 --> 01:22:20,320
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want
to know you had nothing to do with it.

792
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:22,854
Me? Why, how can you say a thing like that?

793
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:24,545
Didn't I round up all them cattle for you?

794
01:22:24,622 --> 01:22:26,953
Wasn't I right here in the
saloon when the fire broke out?

Didn't...

796
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:34,183
Well, I was, and what's more,
I ain't got no idea who done it.

797
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,283
Now, drink up.

798
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,596
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

799
01:22:47,831 --> 01:22:52,731
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was,
and I don't want you calling me no liar.

800
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:55,560
Now, drink hearty.

Will you swear by that?

01:23:01,836 --> 01:23:03,928
There ain't no reason I
should, but I'm willing.

803
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:07,701
All right, I swear by my sword
there I had nothing to do with it.

- Let me see it.

Swear on that?

809
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:35,979
All right, it was me. I
burned their houses and crops.

- I run them varmints out.
- Nice going.

And if you think...

If you think I'm sorry, you're crazy.

813
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,918
I'm proud and glad I rid the country of them.

814
01:23:46,987 --> 01:23:50,512
It was either them or us, and now
the range grass will grow back,

815
01:23:50,589 --> 01:23:52,715
and some day, the cattlemen
will put up a statue of me

816
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:54,757
out there on the street,
and they'll write on it,

"Judge Roy Bean, he give us back the land. "

You get warrants in Fort Davis, don't you?

819
01:24:02,727 --> 01:24:03,818
Yeah, that's where they get them,

820
01:24:03,894 --> 01:24:05,121
but they don't know how to spell my name.

821
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:07,024
- It's been tried before.
- I'll get one.

had to, and you think it was wrong.

But if it was my own son
come over here with a warrant,

826

the back before I get out of here.

So long, Cole.

829

out the duties of deputy sheriff

you? They're coming back.

915
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:36,554
Wagons by the score.

916
01:38:38,065 --> 01:38:39,497
It's the promised land.

917
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,499
Jane Ellen,

918
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:46,626
someday, Texas is going to be
the biggest and the finest...
