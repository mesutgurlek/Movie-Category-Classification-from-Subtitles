00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
My friend Grey Wolf likes to play tricks.

3
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,880
Next time I kill you.

4
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm glad you put it off.

5
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
- Any reason for this?
- Because you are here.

6
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm here to see your brother.
Red Cloud and I happen to be friends.

7
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,240
[Grey Wolf] There is no friendship between
red man and white. The fight is to the end.

8
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,640
Ride back to your people.
There is no room for you here.

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,640
You've grown a big mouth, Grey Wolf.

10
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,520
I didn't come to talk to a big mouth,
I've come to talk to a big man.

11
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,520
- Hello, Red Cloud.
- Johnny Hawks.

12
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,680
- I was told you were dead.
- Somebody lied.

13
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,600
I did a little fighting in the war.

14
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,080
White man against white. We were hoping
you would kill each other off.

15
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,320
- Didn't last that long.
- Too bad.

Hunting.

19
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
Hunting what?

20
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,640
Why are you here?

21
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm on my way to the new fort.

22
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,000
I wanted to say hello to an old friend.

23
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,840
Why are you here?

24
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,840
- There's a wagon train at the fort.
- I know.

25
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,640
Will you let it pass through?

26
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Why not? I am at peace.

27
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,840
- Between killings?
- I kill only those who break my law.

28
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
What law is that?

29
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,520
White men must not come into our land
looking for gold.

30
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Gold? I didn't know there was any around.

31
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
White men must not come
and trade whiskey for gold.

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,960
It takes two to make a trade.

33
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,720
I've punished both.

34
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Come.

35
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,560
- They broke the law.
- They look sorry for it.

36
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll help you keep your law.
But we'll punish our own lawbreakers.

37
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Good.

38
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,920
You believe a man
who has killed so many of us?

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,320
He's killed twice as many of mine.

40
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,560
Is the captain of the fort to be trusted?

41
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Come and speak to him.
You two might get along good.

42
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,720
- I will be there tomorrow.
- I'll tell him.

Not until you have eaten with your friends.

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Thanks, Red Cloud, but I think I should...

46
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,640
I am kind of hungry.

47
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Open it.

48
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,520
Looks like gold.

49
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
Feels like it.

50
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
Tastes like gold. Where does it live?

51
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,480
- I hope you will never learn.
- Why?

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,960
It would make me unhappy to see
your hair growing on a stick.

But you're rich. Gold will buy horses,
blankets. You're very rich.

Will it bring back the buffalo
your people will kill?

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,520
Will it clean the streams your people will
fill with filth as they search for yellow iron?

58
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,560
Will it bring back the beauty of the land?

I'm already rich in the only wealth I want -

that which you see about us.

Think of these things
while you are waiting for sleep.

Are you angry because
I saw you in the water?

63
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,360
I've seen your mother wash you
when you were that high.

64

I am not that high any more.

Who did?

- Just doing some night hunting.

to come and tell it to Captain Trask.

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Maybe an old friend could persuade you.

161
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,000
[Trader Joe] Wes Todd.

162
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,720
I thought you was dead.

163
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,160
Well, I just ain't, Chiv.

164
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,400
I guess he's persuaded.
Let's see the captain.

165
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,200
- What did you hit me for?
- Shut up.

166
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,040
- Play along.
- I don't get this.

167
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,120
When the reinforcements arrive,
we must fight, teach Red Cloud a lesson.

168
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,800
Sir, I agree.

169
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm trying to prevent a war, not start one.

170
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Man from Laramie is here. Johnny Hawks.

171
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,440
Send him in.

172
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,120
About time.

173
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,320
- Howdy, Captain.
- Mr Hawks.

174
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,440
- How many men did Laramie send?
- Just me.

175
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,560
One man can't handle an uprising.
I don't care who he is.

176
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,120
What uprising?

177
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,600
A band of Sioux ran amok last night,
scalped one of our men.

178
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,960
- They did?
- Chivington saw it.

179
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,280
He's right outside. Come in.

180
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,480
Take off your hat.

181
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,800
- [Lieutenant Blake] Who's he?
- The man who was scalped.

182
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,400
- What's the meaning of this?
- Well, sir...

183
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,800
Is this the man you said was scalped?

184
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,360
Yes, sir, but I didn't have...

185
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Have they finished the guardhouse yet?

186
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,160
- Just about, sir.
- Lock him up.

187
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,400
Yes, sir.

188
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,880
- I'm glad you weren't scalped.
- Lock him up.

189
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,840
I would've been burned alive
if it weren't for Johnny.

190
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,920
- You were there?
- Thought I'd see the Indians first.

191
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
Now you know the trouble we're in.

192
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,760
The trouble's not with the Indians.

193
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,280
It's settlers like Chivington
trading whiskey for gold.

194
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,120
I wish I could get rid of that wagon train.

195
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,040
I was sent to guide them
through the Sioux country.

196
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,680
I can't send women and children out
with Indians on the warpath.

197
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
They're not on the warpath.

198
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,960
Red Cloud wants to
settle things peaceably.

199
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,080
You think we can trust him?

200
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,480
He's worried if he can trust you.

201
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,920
Why?

202
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,760
Any of his people break the law,
Red Cloud puts them to death.

203
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,880
- You want me to hang Chivington?
- We're not Indians, we're civilised.

204
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,320
- But you gotta do something.
- I put Chivington in the guardhouse.

205
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,800
Sure, but don't neglect his partner.

206
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Partner?

207
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,720
He was with him.

208
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,160
Lock him up.

209
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,160
Now, where do you suppose
I can meet Red Cloud?

210
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
- Lock this one up too.
- How about right here?

211
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,480
It would be a mistake
to bring the enemy here.

212
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,120
- I agree.
- I disagree. I'll take responsibility.

213
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,920
- But Captain...
- It's all settled.

214
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,160
How long would it take you
to get Red Cloud here?

215
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,760
He's on his way now.

216
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,680
Excuse me.

217
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,480

- Just enough to stay alive.

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,200
Russ Jenkins said you killed more Indians
than Davy Crockett.

222

Ma don't like Indian fighting, says it's silly.

223

- What's your pa say?
- Ain't got a pa.

- But I got a grandpa.
- What's he say?

225
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,400
He's in Oregon.
Have you got a real Indian arrow?

226
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,560
- Not on me but I'll get you one.
- Off a dead Indian?

227
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,400
- Off a live one, if you don't mind.
- Ah...

228
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,400
Or you can get one yourself tomorrow
from Red Cloud.

229
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440

- That's right.

Stop that nonsense. Get down.

234
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,280
They are too.
Johnny Hawks just told me so.

So you're the Indian fighter fella.

Why's a man like you scaring
little boys about Indians?

239
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
They're coming to sign a peace treaty.

240
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,440
Last treaty didn't do me much good -
my husband died at Vicksburg.

241
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,080
- Sorry to hear it.
- It ain't your fault.

Which side of the war were you on?

Thank you. Won't put you out?

247

Feeding a man never put me out,
providing he's got an appetite.

Thank you. I got the appetite.

I can't figure you.
I can't figure Johnny Hawks.

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,920
- I can't figure nothing.
- Don't you see what he's doing?

255
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,040
I figure I owe you a bust in the nose.

256
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,680
- Johnny's a smart operator.
- I owe him a bust in the nose too.

257
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,720
He puts over this peace powwow
so he can have the field to himself.

That's the way he fixes the peace treaty,

to scare off everybody but Johnny Hawks.

00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,040
[Wes] Thanks for getting us
out of the jailhouse, partner.

315
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,840
Don't thank me. You carry
your luck around your neck.

316
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,080
Could be you're right.
Maybe some of it'll rub off on you.

317
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,880
It might. We're gonna be
real close on this trip.

318
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,560
Me and Wes'll be right behind you.

319
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,400
That's a pleasant thought.

320
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,320
[Briggs] Johnny.

321
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,760
Look at that scenery.

322
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,440
- What's the matter with it?
- Needs photographing.

323
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,480
I like it the way it is.

324
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,840
When I was working for Mr Brady,
photographing the Civil War,

325
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,880
I said to him, Mr Brady...

326
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,920
I always call him mister.

327
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,760
I said, Mr Brady, I'm not a genius like you,

328
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,360
but you're gonna be proud of me cos I'm
gonna photograph the whole Wild West.

329
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,040
Why?

330
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,960
I want everyone to see it.

331
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Why?

332
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,960
When they see it, they'll come, thousands
of them. Isn't that reason enough?

333
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,440
That's reason enough
to bust that camera over your head.

334
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Don't you want to open up
the West to civilisation?

335
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,320
Come here.

336
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,480
Ah, maybe you won't understand this.

337
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,040
To me, the West is like a beautiful woman.

338
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,920
My woman.

339
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,520
I like her the way she is,
I don't want her changed.

340
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm jealous, I don't want
to share her with anybody.

341
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,040
Uh-uh.

342
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,080
I'd hate to see her civilised.

343
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,760
Would you rather I didn't take any photos?

344
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,560
If you don't, others will.

345
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,880
It's so beautiful.

346
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,480
Come on, there's plenty more up ahead.

347
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,400
Oh, here, I'll give you a hand.

348
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Come on. Give me your arm.

349
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,480
Angel with us? Come on, let's go.

350
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,520
[Briggs] Come on, Angel.

351
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,120
[? Guitar playing]

352

353

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,160

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,360
? One wore blue and one wore grey

356
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,960
? As they marched along their way

357
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,400

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760

? One came home, one stayed behind

361
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,440

362
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,720
? A cannonball don't pay no mind

363
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,880
? Though you're gentle or you're kind

364
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,920

365
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,040

? Two girls waitin' by the railroad track

368
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,840

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,640
? There on a beautiful... ?

373
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,800
That's an Indian knife, ain't it?

374
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,160
- Used to be.
- Did you fight for it?

375
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Yep. Quite a tussle.

376
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,280
Tell us. Will you, Johnny? Tell us?

377
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,880
No stories now. You get to bed. Come on.

378
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,720
I don't wanna go to bed.

379
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,760
Good night, Tommy.

380
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,720
In you go. See you tomorrow. [Chuckles]

381
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,720
Think we'll see any Sioux
before we get through?

382
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,760
Hope so. They're good for trading.

383
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,400
Stealing and killing.

384
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,520
No more than most people I know.

385
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,560
- Like Indians, don't you?
- Yeah, I like Indians.

386
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,520
I like whites too.

387
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,640
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

388
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,920
Why don't you come through to Oregon?

389
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,040
What'll I do in Oregon?

390
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,600
It's rich country. Every man's entitled
to 640 acres, free and clear.

391
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,920
- I can't see myself behind a plough.
- Why not?

392
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
- I'm no good at plantin' seeds...
- Why not?

393
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,880
Cos he's a Indian fighter, that's why!

394
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,000
You get back to bed and you stay there.

395
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,600
Boy's getting to be a problem.

396
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,480
You're a fine woman, Susan.
I wish I had half your character.

397
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I got enough for both of us.

398
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,000
It'd take more than you think. I'm shiftless.

399
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,960
- Training would take care of that.
- It's in my bones.

400
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,480
When I'm supposed to be tending crops,
I'd be off fishing. I'm no good for farming.

401
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,520
Who's talking about farming?

402
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,920
I'd want my husband out shooting and
trapping, bringing home fish and game.

403
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,200
Farming wouldn't hardly interfere.

404
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Some men are
natural born husbands but...

405
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,200
- I just ain't good for that.
- You ain't never tried.

406
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,560
Well... Well, Susan, it hurts me
to own up to this, but...

407
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,480
I ain't fit for marriage.

408
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,640
Sure hate to hear a man run himself down.

409
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,680
I've given it a lot of thought...

410
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,920
Hiya, Will.

411
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,560
Thanks for the apple.

412
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,680
I've got some horse inspecting to do.
See you in the morning.

413
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,600
As the old saying goes,
two's company and three's a crowd.

414
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,240
Should've thought of that
before you came crashing in here.

415
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,080
Susan, any place you are is where I belong.

416
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,560
There's something I'd like to tell you
but I ain't had the chance.

417
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,600
I'm the best apple grower
ever to come out of Michigan.

418
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,240
Hey, that's a big fella.

419
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,240
About six rattles, he must be five feet long.

420
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,000
- What you got?
- Rattler.

421
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,640
I'll show you how to kill a rattlesnake.

422
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,160
[Wes] Hey, Johnny!

423
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,760
[Women screaming]

424
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,040
Blew his head right off.

425
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,080
I told you. That's the best way
to kill a rattler.

426
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,160
Flipped that snake right at him.
What if he'd missed?

427
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,600
No chance.

428
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,320
I never miss a snake.

429
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,600
Tommy, catch.

430
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,920
Thanks, Johnny!
Look, Mom, Johnny killed a rattler.

431
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
All right, everybody, let's move on.

432
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,440
[Men] Yah! Yah!

433
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,080
Hey!

434
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,840
- Giddup there!
- Giddup! Yah!

435
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
That was a close shave.

436
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
But I was ready,
I got good medicine for snakebites.

437
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,440
Hey, you mean I have to go
find another snake?

438
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,680
- What are they palavering about?
- Did you fix it up with Trader Joe?

439
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,400
He'll give us blasting powder, shovels,
everything, for an equal cut.

440
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,720
Too many coming in for an equal cut.

441
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,920
- I don't trust him.
- Who, Trader Joe?

442
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
- No, Johnny Hawks, you meathead.
- Oh.

443
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,280
[Morgan] Mr Hawks!

444
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,320
- Ain't the main trail down there?
- Yep.

445
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,520
Why go this way?
It's a hard pull up them hills.

446
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,000
Think how easy it'll be
sliding down the other side.

447
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,560
That's right in the middle of Sioux country.

448
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,640
- We're friendly with the Sioux.
- Are they friendly with us?

449
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,680
We've got this far, haven't we?

450
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,320
I ain't seen no Indians.

451
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,160
Depends how you look. I've counted 39.

452
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,000
- See that mountain top?
- I see it.

453
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,760
That's six more. That makes 45.

454
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
Haw! Get 'em up! Come on!

455
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,960
- Thanks, Johnny.
- What for?

456
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,280
Taking us close to the Indians.
I'll get great pictures.

457
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,920
Glad you're happy. That makes two of us.

458
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,320
Come on, Angel.

459
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,880
How come we're bedding down early?

460
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,760
The horses must be tired.
Uphill all the way.

461
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,160
Ain't the horses give the orders.

462
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,440
Johnny's got a gold bug in his head.

463
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,480
Let's see where it takes him.

464
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,040
[Woman screams] Keep your nose out of
here, you Peeping Tom! Some people!

465
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,760
Brought your knife back.

466
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
Remember?

467
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,160
Here.

468
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,280
Don't you want it back?

469

01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,840
The white man armies will stamp you out,

785
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,880
build towns on your hunting grounds,

786
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,480
shoot down those who are left
like animals.

787
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,320
Your words do not frighten me.

788
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,240
When you make your war, Red Cloud,

789
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,880
tell me, on which side will our son fight?

790
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,200
I'm sure that someday she'll give me a son.

791
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,800
For this will be the long war.

792
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,360
All of us here will have joined your brother

793
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,240
before peace lives again
between red man and white.

794
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,640
Here they come.

795
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,200
[Man] They're turning off.

796
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,040
They're going away!

797
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,160
- Well, I'll be...
- The Indians are leaving!

798
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,000
He did it.
