1
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:04,792
#

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,007
This is gonna be a great cover.

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:12,711
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"--
unique.

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,630
Hey, Betty, you look like
someone who was good at science.

5
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,636
Why do tornadoes always hit
shantytowns and trailer parks?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,625
Does god just hate
poor people?

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,613
Amanda, I highly doubt that.

8
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,603
But I gotta say,
I kind of feel

9
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,945
like I'm in the middle
of a fashion storm right now.

10
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,935
No. You look like
a plus-size princess.

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,008
Dressing you up
in clothing from my hefty years

12
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,040
is like playing
with a big squishy doll.

13
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,224
It's so fun. Can we do it
again tomorrow, please?

14
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,229
No, but you know

15
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:41,023
is if the assistants got to go
on the editors' retreat, too.

16
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,436
I mean, everyone from Meade

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,763
out in the woods,
sharing ideas,

18
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,259
telling anecdotes--
it sounds great.

19
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:50,630
Great like herpes.
(cell phone ringing)

20
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,888
Oh. Will you hold my bagel?
- Sure.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,792
Amanda!

22
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,782
(ring)

23
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,728
It's for your own good.

24
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,395
Hey, Phil. It's Betty.

25
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,822
Oh. Oh, that's too bad.

26
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:08,743
I guess I'll let Daniel know.

27
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,817
(beep)

28
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,890
Daniel, Phil just called.

29
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:14,879
There's a problem
at the printer,

30
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:16,360
so the fashion storm issue

31
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:18,350
won't arrive at the loading dock
till noon,

32
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,296
which means we have to push
your final approval.

33
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,116
Oh, that sucks.

34
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:25,332
I wanted to ride
up to the retreat with Connor.

35
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,406
That was supposed
to be the fun car. Ugh.

36
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:30,283
Well, here's a thought,
just, you know, out of the blue.

37
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,230
What if <i>you</i>
go ahead with Connor

38
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:34,346
and let <i>me</i>
do the final approval

39
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:36,336
right before
the issue goes out?

40
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:39,213
I don't know. I mean...
If there's any problems,

41
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:41,456
That's the last chance
to catch them.

42
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,546
I don't think you really want
that kind of responsibility.

43
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,365
Uh. Yeah, I do.

44
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,285
Daniel, I've watched you do it,
like, a million times,

45
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,317
I totally know
what to look for,

46
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,475
and besides, while you guys
are at your retreat,

47
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,658
I really want to be helpful.

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,777
I guess you are kind of
O.C.D. about things, right?

49
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:58,723
I prefer the word "careful."

50
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:02,023
(sighs)

51
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,182
All right. You know what?

52
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,706
Go for it.

53
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,187
(gasps) Really?
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,710
Thank you!

55
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,080
Aah!
You won't be disappointed.

56
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,027
(elevator bell dings)

57
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,974
That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:17,005
I need your budget
right away. Excuse me.

59
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,571
Sorry, mate.
Hold the lift.

60
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:21,152
Wilhelmina. (chuckles)

61
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:22,294
Good morning, Connor.

62
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,961
So are you ready for our
little trek into the woods?

63
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:26,443
Ugh. Absolutely not.

64
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,940
I find these retreats
a colossal waste of time.

65
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,929
Oh. Well, that's
an important perspective

66
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:33,426
that we all need to hear.

67
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,514
So you're going,
and that's an order.

68
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,181
Uh, an order?

69
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:42,609
Connor, you do realize
you work for me?

70
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,683
Yes, my queen.

71
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,899
and heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

72
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,057
Still...

73
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:52,046
it's the price of leadership.

74
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,781
I'll see you there, boss.

75
00:02:57,082 --> 00:03:00,425
Okay, bridezilla,
let's discuss your wedding.

76
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,049
Mm, nah.
Let's talk about your hair.

77
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,716
Ooh.
- It's looking a little frizzy today.

78
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,255
(gasps) What? Oh, my god. Fix it.
- Sit.

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,175
I thought the red lip,
the updo was the right choice.

80
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:14,011
Wait. You're distracting me.
Marc, you proposed to Cliff,

81
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,507
Which I have to say, I thought
was a little weird considering

82
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:19,047
that you were so freaked out
about moving in with him,

83
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,840
and now you never want
to talk about it.

84
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,913
Ah. That--that is not true.

85
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:26,241
Well, every time
I bring up the wedding,

86
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:27,294
you change the subject.

87
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,669
Hey, what are we gonna do
while the editors are gone?

88
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,895
The usual--make the temps
kiss each other?

89
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:32,758
That is really fun.

90
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,832
Mm.
- Wait, no. You're doing it again.

91
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,567
Marc, are you punishing me

92
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,106
because I said I don't approve
of gay marriage?

93
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:41,053
I only meant that
for unattractive gays,

94
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,058
and Cliff is really growing on me.
(Wilhelmina) Marc.

95
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,005
Ooh. Gotta go.
(whispers) Thank God.

96
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,020
Marc!

97
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,036
Yes?

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,152
Aah! Gun!

99
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:52,395
(sighs)
It's for the retreat.

100
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,764
Connor's making me go.

101
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:56,246
He's enraging.

102
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:58,320
He's so self-confident,

103
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,859
he won't listen
to a word I say

104
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:03,822
and he's not afraid of me.
- I am. I'm afraid of you.

105
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,769
Oh, stop your cowering, Marc.

106
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,799
I don't even need a gun
with you.

107
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:11,439
Five good words, and I could
make you pee in your pants.

108
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:14,613
So Connor's really
getting under your skin, huh?

109
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:16,940
Is it that obvious?

110
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,987
Oh, it's no use, Marc.

111
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,681
He's unavailable.

112
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,161
He has a fiancée,

113
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:28,621
and I'm sure she's 20-something,
fabulous, European and thin.

114
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:31,245
Well,
you're all those things, too.

115
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:34,207
(stammers) Okay, so I will
make sure that your room

116
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,804
is on the opposite side
of the lodge from Connor's.

117
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,894
Good. Thank God
it's hunting season.

118
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,348
If I can't be
with the man I want,

119
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,380
at least I can kill something.

120
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,427
(forklift engine humming)

121
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,320
(forklift beeping)

122
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:53,675
(sniffs)

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,256
What the...

124
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:57,907
(sniffs)

125
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,599
Hmm.

126
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:02,477
You know, the binding adhesive
has a really strong smell.

127
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,805
I'm afraid it's gonna overpower
the perfume samples.

128
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,598
Oh, jeez. That would
be a disaster, huh?

129
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,010
Here's what I'll do--

130
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:12,888
I'm gonna have my guys
rip all these pallets apart,

131
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,215
we'll take the magazines
back to the printer,

132
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,798
then we'll manufacture
an odorless adhesive

133
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,913
and we'll rebind them.

134
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:22,452
Now I know it's probably
gonna cost a few hundred grand,

135
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:25,372
but I want you to be happy
because you have final approval.

136
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,362
Fine. They can go out as is.

137
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:30,451
All right, boys, ship 'em.

138
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,371
Oh, hey. Could you
take a picture for me?

139
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,264
Fine. I'll do it myself.

140
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:40,777
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"--

141
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,105
First "Mode" issue
approved by me!

142
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,713
(camera shutter clicks)

143
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,618
(Daniel) Welcome, everyone,

144
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:48,564
to Meade's annual
editors' retreat.

145
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,188
Without further ado,
let me turn things over

146
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:53,177
to the newest member
of our team--

147
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:56,689
C.F.O. of Meade publications,
Connor Owens.

148
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,699
Thank you, everyone.
I'm thrilled to be joining,

149
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:06,084
but before the fun begins,
some sobering facts.

150
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,131
This is not a happy time
for the magazine industry.

151
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,163
Fewer readers
plus more competition

152
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:14,210
equals far, far less money.

153
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,241
If we can't come up
with innovative ways...

154
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,696
(buttons clicking) to cut costs
and increase revenues,

155
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,320
Meade may have to take
drastic steps.

156
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,283
Some of you may find
your magazines shut down.

157
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:28,092
The next few hours that were
scheduled as personal time

158
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:31,096
will now be a walk in the woods,
some time with your thoughts.

159
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,016
Bring me bold ideas.

160
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:37,190
I don't care how silly
or far out they may seem to you.

161
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,672
That crazy idea

162
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,972
may just be the one
that saves your magazine.

163
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:46,628
Uh, excuse me. May I offer
a crazy suggestion right now?

164
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:48,151
Of course.

165
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:52,214
Take everyone's phones
and P.D.A.s.

166
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,711
What?

167
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:58,350
You really want people to focus?
Cut off all distractions.

168
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,932
Great idea.

169
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,047
Well, I don't think so.
- I do.

170
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,925
I mean, going off the grid--
I-I like the way that sounds.

171
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,804
All right, people.

172
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,851
Hand 'em over.
On the table right now.

173
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:13,882
Oh, Claire,
just so you know,

174
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,871
I'm going hunting
later on today.

175
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,172
Feel free to walk
front of my gun.

176
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,711
(Betty) Good news, everybody!

177
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,658
The final approval is done.

178
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,282
I was a little worried
about the smell,

179
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:29,329
but I think it's gonna be okay.
The issue has shipped! (high-pitched voice)

180
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:33,857
(normal voice) You e-mailed us all a picture.
- I tried to get your mustache

181
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,719
<i>(woman) We have breaking news</i>
<i>to report.</i>

182
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,131
<i>A tornado is currently</i>
<i>cutting a path of destruction</i>

183
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,121
<i>through central Kansas.</i>

184
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,744
<i>This is dramatic live footage</i>
<i>from the town of Tibsley.</i>

185
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,157
<i>Search and rescue teams</i>
<i>are on hold</i>

186
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,950
<i>until the tornado threat</i>
<i>diminishes...</i>

187
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,446
That kind of looks like the cover.
<i>...Deaths have been reported</i>

188
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:52,774
<i>and countless</i>
<i>have been left homeless.</i>

191
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:23,905
(panting) Phil! Phil.

192
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:26,445
We can't ship the magazine.
Huge emergency.

193
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,237
Oh, let me guess.
The pages are too glossy.

194
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,268
Well, yes, a little, but no.

195
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:34,570
There is a huge awful tornado
destroying Kansas. Look.

196
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,362
Tornado on the cover.
Tornado on the TV.

197
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,098
Get it?

198
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,680
This is gonna be
a huge P.R. disaster.

199
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:45,065
All right, you listen to me.
It was really cute before

200
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,139
when you came
in with the final approval

201
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,847
and then you took the picture
remember that? It was very cute.

202
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,571
But the truth is, you have no authority.
(gasps) What? What?

203
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:55,899
Look,
they put me in charge here.

204
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:59,369
I am the point person,
so stop shipping the issue.

205
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:02,121
That's an... order?

206
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,956
Listen, pointy, the only
two people with real authority

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,198
are Daniel Meade
and Wilhelmina Slater,

208
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,330
And if I don't hear from either
one of them, the issue ships.

209
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,462
Phil, I've been trying
to get ahold of them,

210
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,875
but I can't get through.

211
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,963
Look, I begged Daniel
for this responsibility.

212
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:19,343
Ugh.

213
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:22,730
And I promised him that
nothing would go wrong.

214
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,607
So please... help me.

215
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,147
All right, look.
The only thing I can do for you

216
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,603
is I can hold off
for four hours, all right?

217
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:30,814
Huh.

218
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:33,733
And if I don't hear
from either one of them by then,

219
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,764
The issue goes out. Sorry.

220
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,881
Okay! Thank you!
- Whatever!

221
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,451
<i>(woman singing Spanish)</i>

222
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,080
(singsong voice) Here it is!

223
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,931
(normal voice)
The permit from the city for my salon.

224
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:51,085
Oh.

225
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,793
Okay,
"commercial variances

226
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,544
are prohibited
in residential districts."

227
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,956
Yeah, but where's my permit?

228
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,019
<i>Mija,</i> I think this means
your permit is denied.

229
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,305
What?

230
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:09,029
Do you know how hard
I work for this?

231
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,271
You know whose fault this is?

232
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:13,980
Archie "the rat" Rodriguez.

233
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:17,662
Mr. Slick-ass City Councilman
comes over here,

234
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,243
and he's all like, "you need to
apply for your permit legally."

235
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,402
Look where it's gotten me.
He should be impeached.

236
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:24,475
Yeah.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

237
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,064
Oh, man!

238
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,522
You should just
open the salon anyway.

239
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,696
No, she shouldn't.
It's breaking the law.

240
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:33,574
What are they gonna do,
put undercover hair police

241
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:36,156
across the street
to watch our house?

242
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,975
Honey, <i>papi's</i> right.

243
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,541
Bye.

244
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:42,884
We can't risk getting caught.

245
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,408
(both snap fingers)

246
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,313
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Bold ideas. Bold ideas.</i>

247
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,302
<i>Isn't that</i>
<i>what we pay Connor for?</i>

248
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:51,137
<i>Okay, think, Daniel. Think.</i>
<i>I'm empty.</i>

250
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,131

<i>really good penmanship.</i>

Aah!

253
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,506
Oh!

254
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,029
(groans) Sorry.

255
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,569
Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, my ankle.

256
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:06,922
Ahh. You?

257
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,081
Yeah, fine.
Don't worry about me.

258
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,297
Do you think it's broken?
- Well, I'm not a doctor, but...

259
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:13,313
Really?

260
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:15,556
What? I could be a doctor.

261
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,502
Is it so obvious I'm not?

262
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:20,465
What are the odds I fall
out of a tree and hit a doctor?

263
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,539
Point taken.

264
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,078
Aren't you a little grown-up
to be climbing trees?

265
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,532
That's exactly
why I was doing it.

266
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,029
People are always saying
you're too old to do stuff.

267
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,441
You know what?

268
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,600
I agree with you.

269
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,463
He me up. Let me see
if I can bear weight.

270
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:37,478
Okay.

271
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,917
(grunts)
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

272
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,709
Ow! Okay.

273
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,883
All right. Ow!

274
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,697
(leaves rustle)

275
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,352
Come to mama.

276
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,955
You're welcome
to take the first shot.

277
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,679
Too easy. Aren't you
supposed to be thinking?

278
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:09,387
Oh, this is actually
where I get my best ideas.

279
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,969
There's something
so primal about it.

280
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,592
Very few things in life
make you feel this way.

281
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,005
I could think of a couple.

282
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,756
Yeah, me, too.

283
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,745
Well,
should we do this together?

284
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,453
(sighs)

285
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:26,527
(cell phone rings)
Dani.

286
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,235
Ugh. Hilda, I can't
really talk right now.

287
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,071
I'm trying
to get ahold of Daniel,

288
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,670
And I'm in the middle
of a work crisis.

289
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,033
Me, too. Listen, where'd you put the

290
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:36,811
hat you bought during your ugly hat phase?

291
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:39,223
My what? I didn't have
an ugly hat phase.

292
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,101
Oh, right.
Just your hat phase.

293
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:44,217
Okay, uh, why do you
need this right now?

294
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:47,644
Because I have come up with
a way to keep the salon open.

295
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,676
They denied my permit,

296
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:52,892
so i'm opening an underground
styling speakeasy.

297
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:55,093
All cash,
entrance in the back.

298
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:58,098
Okay, I don't really have time
to focus on this right now,

299
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,283
but it already sounds
like a bad idea.

300
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:01,737
What are you talking about?

301
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,022
People love a sense of danger.
- With their haircuts?

302
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,519
(gasps) I-I found them.
Thank you. Never mind. Bye.

303
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:08,467
(beep)

304
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,371
(sniffs)

305
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,402
I smell pluck.

306
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,246
Where are you going?

307
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:14,688
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

308
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:16,803
Daniel is not answering
his cell phone,

309
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,793
and the lodge is
under strict instructions

310
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:21,628
not let any calls in or out
for the next few hours.

311
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:24,591
Yes, I know. Wilhelmina managed
to get a text off to me

312
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,811
before they took away
all their cell phones.

313
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,188
Oh. Well, I'm going up there.

314
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:31,869
So I raided the petty cash
drawer, and I'm taking a cab.

315
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,604
I've underestimated you.

316
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,398
I was thinking this was
all out poor, homely Betty

317
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,386
worrying about the poor,
homely people of Kansas,

318
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,799
But no, no, no, no.
This is about your career.

319
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:42,872
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

320
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,862
You think that if you get
the news to Daniel,

321
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:46,893
you'll come up smelling
like a <i>she-ro.</i>

322
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:49,813
Ugh. Marc, I don't care
what I smell like.

323
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:50,279
Mm, right.

324
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,802
I promised Daniel
nothing would go wrong,

325
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,807
so I don't really have a choice.
- Well, then I'm going with you.

326
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,786
You think I'm just gonna sit
here and watch you outshine me?

327
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:58,700
Fine. Whatever, Marc.

328
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:00,732
First of all,
I'm not taking a <i>cab</i>

329
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,552
all the way to Talmadge Hall.

330
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,514
All righty then, Marc.
How do you want to get there,

331
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,293
your wings?

332
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:09,323
Cliff's away till tomorrow.
We'll take his car.

333
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,762
Road trip?

334
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:12,285
Shotgun!

335
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,057
<i>(man) With new tornadoes</i>
<i>touching down all over Kansas,</i>

336
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,638

337
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,627

<i>of this powerful system...</i>

338
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,420
Oh, god. Marc, can you
<i>please</i> pick up the pace?

339
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:27,902
Easy does-y, fuzzy wuzzy.

340
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,721
You're gonna give yourself
worry lines,

341
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:32,853
not that anyone could see them
under that canopy of bangs.

342
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,138
(giggles)
The issue ships in two hours,

343
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,702
and we are still 100 Miles
from the lodge.

344
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:38,523
And constantly

345
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,513
with the latest tornado
updates

346
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:42,580
is not gonna get us
there any faster.

347
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,433
Well, I'm sorry.

348
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,099
You know what? I'm right here.
- I can't just sit back...

349
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:48,342
You don't have to scream in my ear.
- and watch my magazine--

350
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,839
Ladies, <i>chillax.</i> I know
how we can pass the time.

351
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,870
Let's talk about Marc's wedding.
- No.

352
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:53,821
You're getting married?

353
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,875
I have a better idea.
Let's talk about Amanda's hair.

354
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,668
Wow. Still frizzy.
- What? I am not falling for that again.

355
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,588
Marc, I came on this trip
to talk about your wedding,

356
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:04,508
and that I what we're gonna do.
- Marc, I can't believe

357
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,793
if I was getting married,

358
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,730
I would never stop talking
about my wedding.

359
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:09,840
- And we'd all kill ourselves

360
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:11,266
so does that mean
there will be two best men?

361
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,168
I'm still the Maid of honor...

362
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,109
- That's offensive.

363
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,046
- 'cause I already
bought a fuchsia dress.

364
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,559
I didn't mean it to be.
I'm totally for gay marriage.

365
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,474
It's a really cute--

366
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,294
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

367
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,071
Let's just listen to music quietly.
<i>(woman) # amazing Grace #</i>

368
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,103
Oh, good. Christian radio, my favorite.
<i># how sweet #</i>

369
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,938
Watch out for that stuff.
It'll make you itch like crazy.

370
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:28,462
Oh, I'm immune.

371
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,901
(leaves rustling)

372
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:30,916
Shh.

373
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,863
Sounds like a big one.

374
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,613
8-pointer, maybe.

375
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:41,116
Ugh. False alarm again.

376
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,205
Would it be too much to ask
for something with antlers?

377
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,729
What is it?

378
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,860
It's, uh, Daniel
and some cripply wood nymph.

379
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:51,230
It's your form of rebellion.

380
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:56,309
That's my fiancée Molly.

381
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,789
That's her?

382
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,948
You sound surprised.

383
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,715
Well, it's just that he's...
wonderfully ordinary.

384
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,507
Why is she limping?

385
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,962
All right, it's not much further now.
- Okay.

386
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,952
So you don't work at Meade?

387
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,940
No, but I'm here
with someone who does.

388
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,506
Oh. Who?

389
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,368
(Connor) Molly.

390
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:21,150
Well, I see you two
finally met.

391
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:24,156
What have you done?
- I twisted my ankle. It's a long story.

392
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,956
Oh, let me.
Can you grab that, mate?

393
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:27,329
Yeah.

394
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:30,291
Ooh. (laughs) Okay.

395
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,900
(laughs)

396
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,998
(Betty)
We only have an hour and 27--

397
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,115
Oh!--26 minutes left.

398
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:44,511
We are currently traveling

399
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,542
at the speed
of 50 Miles an hour,

400
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,759
and I think that if we push it
at least up to the speed limit,

401
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,594
we could give ourselves a cushion.
- Hey, Betty, you know what?

402
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,557
Now might be a really good time
for some stress eating. (sighs)

403
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,561
I'm sure Cliff is
a food stasher. (groans) Ugh.

404
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,395
(squeals)

405
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:02,032
- What? What? What? What is it?

406
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,809
Nothing.
- You squealed.

407
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,798
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

408
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,279
No, I didn't.
- Yes. You did.

409
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,057
No, I didn't.
- Betty?

410
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:09,898
You kinda did.

411
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,062
Okay, fine. Do you
really want to know?

412
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,674
I found a receipt from Tiffany's
for two wedding rings.

413
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:15,362
(Betty gasps) Oh!

414
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:16,388
Oh. Oh. (wheezing)

415
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:18,791
Cliff got you a ring!
Oh! Oh, that's so cute!

416
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,271
Oh, my god.
- That's so sweet.

417
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,261
Let me see it...
- No, Marc...

418
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,207
Marc! Marc, the wheel!

419
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,435
(screams, glass shatters)

420
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:30,543
What have I done?
- You crashed Cliff's car.

421
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,167
How's he ever gonna be able
to trust me again?

422
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,622
Um, you get it fixed.
It's just a car.

423
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:38,584
And it's an ugly car,
so you kind of did him a favor.

424
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,997
55 minutes? All right, thanks.

425
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,943
Guys, we can't wait
for the tow truck.

426
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,906
We'll never make it on time.
Amanda, help me push.

427
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,656
Uh, no. These stilettos
were not meant for pushing.

428
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,746
Although, maybe they were meant
for something else.

429
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,016
(Marc groans)

430
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,751
Unh!

431
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,613
Wait, wait.

432
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,956
Wait. I wasn't ready.
- If we get back to the city by 5:00,

433
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,987
We can all get completely drunk

434
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,230
And pretend like none of this
ever happened.

435
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:04,949
Okay, here's...

436
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,996
I saw a store back that way.
Marc, you stay here.

437
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,668
Amanda, come with me.
We'll ask someone for a ride.

438
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:11,763
- These stilettos are...

439
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,387
Okay, I'm going by myself.
(Amanda) Whatever.

440
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:17,307
Betty, could you grab me
some beef jerky?

441
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,720
Thanks!

442
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:23,021
(knocks rhythmically)

443
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,094
I got the horse right here.

444
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:28,606
His name is Paul Revere.

445
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,092
Are you a cop? Because you
gotta say if you are.

446
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,759
I'm just here
to get my roots done.

447
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:37,790
Julie, you look so good, right?
- Yeah.

448
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,345
I added some extra layers for fullness.
- I love it. It's perfect.

449
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,292
Oh, good. I'm so glad.

450
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,450
Now just remember
what it looks like.

451
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:49,004
Oh, and don't take that off
until you're around the corner.

452
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,628
Hey. Da-da-da.
You gotta go out the back.

453
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,930
And if anyone asks, you were
here looking for your cat.

454
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,792
Bye.
- Hello.

455
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,950
Hey! Oh, you waited too long.

456
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:00,812
I know. I know.

457
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:02,759
Okay.

458
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,595
<i>Papi.</i>
Why aren't you at work?

459
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:07,753
They're bombing for roaches.

460
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:09,700
So this is your solution?

461
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,180
Breaking the law?

462
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:14,101
Excuse me. (lowered voice) look,
I tried to do it legally.

463
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,328
I applied for a permit
and look what happened.

464
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,471
I got rejected.
So why take no for an answer?

(panting) Hello.

471
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,736
Good day. How are you?

472
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:44,191
Um, I have
a very strange request.

473
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,180
I was wondering if you could

474
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,634
MAYBE give me a ride
to Talmadge Hall.

475
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:51,765
I could pay you, uh...

476
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,364
and 10, 15, 16, 17...

Lady, I'd love to drive you,

479
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,288
but the government don't want me
behind the wheel

those issues?

506
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,698
Because you look like
a boy with a crush

00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:17,337
and some sort of crud
on your face.

would it?

511

What?

512
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,537
No! No!

I really appreciate that.

Betty, this is teriyaki.

00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,840
No, I really mean it.
You went way above

00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,871
and beyond the call of duty,
Betty.

Skywriting-- way to think on your feet.

and I didn't
want to disappoint you,

So I used your credit card

00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,747
Oh, just curious.

524
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,625
Uh, how much does
skywriting cost anyway?

525
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:09,391
Um, let's just say a lot less
than a massive P.R. nightmare.

526
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:12,396
Not that our problems even
compare to the tornado victims'.

527
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:15,274
Right. I'm gonna call Phil down
at the loading dock right now.

Well, you'll be happy to know
this retreat's gonna end early

so we can deal
with this whole thing.

00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:26,573
We're gonna have to figure out
a whole new cover,

Do we?

You didn't give me a lot of time.

You know, using a skywriter to
send a message--let me tell you,

Ultimately, it may help us
avoid layoffs tomorrow.

"no good deed

But it really seems
to apply here.

You know what? That's just like
my pert getting denied.

621
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,403
I went through
all the right channels,

625
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,973
you know gaining momentum,
like a...

626
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:31,115
tornado?

627
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,839
Justin.

628
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:37,082
(slams hand on table)
You, too?

629
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,113
It's not personal,
Aunt Betty.

630
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,060
There just hasn't been
a T-shirt-worthy scandal

631
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:43,642
since Winona had her troubles.

632
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,123
Okay, that's enough.

633
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:49,566
My girls may be a lot of things,
but helpless isn't one of them.

634
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,502
So the question is,
what are you gonna do now?

635
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,750
(Ignacio) Hmm?

636
00:26:58,793 --> 00:27:00,485
<i>(wind howls)</i>

637
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,051
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

638
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,998
I don't think
it's gonna get physical,

639
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,945
but I might need someone here
to restrain me.

640
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:13,441
Please. I'm happy to be
anywhere I'm anonymous.

641
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:15,642
Hey, aren't you Tornado Girl?

642
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,424
No. I just look like her.

643
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,160
We're here to see
Councilman Rodriguez.

644
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:24,106
- Well, I'm afraid the councilman
is unavailable.

645
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:26,877
You want to make an appointment
to come back next week?

646
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:27,364
Next week?

647
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:30,538
Mm. I got a problem right now.
- Forget it.

648
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:31,936
Hilda,
she said "unavailable."

649
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,474
That's what I say when
Daniel's in the bathroom.

650
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,591
He must be here.
(door opens)

651
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:37,944
Oh! Look.

652
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,442
Hilda. Hey,
how'd that permit work out?

653
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,066
Oh, you didn't hear?

654
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,140
I got rejected.

655
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:48,271
Oh, wow. Uh, I'm sorry.

656
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:49,795
You're sorry. You're sorry?

657
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:52,757
You told me to do things
aboveboard, and what happens?

658
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,634
I get screwed.
(whispers) Take it down a notch.

659
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,158
(clears throat) All right.

660
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,290
Councilman, I am
one your constituents,

661
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,237
and I got a problem

662
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:04,226
how you gonna fix it?

663
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:06,934
Uh, they rejected your permit.
There's nothing I can do.

664
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,881
The law is the law.

665
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:11,250
The law is the law?

666
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,240
That's the best you got?

667
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:16,202
It seems like you could do
a little bit better

668
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,319
when you are destroying
someone's dreams.

669
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:23,101
This is one of
the only good things

670
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:26,021
that has happened to my sister
in a long time.

671
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,306
Lots of people have
home businesses.

672
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,184
There's got to be something
you could do..

673
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:33,088
isn't that your job?
- Betty.

674
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,611
I'm coming.

675
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:42,483
Oh! Oh! Aah!

676
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,218
(screams and gasps)

677
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,784
Oh.
- Marc!

678
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:47,942
(whispers) Shh! Silence.
(presses button)

679
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:51,032
(flatly) Powerful forces are
arrayed against you.

680
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:53,909
What?
What are you talking about?

681
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:57,676
Things are not what they seem.
- Okay, not in the mood.

682
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:01,612
Not all birds
fly south in winter.

683
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,236
I don't understand you.
Stop being cryptic.

684
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,225
(normal voice)
Oh. For god sake, Betty,

685
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:09,822
I'm not gonna jeopardize my job
by spelling it out to you.

686
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:11,853
If you want to know
what really happened

687
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:13,800
with the issues going out,

688
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:16,932
then go talk to Phil
in the loading dock.

689
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:19,852
(whispers) He knows.

690
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,211
I need to know
why the issue wasn't stopped

691
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:26,073
after Daniel called you.

692
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:28,581
Yeah, well, too bad,
'cause I ain't talkin'.

693
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:29,712
Well, I ain't leavin'.

694
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:35,214
You can't get away from me.
- You're like a gnat with glasses.

695
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:37,542
Well, I could do this all day,

696
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,530
'cause if I'm not getting
hate mail

697
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,858
from the daughters of Kansas,
then it's a vacation.

698
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:45,837
Yeah. You got a raw deal.

699
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:48,249
You're a pain in my ass,

700
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,788
but you don't deserve this.

701
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,132
All right, come here.
(clears throat)

702
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,586
Listen,
you didn't hear this from me,

703
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,575
but I got a call, all right.

704
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:00,522
It wasn't telling me
to <i>hold</i> the issue.

705
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:03,315
It was telling me to ship it.

706
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,065
What? Well,
who told you to do that?

707
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,874
(sighs)

708
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:13,895
Uh, Betty?

709
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,746
You lied to my face, Daniel.

710
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:19,778
You have to believe me.

711
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,692
You were never supposed
to get blamed for this.

712
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:23,290
But I did.

713
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:25,702
And I defended you.
You saw me.

714
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:28,834
Yeah, but you knew the truth,
and you said nothing.

715
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,797
Look, things
are not as simple

716
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:34,082
as you and I wish they were.

717
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,875
This company is in a lot
of trouble. We need money.

718
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,880
I only agreed to it because
it was a business decision.

719
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,800
It was a way to save Jobs.
And ruin my reputation.

720
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,085
Look, I never intended
for that to happen.

721
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,709
This is gonna blow over.
- Blow over?

722
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:50,883
(voice breaking)
I'm not Daniel Meade.

723
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,041
I'm an assistant,

724
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,284
and I don't want
to be an assistant

725
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:58,035
for the rest of my life.

726
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:00,913
The only thing I have going
for me is my reputation,

727
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:03,706
and now I don't have that.

728
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,134
I'm Tornado Girl.

729
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,333
Chocolate chip.

730
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:28,634
Oh, <i>papi,</i> thank you.

731
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,624
(doorbell rings)

732
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,755
I'll get it.

733
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,395
Evening.
I'm Councilman Rodriguez.

734
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,764
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, sir.

735
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:43,138
Mr. Councilman, it is an honor
to have you in our home. Please.

736
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:43,658
Thank you.

737
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,382
He's been here before, <i>papi.</i>
I gave him a haircut, remember?

738
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:50,090
So what are you gonna do now,
evict us?

739
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,122
I kind of felt bad
about earlier today,

740
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:55,126
and I don't want to be the guy
who destroyed your dreams,

741
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:57,709
so I've, uh, done
a little bit of research.

742
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,994
What is that?

743
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:01,306
Your loophole.

744
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,268
See, if 30% of your profits
come from products you sell,

745
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,569
then we can get you
that permit, for a boutique.

746
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:10,024
A boutique?
So wait, wait, wait.

747
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,621
If I sell things, I can cut hair.
- That's right.

748
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:16,118
So what am I gonna sell?
Are you kidding?

749
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:18,699
First you can get rid
of this hideous lamp,

750
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:21,620
and then get rid of half a dozen
of those saints

751
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,624
and while you're at it,
get rid of Betty's hats.

752
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,825
Well, actually,
I was thinking you could...

753
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:29,660
sell some candles. See?

754
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:31,099
Just a thought.

755
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,469
<i>Muchísmo gracias,</i>
Councilman Rodriguez.

756
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:37,151
Oh, please, call me Archie.
- Okay, Archie.

757
00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:39,681
Hey, let me get my camera
before you go.

758
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:40,409
<i>Papi.</i>

759
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,780
Wow. Well, thank you.

760
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:44,642
I... I owe you.

761
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:45,742
Well...

762
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:46,800
(sniffs)

763
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:49,339
Well, good luck.

764
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:50,736
Thanks.

765
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,824
Hey, uh, if you ever need
a haircut or--or a candle...

766
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,687
(chuckles) Just say the word.

767
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,676
Since I've sort of
done you a favor,

768
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,708
I don't think
it would be ethical

769
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,585
to, uh,
get a free haircut, so...

770
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:04,997
Yeah. Oh, I was gonna charge you,
Councilman. (chuckles)

771
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:06,902
(laughs)

772
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,299
Well, then I'll definitely
be stopping by.

773
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,568
Okay.

774
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:11,896
All right, good night.

775
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,885
Night.

776
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:15,366
(door closes)

777
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,778
(Ignacio)
Okay, everybody say <i>"queso."</i>

778
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,513
Hey.
<i>- Papi.</i>

779
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:21,037
Where'd he go?

780
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,982
(Betty clears throat)

781
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,633
I spoke to Phil

782
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:35,172
and Daniel.

783
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:37,119
I know what happened.

784
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:41,774
I officially have no idea
what you're talking about...

785
00:33:41,858 --> 00:33:43,509
Hmm.

786
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:45,159
But I'm sorry.

787
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:48,715
We're very different people.

788
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,703
That said,
we're in the same position,

789
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:53,750
and sometimes we have he to
look out for each other,

790
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:54,766
so...

791
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,221
Well, thank you.

792
00:33:57,305 --> 00:34:00,098
Clearly Cliff has had
a good influence on you.

793
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:02,849
He's a very lucky man.

794
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:05,769
(scoffs) He's... yeah.

795
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:08,351
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
He's really, really lucky.

796
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,594
Uh, what was that?

797
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,795
Nothing.
Uh, everything's great.

798
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,196
Everything is... perfect.

799
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:20,158
Uh, well, this may be
none of my business,

800
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:23,036
but it doesn't <i>seem</i>
like everything's okay.

801
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,559
You're right.

802
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:27,649
It's none of your business.

803
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,897
What are you
still looking at me for?

804
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:36,917
All right, fine.

805
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:39,541
I-I...

806
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,842
I cheated on Cliff
at your party,

807
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:45,255
and that's why I asked him
to marry me,

808
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,751
because I felt so guilty.

809
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:50,629
And now I feel like
such a terrible person

810
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,322
because of it,

811
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,692
and i'm sure
that's what you feel, too.

812
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:58,120
Marc,
I know you're a good person.

813
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:03,241
But I also know
that it really hurts

814
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:07,176
when someone you trust
lies to you.

815
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:10,223
Look, if you love him,

816
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:12,677
he deserves
to know the truth.

817
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:16,868
(Wilhelmina) Rest assured,

818
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,746
Meade publications is doing
everything it possibly can

819
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:22,200
to rectify
this terrible situation.

820
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,697
By tomorrow--
or the latest, next week--

821
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:27,193
every issue will
be off the newsstands.

822
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:30,622
And how are you dealing
with Tornado Girl? (laughter)

823
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:34,473
Fired, reprimanded, banished
to a basement somewhere?

824
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,673
Now, now. (chuckles)

825
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:40,017
That is an internal issue
that we are handling privately.

826
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:42,302
We're all human,
and we all make mistakes.

827
00:35:42,344 --> 00:35:44,164
So thank you--

828
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,745
Wilhelmina's right. (sighs)
We all do make mistakes,

829
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,174
especially those of us
in charge.

830
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:52,163
I was the one
who made the decision

831
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:55,167
to let the magazine run
in the newsstands.

832
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:58,892
It was a very cynical decision,
and I regret it...

833
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:01,557
but not nearly as much
as I regret

834
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,451
watching my assistant,
Betty Suarez, take the blame.

835
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:07,567
It was my fault, mine alone.

836
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:11,334
Well, I-I, for one,
am shocked, Daniel,

837
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,492
uh, personally shocked
and embarrassed

838
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:17,343
that our company is involved
in something like this...

839
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:19,417
which is why
Meade publications

840
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,337
will donate all profits
from the sale of this issue

841
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:26,018
to a relief fund to benefit
the victims of these tornadoes.

842
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,346
Uh, that's...
That's all I have to say.

843
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,716
(clears throat)
Thank you, everyone.

844
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:34,313
(reporters talking at once)

845
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,134
(Suzuki) Did we hear correctly?

846
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,503
All proceeds from the sale
of this month's magazine...

847
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,011
(mouths words)

848
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:42,735
will be going to tornado victims?
(mouths words)

849
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:50,522
So what did you want
to tell me

850
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:53,062
that was so important
I had to rush over?

851
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,986
Well, how do I say this?
- Uh...

852
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,049
I crashed your car.

853
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,207
Oh.

854
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,492
(laughs) God.

855
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,539
I thought it was
something much worse.

856
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,121
(laughs) Whew.

857
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:14,898
(chuckles)

858
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,622
Actually,
there is something else.

859
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:23,024
You better sit down.

860
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:44,946
Hey, Tornado Boy.

861
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:49,178
Hey, Molly.

862
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:51,802
So is that what
you're gonna call me now?

863
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:54,341
What? It's cool,
like a superhero name.

864
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:55,737
(laughs)

865
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,462
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm impressed.

866
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:02,001
It's not very often
you get to see a big shot

867
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:04,709
throw himself under a bus
for an assistant.

868
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:08,095
Well, ahem. Thanks.

869
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:10,212
It looks like
your ankle's okay.

870
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:12,454
I have a splint.

871
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:15,417
Is it weird that I'm a little
excited about having a splint?

872
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,135
I've never had one before.
You wanna sign it?

873
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:18,421
Sure.

874
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,087
I'm a little hopped up
on painkillers right now.

875
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,219
(laughs) Oh, well, please.
You're welcome to sit down, if you'd like.

876
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:27,181
Connor should be around here somewhere.
- Actually,

877
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:30,017
it's our anniversary.
He's taking us to Del Posto.

878
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:34,164
Oh, well, make sure
you don't drink wine.

879
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,196
The painkillers.

880
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:39,243
(gasps) Right.

881
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,549
(sighs)

882
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,055
I am so proud of you both.
Mm.

883
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:56,629
You fought for yourselves,
and you won.

884
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,314
Yeah, I taped

885
00:38:57,398 --> 00:39:00,742
and I just can't stop watching it.
- Is there a bottle of champagne...

886
00:39:00,826 --> 00:39:01,145
uh-oh.

887
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,746
If it's not made in
France, it's sparkling wine,

888
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:05,778
and that bottle's
from New Jersey.

889
00:39:05,863 --> 00:39:07,216
(chuckles)

890
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:08,571
(sighs)

891
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:11,449
What's the matter, baby?
I thought you were happy.

892
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:13,141
Everything's back to normal.

893
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,299
It is, and normal is good.
Believe me.

894
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:17,373
If I never hear the word
"tornado" again,

895
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,405
I'll be just fine.
(laughs)

896
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,225
It's just...

897
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,214
there was a moment there
where I thought

898
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:26,091
I had actually accomplished
something really great,

899
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,503
you know,
something that would...

900
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:31,213
make normal different...

901
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,582
more, I guess.
I don't know.

902
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:38,449
<i>Mija,</i> you keep putting one foot
in front of the other,

903
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:41,284
open your eyes
to the opportunities,

904
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:45,093
you're gonna get to where
you wanna go, guaranteed.

905
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,421
I love you.

906
00:39:47,505 --> 00:39:50,552
I love you, too. (laughs)

907
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,108
(the panics)
# where has my light gone? #

908
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:56,689
# where has my fit gone? #

909
00:39:56,773 --> 00:40:01,259
# what keeps us burning
when t fire is long gone? #

910
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:05,788
# when I can't relate
to that voice without a face #

911
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,919
# should I be afraid,
or is it just... #

912
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:12,305
Connor, now that Daniel has go
and given everything away,

913
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,786
we need to strategize.

914
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,791
I'm afraid it's gonna be a late night.
- Uh...

915
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,795
Well, that's not gonna be
a problem for you, is it?

916
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,107
No.

917
00:40:21,193 --> 00:40:24,197
I had dinner plans,
but I can reschedule.

918
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,466
Good.

919
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:29,063
We're very lucky
to have you on board.

920
00:40:29,149 --> 00:40:31,095
# my answer's always this #

921
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,958
# I said don't fight it #

922
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,438
# don't fight it #

923
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:35,920
# don't fight it #

924
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:38,374
# if you don't know what it is #

925
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,406
# if you don't know
what it is #

926
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:41,844
(speaks inaudibly)

927
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,706
# just don't fight it #

928
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:45,230
# don't fight it #

929
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:46,712
# don't fight it #

930
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,954
# if you don't know what it is #

931
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:51,282
# if you don't know
what it is #

932
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,806
Yeah, well, it's work.

933
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,286
It's always work.

934
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:55,302
Molly.

935
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:56,783
I gotta go.

936
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:58,308
Don't run. Please.

937
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,254
# if you don't know what it is #

938
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:03,217

939
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:04,866

940
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,390

941
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,872
