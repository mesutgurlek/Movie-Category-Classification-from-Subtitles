00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,475
You will have neither food nor drink,

169
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:28,113
for you must learn
how barren is the life of a sinner.

170
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,527
Children, I exhort you
to shun her, exclude her,

171
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,595
shut her out from this day forth.

172
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:40,065
Withhold the hand of friendship

173
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:43,831
and deny your love to Jane Eyre,

174
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:45,564
the liar.

175
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,408
How do you bear being struck?

176
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:27,876
Miss Scatcherd hits me to improve me.

177
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,248
She's tormented by my faults.

178
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,646
If she hit me, I'd get that birch

179
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,016
and break it under her nose.

180
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,554
She'd find another soon enough.

181
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,858
My father used to preach
that life's too short

182
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:40,723
to spend in nursing animosity.

183
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,166
At my aunt's house,
I was solitary and despised.

184
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:54,006
She thought I could do
without one bit of love or kindness.

185
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:56,932
You are loved.

186
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:02,541
There's an invisible world
all around you,

187
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:07,411
a kingdom of spirits
commissioned to guard you, Jane.

188
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:09,945
Do you not see them?

189
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,388
Jane?

190
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,969
Have you something for me to do?

191
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:26,100
You're doing something already.

192
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,539
May I see?

193
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:38,883
These are wonderful.

194
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:44,219
St. John...

195
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:45,916
No, Mary, please...

196
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:49,086
See how skilled Jane is.

197
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:57,599
Is this how you perceive me,
Miss Elliott?

198
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,709
Well. How fierce I am.

199
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,441
Jane.

200
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,587
You're freezing.
Your little feet are bare.

201
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,288
Come into bed and cover yourself.

202
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,129
(COUGHING)

203
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:34,330
How are you?

204
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:38,409
I'm happy, Jane.

205
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,008
I'm going home.

206
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,415
Back to your father?

207
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:48,546
I'm going to God.

208
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,949
Don't be sad.

209
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,994
You have a passion for living, Jane.

210
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:02,061
And one day you'll
come to the region of bliss.

211
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:11,740
Don't leave me.

212
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:14,742
I like to have you near.

213
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,613
I will not leave you.

214
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:25,949
No one shall take me from you.

215

(CARRIAGE ROLLING AWAY)

220
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:31,354
Mr. Rivers? I wondered if you
had yet heard of any work I could do.

221
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,605
I found you a situation some time ago,
but I've delayed telling you

222
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:38,403
because the work is lowly
and I fear you'll scorn it.

223
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,829
I shan't mind what I do.

224
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,936
When I took over the parish
two years ago, it had no school.

225
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,667
I opened one for boys.
I now intend to open one for girls.

226
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,645
The schoolmistress will have
a cottage paid for by benefactors

227
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:57,911
and she'll receive ￡15 a year.

228
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:02,249
You can see how humble,
how ignoble it is.

229
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,287
Mr. Rivers, thank you.

230
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,552
I accept.

231
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:07,822
With all my heart.

232
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:09,189
But you comprehend me?

233
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,097
'Tis a village school,
cottagers' daughters.

234
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:17,533
What will you do
with all your fine accomplishments?

235
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:20,901
I will save them
till they're wanted. They will keep.

236
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,264
ROCHESTER: Jane.

237
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:05,980
You will be quite alone here.

238
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:07,518
I'm not afraid of solitude.

239
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,224
This is my first home
where I am neither dependent

240
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,623
nor subordinate to anyone.

241
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:15,659
Thank you, Mr. St. John.

242
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:22,699
It is small and plain, as I told you.

243
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,932
Then it'll suit me very well.

244
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:44,085
GIRL: Safe journey, Miss Eyre. Godspeed.

245
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,258
Goodbye, Miss Eyre.

246
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,050
-Safe journey.
-Thank you.

247
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,520
Bye, Miss Eyre.

248
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:50,621
Bye, Miss Eyre.

249
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:52,392
Girls!

250
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:03,432
Goodbye.

252
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:51,991

00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:03,901
(DOOR OPENING)

254
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:19,742
How do you do, my dear?

255
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,448
-Are you Mrs. Fairfax?
-Indeed I am.

256
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,018
What a tedious journey
you must have had.

257
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:31,494
Your hands must be frozen. Here.

258
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,998
Goodness. How young you are.

259
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,308
I'm quite experienced, I can assure you.

260
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:44,869
Of course you are.
I'm sure we're very lucky to have you.

261
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:47,978
Leah, would you ask Martha
to bring a little hot port

262
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:49,413
and cut a sandwich or two?

263
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:51,116
Draw nearer the fire.

264
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:54,318
John is taking your trunk
up to your room.

265
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:00,390
I've put you at the back of the house,
I hope you don't mind.

266
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:02,887
The rooms at the front have much
finer furniture,

267
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:06,194
but they're so gloomy
and solitary, I think.

268
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,026
I'm glad you're come.

269
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,965
To be sure, this is a grand old house,

270
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:17,002
but I must confess that in winter
one can feel a little dreary and alone.

271
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:22,406
Leah's a very nice girl, and John
and Martha are good people, too,

272
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,910
but they are servants.

273
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,454
One cannot talk to them
on terms of equality.

274
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,986
JANE: Am I meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?

275
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:35,392
Who?

276
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,657
Miss Fairfax, my pupil?

277
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:40,663
Oh, you mean Miss Varens,
Mr. Rochester's ward.

278
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,702
She's to be your pupil.

279
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,499
Who's Mr. Rochester?

280
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:49,605
Why, the owner of Thornfield.
Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.

281
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,906
I thought Thornfield Hall
belonged to you.

282
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,313
Bless you, child, what an idea. Me?

283
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:58,183
I'm only the housekeeper.

284
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,617
Forgive me.

285
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,713
There is a distant connection
between Mr. Rochester and me,

286
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,191
his mother was a Fairfax,
but I'd never presume on it.

287
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:09,084
Heavens. Me, owner of Thornfield?

288
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:12,288
We shall have a cheerful
house this winter.

289
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,663
With Miss Varens here and with you,

290
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:17,067
we'll have quite a merry time of it.

291
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,109
I'm sure that last winter,

292
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:21,005
and what a severe one it was, 
if it didn't rain it snowed,

293
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,066
if it didn't snow it blew.

294
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:27,705
I declare, not one soul came to
the house from November to February.

295
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,407
When spring finally came,

295
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,048
I thought it a great relief
I hadn't gone distracted.

296
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,450
(LAUGHING)

297
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:39,459

Yes.

MRS. FAIRFAX: We must open the

303
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,609
to let in some air.

304
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,384
I've never seen such
an ancient old house.

305
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:44,352
How beautifully you've preserved it.

306
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:47,153
Well, Mr. Rochester's visits
are always unexpected.

307
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:50,158
He doesn't like to arrive and find
everything all swathed up,

308
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,721
so I keep it in constant readiness.

309
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:56,498
Now, come and meet Miss Varens.

310

anything about her.

Your gaze is very direct, Miss Eyre.

492
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,218
Do you think me handsome?

493
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,214
No, sir.

494
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:18,080
What fault do you find with me?

495
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:19,818
I have all my limbs and features.

496
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:22,151
I beg your pardon, sir.

497
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:25,830
I ought to have replied
that beauty is of little consequence.

498
00:43:32,405 --> 00:43:34,498
You're blushing, Miss Eyre.

499
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:38,711
And though you're not pretty any more
than I am handsome,

500
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:40,507
I must say it becomes you.

501
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:49,213
And now I see you're fascinated by
the flowers on the rug.

Come, speak to me.

503
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,690
Fact is, Miss Eyre,
I'd like to draw you out.

504
00:43:57,597 --> 00:44:00,395
You have rather the look
of another world about you.

505
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:07,499
I don't wish to treat you as inferior.

506
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:10,238
Yet you'd command me to speak?

507
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,808
Are you very hurt by my tone of command?

508
00:44:13,312 --> 00:44:14,904
There are few masters
who'd trouble to enquire

509
00:44:14,981 --> 00:44:16,505
whether their paid subordinates

510
00:44:16,582 --> 00:44:18,072
were hurt by their commands.

511
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:21,518
Paid subordinate?
I'd forgotten the salary.

512
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:24,684
Well, on that mercenary ground,

513
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:26,782
will you consent to speak as my equal

514
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:29,191
without thinking
that the request arises from insolence?

515
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:32,462
I'd never mistake
informality for insolence, sir.

516
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:37,026
One, I rather like. The other,
nothing freeborn should ever submit to.

517
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:38,325
Humbug.

518
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:40,761
Even for a salary.

519
00:44:40,873 --> 00:44:43,899
Most free-born things
would submit to anything for a salary.

520
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:49,073
But I mentally shake hands with you
for your answer.

521

Not three in 3,000
schoolgirl governesses

522

would have answered me
as you've just done.

523
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:57,888
Then you've not spent much time
in our company, sir.

524

00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:12,026
How?

528
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,771
Your openness, your unpolluted mind.

529
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:19,739
When I was your age,
fate dealt me a blow.

530
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:23,444
And since happiness is denied me,

531
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:25,643
I've a right to get
pleasure in its stead.

532
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:28,050
And I will get it, cost what it may.

533
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:32,089
Then you'll degenerate still more.

534

I was seeking was sweet and fresh,

wore the robes of an angel of light,

what then?

538
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:56,947

I don't understand you at all.

539

I fear the conversation
has got out of my depth.

You're afraid of me.

541
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:09,125
I'm not afraid.
