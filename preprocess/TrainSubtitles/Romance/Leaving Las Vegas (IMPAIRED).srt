476
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:45,319
Then this is our first date or our last.

477
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,780
Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.

478
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,785
First.

479
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,788
It's our first.

480
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,625
I just wanna know.

481
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,169
Why are you killing yourself?

482
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,132
Interesting choice ofwords.

483
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:12,305
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

484
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,474
Is your drinking a way to kill yourself?

485
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:19,270
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

486
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,567
Shoot.

487
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,529
Can I have another one?

488
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:54,263
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

489
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,226
No.

490
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,709
- Good night.
- Good night.

Why don't you stay at 
my place tonight?

493
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,179
I mean, look, you're pretty drunk.

494
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:41,185
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

495
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,688
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

496
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:47,692
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

497
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,364
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

498
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,410
We'll talk about it tonight 
at my place.

499
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,707
I'm not much good in the sack.

500
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,585
Ben, it's not about sex.

501
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,422
I'll make you up a bed 
on the sofa.

502
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,967
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

503
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,636
As you know, I am my own boss.

504
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,392
Do it, Ben.

505
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,189
OK. [chuckles]

506
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,317
I'll do it.

507
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,215
This is the home of an angel.

508
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,638
- Are you OK?
- Of course. Wow.

509
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,185
You look extremely beautiful.

510
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,105

00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,627
...you know,

514
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,506
it's just like this thing's 
happening really quickly.

515
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,177
I just don't know 
what's going on.

516
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,640
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

517
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,477
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

And it's just... It's all 
happening really quickly.

I just felt like we were...
we've been together for a long time.

520
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,657
Itjust felt so easy,

521
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,784
and I felt like, um...

00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,870
I felt like I was me.

I didn't feel like I was...

When is your rent coming up

What do you mean?

00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:47,955
I think you should go and bring

Sera.

- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

530
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,761
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:09,476
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

Right now, I feel really good.

You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

OK.

All right, you go back 
to your motel.

539
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,183
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash

541
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,027
to take the taste of come
out of my mouth.

542

I'm tired of being alone.

OK.

We both know I'm a drunk.

597
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,633
And I know you're a hooker.

598
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,553
I hope you understand
that I'm a person

599
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,223
who is totally at ease with this,

600
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,519
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

601
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,729
I do.

602
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,900
It simply means I trust
and accept yourjudgment.

603
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,072
I was really worried
about how that would be,

but now I'm not.

605
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,207
But you should know that included
with the rent around here

606
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,501
is a complimentary blowjob.

607
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,795
Yes.

608
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,757
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

609
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,136
Whatever that means.

610
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,392
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

611
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,522
OK. All right.

612
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,651
Open this one first.

613
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,996
Very nice.

614
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,917
This should go very nicely
with my suit,

615
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,169
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing

616
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,922
I brought over from the 
motel with me.

617
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,509
Oh, right. The suitcase 
was clinking.

618
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,428
What did you do with 
your clothes?

619
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,515
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral,

620
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,435
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

621
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,605
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair ofjeans

622
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,775
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

623
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,779
That's nice talk, Ben. 
Keep drinking.

and the occasional drool,

fall from your mouth.

It looks like I'm with 
the right girl.

627
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,283

you would buy this for me.

I'm gonna fill it right now.

gambling tonight?

630
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:19,257
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

631
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,178
I hadn't planned to gamble,

632
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,514
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money,

01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,976
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

634
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,522
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

635
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,779
Then come.

636
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,322
I'm sorry.

637
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,326
I love you.

638
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,764
- [Sera] You got a 13.
- [Ben] Hit me.

639
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,601
- [Sera] Wait. She's got a seven.
- [Ben] I don't know. You tell me.

640
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,022
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

641
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,633
[Ben] You got it. 
You can do it.

642
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,136
Wait a minute! Really? 
Oh, man!

643
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,638
- What?
- He's OK.

644
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,140
Do you want anything?

645
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:37,312
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

646
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,231
What?

647
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,651
What? No! No!

648
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,570
Fuck you! Fuck! You fucker!

649
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,663
That boy is... 
You can'tjudge me!

650
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,333
You! I am his father!

651
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,918
Get up!

652
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,589
- [Man] Let's go, guys.
- [Ben screaming]

653
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,638
[Sera] Ben?

654
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:13,658
Ben?

655
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,992
- How are you?
- Very well.

656
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,624
I never expected
to have to ask this again,

657
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,043
but how did our evening go?

658
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:12,092
I remember getting to the casino.
[Coughs]

659
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:18,390
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

660
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,979
And playing blackjack,
and then security came.

661
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,274
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

662
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,569
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street,

663
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,739
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

664
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,534
That's impressive.

665
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,121
How did you do that?

666
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,459
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

667
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,630
...and that I would 
take you home...

668
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,260
...and that we would never
go in there ever again.

669
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,308
"We"?

670
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,063
Yes, we.

671
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,740
That's amazing.

672
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,783
What are you?

673
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:24,831
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

674
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,502
How can you be so good?

675
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,508
I don't know what 
you're saying.

676
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,807
[Sera] I'm just using you.

677
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,351
I need you.

678
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:52,192
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

679
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,198
You go back to sleep,

680
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,700
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

681
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:06,039
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

682
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:25,058
Ben, I'm working tonight.

683
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,188
I know.

684
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:51,042
[Woman] I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

685
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,878
- So fuck you!
- [Man] Shut the fuck up.

686
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,678
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

687
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,058
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

688
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,519
Just lean into the railing.

689
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:14,107
It's not vino veritas.
It's en vino veritas.

690
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,234
Who the fuck are you talking to?

691
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:20,738
Little brown-nosed gnomes
with a slingshot.

692
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,409
[Foreign language]

693
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:30,582
- To be in drunk.
- Lean into the bar?

694
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,917
You lean into the bar.

695
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,047
Listen, my boyfriend over there
is really boring the shit out of me

696
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,300
and I was wondering
if you would buy me a drink?

697
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,969
Do you mind if I buy her a drink?

698
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:48,433
- I don't care what you do with her.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

699
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,435
Barman, a rum and Coke.

700
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:57,233
Can I stay with you for a while?

701
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,113
You mean move in with me?
Isn't this a bit sudden?

702
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,449
I don't have a lot of things.

703
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:08,786
I don't think my wife
would dig it very much.

704
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:15,376
Then maybe we should just go
to a motel and fuck all day.

705
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,462
I could suck you like this.

706
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,965
I'm sure fucking you
would be wonderful,

707
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:25,970
but it's almost impossible for me
to imagine being with someone else.

708
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:29,891
Now listen, asshole,
I'm notjust gonna sit here

709
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,227
and watch her suck on your ear!

710
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,812
Shut the fuck up!

711
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,238
I am sorry,

712
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,075
but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together

713
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,369
in a motel.

714
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,913
And after that, caviar.

715
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,666
[Woman] Woo!

716
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,669
Baby, wait up!

717
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,844
You're quite a fighter.

718
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,389
Here.

719
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:14,435
Listen, this may sound silly,

720
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,437
but I have to ask you to leave.

721
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,524
It's what we do around here
when there's a fight.

722
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,026
The men's room is around the back.

723
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,036
Sexy, sexy.

724
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,875
- I'm back.
- [Woman] Mickey!

725
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,377
Boo!

726
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,672
[Sera] Oh, my God.

727
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,050
- Did I scare you?
- What happened?

728
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,555
Fuck, Ben. Did you get in a fight?

729
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,058
I thought you said you didn't fight.

730
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,936
How do you feel?

731
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,065
Like the kling-klang king
of the rim-ram room.

732
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,109
Did you stop at a bar?

733
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,655
Did you say something stupid
to somebody stupid?

734
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,741
Absolutely not.

735
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,620
I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.

736
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,208
I bet you were.

737
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,091
Why don't you go take a shower
and put on your other shirt?

738
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,636
Then we'll go shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

739
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,098
I think this shirt is unlucky.

740
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,602
Not at all.

741
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,188
Your blood tastes good.

742
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,984
Hey, we got eggs.

743
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,614
I always had a fantasy
of being a flamenco dancer.

744
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,368
I think you look great.

745
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,370
We'll just get you a bow tie,

746
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,872
and then you can be one
of those blackjack dealers.

747
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:01,376
- All right?
- They wear it because they have to.

748
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,212
I'll wear it because I want to,

749
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,464
which will make me look different.

750
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,132
Ben.

751
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:11,844
Let's get a drink!

752
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,223
- What is that?
- What?

753
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,477
Holy cow. [gasps]
It came out of your ear!

754
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,606
I didn't have time
to write you a card,

755
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,067
with you breathing down
my neck all day,

756
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,361
so you'll just have to wing it, baby.

757
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,030
Open it.

758
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,867
[Ben coughs]

759
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,668
They're your color.

760
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,839
I think you should wear
one of them at a time.

761
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:51,426
One of these and one of your other ones.

762
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,929
I was gonna buy you just one,

763
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,472
but I didn't think it would fly.

764
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:00,184
Nurse! As a gift, I mean.
Aah!

765
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:01,853
[Sera laughs]

766
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,358
I'll wear them tonight.

767
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,362
One of them.

768
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,787
Tonight.

769
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,080
Put it on.

770
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,422
I can't get it.

771
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,258
I'll help you.

772
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:42,351
You'll be able to feel it,
sharp and hot under your ear,

773
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,855
as one of the brothers
is putting your head face down

774
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,900
into one of the penthouse pillows.

775
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:27,730
Ben, wait!

776
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,153
Maybe you should wait.

777
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,033
Why?

778
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,496
You can tell.
She really wants you to.

779
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,185
Maybe I should follow you around

780
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:10,064
and ask one of your tricks
what it's like to sleep with you.

781
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,192
They wouldn't know.

782
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,573
Maybe you should ask me sometime.

783
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,992
Be happy to show you.

784
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,164
I'm gonna be home around 3:00.

785
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,792
If you're back, we could
watch some TV or something.

786
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,174
What I'm saying is that I hope
you're back when I get home.

787
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:42,847
Be careful.

788
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,143
You be careful, too.

789
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:50,104
I'm gonna miss you.

790
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:01,198
I know this really cool place
in the desert.

791
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,826
We could go away for a couple days.

792
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,495

951
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:20,675
My love.

952
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:23,845
You're my love.

953
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,057
[Gasps, coughs]

954
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:30,685
Do you want help?

955
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:40,069
- Do you want my help?
- No.

956
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,700
I want to see you.

957
01:42:48,745 --> 01:42:50,496
You're my angel.

958
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:57,503
I'm right here.

959
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,844
What happened?

960
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:13,477
- Something went wrong, but I'm OK.
- [Ben grunts]

961
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,233
I'm sorry I put us asunder.

962
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:47,970
It's OK.

963
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:02,443
Let me do it.

964
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:11,452
There. There you go.

965
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:23,881
See how hard you make me, angel?

966
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:04,880
You know I love you.

967
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,050
Yeah.

968
01:45:11,221 --> 01:45:13,180
I know.

969
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:35,119
[Gasping]

970
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:55,681
[Sera] I love you.

971
01:46:34,137 --> 01:46:36,138
[Exhales]

972
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,656
[Sera] I think the thing is,

973
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:58,035
we both realized that
we didn't have that much time,

974
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:00,579
and...

975
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:06,710
...I accepted him for who he was.

976
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:11,340
I didn't expect him to change.

977
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:16,887
I think he felt that for me, too.

978
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:21,892
I liked his drama.

979
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:26,772
And he needed me.

980
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:32,486
I loved him.

981
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:53,299
[Sniffles] I really loved him.

982
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:58,387
