# Mas que nada #

6
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,648
# We came to make it hotter #

7
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:46,083
# We beat the party starters #

8
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:48,121
# Bubblin' up just like lava #

9
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:50,713
# Like lava,
heat it like a sauna #

10
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,225
# Penetrate
into your body armor #

11
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:55,454
# Rhythmically we massage ya #

12
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,724
# With hip-hop mixed up
with samba #

13
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:59,527
# With samba
So yes, yes, y'all #

14
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,566
# Yes, y'all, y'all #

15
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,760
# You know we never stop,
we never rest, y'all #

16
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:02,802
# Rest, y'all, y'all #

17
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,268
# We can keep it
funky fresh, y'all #

18
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:05,361
# Fresh, y'all, y'all #

19
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,202
# And we won't stop
until we get ya #

20
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,935
# Till we get y'all sayin' #

21
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,641
# Oaria raio #

22
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:17,877
# Oba oba oba #

23
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,475
# Yo, Peter Piper
picked peppers #

24
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:20,884
# But Tab rocked ryhmes #

25
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:22,945
- # On one two, three,
four, several times #
- Oh, Miss. Miss.

26
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:25,150
We have a lot
of vegetarians...

27
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,819
so I wanna make sure every tray
has a vegetarian item...

28
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,919
and a non-vegetarian item.
Got it?

29
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:31,793
And they can't touch. Okay?

30
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,730
And if you run out of either,
go back and refill.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,768
Don't just circulate with one.
Got it?

32
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,463
And if you get the feeling
one is running out faster...

33
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,004
than the other,
then just load the trays...

34
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,039
according to that ratio.

35
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,073
You got it?

36
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,108
Okay, what else?

37
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,142
- Hey!
- Um... Ooh!

38
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,269
It's your wedding day. Relax.

39
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,778
Hey.

40
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,179
I find a little stress
goes a long way.

41
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,275
If I worry now, then
I can relax during the ceremony.

42
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,684
You're not gonna relax
during the ceremony.

43
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,153
You're right.

44
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:57,212
You should, though.

45
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,314
It's gonna be perfect.

46
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,759
It's really coming together,
isn't it?

47
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,289
You know,
I think we should probab...

48
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:05,661
What in the heck?

49
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,398
Well, hello, little lady.

50
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,333
What can I do for you?

51
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,700
What the hell is this?

52
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,170
Why, it's the angel...

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,832
just like your ordered.

54
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:17,376
No, but she doesn't have wings.

55
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:19,139
Yeah. So?

56
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,544
So angels have wings.

57
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:23,207
This is just a lady.

58
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:26,150
No. No, no, no.
It's... It's an angel.

59
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,915
See, beautiful,
all-knowing smile...

60
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,119
eyes that have seen
a thousand eternities... angel.

61
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,424
Chloe, do angels have wings?

62
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,131
Sometimes?

63
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,166
Always!

64
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,669
That's the difference between
a person and an angel: wings.

65
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,432
Why do angels
have to have wings?

66
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,938
So they can fly.

67
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,599
No, but angels are magical.

68
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,233
They don't need wings to fly.

69
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,800
What, does God have wings?

70
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,370
Okay, l知 not gonna stand here
and debate theology with you.

71
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:58,281
So just take it back
and bring me one with wings.

72
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,512
All right, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, little miss.

73
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,248
This is a ice sculpture.

74
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:05,257
I sculpted it out of ice,
then it melts...

75
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,589
and I don't have a lot of them
just lyin' around.

76
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,152
So sculpt some wings
and stick them on. I don't care.

77
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,095
This isn't what I ordered,
and l知 not accepting it.

78
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,190
- Yeah. But l...
- Tut-tut-tut, take it back.

79
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:17,764
I made an angel.

80
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,430
Oh, yoo-hoo.

81
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:20,939
Oh, not done with you.

82
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,235
Not so fast.

83
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,936
Um, did you get
the appetizers down?

84
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,204
Do I need
to go through it again?

85
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:26,472
No.

86
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,776
Are you nodding to signal yes,
or is your neck broken?

87
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,645
Oh, yes, appetizers. Yes.

88
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:31,877
Dinner.

89
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:32,941
I want this on a schedule.

90
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,384
So I want you to get
the salads down...

91
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:37,617
even if the people aren't...
My gardenias!

92
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,658
Your what?

93
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:39,953
- Stop! You're gonna run over...
- Doesn't seem to be a reason...

94
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,618
- my gardenias!
- why we didn't do that.

95
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,993
You idiot! Stop your truck!

96
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,656
l知 just doing what
l知 supposed to be doing. l...

97
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:46,994
- Stop the truck!
- Huh?

98
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,091
Stop!

99
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,227
- What are you talkin' about?
- Stop the truck!

100
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,964
- Stop!
- Oh!

101
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:56,332
Huh?

102
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,062
Who the hell are you?

103
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,892
Kate, I know this must be...

104
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,431
That idiot with the truck!

105
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:20,557
l知 gonna kill him.

106
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,101
l知 gonna sue him,
and then l知 gonna kill him!

107
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,135
What time is it?

108
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,534
That's not really important
right now.

109
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:25,593
Don't tell me what's important.

110
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:26,661
l知 getting married today.

111
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,002
No, you're not.

112
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,564
How long
have I been unconscious?

113
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:30,837
- What kind of hospital is this?
- Will you please stop...

114
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,434
interrupting and just listen.

115
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:33,979
Look, my insurance pays
your salary...

116
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,242
so if I want some information,
just do me the courtesy...

117
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:37,578
Will you shut up? You're dead!

118
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,453
Is that some kind of sick joke?

119
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,852
Look around you.
There are no walls.

120
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:43,946
Hello?
Where do you think you are?

121
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:45,082
Okay, you were crushed to death.

122
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,051
l知 sorry. I lost my cool.

123
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,425
I don't usually do that.

124
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:50,896
l知 dead?

125
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,192
l知 sorry.

126
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,493
Now, we don't have much time.

127
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,999
- Is this heaven?
- Not exactly.

128
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,059
- Hell?
- No. Just listen, please.

129
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,604
There are some important things
for you to know.

130
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,162
Well, who are you?

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,730
l知 an angel.

132
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,544
Who put you up to this?

133
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:09,582
Put me up to what?

134
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,015
For the last damn time,
angels have wings.

135
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,484
Wings!

136
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,186
Oh, my God, you're disappearing.

137
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,587
That's not good. l知 sorry.

138
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:20,990
You were saying something
about important information?

139
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,551
Wait! Don't go!

140
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,392
Hello?

141
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:25,726
Hello?!

142
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:30,994
Crap!

143
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,469
It's coming in clearer now.

144
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:38,104
Definitely, coming in clearer.

145
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:42,371
A boat.

146
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,874
He left the money on your boat.

147
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:49,055
We didn't have a boat.

148
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,146
No boat?

149
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,420
Hold on.

150
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:00,660
l知 getting something.

151
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,432
- You're sure
you didn't have a boat?
- No boat.

152
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:06,665
Maybe he had a boat
that you didn't know about.

153
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,968
He was afraid of the water.

154
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,338
A boot?

155
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,135
Probably not?

156
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,243
Let me see
if something else comes in.

157
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:17,705
Do you hear that, too?

158
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:18,944
Yeah, I do.

159
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,645
Is it from beyond?
Is that a message?

160
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,620
No. I think it's my smoke alarm.

161
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,054
Can you excuse me a second,
Mary?

162
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,522
Oh, God! Oh, no!

163
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,061
Oh, no!

164
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,096
What, what, what?

165
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,425
- What is it?
- Uh, no, everything's fine.

166
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:32,465
No, no, no.
It's under control.

167
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,499
- It's just a little, uh...
- What is that?

168
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,533
Just a little smoky, that's all.

169
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,592
- Oh, God. Move.
- It's the thing in that
silver pan that burned.

170
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:37,636
The osso bucco.

171
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,171
I-I-I don't know.
Does the name matter?

172
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,297
It's on fire.

173
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,204
God, Dan,
you're like the worst cook ever.

174
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,503
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get the crab

175
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:44,543
What are you...
Can you...

176
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,578
l知 just... It's smoking.

177
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:46,612
Can you...
Well, how's the crab dip going?

178
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,078
Crab dip is going great.
Oh, no, no.

179
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,514
The crab dip is going
spectacularly well.

180
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,880
That's the thing
in the little red bowl, right?

181
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,816
- Yes. Can you just chop
something, please?
- Chopping, chopping.

182
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,348
Oh, God, Dan.

183
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,258
You know, as much as
I love you hovering around...

184
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,389
and watching me while I work,
how's the reading going?

185
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,400
- Oh, the reading. The reading.
- Okay.

186
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:10,626
l知 back.

187
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,170
Listen, I gotta run.

188
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:13,205
Oh, really?

189
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,365
Sorry about that, Mary.

190
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,135
- I just...
- Oh, no. You did good.

191
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,540
- Really?
- Absolutely.

192
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,100
Maybe we have a boat
I forgot about.

193
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,373
- Yeah. I mean, you know...
- Yeah.

194
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:21,708
And remember, no...

195
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,510
- driving on Mondays.
- Driving on Mondays.

196
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,574
Right? Be careful.

197
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,676
Bye.

198
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,121
Okay, Dan.

199
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,178
Why aren't you chopping?

200
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:31,621
Hmm? Oh, small cut.

201
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:32,953
- What?
- It's fine. It's tiny.
It's all good.

202
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,118
- Really?
- Yeah. And most of the blood...

203
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:36,094
went into the tomato sauce,
so who's gonna know?

204
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,858
Dan, look, l知 sorry
for leaving you alone.

205
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,092
It's so unfair.

206
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,464
You have my complete,
undivided attention now, okay?

207
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,866
Stir the b饌rnaise sauce
before it separates, all right?

208
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,034
You got it. Oh, b饌rnaise...

209
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,133
No, actually,
I know what that one is.

210
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,735
- Good.
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

211
00:08:58,218 --> 00:08:59,242
Damn it.

212
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:01,654
- Hi.
- Hi.

213
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,484
l知 Chloe.
l知 a friend of Beth's.

214
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:05,456
She gave me your address
and told me to stop by.

215
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,789
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

216
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,885
Beth. God, how is she?

217
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:10,589
Ah, you know,
still with the drummer.

218
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,130
You are kidding me.
That guy is a mess.

219
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:13,426
I thought they totally broke up.

220
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,364
Which time? I think, it's
been like five times already.

221
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,130
Do you know that girl Colleen,
who he used to date?

222
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,363
- Do you know Colleen?
- Yeah.

223
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:19,928
- Have we met before?
- You look really familiar.

224
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,337
That's so weird, 'cause
when you opened the door...

225
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,704
- I was like, "I think
I know that girl."
- Yeah.

226
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:23,742
That's so funny.

227
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,243
Oh, man.

228
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,938
Uh... sorry.

229
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,207
This is my brother, Henry.

230
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,248
Hi.

231
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,282
He needs your help.

232
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,840
I don't know about that.

233
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:33,078
You promised.

234
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,220
Well, come on in.

235
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,720
Wow. God, Beth.

236
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,282
Haven't heard her name...

237
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,419
long time.

238
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,725
Um, how can I help you?

239
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,428
I don't know if you can.

240
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,236
Henry's fianc馥 passed away
about a year ago...

241
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,273
on their wedding day.

242
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,137
Oh, my God. l知 so sorry.

243
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,335
Thank you.

244
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,775
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but how, um...

245
00:09:58,845 --> 00:09:59,869
How did it happen?

246
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,538
She was crushed by an angel...

247
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,141
and as sad as I am,
I do appreciate the irony.

248
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,287
And, well, he's just...

249
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:10,754
He's not moving on.

250
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:12,222
I don't think that's so unusual.

251
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,486
You've changed.

252
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,787
You don't smile.

253
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,761
You don't leave your apartment.

254
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:17,921
I like my apartment.

255
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,828
Nobody hassles me
if I don't smile there.

256
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,434
He's not letting go,
and I was just thinking...

257
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:26,199
that maybe if he communicated
with his fianc馥, Kate...

258
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,900
that, um, maybe she would,
you know...

259
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,671
convince him that it's okay
for him to move on in his life.

260
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:33,938
Is that what you want?

261
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:35,412
That's what she wants.

262
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:36,778
And once she gets an idea
in her head...

263
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,282
it's best to just...

264
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,876
l知 here, so, you know.

265
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,285
Okay. All right.

266
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,120
Well, let's give it a shot.

267
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:50,519
Um, how do you get
into all of this?

268
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,688
Oh, what?
You mean, like being a psychic?

269
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:52,731
Yeah.

270
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,027
Why? You think it's crap?

271
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,995
No. I keep an open mind.

272
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,128
I mean, there are plenty
of things people can't explain.

273
00:10:58,204 --> 00:10:59,330
You can be honest.

274
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,470
Not crap, just unproven...

275
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,004
after hundreds of years
and thousands of studies.

276
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:08,575
But you're keeping an open mind.

277
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,672
Isn't it obvious?

278
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,643
Well, what do you do
for a living?

279
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,211
- l知 a vet.
- So a man of science?

280
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,950
I suppose I am.

281
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,150
Do you believe in heaven?

282
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,187
Jury's out.

283
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,294
Wow.

284
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,763
See, that's just...
That's depressing to me.

285
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,891
I mean, what a sad and
hopeless world it would be...

286
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,594
if that was the case.

287
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,729
I really believe that the people
we love never really leave us.

288
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,330
You know, they're...
They're always watchin' over us.

289
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,535
And then, sometimes,
if we're lucky...

290
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,169
we get to talk to them.

291
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:43,608
So have you had
a lot of luck with this?

292
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,048
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

293
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:46,346
I know that's
not very scientific...

294
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,408
but when it works...

295
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,216
it really does
make people happy.

296
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,483
You wanna give it a go?

297
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:57,361
Okay. Give me your hands.

298
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,696
Does this cost extra?

299
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:02,667
Do you always use humor to cope
with uncomfortable situations?

300
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,226
That reminds of this time
two rabbis walked into a bar.

301
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:07,829
All right.
Come on, give me your hands.

302
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,276
Now, just think about the person
you're trying to contact.

303
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,877
I am getting something, um,
but it's...

304
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:16,972
But it's a man.

305
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:21,776
He's in a, like, a blue suit
or, um, like a uniform.

306
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,981
My father wore blue suits.

307
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,024
He was a lawyer.

308
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:26,456
Are you trying to contact him?

309
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,292
No. He's still alive.

310
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:31,125
- Retired.
- Oh.

311
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,494
At least,
I think he's still alive.

312
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,328
I haven't spoken with him
since last night.

313
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,526
Maybe something happened
this morning.

314
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,034
All right. Look, I get it.

315
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,764
You don't believe in this stuff,
and you probably think...

316
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,999
l知 some loon
who's just wasting your time.

317
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,975
But you know what?
You're here, so why not?

318
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,307
All l知 asking for is five
minutes for you to humor me.

319
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,007
You're right. l知 sorry.

320
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,141
Okay.

321
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:55,050
Just relax. Give it a go.

322
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,753
Okay. Just think about Kate.

323
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,354
Picture her in your mind:
the way she made you feel...

324
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,795
the way she looked.

325
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,662
Think about Kate.

326
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,704
- Oh, God.
- That didn't sound good.

327
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,841
My assistant. Probably
just shish-kebabbed his tongue.

328
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,123
Oh, God!

329
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,522
Whoa! Oh!

330
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,788
Holy shit!

331
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,538
Um, you know,
I-I should get going.

332
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:47,732
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,741
- I wanna check on my dad.
- Oh.

334
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,047
What do I owe you?

335
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,081
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

336
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,380
Oh, no. But l...
I mean...

337
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:00,510
No, no, no. I-I didn't...

338
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,644
I didn't get anything, so...

339
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,688
Yeah, but you tried.

340
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,484
If someone's pet dies
on the operating table...

341
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,819
you don't charge them, right?
I mean...

342
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:10,520
No. No, that...
That would make me a dick.

343
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,565
Right.
It's a good thing you don't.

344
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:16,466
Right. Yes, okay.

345
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,130
If I ever need any catering,
l値l know where to come.

346
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:20,297
I work cheap, so...

347
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,034
I can see you
why you have two jobs.

348
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,507
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you, Ashley.

349
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,441
Oh. Nice to meet you.

350
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:30,849
Say, "Pretty. Pretty bird."

351
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,441
Come on, say it.

352
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,248
You know, I gave you a key
in case of emergencies.

353
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,310
I think you and I just have...

354
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,550
a different definition
of "emergency."

355
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,149
So, how'd it go with Ashley?

356
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:44,424
Oh, that. Much to my surprise,
it was futile.

357
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,589
You didn't try.

358
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,927
I totally tried.

359
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,729
I chanted, you know, I played
with an eagle feather...

360
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,292
listened to some Tori Amos.

361
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,105
And nothing?

362
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,106
I mean, she's really nice,
but, I mean...

363
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:56,607
the whole thing
was kind of a joke.

364
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,167
Well, does she want you
to come back?

365
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,542
Chloe, enough, all right?

366
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:03,407
Right. You know what?

367
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,712
l知 never gonna help you again.

368
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,048
Is that a promise?

369
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,748
Well, unless it's an emergency.

370
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,356
Hey, you never told me
how it went on Friday.

371
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,986
Oh, what,
with the stockbroker?

372
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,156
What is it about telling a guy
that you're a psychic...

373
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,529
that makes him think
that you'll sleep with him...

374
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,124
on the first date?

375
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,635
Well, maybe they think that,
because you're a psychic...

376
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:25,966
you already know
that's all they're after...

377
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:27,733
so they might
as well just go for it.

378
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,776
That is so your gay prejudice
towards straight men talking.

379
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,970
No, no, it's all men.

380
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:35,639
Gay, straight, we're a real
goal-oriented gender...

381
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:36,682
when it comes to sex.

382
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,343
Dan, I think they're a little
more complicated than that.

383
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,283
No, we're not.

384
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:42,412
How's my ass look in this?

385
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,080
I don't know.
Can you get a little closer?

386
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,124
I still have
some peripheral vision left.

387
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,820
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

388
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,452
# And we ride the bus there #

389
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,053
# Pay the bus fare #

390
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,031
# Or we find a new reason #

391
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,260
# A new way of livin' #

392
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,928
# And we shout it out,
and try to... #

393
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,562
Good God, what the hell is that?

394
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,631
Oh, Dr. Mills,
you know this is Beatrice.

395
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,936
Lona, there are other ways
you can show your love...

396
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,035
for Beatrice
besides giving her food.

397
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:08,137
Take her for a walk,
throw her a Frisbee.

398
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:10,011
She's gained a little weight,
I know.

399
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,073
l致e driven cars
smaller than her.

400
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:14,346
She looks like a tick.

401
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,820
The prettiest tick
you've ever seen.

402
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,186
Well, let me grab
a couple of Sherpas.

403
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,282
They can help me hoist her
on the table.

404
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,192
Hey, guys, Beatrice is here.

405
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,423
Aw! I call head.

406
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:27,489
No, l知 not taking the ass
two times in a row.

407
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:28,931
- Shoot you for it.
- And you...

408
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,468
quit messin' with
whatever you're messing with.

409
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,936
l知 not messing with anything.

410
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,768
I make such a cute doctor.

411
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,273
I should've stayed in college.

412
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:38,403
These aren't toys.

413
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,104
Oh, hey, just curious...

414
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,943
do animal tranquilizers work
on people?

415
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,346
How'd you get those
out of my cabinet?

416
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,585
Here we go.

417
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:49,679
Is that it,
or can I go back to, uh...

418
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,881
Go ahead.

419
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:53,652
Oh, hello,
the reason why I came here.

420
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,627
Um, l致e got somebody
I want you to meet.

421
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:57,663
- Now hoist.
- Oh, God.

422
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,493
Her name is Janet.

423
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,157
- Okay.
- Janet.

424
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,326
I can already tell
I won't like her.

425
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,199
She sounds like somebody
with a dream catcher.

426
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,898
So, what,
are you never gonna date again?

427
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,966
l値l date when the right person
comes along.

428
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,669
Okay, well,
what if I told you...

429
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,838
she's an eighteen-year-old,
hot masseuse...

430
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:18,145
with huge natural breasts,
who loves to gourmet cook...

431
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,481
watch sports,
perform oral sex...

432
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:23,886
and when she's not doing
any of that, she saves whales.

433
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,259
I guess we could have lunch.

434
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,452
Okay.

435
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,392
What if she doesn't do
any of those things?

436
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:31,657
Goodbye, Chloe.

437
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:33,756
Tell me when you wanna start
dating again, okay?

438
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,698
Two years, five years, what?

439
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,030
I had the person I was gonna
spend my life with...

440
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,070
and I lost her.

441
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,504
So you're just gonna spend
the rest of your life alone?

442
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:43,064
No, l致e got you.
l致e got my work.

443
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,268
l知 sure
you're gonna get married...

444
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:47,278
and have kids or adopt
a slew of Nigerian children...

445
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,745
and l知 gonna get
to be Uncle Henry.

446
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:49,940
Um...

447
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,709
- Man down!
- There's a man down.

448
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,184
All right, l致e got to get...

449
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:57,914
Why would you even want these?

450
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,015
They're just cool.

451
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,821
They're so big.

452
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,162
I can't move my legs.

453
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,357
Oh!

454
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,637
l知 so sorry to bother you.

455
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,574
I was wondering if you would
maybe try again with Henry.

456
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,974
I mean, he really liked you...

457
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,636
and if
he's ever gonna believe...

458
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,307
that anyone is talking to Kate,
then I think it's gonna be you.

459
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,043
Yeah, I mean,
I think that's a great idea.

460
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,813
I just... I don't know
if he'll go for it.

461
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,718
I don't think
he would come to you...

462
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,950
but if you would go to him...

463
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:34,219
and you could prove
that you heard from Kate...

464
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,587
But I didn't.

465
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,289
- You could fake it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

466
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:39,558
I can't do that...

467
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,294
'cause l知 not like a,
you know, scam artist.

468
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,960
This is Kate's diary.
I, um...

469
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,628
I went into Henry's apartment
when he wasn't there...

470
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,137
you know, looking for letters
or anything...

471
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:48,264
that would have information...

472
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,103
that only the two of them
would know, and, I mean...

473
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,609
Henry doesn't even know
this exists.

474
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:52,939
Right. I just... I really...

475
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:54,639
Look, I know that you've heard
the story before...

476
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,442
but would you really think
about it?

477
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,915
Do you really think that Henry's
better off sitting alone...

478
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,781
in his apartment
for the rest of his life?

479
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,047
Do you really think
that Kate's ghost...

480
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,520
doesn't want him to date again?

481
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:07,218
l知 just asking you to tell
one little lie...

482
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,760
to salvage someone's life.

483
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,625
Is that so impossible?

484
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,500
Hey. Ashley, right?

485
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,006
- Yeah.
- Henry.

486
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:23,541
Henry. Hi.

487
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:24,940
- How are you?
- Yeah, good, good.

488
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,102
You shop here?

489
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:27,941
Yeah, they, uh... They have
really great tomatoes here...

490
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:32,450
so I just...
Oh, I see. Okay.

491
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:35,976
Uh, tomatoes are vegetables
that you buy fresh...

492
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,750
and then you cook them in food.

493
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,290
l致e heard about these, yeah.

494
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,053
I always wondered what was
on this side of the store.

495
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,991
- So colorful.
- Yeah.

496
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:44,495
How's business?

497
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,825
Oh, you know, sucks.

498
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,423
- So it's looking up.
- Look up, right.

499
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,662
Well, you know,
l値l let you go...

500
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,203
but, uh, if you're
ever in the area...

501
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,795
you should stop by,
and l値l cook you a...

502
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,306
l値l cook you a real meal.

503
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:56,636
All right.
Well, maybe l値l do that.

504
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:57,698
- Okay.
- Nice seeing you.

505
00:19:57,776 --> 00:19:58,834
Nice seeing you.

506
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,044
It was raining.

507
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:06,084
It was raining
when you met her...

508
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,277
the woman you were trying
to contact.

509
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:10,720
It was night time,
and it was raining.

510
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,222
You tried to steal her cab?

511
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:14,125
Yeah.

512
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,388
And you two...
You two got into a fight...

513
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,123
but you rode with her
all the way home...

514
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,427
even though you lived
in totally opposite directions.

515
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,433
That's exactly what happened.

516
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,661
And she stiffed me.

517
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,897
I wound up paying eighty bucks
for that cab ride.

518
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,103
Do you wanna go somewhere else,
so we can talk?

519
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,167
Yeah, it's...

520
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:34,770
Yeah.

521
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,216
So I noticed you didn't have
any animals in your apartment.

522
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,515
Oh, well, my building
doesn't allow pets...

523
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,145
but I always grew up with cats.

524
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:44,416
Oh.

525
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:46,784
When I get a new a place,
I think I might...

526
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,258
Wait. Why'd you go, "Oh"?

527
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,386
"Oh, you had cats.
That's nice."

528
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:53,488
No, that was more like,
"Ah, you had cats. Figures."

529
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:54,760
l知 a vet. I love cats.

530
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,767
Right.
And the women who have them?

531
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,694
They're insane,
across the board.

532
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:01,034
You know, they wear,
like, sweatshirts...

533
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:02,334
- with their cat on them.
- Oh.

534
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,399
You know, "Hang in there."

535
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:06,876
Hey, look,
let me ask you, when...

536
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:10,814
in the market,
were you, like...

537
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:12,407
Were you hearing someone?

538
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:14,452
Um, yeah, I mean, I think...
I think so.

539
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,545
I think it was Kate.

540
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,749
Seems a little hard to believe.

541
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:21,190
I know,
but do you wanna try again?

542
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,229
What do you got to lose?

543
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:28,433
All right.

544
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Let me just get
your hand, like... Okay.

545
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:35,162
This restaurant
reminds her of something.

546
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:38,367
New York. It was snowing.

547
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,473
We went...
We went there for Christmas.

548
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,516
You refused to admit
that you didn't speak French...

549
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,281
so you ordered the pancreas?

550
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:51,713
And then, later,
after you threw up all...

551
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:57,357
Hello. No, yeah.

552
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:58,691
No, no, no,
l知 just eating right now.

553
00:21:58,764 --> 00:21:59,924
You're not interrupting
anything.

554
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,024
Are you serious?

555
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:03,068
Just so you know,
that wasn't me.

556
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,602
- That was J.W. I swear.
- Wow.

557
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,728
What else?
Are you getting anything else?

558
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,738
- Okay, listen, we'll
come over tonight...
- Yeah, l知 just, I gotta...

559
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,000
I gotta get back into it.

560
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:10,098
- Okay?
- and we can meet afterwards.

561
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:11,164
Great.

562
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,768
Look, bro, when I see four girls
in matching bowling shirts...

563
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,143
that's how I roll, man.

564
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:16,841
It's totally true.

565
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:18,075
Sorry, l知,
like, totally thrown...

566
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,117
No, it was great.

567
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,175
- with the cell phone guy, um...
- I don't know where to begin.

568
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,312
- We should
just try another time.
- We started out with a donkey.

569
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:24,981
Yeah,
I have to get going anyway.

570
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,024
What are the odds there was...

571
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,888
- two chicks named Darla?
- Oh. When'd you give her
your card?

572
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,451
That's all right. You got
your tricks, l致e got mine.

573
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,019
- Wow.
- Seriously?

574
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,530
Yeah, but you don't really have
to be tricky...

575
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,897
if you wanna pay for lunch,
because I won't fight ya.

576
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,526
Yup. Cat person.

577
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:39,264
I thought it was the one
without her.

578
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:40,362
Thank you.

579
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,202
I was actually really nervous
at first...

580
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:43,434
but then it was so easy.

581
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:44,533
I almost wanted it
to be harder...

582
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,475
so I wouldn't feel bad
about the situation.

583
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:49,038
- What?
- Ashley.

584
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,847
- No.
- Look in my eyes.

585
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,408
- No.
- It's time for a reality check.

586
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,578
I don't want a reality check.

587
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:56,951
You don't want one,
because you know you need one.

588
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:59,149
Tell me you are done with this.

589
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:00,248
l知 done...

590
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,527
right after this next meeting.

591
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:03,891
Why are you doing all this?

592
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:05,259
l知... l知 helping someone.

593
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,027
Is he cute?

594
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,465
I don't see what that has to do
with anything.

595
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:10,502
Stay with me here.

596
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,059
You, ahem...
You hate doing this.

597
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,968
Yeah, it goes against
everything I believe.

598
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,472
All right,
but instead of just doing it

599
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,873
and getting it over with,
you're stretching it out.

600
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,205
Well, he's very skeptical.

601
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,405
I can't just blurt it out,
or else he'd never believe me.

602
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,948
Today, you had lunch.
Tomorrow, who knows, dinner?

603
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,210
Maybe you'll go to a movie...

604
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:26,444
channel his fianc馥 there.

605
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:27,712
- So off base.
- What does he do?

606
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,617
- Veterinarian.
- A doctor.

607
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:30,814
If you weren't gay,
l壇 think you're jealous.

608
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:31,856
If you weren't blushing...

609
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,084
l壇 think you were telling
the truth.

610
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:37,219
So you like
David Foster Wallace, huh?

611
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:38,627
I couldn't get past page 20.

612
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:40,631
I keep it there
because it makes me look smart.

613
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,057
Oh. Huh.

614
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,236
Oh, God, is he, like, a friend
of yours or something?

615
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,873
You got me a gift?

616
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:54,003
Well, you won't charge me,
and l知 taking up your time...

617
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,808
so, you know,
I had to do something.

618
00:23:58,751 --> 00:23:59,979
David Foster Wallace!

619
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,679
I love him.

620
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,915
I saw the book last time,
so I figured you were a fan.

621
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,547
I am. I am.

622
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,148
I can't wait to not read this.

623
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,193
Yeah, they're short stories...

624
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,784
so you could read
the first paragraph...

625
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,056
of each one and then just quit.

626
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,154
That's... That's great.

627
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,199
No, this is, um...
This was really sweet of you.

628
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,290
Thank you.

629
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,459
Should we get started?

630
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:18,662
- Yeah.
- Okay.

631
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:23,030
Oh, before we start, l致e been
doing a little research.

632
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,336
Okay.

633
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,970
Some of the things you've said
are pretty unbelievable...

634
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:30,105
and I think I know
how you're doing it.

635
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,050
Really?

636
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,550
Normally, in these readings...

637
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,452
the person that's getting read
gives out unconscious signals.

638
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,183
Like you could
suggest something...

639
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:40,817
and then l値l
shake my head no or nod...

640
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,861
and I don't even realize it,
but you pick up on it...

641
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,225
and then you get closer
and closer...

642
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:45,593
until you actually get
something.

643
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:48,593
All right,
well, that makes sense.

644
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,294
How do you...
How do you wanna deal with that?

645
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:51,768
Well, l知 gonna concentrate
really hard...

646
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,134
on not giving you anything.

647
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:54,900
I mean,
keep my body very still...

648
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,100
not change my voice. Nothin'.

649
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,905
Okay. Sounds good.

650
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,205
Uh, let's start.

651
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,371
Okay.

652
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:04,608
You're gonna talk like that
the whole time?

653
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,014
Yes.

654
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:07,108
You know what?

655
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,552
l知 still picking up a slight
bit of emotion from you...

656
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:10,849
so what I think
we should do...

657
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:14,620
is turn our chairs back to back
so I can't see you at all.

658
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:15,717
- Okay.
- Okay?

659
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,058
- Better?
- Yes.

660
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:25,103
You know what?

661
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,297
To be safe, I think we should be
in separate rooms.

662
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,363
Oh, but then
l知 gonna have to shout.

663
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:31,409
Yeah, all right. Now you're
just messing with me, right?

664
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:34,968
Yes.

665
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,015
That's pretty stupid, huh?

666
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,106
Yes.

667
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,275
You wanna
go get something to eat?

668
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:40,375
Yes.

669
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,447
So, you bring
all your psychics here?

670
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,152
Well, you really should know
the answer to that.

671
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:51,490
But this is a cool place
that you picked...

672
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:52,530
l値l give you that.

673
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,122
Kate showed it to me.

674
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,698
You know,
l知 getting the feeling...

675
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,933
like she wants you
to be happy again...

676
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:04,703
like when you used to come here.

677
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,569
l知 getting that feeling, too.

678
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,919
You are so screwed.

679
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,960
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

680
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:25,091
Oh. Right.

681
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:30,225
Traitors.

682
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,863
Lying, cheating,
red-headed hussy.

683
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,133
l値l wring her neck.

684
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,899
Throw her in front of a car,
throw her down some stairs.

685
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,970
# She had blonde hair,
blue eyes, too #

686
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,016
# And she had
a little itty-bitty #

687
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,607
# Hootchie-cootchie-coo #

688
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,516
You. You bastard.

689
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,555
Whoa. Hey, evening, Miss.

690
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,423
You can hear me?

691
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:53,651
Unfortunately.

692
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:54,692
Are you psychic?

693
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,022
No, dead.

694
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,061
Good. What happened?

695
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,030
Drunk driving accident.

696
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,895
Oh, so backing over me
with your truck wasn't enough...

697
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,662
to get you to stop
drinking and driving?

698
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:04,963
l知 not proud.

699
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:06,095
What are you doing here?

700
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,297
Same as you.

701
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:10,637
Takin' care
of unfinished business.

702
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,903
Are you sure
that's why you're here?

703
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,239
That's what the lady told me.

704
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:14,904
- The lady in the white room?
- 'Course.

705
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,379
Why, what'd she tell you?

706
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:17,472
None of your business.

707
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:19,784
Did she give you any hints?

708
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,614
How... How specific was she?

709
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,914
Ah, you didn't talk to her,
did you?

710
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,256
What'd you do, piss her off?

711
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:28,623
Unfinished business.

712
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,454
Well, that's it.

713
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:35,490
I got to protect Henry.

714
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:36,591
Yeah.

715
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:38,363
Wh... Hey, hey!

716
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:40,662
You're welcome.

717
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,142
Hey. Can I help you?

718
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:47,508
Hi. Um, l知 sorry.

719
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:48,773
I called, and no one answered.

720
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:51,680
Um, my friend gave me
your number in yoga class.

721
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,342
Well, l知 just having
a really bad day.

722
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:56,876
My... My friend died,
and we had a fight.

723
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,617
Oh, okay, okay.
Sure, sure, sure, come in.

724
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,919
Come in. It's fine.

725
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:02,255
Thank you.

726
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:06,089
Okay. Come right this way.

727
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,994
l知 sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

728
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,536
Oh, it's Kay... eleen.

729
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:14,094
- Kayleen?
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,764
Great.
Um, why don't you come this way.

731
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:16,967
Uh, just have a seat.

732
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,033
Do you want a drink or anything?

733
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,078
No, l知 fine.

734
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:21,112
Okay, great.

735
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,976
Make yourself comfortable.

736
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:25,614
Okay.

737
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,119
So, you talk to dead people?

738
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:31,280
Well, I can't promise results...

739
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:33,347
but, yes,
I have had some success.

740
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,416
Comes in nice and clear, huh?

741
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:36,461
No mistaking it?

742
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:37,688
Sometimes, yeah.

743
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:38,821
Great. Can't wait.

744
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,159
All right, so the first thing
l知 gonna have you do...

745
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:41,426
is give me your hands.

746
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,525
Uh, you...
Uh, we probably shouldn't...

747
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,866
because l知, uh,
coming down with a cold.

748
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,545
Okay. Um, great.

749
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:56,911
Okay, this is what
we'll do then.

750
00:28:56,982 --> 00:29:00,611
Um, why don't you concentrate
on your friend, okay?

751
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:02,778
And let's try to see
if she can come through to us.

752
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,549
- You're the psychic.
- Great.

753
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:13,324
Yeah, wow,
l知 getting something.

754
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:17,357
Ashley Clark, you have made
a mockery of the gifts...

755
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:18,926
you've been given.

756
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:20,972
Uh, Kayleen?

757
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,507
You speak falsely for the dead.

758
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:26,544
We have been sent here
to give you a warning.

759
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:30,638
Stop now or suffer
a terrible fate.

760
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:32,148
Is this some sort of joke?

761
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:33,548
This is no joke.

762
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:36,553
We see and hear everything.

763
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:40,182
We saw you drop the tray
of meatballs last night...

764
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,522
and still serve them.

765
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:45,620
We saw what you did
in the shower last night...

766
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,396
and it's nothing
to be ashamed of...

767
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,765
but we still saw.

768
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,736
And we see
what you're trying to do...

769
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:54,294
to Henry Mills.

770
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,306
l... l知 just...

771
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:57,500
You, of all people...

772
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,443
should know the consequences
of defaming the dead.

773
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,446
Leave Henry Mills alone...

774
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:05,244
or you will never
find peace again.

775
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:08,582
You will lose your possessions,
your friends...

776
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:12,020
and eventually your life.

777
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,117
This is the only time
we will visit you.

778
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Oh, I must've dozed off.

779
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,793
Did you contact my friend?

780
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:28,269
Ashley, are you okay?

781
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:31,865
Please go.

782
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:33,968
Well, you look
like you've seen a ghost.

783
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,240
Can you go now, please?

784
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,338
Just go.

785
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,834
You'll never guess
who I ran into.

786
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,166
- Who?
- Ashley.

787
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:02,872
Ashley...

788
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:04,533
I know so many Ashleys.

789
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,576
The psychic.

790
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:07,737
Oh, that Ashley.

791
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,803
- What did she say?
- Well, it was really weird.

792
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,544
I mean, she got these images,
really specific stuff.

793
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,347
Really? Wow.

794
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,546
Will she get a message
from Kate?

795
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,383
- Like what?
- Huh?

796
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:20,822
- What?
- What?

797
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:24,921
Anyway, we're, you know,
gonna try it again.

798
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,759
That's great.
That's... I really...

799
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,423
I feel like
she can help you, Henry.

800
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,525
Come on, Ashley!

801
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,435
Ashley, come on!

802
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,029
She's not home?

803
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,267
Uh, why?

804
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,367
Are you here to meet her?

805
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:41,309
No, we had, um, an appointment.

806
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:43,108
Wait a second.
Are you Henry...

807
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,842
the-the veterinarian?

808
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,110
She mentioned me?

809
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:47,446
No, it's just
a really lucky guess.

810
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,918
l知 good like that.

811
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:50,420
l知 Dan, the catering partner.

812
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:51,887
- Right. Hi, Dan.
- Hi.

813
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,584
Yeah, we were supposed to meet
an hour and a half ago...

814
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:55,922
at this restaurant, but
she's not answering her phone.

815
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,723
I know.
l致e been calling her all day.

816
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:58,820
Do you mind if I try?

817
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:01,325
Knocking?

818
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:04,197
Please. No, please.
Help yourself.

819
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,169
Maybe later you can come
jab an elevator button...

820
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:07,899
a hundred times
after l致e already pushed it.

821
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:11,509
Ashley!

822
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:13,737
Ashley, it's Henry.
Are you there?

823
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,508
Henry, l知 sick!

824
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:19,141
I tried to call.

825
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,515
I might be sick
for a really long time.

826
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,319
Okay, do you need anything?

827
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,950
No. l値l call you
if I ever feel better.

828
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:29,357
Ashley?

829
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:31,121
Ashley!

830
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,328
Got more than you did.

831
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:43,005
Hey, it's Ashley,
psychic-slash-caterer...

832
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:44,405
leave an awesome message.

833
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,034
Good morning. It's Henry.

834
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:47,669
Just thought l壇 check in
since you didn't...

835
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:50,306
- # This little light of mine #
- sound so good last night,
see if you're all right.

836
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:53,579
- So, um, you all right?
- # l知 gonna let it shine #

837
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:54,949
Morning again.

838
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,851
It's, uh, Henry again.

839
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,821
That's some cold.
I hope you didn't get it...

840
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,084
when we went out
the other night.

841
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:01,352
Anyway, I was gonna...

842
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,587
you know, come by and drop off
some soup or something...

843
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:05,926
so, um, maybe l値l see you.

844
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:09,765
# Shine, let it shine #

845
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:13,065
# Even if it burns your eyes #

846
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,834
# This light of mine is mine #

847
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,670
- # And l知 gonna let it shine #
- It's Henry.

848
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,540
The sandwich was gone, so,
you know, that's a good sign.

849
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:21,909
Buying a sandwich for someone...

850
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,140
you've never
had a sandwich with...

851
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:24,476
is a lot harder than you think.

852
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:25,948
I mean, just the bread.

853
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:27,484
I started off
with whole wheat...

854
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,520
but then I worried that,
you know, l知 saying...

855
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:31,020
you're kind
of a crunchy person...

856
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:32,750
who only eats whole wheat.

857
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:35,315
I almost went with pumpernickel,
but then l壇 look like...

858
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,883
the kind of guy
who wants to impose...

859
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:39,293
my weird bread fetish
on everyone and...

860
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:42,026
You know, now, l知 one of those
idiots who just prattles on...

861
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,590
in, uh, answering machines...

862
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,867
and also uses a word
like "prattles."

863
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,439
So the only thing I can think of
is that, uh, you really just...

864
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:51,770
you don't
wanna talk to me anymore.

865
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:56,472
Um, if that's right,
well, um...

866
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:57,913
I don't know, I guess just...

867
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,643
kinda keep doin'
what you're doin'.

868
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,652
- # Shine, let it shine #
- So, take care of yourself...

869
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:06,816
- # Even if it burns your eyes #
- Ashley.

870
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:09,451
# This light of mine is mine #

871
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,893
# And l知 gonna let it shine #

872
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,388
There you are.

873
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:15,592
Why have you been avoiding
my brother?

874
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,328
Uh, I can explain.

875
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:18,460
Um...

876
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,072
I guess I can't explain.

877
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:25,131
Okay,
if you didn't wanna do this...

878
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,177
you should've just said so...

879
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:27,370
but to lead him on
and let him think...

880
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:29,072
that you can help him
and then just disappear?

881
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,577
I mean, he's worse off,
if that's possible.

882
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,707
I just couldn't do it anymore,
all right?

883
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,751
l知 sorry.

884
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,149
Please tell him l知 sorry.

885
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,380
Did you run out of things
to say?

886
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:37,421
- No, it's not that.
It's not that.
- Because I have...

887
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,456
- It's not...
- more information.

888
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:39,956
I have letters
and some pictures and...

889
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,616
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's Kate.

890
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,555
Oh, God!

891
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:49,600
Wait, what do...
What does that mean?

892
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,430
Do... Do you want the letters?

893
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:54,301
All right, show's over.

894
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,307
Come out. I know who you are...

895
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,342
Kate.

896
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,672
- Boo.
- God.

897
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:03,513
God, it's really you.
This is unbelievable.

898
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,105
- Are you really like a...
- Ghost?

899
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,312
It's the only way
I can explain it.

900
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:08,613
That is awesome.

901
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:10,953
Here, catch.

902
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:16,160
Nice throw.

903
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:17,319
Crap.

904
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,227
Hey, what was that
the other day, man?

905
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,459
I was just trying to help out
the situation.

906
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:23,501
Help?

907
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,195
You were helping yourself
to Henry.

908
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,495
Okay, so, like, l知 like...

909
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:29,767
l知 like
slightly attracted to him.

910
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:30,933
Well, he's not right for you.

911
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,169
Yes, he is.

912
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:35,974
He is considerate, and
he is sweet, and, you know...

913
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,947
pulls the chair out for me
when I sit.

914
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:38,983
Big deal.

915
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,745
It is a big deal,
and you know it, okay?

916
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,514
He's been wonderful to me
from the second he met me...

917
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:44,282
even though he probably thought
I was a little crazy.

918
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:45,322
Well, you do
talk to dead people.

919
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,357
That's a little crazy.

920
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,618
Oh, l知 crazy?

921
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,456
You're the one who's spying
on me in the frickin' shower.

922
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,090
You're right.
l知 sorry about that.

923
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,532
You know what, girl to girl,
you're gettin' a little hippy.

924
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:59,160
You might wanna cut back
on the pasta.

925
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,228
All right, what do you want?

926
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:04,366
l知 serious. Why are you here?

927
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:05,670
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot...

928
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,574
and that's partly my fault...

929
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:09,169
with the threats
from beyond and all.

930
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:10,544
- Yeah.
- But here's the thing.

931
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:12,845
I was sent back to earth
to protect Henry.

932
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,782
Really? How do you know that?

933
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:18,118
Because when you die,
you go to this white room...

934
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:21,886
and there's a woman who may
or may not be an angel...

935
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,420
and she says that, you know,
just, you know...

936
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:28,329
stuff, and I just know.

937
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,426
So, like, I have to like
stay away from Henry now?

938
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:35,098
Oh, that would be so great.
Thank you.

939
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:38,733
Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

940
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,243
But you're dead.

941
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:41,869
I still don't want you
to see him.

942
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,379
Yeah, I know,
but for argument's sake...

943
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,540
I mean,
if I wanted to see him...

944
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,174
there's not a whole hell
of a lot you could do about it.

945
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,275
Really?

946
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:50,150
Then why have you been hiding
in your bedroom for a week?

947
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,182
Well, l知 done hiding.

948
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:53,690
Let's not let this get ugly.

949
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:54,725
I think it already has.

950
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,054
You have no idea.

951
00:36:58,963 --> 00:36:59,987
Ashley?

952
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:01,793
Hi, Henry.

953
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,231
Oh, sorry.

954
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,290
"Dr. Mills."

955
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,234
Oh, hey, you're alive.

956
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:07,669
Yeah, thanks to you.

957
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,365
You're a real lifesaver.

958
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,409
Know... You know,
the food that you left me...

959
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:13,944
was the only thing
that kept me going.

960
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:15,240
Oh, you got that. Good.

961
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:16,746
I left a couple
of messages, but...

962
00:37:16,814 --> 00:37:18,941
I know. l知 so sorry.
I, um...

963
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:21,349
I just... I felt so ill
that I couldn't talk to anyone.

964
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:22,386
But the minute I felt better...

965
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:24,717
I wanted to come down here
and thank you in person.

966
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:26,051
I hope you're not mad at me.

967
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,751
No, not at all. l...

968
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,486
l知 sorry that I called
and bothered you.

969
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,153
I mean, you said that you'd call
when you felt better...

970
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:32,787
and here you are.

971
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,263
Do you wanna go out tonight?

972
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,901
Yeah. All right. l壇 love to.

973
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,529
Okay, great.

974
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:43,096
Oh, great. Oh, great.

975
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:45,608
l値l let you get back
to saving animals' lives...

976
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,201
and everything.

977
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:48,438
Okay.

978
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,117
And what seems to be
the trouble with Margaret?

979
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,589
itchy ass.

980
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:01,852
Excellent.

981
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:19,910
Oh!

982
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,605
Oh, God!

983
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:23,881
Ashley, hello.

984
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,313
What was that crash?
I heard a crash.

985
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:27,711
- Ashley, hello.
- Shit.

986
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:29,116
What is going on?
Is there someone there?

987
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,154
Is someone at your place?

988
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,188
- Hello.

00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:39,728
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

992
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,492
Dan. Sorry.

993
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:43,033
The phone scared me,
so I killed it.

994
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:44,932
What's going on?
Where have you been?

995
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:46,903
- Why haven't you talked to me?
- It's a long story.

996
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,097
l致e got time.

997
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,400
l... I can't talk right now.

998
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:50,441
Why don't you

999
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:51,770
we'll work on the Spencer party.
I got to go.

1000
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:52,901
Where are you off to?

1001
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:54,569
The gym. Okay?
I got to go. Bye.

1002
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,646
- Oh, wait, Dan!
- Yeah?

1003
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:58,079
Would you say l知 hippy?

1004
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,281
# Goddess on the mountain top #

1005
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:04,116
# Burning like a silver flame #

1006
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,816
# The summit
of beauty and love #

1007
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,085
# And Venus was her name #

1008
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,524
# Whoa #

1009
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,890
There's a gas leak
in the building.

1010
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,727
Everyone get out now.

1011
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,061
This is an emergency.

1012
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:22,496
It'll be fine
if we just don't freak out!

1013
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:24,131
It's all right! It's okay!

1014
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,176
We'll be right
if we just stay cool!

1015
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:28,610
Just stay cool, guys!
Just don't light a match!

1016
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,405
What... Everyone out!

1017
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:35,853
Oh, no.

1018
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,251
- Miss?
- The...

1019
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:38,879
It was just the P.A.

1020
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:41,285
Was there an announcement
on the P. A?

1021
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:43,921
What P. A?

1022
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:48,056
Stairmaster's open,
you know, for your... Mm-hmm.

1023
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,725
Miss.

1024
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:53,362
Yeah. I was just...

1025
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:55,804
Well, look at me, hmm?

1026
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:57,568
Naked in there, okay.

1027
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,769
Just kidding.
Sorry about that, you guys.

1028
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,141
l知 crazy.

1029
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:05,809
So, do you have any idea
where you wanna eat?

1030
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:06,850
Um, no.

1031
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:08,613
I mean, if you have a place...
some place in mind or...

1032
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,347
No, it's your treat,
so, you know...

1033
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,388
l知 gonna let you choose.

1034
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:15,153
Oh, well, in that case, I just...
I know just the place, actually.

1035
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:16,953
No, I was... I was kidding.

1036
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:17,995
Do you wanna get some seafood?

1037
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,188
Oh, no, no, big talker...

1038
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:21,231
you're now gonna eat
a hot dog out of a cart.

1039
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,160
- Hey.
- Sor... Oh, sorry.

1040
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:25,896
Uh, one Italian sausage.

1041
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:28,434
- Thank you.
- No, make it two.

1042
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:29,973
If you're sure you wouldn't
rather have seafood.

1043
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,440
No, we're...
No, we're fine with the two.

1044
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:32,999
Two Italian sausage.
Thank you.

1045
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,977
Are you going to treat me
to a funnel cake, too?

1046
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,414
Only if you're a good boy.

1047
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:42,280
Watch out for that.

1048
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:46,321
Stop it, please.
It's really not funny.

1049
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,017
No, you're right.
That's horrible.

1050
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:54,193
Stop, 'cause if you wanna play,
l値l play that game.

1051
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,596
You wanna play that game?

1052
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,531
Oh, my God! Oh!

1053
00:40:57,602 --> 00:40:59,832
Ohh!

1054
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,269
Oh.

1055
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,363
Let me just...

1056
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,243
You got a little somethin', uh...

1057
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:14,246
I can't believe
you're not embarrassed...

1058
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,218
to be seen with me right now.

1059
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,754
Oh, God, no, no, I totally am.

1060
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:18,914
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1061
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,423
If I run into anybody
that I know...

1062
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,152
l知 gonna pretend
you're a German tourist.

1063
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,292
I don't wanna be associated
with you.

1064
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:25,454
Do you know any German?

1065
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:28,957
Uh... Ich machen dachen
zeit yachen...

1066
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,967
tick wagen
fahr Fig Newton...

1067
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:32,866
in BMW en zag.

1068
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:34,268
It's kinda like
a Swedish German.

1069
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:35,600
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1070
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:36,697
- It's not. Yeah.
- It's good.

1071
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,742
Yes, no, I think the bathrooms
are over there...

1072
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,574
German lady,
who's from also Sweden...

1073
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:42,704
that I don't even know.

1074
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:46,072
Hey, I feel kind of weird
bringing this up...

1075
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,710
but have you thought
about Kate lately?

1076
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:53,918
Um, yeah, not really.

1077
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:56,186
I mean, you know
how I feel about all that...

1078
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,751
but you said
some pretty amazing things.

1079
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,525
Can I ask you a question?

1080
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:01,690
Sure.

1081
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,964
Um, there's no right
or wrong answer to this...

1082
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:08,369
so you can just be honest,
but, um, are we...

1083
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:11,505
Are we out to talk about Kate...

1084
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:15,740
or-or are we,
you know, just out?

1085
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,611
Because, either way
is totally fine with me.

1086
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:21,345
I just... If it's both...

1087
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,212
then it probably gets, like,
a little complicated for me.

1088
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:29,425
Yeah, I was kind of wondering
the same thing, actually.

1089
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,825
I mean, are we out
because l知 your client...

1090
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,921
or are we out?

1091
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:00,214
Oh, great, l知 your client.

1092
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,285
That sucks.

1093
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:10,500
I had a good time.

1094
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:11,728
Me, too.

1095
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:14,529
l値l call you tomorrow.

1096
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:15,697
Okay, you don't have to.

1097
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:16,831
No, I want to.

1098
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:19,172
Okay. Okay, me, too.

1099
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:21,168
Okay.

1100
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:25,239
Bye.

1101
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,233
Forgetting something?

1102
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:47,497
Was I somehow unclear
about what I wanted you to do?

1103
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:49,964
Oh, were you expecting Henry?

1104
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,976
I was hoping.
He's quite a kisser.

1105
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:54,602
You're really gonna
throw that in my face?

1106
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,374
Isn稚 that tactic
a little beneath you?

1107
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:57,414
You're one to talk!

1108
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:00,006
I had to show a room
full of guys my naked breasts...

1109
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:01,312
because of you!

1110
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:06,683
That's a nice gesture,
but unnecessary, dear.

1111
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh, I was... Um...

1112
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,889
Good night.

1113
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,356
Bingo, come on.

1114
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:16,400
That dog just sniffed you.

1115
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,367
God, I think
the animals can see you.

1116
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:19,460
That is so cool.

1117
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:20,526
That's great.

1118
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,231
Wonder how I can use that
against you?

1119
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:23,273
Hey, I showed it to you.

1120
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:24,740
Yeah, that was dumb.

1121
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:27,010
I don't understand.

1122
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,444
If you weren't sick,
then what was the problem?

1123
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:30,480
I can't get into it...

1124
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:31,776
because you're
gonna think l知 crazy.

1125
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:32,816
No, no, no. l値l hide it.

1126
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:35,943
I promise, l値l look at you
really sincerely and say...

1127
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,351
"I understand."

1128
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,981
- Okay. Fine.
- Good.

1129
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,321
You remember Henry, right?

1130
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,759
Yeah, yeah.
The guy with the wife...

1131
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:45,921
that was the crushed
by the angel.

1132
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:47,487
Right. I saw her.

1133
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,562
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1134
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:55,366
Uh, now,
when you say, uh, you saw her...

1135
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,166
you mean you saw...

1136
00:44:58,242 --> 00:44:59,971
- Her ghost, yes.
- Mm.

1137
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:01,671
Yeah, she's been hassling me.

1138
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,008
I understand.

1139
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,139
No, Dan, this is not a joke.

1140
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,047
Look, l致e heard voices
before and stuff like that...

1141
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:08,642
but l致e actually seen her.

1142
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:09,845
Do you see her right now?

1143
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,285
No, I only see her
when she wants me to see her...

1144
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:12,549
I think. I don't know.

1145
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:15,147
You know what?
Never mind. l知 kidding.

1146
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,716
I seriously was kidding.
I totally made that up.

1147
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:17,920
Let's cook. I bought salmon.

1148
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:19,895
You... You really believe this,
don't you?

1149
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,022
It's really happening.

1150
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:23,498
And it's only you.
No one else can see or hear her?

1151
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,364
Yeah. I don't know why l知
the only one who can see her.

1152
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,427
Maybe because l知 after the guy
she was supposed to marry.

1153
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:29,132
Maybe that's sufficient
motivation for her...

1154
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,571
to come back from the dead.
I don't know.

1155
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:33,235
I note that
during your little rant...

1156
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,211
defending your sanity,
you admit you're after him.

1157
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:40,711
Well, yeah, I mean,
we're like...

1158
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:42,582
We're like... We're
sort of dating or whatever.

1159
00:45:43,454 --> 00:45:44,478
Ashley.

1160
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:48,051
No, I don't want
a reality check.

1161
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,888
This is what happens
when you lie...

1162
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,860
about talking
to a man's dead fianc馥.

1163
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:52,987
l致e seen it a thousand times.

1164
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,793
No, because l知 not lying, okay?

1165
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,890
I can actually talk to her.
That's different.

1166
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:58,798
Okay, I was lying before...

1167
00:45:58,869 --> 00:45:59,961
because I actually
couldn't talk to her.

1168
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:01,732
And also, admittedly...

1169
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:03,239
I lied to you
about being interested in him.

1170
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:04,467
So I am sorry about that.

1171
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:05,531
Yeah, listen,
while you work that out...

1172
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:07,474
maybe this can bubble
into your subconscious.

1173
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:08,773
Run away!

1174
00:46:08,846 --> 00:46:10,677
I mean, you have dated guys
with every problem there is...

1175
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:13,148
but this one, apparently,
has a ghost?

1176
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:14,878
Yeah, but it's not his fault
his fianc馥's haunting me.

1177
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:17,284
- Mm.
- Look, it's impossible
to find a great guy...

1178
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:18,651
and l知 not gonna
let a little thing...

1179
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:19,916
like a ghost stop me, okay?

1180
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,389
l知 not gonna let her win.

1181
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:22,426
You mean her ghost?

1182
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:23,619
- Right.
- I understand.

1183
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:25,127
l知 going to the market.
Bone the fish.

1184
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:42,476
Are you all right?
Why are you screaming?

1185
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:44,813
No, I wasn't.

1186
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:45,974
I was... I was singing.

1187
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:49,477
Thanks.

1188
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,786
Father Marks?

1189
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:58,829
Ashley.

1190
00:46:58,896 --> 00:46:59,954
That's me.

1191
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,727
I haven't seen you in,
what's it been, ten years?

1192
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:06,235
l致e been
to a few Christmas services.

1193
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:08,669
Well, next Christmas, why don't
you come up and say hello?

1194
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:10,832
Absolutely.
I will put that in my calendar.

1195
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:12,500
December the 25th.

1196
00:47:12,576 --> 00:47:14,271
Got it.

1197
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:15,403
Well, you didn't come here...

1198
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:17,970
so I could make you squirm
about your attendance.

1199
00:47:18,048 --> 00:47:19,208
Now that you mention it.

1200
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:25,587
Um... Father, um, l致e... l致e...

1201
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:26,987
l致e had an encounter...

1202
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:30,492
encounters with a ghost.

1203
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:31,789
Well, you mustn稚 be
completely surprised...

1204
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,659
that this is happening to you.

1205
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:34,959
I mean, if you dabble
with the occult...

1206
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:37,466
you're bound to get
these kind of incidents.

1207
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:38,934
- I know.
- Well, all right.

1208
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:40,834
You're not here
to get a lecture from me.

1209
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:42,395
So why did you come here?

1210
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:45,569
I want you to get rid of her.

1211
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:49,839
Do you see the ghost now?

1212
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:50,881
No.

1213
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:53,849
And this room is where
you've seen her the most?

1214
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,408
Definitely.
This is definitely the room...

1215
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:56,817
where I see her most.

1216
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,718
So, uh, is there a script
for this sort of thing?

1217
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,919
For exorcism? Oh sure, sure.

1218
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:05,222
No, when you're
casting out spirits...

1219
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:07,730
the Church doesn't really
like us to wing it.

1220
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:08,992
Right. Of course.

1221
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:13,098
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1222
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,694
Yes.

1223
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,536
"I address thee, spirit,
in the name of the Father...

1224
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:20,372
"and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

1225
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:23,413
"Come out
and leave this servant of God."

1226
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,879
You don't really believe
this is gonna work.

1227
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:26,541
I see her. She's right there.

1228
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:31,686
"It is time
for your soul to pass on.

1229
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:34,724
"Hear the command
of God himself...

1230
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:35,952
"who did
walk upon the sea...

1231
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:37,789
"and extend his right hand
to Peter."

1232
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,261
You really don't believe
in all this hocus-pocus, do you?

1233
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,322
"in the name of God, the
Almighty Father...

1234
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:44,594
- "that thou depart..."
- Oh, that's not good.

1235
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:46,431
It's working. It's working.

1236
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:48,403
Uh, okay, Ashley, listen.

1237
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:51,168
l致e been reconsidering,
and I think we can come...

1238
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,335
- to some sort of understanding.
- "Let the Holy Spirit...

1239
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,707
"dwell therein."

1240
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:56,405
Okay, uh, s-s-some of the...

1241
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,948
some of the things I did,
a little out of hand...

1242
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:01,746
and l壇 like to take
this opportunity to apologize.

1243
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:05,414
You know, the whole naked
in the gym thing, not cool.

1244
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,513
I get it now.

1245
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:10,685
- What's happening?
- "Therefore,
restless spirit...

1246
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:11,750
Oh, make it stop!

1247
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:13,854
"acknowledge
that your time has ended."

1248
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,059
Please, I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go!

1249
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:22,162
She's gone.

1250
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:26,333
Yeah.

1251
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:28,973
You did it.

1252
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:30,445
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1253
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:32,880
l知... l知... l知 sure.

1254
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,974
She was right there...

1255
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:36,981
and then she vanished.

1256
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:38,487
Well, bugger me.

1257
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:40,847
Good.

1258
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:43,486
- Good.
- Very good.

1259
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:49,927
So, you're, uh, finished
with your psychic work?

1260
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,934
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's over.

1261
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:54,596
And we'll see you in church
on a regular basis?

1262
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:56,196
We didn't agree to that
before we started.

1263
00:49:56,273 --> 00:49:57,797
Oh, l値l bring her back.

1264
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,074
It's a deal. It's a deal.
I promise.

1265
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,442
Okay. No more of these games.

1266
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:04,344
- I know. l知 sorry.
- Take care of yourself...

1267
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,382
- Ashley Clark.
- Bye-bye.

1268
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:09,309
He sounded so serious.

1269
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,320
No! No!

1270
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,412
Did you like
that disappearing thing?

1271
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:13,478
I just made that up.

1272
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:14,990
I didn't even know
I could do that before now.

1273
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:17,661
Okay, time to get to work.

1274
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:20,629
Tonight, instead of sleeping,
I thought l壇 tell you...

1275
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:23,758
all the stories
of all the pets l致e ever owned.

1276
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:26,762
- Oh, people love pet stories.
- Just... Just...

1277
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:29,362
So, l知 gonna start
with the first pet I ever had.

1278
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,705
It was a turtle named Ernie,
and I must've been eight.

1279
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:34,038
She actually had kittens.

1280
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,738
She had baby kittens,
and then we named them all.

1281
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:38,509
And we used to call him Boots,
because he was all white...

1282
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:39,947
and he had these little black...

1283
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:41,848
- Boots?
- Exactly.

1284
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:45,446
At least that's what we called
him until "he" had kittens.

1285
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:47,683
Then we named him Mrs. Piggy.

1286
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:50,784
And there were six kittens.
What were their names?

1287
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:56,957
Was that you?

1288
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,166
The doorbell?

1289
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,703
Yeah, that was me.
Don't answer that.

1290
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:15,984
I remember the kittens' names!

1291
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:19,318
It was Willy, Betty, Whiskers...

1292
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,221
Fang, Teddy, and Nugget!

1293
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:23,885
And then there was Buffy,
who was my last dog.

1294
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:25,588
But after he died, that was it.

1295
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,263
God, I think that's all my pets.

1296
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,264
You should get some sleep.

1297
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:32,029
Mmm... thank you.

1298
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,368
Good morning.

1299
00:51:37,441 --> 00:51:39,636
- The time is 7 A.M.
- You have a busy day
in front of you...

1300
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,177
- Good morning, everyone.
- so I thought you might
like to hear...

1301
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:43,509
all my favorite colors
and numbers.

1302
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,107
- Blue, seven, seventeen...
- Good morning, everyone! Well...

1303
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:51,621
Lime green, forest green,
yellow, one, blue.

1304
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:53,622
Oh, crap,
did I already say blue?

1305
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,715
You know what?
l知 gonna start over.

1306
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,955
- Blue.
- Ow!

1307
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:00,019
Oh, God!

1308
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:03,529
Gettin' tired? Unable to
function?

1309
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:05,627
l知 fine.

1310
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:06,669
You know,
you really should think...

1311
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:08,068
about what you're
getting into here.

1312
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:09,105
I don't need sleep.

1313
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:11,232
I can hound you
every second of every day.

1314
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:12,275
You're never gonna know...

1315
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:13,809
if something you hear
is real or not.

1316
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:15,708
I can keep you
from sleeping and eating...

1317
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:17,110
- and drinking...
- Enough!

1318
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,672
Enough, okay?
Congratulations, you win.

1319
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:23,510
I love spending time with Henry,
but it's not worth it.

1320
00:52:24,955 --> 00:52:27,321
Good.
Then my work here is done.

1321
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:29,821
But if you ever try
to see him again...

1322
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:31,520
- You'll be back.
- You can count on it.

1323
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:32,619
Go.

1324
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:34,821
Hey, wait, Kate.

1325
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,061
Look, is there, um...

1326
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,368
Is there anything
you wanna tell him?

1327
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:40,970
What do you mean?

1328
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,801
Well, Henry came to me...

1329
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,135
because he wanted
to talk to you...

1330
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,041
and I definitely think
I can deliver on that.

1331
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:49,809
So is there anything
you wanna say to him?

1332
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:55,913
Kate contacted me from beyond...

1333
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,321
not like before, but clearer.

1334
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,085
Clearer than anything
that I have ever experienced.

1335
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:03,251
What did she say?

1336
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:06,495
Hi, Henry.

1337
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:11,325
She says, "Hi, Henry."

1338
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:15,164
I know. Um, you know what?

1339
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:18,001
Ask me questions.

1340
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:22,739
Just, uh, ask me as
many questions as you'd like...

1341
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:24,872
and just keep asking me
until you're convinced.

1342
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:27,210
What was her favorite food?

1343
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:30,486
The three berry cake
at Sweet Lady Jane's.

1344
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:32,317
She says ask a tough one.

1345
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:36,389
Um, what was
her first pet's name?

1346
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,894
Ernie the turtle.
She told me that earlier today.

1347
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:42,062
Her favorite Hawaiian island?

1348
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:47,692
She's only been to Maui, and
she got stung by a jellyfish.

1349
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,968
You really, uh...

1350
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:53,967
What else?

1351
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:56,874
She always hated this chair.

1352
00:53:56,947 --> 00:54:00,007
Her second toes are slightly
longer than her first.

1353
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,710
She always meant
to take guitar lessons.

1354
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:04,219
Well, l...
Why did she come here?

1355
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:05,880
I mean, what does
she wanna tell me?

1356
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,516
She says that she can tell
that you're torn...

1357
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:11,390
between being faithful
to her memory...

1358
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:13,190
and the feelings
that you have for me.

1359
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,257
The hell I did!

1360
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,331
Ow! Oh! Ah!

1361
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:20,632
- What happened?
- Seed in the eye! It's okay!

1362
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:22,171
Tell him the truth!

1363
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,673
She says she just wants you
to be happy, Henry...

1364
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:27,107
and she can tell
that you're happier with me.

1365
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:30,240
You are screwing
with the wrong woman.

1366
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:32,680
That's it. I mean,
she wants you to move on.

1367
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:34,740
Oh, she's gone.

1368
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:35,785
No, l知 not!

1369
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:37,046
l知 right here!

1370
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,678
l知 right here!

1371
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:40,985
l知 gonna be with you
every second of every day...

1372
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:42,286
for the rest of your life!

1373
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:43,326
Tell her thank you.

1374
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:45,918
Thank you, Kate,
wherever you are.

1375
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:47,864
Are you okay?

1376
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:49,922
You look at it, Doctor.

1377
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,024
Oh!

1378
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:52,802
It really hurts.

1379
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:54,632
Good. I hope it blinds you.

1380
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,773
What would I do without you?

1381
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:01,340
You are so dead.

1382
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:04,471
I, Andy Chris, take you,
Natalie Yeroshik...

1383
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:06,015
as my best friend for life.

1384
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,017
I pledge to honor, encourage...

1385
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:09,643
- and support you...
- Oh, you know the Lerner party?

1386
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,210
You're gonna have
to do that alone.

1387
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:15,452
Where, uh...
Where are you gonna be?

1388
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,459
Uh, I gotta... I gotta...

1389
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:20,587
I gotta go away. l知...
Some... l致e got a thing.

1390
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:21,688
With... With who?

1391
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:23,900
Shh.

1392
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,663
With Henry? With Henry.

1393
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:28,329
This is my solemn vow.

1394
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:32,364
From this moment,
I, Natalie Yeroshik...

1395
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:33,409
take you, Andy Chris...

1396
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:36,002
- What, Dan?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1397
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,842
This is my solemn vow.

1398
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:39,643
By the power vested in me...

1399
00:55:39,716 --> 00:55:42,913
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1400
00:55:42,986 --> 00:55:44,385
You may kiss the bride.

1401
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:46,012
Congratulations.

1402
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:47,056
Yeah.

1403
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:48,148
Yeah.

1404
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:52,724
Three...

1405
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:54,457
four...

1406
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:56,055
five...

1407
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,100
- six.
- Ashley.

1408
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,328
Shh!

1409
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,428
Okay, where was I? I was on...

1410
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,268
- Three.
- Thank you.

1411
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,671
For what?

1412
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:08,700
Three, four, five...

1413
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:13,182
six, seven, eight.

1414
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:15,985
I have to say something.

1415
00:56:16,053 --> 00:56:19,045
Now, you know I never get
involved in your love life.

1416
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:20,214
- Bullshit.
- Fine.

1417
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,019
As someone who's always involved
in your love life...

1418
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:23,184
I think you should listen to me.

1419
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,818
You're making a huge mistake.

1420
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:26,226
No, l知 not.
Help me with the cart.

1421
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:29,595
Okay, it's... It's not because
his fianc馥's ghost...

1422
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:32,100
is trying to drive you away,
and-and it's not because...

1423
00:56:32,169 --> 00:56:34,160
he's a client who you lie to...

1424
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,364
but you talk about picking guys
with problems?

1425
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,600
He just got out
of a relationship...

1426
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:39,665
where his bride was killed
on their wedding day...

1427
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:41,506
and you'll be the first girl
he dates.

1428
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:43,603
That's a pretty serious rebound.

1429
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,671
You really think
this is gonna end up well, huh?

1430
00:56:46,616 --> 00:56:49,141
Nice try. You're still handling
the Lerner party alone.

1431
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:53,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
Cherries Jubilee.

1432
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:06,502
Excuse me for a second.

1433
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:08,834
I could feel the heat
all the way back here.

1434
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:10,270
- Are you okay?
- You know, if I were dead...

1435
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,570
I wouldn't be following around
one person, okay?

1436
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:14,371
l壇 be finding out
the meaning of life.

1437
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:16,969
I would be talking to wise,
notable dead people.

1438
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,071
Oh, like who?

1439
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:20,378
Um, like Eleanor Roosevelt.

1440
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,417
What would you ask her?

1441
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:22,747
Like, all kinds of things.

1442
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:23,843
Like what?

1443
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,387
Um...

1444
00:57:25,455 --> 00:57:26,422
All right,
forget Eleanor Roosevelt.

1445
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,151
You're the only dead person
I wanna talk to right now.

1446
00:57:28,225 --> 00:57:30,591
Oh, I think you burned off
a little bit of your eyebrow.

1447
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,218
What? Where?

1448
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:33,353
Right... Right there.

1449
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:36,258
It's not gonna be even.

1450
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,291
You know what? I don't care.

1451
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:39,392
And you know what else?

1452
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:40,731
l知 going away with Henry
this weekend...

1453
00:57:40,804 --> 00:57:42,601
whether you like it or not,
and I don't care what you do.

1454
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,106
I don't care if you set me
on fire or yell and scream...

1455
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:47,166
and talk about your dog
or watch me while I piss!

1456
00:57:47,244 --> 00:57:49,235
I don't care! So if you're
trying to make me look insane...

1457
00:57:49,312 --> 00:57:50,506
it's not working!

1458
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:55,375
So...

1459
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,281
who's ready for cake?

1460
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:00,814
Oy.

1461
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:05,091
# l値l stop the world
and melt with you #

1462
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:09,729
# You've seen the difference #

1463
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,930
# And it's getting better
all the time #

1464
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:16,029
- # There's nothing you and I #
- Ha! No!
- Yeah.

1465
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:17,130
- # Won't do #
- Oh, my God.

1466
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:19,402
- Pretty smooth.
- It is beautiful.

1467
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,103
It's so weird
how much this place...

1468
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,112
reminds me of my own apartment.

1469
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:26,409
You know what we should do?

1470
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:27,575
I saw some people
riding one of those...

1471
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:28,913
like, two-person bikes.

1472
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,543
We should totally rent
one of those.

1473
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,678
Yeah, absolutely.

1474
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:32,813
Okay, cool.

1475
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,218
Now?

1476
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:37,021
Yeah, why not?

1477
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:38,560
We just got here.

1478
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:40,721
Don't you want to unpack,
check out the room?

1479
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,999
Oh, my God.

1480
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:47,297
Did you think
that you could just bring me...

1481
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,803
up here and never leave
the room?

1482
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:50,772
Just put a "do not disturb" sign
on the door...

1483
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:52,365
and lock ourselves
in for the weekend?

1484
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:53,909
Um... yes?

1485
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:55,239
Awesome.

1486
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:56,643
l値l go freshen up.

1487
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:47,253
Henry?

1488
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:49,897
Yes?

1489
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:51,900
You know l知 still
in the room, right?

1490
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:53,265
Yeah.

1491
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,607
- Okay.
- Okay.

1492
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:16,549
That was gross.

1493
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:18,852
Are you all right?

1494
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:21,090
l知 fine!

1495
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:23,289
Okay.

1496
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:27,935
I should've known it was you.

1497
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,130
You know, I never thought
farts were funny...

1498
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,833
when I was alive,
but the look on your face.

1499
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:33,205
You get out of here.

1500
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:36,474
You're not having sex
with my husband.

1501
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:38,614
He is not your husband.

1502
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:40,274
And even if you did make it
down that aisle...

1503
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,217
there's still that
"till death do us part" clause.

1504
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:44,583
You're a ghost!

1505
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:45,780
Did you say something?

1506
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:47,914
Yeah. The...

1507
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,456
There's potpourri!

1508
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:52,825
Don't do it!

1509
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:55,655
Oh, l知 doin' it.

1510
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:04,095
Oh, my God.

1511
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:06,768
It looks even better
on the floor.

1512
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:10,305
Best day ever.

1513
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,816
Wow, this is gonna be awkward.

1514
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:25,087
Oh, my God!

1515
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:27,689
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1516
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:29,755
I just, you know,
it's just, "Oh, my God."

1517
01:01:31,768 --> 01:01:33,861
l知 surprised he didn't spring
for the suite.

1518
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:36,737
- Hey!
- Are you sure you're okay?

1519
01:01:36,806 --> 01:01:38,103
- How's it going down there?
- Why? Yeah.

1520
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:39,402
- Yeah.
- Yoo-hoo!

1521
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:41,671
It's just you're closing
your eyes very energetically.

1522
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:42,712
I think you're freakin' him out.

1523
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,804
Oh, you like to kiss with
your eyes open? That's cool.

1524
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:46,212
I mean, that's kind of kinky,
but all right, all right.

1525
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:47,442
- l知 cool with that.
- Being on the bottom...

1526
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:48,779
not your most flattering angle.

1527
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:51,551
I was talking to another ghost
the other day...

1528
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:53,350
and you'll never guess
who it was.

1529
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:54,515
Remember that guy you
used to date in high school...

1530
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:56,388
who got killed
in a motorcycle accident?

1531
01:01:56,459 --> 01:01:57,517
Ted?

1532
01:01:57,594 --> 01:01:58,856
- What?
- What?

1533
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:00,259
You said Ted.

1534
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,797
No, I didn't.

1535
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:04,026
I just... I, um...
'cause I bumped my arm.

1536
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,067
l知 okay now.

1537
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,194
Anyway, this is
a little embarrassing...

1538
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:09,363
but he said
you were a bad kisser.

1539
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,737
Actually, he said you were
the worst kisser ever.

1540
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:13,435
"Painful and overly wet,"
was his exact quote.

1541
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,501
He made a noise like this.

1542
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:17,205
- Talk dirty to me.
- What?

1543
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,111
Talk dirty to me.
I love it. It turns me on.

1544
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:20,444
Henry doesn't like that.

1545
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:21,677
Do it loud.

1546
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:24,549
Um... Oh, you're a dirty girl,
aren't you?

1547
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:25,952
She's a dirty little liar
is what she is.

1548
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:27,580
Louder.

1549
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:29,454
You're a dirty little thing.

1550
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:30,515
You're a dirty girl...

1551
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:32,458
- # I believe the children #
- aren't you?

1552
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:33,928
- # Are our future #
- You're a dirty girl.

1553
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:35,362
- Good, good. Louder
though, louder.
- # Teach them well #

1554
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:37,866
- Like... Like you're trying to
drown out some annoying noise
- # And let them lead the way #

1555
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:39,128
- # Show them all #
- Like this?!

1556
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:40,191
- # The beauty #
- Yeah!

1557
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:41,999
- # They possess inside #
- You're a dirty little girl,
aren't you?

1558
01:02:42,072 --> 01:02:43,903
- Louder, please!
- Aren't you
a dirty little thing?!

1559
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:44,997
You like the dirty stuff!

1560
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:47,066
Aren't you a dirty...
That's just stupid.

1561
01:02:47,143 --> 01:02:48,269
l知 just yelling at you.

1562
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,504
- Music!
- Is that annoying?

1563
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:57,980
It's a little loud.

1564
01:02:58,054 --> 01:02:59,180
What?!

1565
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:00,745
The music.
You like it this loud?

1566
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:01,848
Oh, yeah, I love it.

1567
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:03,620
Love this. Salsa.

1568
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:05,684
Salsa makes me horny!

1569
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,233
No, no, no, no!

1570
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:13,496
Come on, just anything.

1571
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,537
I like your hair!

1572
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:15,730
Oh, God, I love it!

1573
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:17,329
- It's looks really good!
- Louder!

1574
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:18,499
Really?!

1575
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:22,741
Sorry, sorry.

1576
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,109
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1577
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,647
- How you doin'?
- l知 good.

1578
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:27,711
So, what's up?

1579
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:29,411
You know that woman
you sent me to...

1580
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,010
the, uh, psychic?

1581
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:32,111
Believe me, you don't have
to whisper that...

1582
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:33,155
in this neighborhood.

1583
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,485
I mean, it's not like
I sent you to a...

1584
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:36,983
Republican.

1585
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:40,727
Well, She's, um... She's great.

1586
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:42,992
I mean, really, I feel
a thousand times better.

1587
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:45,159
Did she get a message from Kate?

1588
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:47,328
Yeah, and I think that Kate
really wants me to move on.

1589
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:49,530
in fact, l知 dating her.

1590
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,207
Who?

1591
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:52,434
Ashley.

1592
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:53,976
Wait, so she told you
that Kate said...

1593
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:55,738
that she wants you
to start dating again...

1594
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:57,746
and then she went out with you?

1595
01:03:57,814 --> 01:03:59,406
Well, it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

1596
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:01,347
Oh, yeah,
I guess that is...

1597
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:02,577
how it happened exactly, but...

1598
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:04,277
Well, you got to stop.

1599
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:05,651
Why?

1600
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:06,916
She's a psychic.

1601
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,548
Since when do you have
a problem with psychics?

1602
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:09,683
l... You do.

1603
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:11,192
You do. You hate them.

1604
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:12,785
Look, Henry,
I think it's great...

1605
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:16,491
that you're dating again,
but, I mean, you can't date her.

1606
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:19,724
God, I thought
you'd be happy about this.

1607
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:22,329
I guess, I-I should be.

1608
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:24,873
l知 just... You're right.

1609
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:26,533
l知 just surprised, I mean...

1610
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:28,668
But l知... l知...
l知 coming around now.

1611
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,310
I mean, look how happy I am now.

1612
01:04:33,383 --> 01:04:34,350
Chloe.

1613
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:35,611
l致e been meaning
to call you, actually.

1614
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:36,879
What's been stopping you, huh?

1615
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:38,614
Pretending to talk
to my brother's dead fianc馥...

1616
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:39,655
so you could date him?

1617
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:40,984
Come on in.

1618
01:04:41,057 --> 01:04:42,490
No, l知 okay.

1619
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,823
I just...
I want Kate's diary back.

1620
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:47,590
Okay. Um... yeah.

1621
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:55,601
l知 not gonna tell him
that I gave this to you...

1622
01:04:55,672 --> 01:04:58,163
because, somehow,
he does seem better.

1623
01:04:58,241 --> 01:04:59,333
I know it looks bad.

1624
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:00,535
How could you do this?

1625
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:03,408
I mean, uh, "I can't fake it.
l知 not some scam artist."

1626
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:05,071
I mean, you totally
took advantage of him.

1627
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:06,115
You asked me to do this.

1628
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:08,013
Use fake psychic vision
to date him?

1629
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:10,109
Let me think.
No, l壇 remember that.

1630
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:13,645
Chloe, I really, really care
about him.

1631
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:15,054
Worst part is that I did this.

1632
01:05:15,124 --> 01:05:17,183
I mean, I gave this to you.

1633
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,319
I handed you everything
that you needed.

1634
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:20,589
You gave what to her?

1635
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:22,631
No, what...
It's okay. Don't...

1636
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:24,423
What's this?

1637
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,462
This is Kate's diary.

1638
01:05:29,138 --> 01:05:30,105
Yeah.

1639
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:31,231
Why would you give this to her?

1640
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:33,335
How'd you even get it?

1641
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:40,205
The story about the pancreas
is in here...

1642
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,910
- Um...
- and how we met.

1643
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:49,022
Henry. Henry!

1644
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:50,116
Henry!

1645
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,825
You were right.

1646
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:04,066
It all fell apart, you know,
'cause l知 a horrible person.

1647
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,267
No, no, you're not
a horrible person.

1648
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:09,368
Yes, I am. I am.

1649
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:12,346
l知 a liar,
and l知 a horrible person.

1650
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:14,906
And you know what?
I never even deserved him.

1651
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:16,212
- Okay, you... You kn...
- I didn't!

1652
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:18,277
No, you know what?
He's an idiot to let you go.

1653
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:19,343
- No!
- All right? No.

1654
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:21,788
No matter what you did,
he's an idiot to let you go...

1655
01:06:21,858 --> 01:06:22,916
okay?

1656
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:24,721
Anyone would be lucky
to have you.

1657
01:06:24,794 --> 01:06:26,193
You're just saying that.

1658
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:27,456
Anyone.

1659
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:39,300
What the hell was that?

1660
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,637
l知 sorry. l知 sorry.

1661
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,041
You're my friend.

1662
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:43,078
You're gay.

1663
01:06:43,146 --> 01:06:44,204
You're my gay friend.

1664
01:06:45,315 --> 01:06:47,044
Ah, screw it.

1665
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:48,640
l知 not gay.

1666
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:50,719
What?

1667
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:52,220
l知 not gay!

1668
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:53,983
l致e never been gay.

1669
01:06:54,057 --> 01:06:57,356
I don't have sex with men,
and they don't have sex with me.

1670
01:06:57,427 --> 01:06:58,917
Wow.

1671
01:06:58,995 --> 01:07:01,987
So when you just kissed me
just then, you were like...

1672
01:07:02,065 --> 01:07:03,555
l知 in love with you.

1673
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:04,691
What?!

1674
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:06,291
l致e been in love with you
since I met you.

1675
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,963
Every time you turn your back
to me, I sniff your hair.

1676
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:11,472
I went into business with you,
so I could be near you.

1677
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:12,530
I hate cooking!

1678
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:14,701
I wanna throw up
every time I cut a fish.

1679
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:16,745
God, you have got to be
the worst psychic...

1680
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:17,780
in the history of time.

1681
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,371
How could you not know
any of this?

1682
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,974
Why didn't you just,
like, tell me?

1683
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:24,986
Okay, remember when we met,

1684
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:26,885
and-and-and
we started, you know...

1685
01:07:26,956 --> 01:07:28,514
going out to lunch and dinner...

1686
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:33,654
and talking on the phone
all day and all night.

1687
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,890
I thought we were dating.

1688
01:07:36,065 --> 01:07:37,362
And... And then...

1689
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:40,527
And then, after a week,
we went to a movie.

1690
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:44,437
I was just about to kiss you,
and you turned to me...

1691
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:49,706
and you said, "I love having
a gay friend to talk to.

1692
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:51,041
"I could never be
this comfortable...

1693
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:52,240
"with a straight man."

1694
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:58,780
What was...
What was I supposed to do?

1695
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:00,846
You waited a week
to make your move!

1696
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:02,447
Of course,
I thought you were gay.

1697
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:03,492
I was taking it slow.

1698
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,119
Five years, one kiss?
That's not slow.

1699
01:08:06,195 --> 01:08:07,253
That's family.

1700
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,695
l知 sorry.
I missed my window.

1701
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:11,461
I was... I was waiting for it
to come back around again.

1702
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:13,793
God, Dan, you've, like...

1703
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:16,698
betrayed me.

1704
01:08:16,773 --> 01:08:18,707
- Betrayed you?
- Yeah.

1705
01:08:18,775 --> 01:08:20,538
Ashley, I love you.

1706
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,669
You think it was easy for me
listening to you...

1707
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:24,645
talk about other guys, huh?

1708
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:27,842
Watching mind-numbingly
boring romantic movies...

1709
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:29,145
and pretending to cry?

1710
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:31,880
Going shopping with you and
giving you advice on clothes?

1711
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:34,149
Do you know how much
of the last five years...

1712
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:36,123
I have spent
learning about clothes?

1713
01:08:36,192 --> 01:08:40,424
This shirt cost me $175,
and I hate it!

1714
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:41,485
I hate it!

1715
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:42,758
I love that shirt.

1716
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:44,322
You know, before
this whole stupid thing...

1717
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,766
I probably spent
$100 a year on clothes.

1718
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:49,031
Now? Now, I spend that much
every three weeks...

1719
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:51,539
on this haircut,
which I also hate!

1720
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:56,141
God.

1721
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:58,476
We took bubble baths together.

1722
01:08:58,548 --> 01:08:59,515
Yeah.

1723
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:01,447
Now can you see
how hard it was for me?

1724
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:08,314
I just wanted to cry
on my gay friend.

1725
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,154
Yup.

1726
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:28,203
l値l let myself out.

1727
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:33,640
Okay.

1728
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:48,693
All right, l知 ready.

1729
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,127
You don't have a cat.

1730
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,465
I rescued a stray,
so you'd talk to me.

1731
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,664
Come in.

1732
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:04,507
So, have you thought
about a name for him yet?

1733
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,774
No. After we're done here...

1734
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:07,509
l知 taking him
back to the pound.

1735
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:10,247
l知 kidding.

1736
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,447
It's a joke,
so you start laughing now...

1737
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:16,959
breaks the tension,
and then we start talking again.

1738
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:18,459
Pet's a big responsibility.

1739
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:19,825
Did you ever think
about maybe just running...

1740
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:20,863
into me on the street?

1741
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,761
Listen, I didn't know
that Ashley was gonna use...

1742
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:24,732
the information I gave her
to start dating you.

1743
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,495
I mean, I really thought
that she was just...

1744
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:28,332
gonna tell you that Kate
wanted you to move on.

1745
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:34,371
We... Do you
really have to do that?

1746
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:35,705
Yeah, he needs his shots.

1747
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:39,778
Yeah.
I think he's already had them.

1748
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,277
He's my neighbor's cat.

1749
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:45,080
Your neighbor let you borrow
her cat to bring to the vet?

1750
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:47,713
You stole a cat?

1751
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,257
l知 gonna bring him back.

1752
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,225
He was on a fire escape.
It's like a walk.

1753
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:52,556
Would you quit doin'
stupid stuff...

1754
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,027
because you think you know
you're right?

1755
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:55,791
Whoa. You should hear yourself.

1756
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:56,957
You sound like Mom and Dad.

1757
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:58,660
And your friends
and your bosses...

1758
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:00,895
and your teachers and strangers
that you meet on the street.

1759
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:03,302
They all tell you this
because it's true.

1760
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:04,930
l知 sorry you feel that way.

1761
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:06,941
See if you can get the cat home
without killing it.

1762
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,237
I think I can handle it.

1763
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:16,609
He's fine.

1764
01:11:26,896 --> 01:11:27,920
Hi.

1765
01:11:29,799 --> 01:11:31,232
I read this.

1766
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,200
Henry, I really wanna talk
to you about all this.

1767
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:34,236
- It's just...
- How did you know...

1768
01:11:34,303 --> 01:11:37,067
about the cake
or Hawaii or the chair?

1769
01:11:37,139 --> 01:11:38,106
None of that's in here...

1770
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,471
and no one else
knows about that.

1771
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:44,342
All right, um,
your sister gave me the diary...

1772
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:45,880
and she asked me to pretend...

1773
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:48,644
that Kate had talked to me,
which is not her fault...

1774
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,709
because I shouldn't have done it
in the first place, okay?

1775
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:55,623
But I did, because
I thought, I don't know...

1776
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:58,319
I thought maybe you needed it,
you know, to help you move on.

1777
01:12:00,763 --> 01:12:03,061
But I must have crossed
over some sort of line...

1778
01:12:03,132 --> 01:12:06,898
or something, because
then, suddenly, she appeared.

1779
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:08,163
- Kate.
- Yeah.

1780
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:12,674
And sh... And she tried
to scare me away from you.

1781
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:18,641
But I just... I really
wanted to be with you...

1782
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:20,648
so I didn't let it stop me.

1783
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,276
You pretended that
she wanted us to be together...

1784
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:24,842
because you thought that
that would make me...

1785
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,012
fall in love with you.

1786
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:30,152
Yeah, I guess I did.

1787
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,325
I, um...

1788
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:37,025
I hoped that you would love me
for other reasons, too.

1789
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:42,197
- Is she here now?
- No, I haven't...

1790
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:45,672
I haven't actually seen her,
um, since you broke up with me.

1791
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:49,606
Guess it was her job
to get rid of me...

1792
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,738
and, well, she did that.

1793
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:55,374
So, she just sort of disappears?

1794
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:56,850
I don't know.

1795
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:02,181
Thank you.

- Long time.
- Yeah, could've gone longer.

1844
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:20,951
Yeah, listen, l致e...

1845
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:22,725
l致e been thinking
about what I did, and...

1846
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:23,958
Can we stop walking?

1847
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:26,001
l知 trying to...
trying to be sincere...

1848
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:27,695
and the panting
is really killing my delivery.

1849
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:28,930
Sorry.

1850
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:32,099
- I screwed up.
- Yeah, you did.

1851
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:33,971
Yeah, I did.
Definitely screwed up.

1852
01:15:34,043 --> 01:15:35,408
But look at it this way.

1853
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:37,604
I pretended I was gay
for five years.

1854
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,046
Has any other man ever done
anything like that for you, huh?

1855
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:41,139
I mean,
I could see a guy pretending...

1856
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:43,549
for two, three...

1857
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:44,643
- three, three years tops...
- Okay.

1858
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,551
- but five, come on, that's...
- Okay.

1859
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:52,218
All right, listen, Ashley,
you know me.

1860
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:54,762
You know me better
than anyone else does.

1861
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,594
And I know you.

1862
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,566
Even though
I did a stupid, stupid...

1863
01:15:59,635 --> 01:16:00,602
Really stupid.

1864
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:04,628
Beyond crazy, stupid thing
by lying to you...

1865
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:09,109
we have been best friends
for five years.

1866
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,775
Yes, that is true.

1867
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:15,650
Look, I don't...

1868
01:16:15,718 --> 01:16:18,278
I don't know
any more fancy way to say this.

1869
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:23,081
l知 a good guy. I love you.

1870
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:25,626
And l... I just...

1871
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:28,857
I just really wish
you'd give me a chance, so...

1872
01:16:32,902 --> 01:16:35,029
Do I attract
screwed-up guys, or what?

1873
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:53,545
Hiya.

1874
01:16:55,457 --> 01:16:56,856
- You.
- Yeah.

1875
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,354
Well, he doesn't look so good,
does he?

1876
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:01,219
No, he doesn't.

1877
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:04,028
Finish your mission?

1878
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:05,066
Yeah. You?

1879
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:07,932
No, or I wouldn't still be here.

1880
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:09,493
- Really?
- Mm.

1881
01:17:09,571 --> 01:17:11,971
So you do move on
once you finish...

1882
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:13,906
- what you're supposed to do?
- Oh, shoot.

1883
01:17:13,976 --> 01:17:16,137
Did you listen
to anything she said?

1884
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:20,010
- No.
- So I guess
you're not done yet.

1885
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:22,073
Guess not.

1886
01:17:22,151 --> 01:17:24,949
Look, what do you think
you're supposed to do?

1887
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:27,010
I don't know.

1888
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:30,058
Well, what do you want more
than anything else right now?

1889
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:37,933
For Henry to be happy.

1890
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,967
Okay.

1891
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,695
What do you think
would make Henry happy?

1892
01:17:46,308 --> 01:17:47,434
I don't know.

1893
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:48,976
Think you do.

1894
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,376
Damn it! Anything but that.

1895
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:55,349
Wait, where are you going?

1896
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:56,941
l知 done.

1897
01:17:57,019 --> 01:17:58,281
So your job was to...

1898
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:00,288
Get you to do
the right thing, yeah.

1899
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:02,187
Well, why didn't you just
tell me that in the first place?

1900
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:04,725
Would you have believed me? Mmm.

1901
01:18:05,995 --> 01:18:07,587
See ya, up there.

1902
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,688
Yeah? Well, if I see you,
I know l知 not in heaven.

1903
01:18:09,765 --> 01:18:11,255
That's the spirit.

1904
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,237
The yellow dress?

1905
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:24,836
Are you planning on wearing
that, or taking it to Goodwill?

1906
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,676
I haven't talked to him
in months.

1907
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:29,115
Wow. No, "Hello, Kate.

1908
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:30,776
"How's the afterlife
treatin' you?"

1909
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:32,252
You know, I think I lost weight.

1910
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,312
I never looked this good
when I was alive.

1911
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:35,414
What do you want, Kate?

1912
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:42,286
Um... all right,
this isn't easy for me, so...

1913
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:45,189
You at a loss for words?

1914
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:46,632
That's a first.

1915
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,938
Have you talked to Henry,
you know, since...

1916
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:51,165
Since you broke us up?

1917
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,867
No, I haven't.

1918
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:55,171
As a matter of fact,
l知, uh, dating someone else.

1919
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:56,936
No, you're not. You can't be.

1920
01:18:57,813 --> 01:18:59,542
Yes, I can,
and we're goin' to Vegas.

1921
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,583
Well, stop! What about Henry?

1922
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:02,742
What about him? You know what?

1923
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:04,046
I am not interested
in whatever sick game...

1924
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,279
you're playing, Kate.

1925
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:06,719
No, listen to me.
l知 being very serious.

1926
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:08,586
I want you two together.

1927
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:10,852
No sale.

1928
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:15,091
I can't believe l知 begging you
to date my husband.

1929
01:19:16,098 --> 01:19:18,965
Okay, don't you still love him?

1930
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:22,831
Even if you weren't
screwing with me right now...

1931
01:19:22,905 --> 01:19:24,839
which it's
so clear that you are...

1932
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:26,067
the answer would be no.

1933
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:28,400
I moved on.

1934
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:32,313
I mean, it killed me to do it,
but I did it.

1935
01:19:33,749 --> 01:19:34,773
So just, um...

1936
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:38,145
Can you leave me alone now?
Please?

1937
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:54,493
Get up!

1938
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,901
Get up!

1939
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:56,938
Henry!

1940
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:58,597
Why can't you hear me?

1941
01:19:58,674 --> 01:20:00,073
Get up!

1942
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:04,336
Everything okay over there?

1943
01:20:04,413 --> 01:20:05,641
Who cares about the bird?

1944
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:07,648
Call Ashley!

1945
01:20:07,716 --> 01:20:09,240
Ashley. Call Ashley.

1946
01:20:10,652 --> 01:20:11,676
Ashley.

1947
01:20:13,889 --> 01:20:14,913
Did you just say...

1948
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,117
- Ashley.
- Who taught you that?

1949
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:18,921
Call Ashley. Call Ashley.

1950
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:20,188
You want me to call Ashley?

1951
01:20:20,262 --> 01:20:22,287
What do you...
l知 talking to my bird.

1952
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:23,558
Get up. Get up.

1953
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:25,031
Kate?

1954
01:20:26,768 --> 01:20:27,792
Is that you?

1955
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:32,138
Are you talking to me
through my bird?

1956
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,299
Yes.

1957
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:35,310
Why do you want me to...

1958
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:36,435
Call Ashley.

1959
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:49,688
I got a machine.

1960
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:51,817
- Airport.
- What?

1961
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:52,918
Airport.

1962
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:56,831
Take the bird.

1963
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:57,957
Oh, yeah.

1964
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,537
# Think of all the luck
you got #

1965
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:10,908
- Taxi! Taxi!
- # You know that
it's not for naught #

1966
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:12,947
Oh, hey, nice. Thanks.

1967
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:14,346
Welcome.

1968
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,611
- # It's not like that anymore #
- Where to?

1969
01:21:16,685 --> 01:21:18,050
Airport. Airport.

1970
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:20,781
What? You heard the bird.
The airport.

1971
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:23,315
Why are we going to the airport?
Where is she goin'?

1972
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,552
Las Vegas.

1973
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:26,150
And you want me to stop her?
I thought you hated her.

1974
01:21:26,228 --> 01:21:27,354
What gave you that idea?

1975
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,158
How do you even...
How do you know this?

1976
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:34,693
What a day, right?

1977
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:37,435
Got your bird with you, huh?

1978
01:21:37,506 --> 01:21:39,235
It's actually my, uh, fianc馥.

1979
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:41,708
- # What is this downside #
- Ah.

1980
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:44,769
- I think.
- # That you speak of? #

1981
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:47,706
# What is this feeling #

1982
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:51,947
# You're so #

1983
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,715
# Sure of? #

1984
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:00,387
# What is this downside #

1985
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:01,520
Ashley!

1986
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:03,292
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back of the line, sir.

1987
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:04,593
I just need to talk
to that woman for a second.

1988
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,395
The only way you get
through here is with a ticket.

1989
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:08,400
Could you maybe get her then?

1990
01:22:09,338 --> 01:22:10,430
It's an emergency.

1991
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:11,802
Oh, it's an emergency?

1992
01:22:11,873 --> 01:22:13,306
Well, by all means,
come on in, man.

1993
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,535
You know,
people who have emergencies...

1994
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,601
don't even have to go
through the metal detectors.

1995
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:19,104
All right, there's
really no need for sarcasm.

1996
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:20,478
Back of the line.

1997
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:22,847
Hi. I need the cheapest
ticket you have.

1998
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:23,907
Where do you wanna go, sir?

1999
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:25,146
It doesn't matter.

2000
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,415
Well, that's not
at all suspicious.

2001
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:29,414
Hurry up, lard ass.

2002
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:31,459
Excuse me?

2003
01:22:31,526 --> 01:22:33,221
Uh... no, that's, uh...

2004
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:34,728
That's... That's my bird.

2005
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:36,263
He says that to everybody.

2006
01:22:37,633 --> 01:22:39,123
Move those fat fingers, Helen.

2007
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:41,668
All right, you know what?
That's enough.

2008
01:22:41,737 --> 01:22:42,761
Sorry.

2009
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:48,240
One ticket to Miami, $1,350.

2010
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,972
- That's the cheapest ticket...
- Don't be cheap. Buy it!

2011
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:52,240
- All right, you know,
that's fine. That's fine.
- Buy it!

2012
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:55,313
You know, I never really
thought about it...

2013
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:57,750
but, uh, a psychic in Vegas?

2014
01:22:57,819 --> 01:22:59,514
We could really clean up,
you know?

2015
01:22:59,588 --> 01:23:01,215
Yeah.
Too bad I don't do that anymore.

2016
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:02,257
All right.

2017
01:23:02,324 --> 01:23:03,291
Over there.

2018
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:04,848
What?

2019
01:23:04,926 --> 01:23:06,223
What's the matter?

2020
01:23:06,295 --> 01:23:07,262
You don't wanna know.

2021
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:08,591
Ashley.

2022
01:23:10,132 --> 01:23:11,156
What are you doing here?

2023
01:23:11,233 --> 01:23:13,394
I don't know.
The bird told me to come here.

2024
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:14,435
Did you do this?

2025
01:23:14,503 --> 01:23:15,595
Who are you talking to?

2026
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:17,935
Oh, let me...
Let me guess, uh, the ghost?

2027
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:18,973
Why are you here?

2028
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,066
Why is your arm around her?
You're gay.

2029
01:23:21,143 --> 01:23:22,735
No, l知 not...
l知 not gay. No, no.

2030
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:24,142
No, l致e never been gay.

2031
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:25,702
Methinks
he doth protest too much.

2032
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:31,309
Do you really want this?

2033
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:35,456
Henry does.

2034
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:36,491
Where is she?

2035
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:37,718
She's right next to you.

2036
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:44,192
You want Ashley and me
to be together?

2037
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:47,493
I do.

2038
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:50,333
l知 sorry I put you
through all of this.

2039
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,771
She says she does,
and she's sorry...

2040
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,536
for being such a royal bitch.

2041
01:23:55,344 --> 01:23:57,437
I mean, l知... l知 paraphrasing.

2042
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:00,772
Thank you, Kate.

2043
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:03,177
You're welcome, Henry.

2044
01:24:09,358 --> 01:24:11,189
When we get to heaven,
all bets are off.

2045
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:14,759
She says you're welcome.

2046
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:17,729
So, Kate
wants us to be together.

2047
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:20,334
I want us to be together.

2048
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:24,195
What do you want?

2049
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,701
Well, I wouldn't
wanna piss her off again.

2050
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:32,206
# And love #

2051
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,772
# Such a silly game
we play #

2052
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:38,843
# Oh, like a summer's day
in May #

2053
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,013
# What is love? What is love? #

2054
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:44,581
- Hello?
- # I just want you
to be loved #

2055
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:46,149
# Oh-oh-oh #

2056
01:24:46,228 --> 01:24:48,423
You know what? That probably
wasn't gonna work out anyway.

2057
01:24:48,497 --> 01:24:49,657
- l知 Bill, by the...
- l知 not gay!

2058
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:50,698
- Okay.
- Okay.

2059
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:51,733
- All right.
- Very good.

2060
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,563
Me, neither. Not gay at all.

2061
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:55,694
Um, maybe, though,
when we get to Vegas...

2062
01:24:55,771 --> 01:24:56,738
we can grab some dinner...

2063
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:59,603
and talk about how,
you know, not gay we are.

2064
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:01,965
# Ah, ah, ah #

2065
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:04,409
# Love #

2066
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:07,642
# Who could tell me
I am wrong? #

2067
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:11,041
# I just think
that I am strong #

2068
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:13,383
# What is love? What is love? #

2069
01:25:13,455 --> 01:25:16,720
# I just want you to be loved #

2070
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:18,225
# Oh-oh oh-oh #

2071
01:25:18,293 --> 01:25:19,385
# Oh-oh #

2072
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:27,659
I am so glad I met you.
You're hilarious.

2073
01:25:27,736 --> 01:25:29,533
I was just going
for ironically amusing.

2074
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:30,935
Are you sure you haven't
been drinking already?

2075
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:32,633
Oh, wait
till after the ceremony.

2076
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:33,674
If you like me now...

2077
01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:35,573
you are gonna love me
when l知 drunk.

2078
01:25:47,155 --> 01:25:49,180
Wow. That was, um...

2079
01:25:50,058 --> 01:25:51,958
- really quick.
- Well, l知 not gay.

2080
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:53,654
l知 not gay.

2081
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:54,695
I just need...
I just wanna get that...

2082
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:56,526
out there right now, so there's
no misunderstanding later.

2083
01:25:56,598 --> 01:25:59,692
l知 not...
So that's why we, uh... Okay.

2084
01:26:00,836 --> 01:26:01,962
There she is.

2085
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:12,871
Oh, God, hold on, Dad.

2086
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:15,109
One second. One second.

2087
01:26:19,421 --> 01:26:20,445
Hi.

2088
01:26:23,258 --> 01:26:25,021
Look, I know
this was supposed to be you...

2089
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:27,354
so thank you.

2090
01:26:29,798 --> 01:26:31,425
Just make him happy, okay?

2091
01:26:33,568 --> 01:26:34,660
Or else, you know.

2092
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:39,768
Wait, can you come back
and haunt me for that, or...

2093
01:26:39,841 --> 01:26:40,865
l... I don't know.

2094
01:26:40,942 --> 01:26:42,807
I kind of missed
the orientation speech.

2095
01:26:48,183 --> 01:26:49,582
Don't worry.

2096
01:26:50,852 --> 01:26:52,547
Kate, I will make him happy.

2097
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:58,892
I love Gardenias.

2098
01:27:10,472 --> 01:27:11,496
Sorry.

2099
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:37,094
We are gathered here
in the presence of God...

2100
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:39,565
to witness the exchanging
of vows that will bind...

2101
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:41,602
- # I can see clearly now #
- this couple together...

2102
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:44,298
- # The rain is gone #
- in the covenant
and relationship of marriage.

2103
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:47,068
When the ceremony has ended,
they will leave this place...

2104
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,610
- # I can see all obstacles #
- as husband and wife...

2105
01:27:49,678 --> 01:27:51,703
- # in my way #
- for the very first time.

2106
01:27:54,583 --> 01:28:00,021
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

2107
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:02,079
# It's gonna be a bright #

2108
01:28:03,091 --> 01:28:05,924
# Bright, sunshiny day #

2109
01:28:07,495 --> 01:28:09,395
# Yeah #

2110
01:28:09,464 --> 01:28:11,193
# Look all around #

2111
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:15,362
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

2112
01:28:16,805 --> 01:28:18,329
# Look straight ahead #

2113
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:23,901
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

2114
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:26,174
# I can see clearly now #

2115
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:28,545
# The rain is gone #

2116
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:35,855
# I can see all obstacles
in my way #

2117
01:28:38,927 --> 01:28:44,160
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

2118
01:28:44,232 --> 01:28:46,257
- # It's gonna be a bright #
- Hello, Kate.

2119
01:28:46,334 --> 01:28:47,665
- # Bright #
- # Bright #

2120
01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:49,465
Not you again! Come on!

2121
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:51,596
Relax! l知 just here
to congratulate you.

2122
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:52,799
Really?

2123
01:28:52,874 --> 01:28:54,205
I did the right thing?

2124
01:28:54,275 --> 01:28:55,867
You certainly did.

2125
01:28:55,944 --> 01:28:57,605
Now just give me back
the orb of true light...

2126
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,112
that you collected
from your loved ones...

2127
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,704
and you can move on.

2128
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:02,316
l知 sorry,

2129
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:03,544
Oh, dear.

2130
01:29:03,618 --> 01:29:04,676
Are you screwing with me?

2131
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:06,482
Are you allowed
to screw with me?

2132
01:29:06,554 --> 01:29:07,521
Hey, hey, no!

2133
01:29:07,589 --> 01:29:09,352
You are not disappearing
on another conversation!

2134
01:29:09,424 --> 01:29:11,324
You better hope I don't end up
in this room again!

2135
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:12,917
l知 gonna kick your ass!

2136
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:14,222

01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:23,466
# They'll reach in and grab
what you're dreamin', now now #

2140
01:29:23,538 --> 01:29:25,335
# Cut it up
and slip it back in #

# The crush, crush, crush

2145
01:29:36,351 --> 01:29:38,410
# Did the Earth just slam
in the sun? #

2146

# And I know, and I know,
and I know it #
