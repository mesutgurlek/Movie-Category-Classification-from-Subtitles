I could just go up and snog his face off.

463

Honestly, Jas. Sometimes I think
you're half girl, half turnip.

It's my cat. He's lost.

I don't know what happened.
He just disappeared.

but I've got to help my mum in the shop.

Well, actually we've got a lot of
influences, Radiohead, Pink Floyd.

No one's going to come to my loser
party if it's on the same night as hers.

912
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:19,818
Georgia! You have to get enough sleep
or your brain won't function.

913
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:22,017
It's a wonder you girls have
anything left to talk about.

914
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:26,345
Mum, we're having a crisis
and you're not helping.

915
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,662
You won't let me have
a cool party in a club,

916
00:59:28,787 --> 00:59:31,779
and now everyone's going
to laugh at me for being so lame,

917
00:59:31,907 --> 00:59:33,784
and no decent boys
will ever want to know me

918
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:38,025
because I'm the naff girl who had
the sad party that no one went to.

919
00:59:38,187 --> 00:59:41,304
- Georgia.
- Okay, good night, Mrs Nicolson.

I know what you're feeling like, honey.

925
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:08,791
It's awful when you like someone
that can't see how brilliant you are.

926
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:16,112
- Mum, what exactly has Jas told you?
- She didn't say any more than that.

927
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:20,784
And, honey, it's your business. You can
talk to me if and whenever you want.

928
01:00:23,593 --> 01:00:28,348
You're such a clever, bright girl,
Georgia. Remember that.

929
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,826
And please,

930
01:00:32,313 --> 01:00:34,065
have a look at this.

931
01:00:36,873 --> 01:00:42,345
Mum, I really don't need to learn
about astronomy right now.

932
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:45,067
No, honey, this is a very special book

933
01:00:45,193 --> 01:00:49,027
that will open your mind to the
curious way of the male species.

934
01:00:49,153 --> 01:00:54,227
See? I already knew
boys were from a different planet.

935
01:00:54,353 --> 01:00:57,425
They're infuriating.
They say one thing and mean another.

936
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,747
Exactly.

937
01:00:58,873 --> 01:01:02,548
And they act like they like you
and then they just ignore you.

938
01:01:02,673 --> 01:01:06,746
Then out of the blue, they decide
they want to move to New Zealand.

939
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:13,223
And don't worry too much.
I'm still trying to figure them out.

When's your dad coming back?

No way.
My mum doesn't want to go, either.

956
01:02:57,593 --> 01:02:59,948
And I can't go now,

will divorce your dad to stay here?

- JEM: It's not a problem.

You know, you're right.
That George Clooney's well buff.

He'd never fancy your mum

- No way.
- Now, why did you call us all over?

01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,311
Okay.

964
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:28,028
Last night, my mum tried to have this
real woman-to-woman chat with me,

965
01:03:28,153 --> 01:03:30,621
after you opened
your big gob about Robbie.

966
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:34,302
- Cringeworthy or what?
- But then she gave me this book.

967
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:37,664
It's my mum's Boy Bible,
and it told me how to get Robbie back.

968
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:41,149
- But isn't that book American?
- Yeah.

969
01:03:41,273 --> 01:03:44,424
Well, then it'll be about American boys,
won't it?

970
01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:48,185
No, it's about boykind.

971
01:03:48,753 --> 01:03:49,708
Oh!

972
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:53,265
- It says boys are like elastic bands.
- What?

973
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:55,463
What do you mean, like elastic bands?

974
01:03:55,593 --> 01:03:58,630
Well, they like to be all close,
and then after a bit of being close,

975
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:01,984
they have to stretch and get far away.
And you have to let them.

976
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:06,106
- And then they come springing back.
- Okay.

977

You've really pissed off a lot of people.

Dave's really cut up.
He's my mate, Georgia.

1067
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:35,989
I didn't mean to use him.

1068
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:40,662
You never called me
when you said you would.

1069
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:46,026
I handled it really badly, I know.
But I didn't want to two-time anyone.

1070
01:10:46,153 --> 01:10:48,223
Or hurt anybody's feelings.

1071
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:52,547
So, you were thinking of
breaking up with Lindsay

1072
01:10:52,673 --> 01:10:56,712
- and then you were going to call me?
- Yeah.

1073
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:03,630
And then I saw you with Dave at my gig.
I was gutted.

1074
01:11:06,993 --> 01:11:08,984
But that's different now.

Why did you tell Jas that
my brother wasn't good enough for her?

1076
01:11:14,513 --> 01:11:16,469
I didn't mean that. We were fighting...

1077
01:11:16,593 --> 01:11:18,345
Does that mean
I'm not good enough for you, either?

1078
01:11:18,473 --> 01:11:20,384
No, of course not.

1079
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:23,869
See, I thought you were
different than that, Georgia.

if my dad could come back.

But we don't want him to
leave us and stay there,

- It's called <i>Bitch In A Uniform.</i>
