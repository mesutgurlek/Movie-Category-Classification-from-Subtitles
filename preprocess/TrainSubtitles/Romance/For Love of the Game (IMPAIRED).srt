Somehow or other
he got through it, but now
he is in the eighth inning,

01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:11,371

Throw the ball to the glove.

You want to see
a big-time pitch?

1374

When you consider the noise,
the situation, this stadium,
that's unbelievable.

They put the handcuffs
on him, 3 and 0.

1379
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:28,498
But he's such an aggressive
hitter, you know they're
gonna green light him 3 and 1.

There's a high drive

[ Lyons ]
What a play by Mickey Hart
right here.

1390
01:43:13,889 --> 01:43:16,084
This is a ball
right out over the middle,
and Birch just hammers it.

1391
01:43:23,598 --> 01:43:26,795
You got lucky again, Chapel.
That was a great play.

1392

I'll miss you

Ma'am? Are you coming?

1394

That will be the fourth save
so far in seven.

Give my seat
to somebody else.

1400
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:07,901
Twenty-two consecutive outs
retired by Billy Chapel,

1401
01:44:08,009 --> 01:44:10,807
and he goes head-to-head
with Lenny Howell.

1402
01:44:14,616 --> 01:44:18,882
Fastball pulled to
the right side. A sliding stop
by Marcus Ransom to get him.

[ Lyons ] We haven't seen
Billy Chapel go this far into
a game for a lot of starts now.

1408
01:44:35,937 --> 01:44:38,405
He looks very, very tired.

The batter will be Ted Franklin,
the local boy from New York.

Sinski comin' back
and makes the play.

1414

Chapel has done it for eight,
retiring 24 consecutive batters.

1415
01:45:02,864 --> 01:45:07,301
Billy Chapel is certainly
getting more than a little

Billy Chapel, in quest
of the perfect game.

1489

You also realize he may
very well be at the crossroads
of a brilliant career.

1490

He's a cinch to wind up
in the Hall of Fame.

1491
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:36,583
However, after this game,
he has to make the big decision.

1492
01:51:36,691 --> 01:51:39,990
A: Will he continue to do
what has been his life,

1493
01:51:40,094 --> 01:51:42,585
maybe more important
than life itself, baseball ?

1494
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:45,222
Or will he hang it up,
and would a perfect game...

1495
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:48,996
give him
the logical conclusion
to the great career ?

You're hitting for Ruiz.

At 40 years old,
Billy Chapel is flirting...

1499
01:52:30,178 --> 01:52:33,443
with perhaps the greatest
accomplishment in baseball.

1500
01:52:33,548 --> 01:52:38,281
Standing in his way will be Matt
Crane hitting for Babe Nardini.

1501

Then Jesus Cabrillo.

1502
01:52:40,488 --> 01:52:43,651
And Ken Strout has a bat
in his hands in the dugout...

1503
01:52:43,758 --> 01:52:48,457
and might very well get
the call to bat for Jaime Ruiz.

1504
01:52:49,997 --> 01:52:52,329
And, you know, Steve, you get
the feeling that Billy Chapel...

1505
01:52:52,433 --> 01:52:55,061
isn't pitching
against left-handers.

1506
01:52:55,169 --> 01:52:57,694
He isn't pitching
against pinch hitters.

1507
01:52:57,805 --> 01:53:00,035
He isn't pitching
against the Yankees.

1508
01:53:00,141 --> 01:53:04,601
He's pitching against time.
He's pitching against
the future, against age...

1509
01:53:04,712 --> 01:53:08,512
and, even when you think about
his career, against ending.

1510
01:53:08,616 --> 01:53:13,076
And tonight, I think he might
be able to use that aching
old arm one more time...

01:53:13,187 --> 01:53:15,655

02:07:20,234 --> 02:07:22,930
There was
this ball game on.

1637
02:07:23,036 --> 02:07:25,869
You saw it?

1638
02:07:27,341 --> 02:07:29,673
With a bunch
of Yankee fans.

1639
02:07:29,776 --> 02:07:32,745
Grown men crying.

1640
02:07:32,846 --> 02:07:35,940
It was... perfect.

1641
02:07:36,049 --> 02:07:38,449
Heather saw it too.

1642
02:07:38,552 --> 02:07:43,251
I called her at school.
We were both so proud
of you, Billy.

1643
02:07:49,296 --> 02:07:51,230
What are you doing here?

1644
02:07:53,567 --> 02:07:57,560
I was-- I was
on my way to England.

1645
02:07:59,172 --> 02:08:01,072
Why?

1646
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:05,778
Because you're there.

1647
02:08:13,253 --> 02:08:16,848
God, I thought--
I thought I was gonna
have an ocean...

1648
02:08:16,957 --> 02:08:20,916
to think about what
I wanted to say to you,
what I needed to say.

1649
02:08:21,028 --> 02:08:23,656
Billy, you
don't need to.
Yes, I--

[ Groans ]

1651
02:08:29,436 --> 02:08:32,599
jane, I used to believe--
I mean, I still do...

1652
02:08:32,706 --> 02:08:35,607
that if you give something
your all, everything you have,

1653
02:08:35,709 --> 02:08:39,440
it doesn't matter
if you win or lose...

1654
02:08:39,546 --> 02:08:42,640
as long as you
risked everything,
put everything out there.

1655
02:08:42,749 --> 02:08:45,582
And I've done that.

1656
02:08:45,686 --> 02:08:50,817
I did it in my life.
I did it... with the game.

1657
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:55,185
But not with you.

1658
02:08:56,596 --> 02:09:00,760
I never gave you that,
and I'm sorry.

1659
02:09:04,037 --> 02:09:06,665
Okay.

jane, listen.
I know I'm--

1664
02:09:19,886 --> 02:09:22,184
I know I'm really
on thin ice here, but...

1665
02:09:22,289 --> 02:09:27,022
when you said
that I didn't need you,

1666
02:09:27,127 --> 02:09:29,459
well, last night--

1667
02:09:29,563 --> 02:09:34,330
that should have been
the biggest night of my life,

1668
02:09:36,169 --> 02:09:38,831
and it wasn't.

1669
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:42,670
It wasn't because--

1670
02:09:42,776 --> 02:09:46,212
because you weren't there.

1671
02:09:46,313 --> 02:09:51,114
So I just wanted
to tell you, not--

1672
02:09:51,218 --> 02:09:55,314
not to change your mind
or keep you from goin'.

1673
02:09:55,422 --> 02:09:59,950
But just so that you know--

1674

[ Whispers ]
that I know...

1675

I love you, Jane.
Oh.
