was part of a religious order...

346
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,913
...that ran that asylum in the 1940s.

She was raped by lunatics
and had the baby there.

348
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,711
That baby grew up
to be Freddy Krueger...

349
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,590
...who murdered 20 or 30 kids
right here on Elm Street.

350
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,553
He got caught, but the courts
cut him loose on a technicality.

351
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:44,225
So the parents of the murdered kids
got together and killed him.

their nightmares.

were really pushing him hard.

Alice.

640

Mr. Jordan and I wanted to see
how you're feeling.

641
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,833
Well, come sit down.

642
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,337
This really isn't a good time.
Maybe you could come back.

643
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:28,009

what you intend to do with your baby.

646

might be a little bit too much for you.

647
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,740
I mean, being single and everything.

648
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:56,412
What Mr. Jordan means
is that we're aware of the burden...

649
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,123
...that raising a child would place on you.

We want to help.

651
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:06,631

and to raise it as though it were our own.

652

Look, I appreciate
what you're offering, but, no.

It's our grandchild.

656
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,145
Doris,
maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

657
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,273
Look, Alice, we're worried
that in your present condition...

658
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:29,153
...that you don't have the ability
to take care of a child.

What are you talking about,
my condition?

660
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:41,082
We got a call from Dr. Moore.

661
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:46,838
He said that Alice was hysterical and that
she was having paranoid delusions.

than just your feelings.

-You said she committed suicide.
-Yeah, that's what the papers thought.

677
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,441
She spent the rest of her life
in the asylum.

678
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:53,112
After Krueger's trial, she flipped out,
and hung herself, so they thought.

-Meaning?
-Meaning they couldn't prove it.
