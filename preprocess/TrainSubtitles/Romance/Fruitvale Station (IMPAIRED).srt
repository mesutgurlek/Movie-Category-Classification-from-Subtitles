OSCAR:
What's your resolution?

00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,380
SOPHINA: I'm gonna cut carbs.

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,037
But, you're Mexican.
You can't eat nothin yo grandma makes.

4
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:24,098
It only takes 30 days to form a habit.

5
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:26,285
And then, it becomes second nature.

6
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,127
Who said that?
- ... Oprah.

7
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,549

00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:19,455

140
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:18,650
For me to bring you back,

00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:16,187
Give me the bad news first.

171
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,951
I'm gonna need help with the rent for this month.

172
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,151
How much?

173
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:25,215
Like $300. But, I can get you back
in a couple of weeks.

174
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:26,449
Okay. So, What's the good news.

175
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,713

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,130

And your mouth.

203
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:55,307
Alright, turn around.

204
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,221

206
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,990
Happy Birthday.

207
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,750
What happened to your face?

208
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,287
You look nice today.

209
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,746
My girls come over last night?

210
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:52,907
We played board games.

211
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,107
I bet, Y'all let her win too.

212
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,307
Of course.

213
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,685
Yall hella weak for that.
She gets no easy wins with me around.

214
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,694
What?

215
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:04,147
Do you remember that microwave popcorn
you bought a while back?

216
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:05,347
Hella good.

217
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,514
Yeah. While I was putting it into a bowl.

218
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:11,652
Tatiana's just standing there..
Staring up at me;

219
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:13,901
Looking like she wants something.

220
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,434
Okay, what?
C'mon mom.

221
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,634
She says..

222
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:21,379
"Grandma, do we have any dark butter?"

223
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,100
What's Dark butter?

224
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,811
I'm thinking, maybe she watch
"Food Network" or something.

225
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,663
So I say, "what's dark butter sweetheart?"

226
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:36,419
She says, "When Daddy took me to see WALL.E
he asked for light butter,

227
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:39,209
so I want to try some dark butter this time."

228
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:40,305
She too smart.

229
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:41,430
This moms right here?

230
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,860

233
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,247

234
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,447

00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,776
Calm... down!

238
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:18,976
Oscar...

239
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,232
What happened to your face?

240
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:29,475
Dark butter.

241
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:36,157
She always listening?
Too damn smart for her own good.

242
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:39,206
The preschool said we should think about
starting her in school early.

243
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:40,406
Phina tell you that?

244
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:44,425
Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school.

245
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,842
Uniforms...

246
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:53,253
I was lookin at St. Bede the other day.
It's this other school that starts them off learning Spanish,

247
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:56,357
and they back going on English -
- I'm not coming to see you anymore.

248
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:57,557
What?

249
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:03,550
I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore.
This is the last time.

250
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,118
I know I know I know. This is my last time too.
I told you that.

251
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,852
I ain't goin down no more.
- You want to keep putting Sophina through this...

252
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:11,357
you go on right ahead. Okay?

253
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,640
But Tatiana,

254
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,817
that baby doesn't deserve this, Oscar.

255
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,955
She don't know what's going on.

256
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:21,911
So, I guess that's why she asked me
why you love taking your vacations more than being with her.

257
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,111
She aint say that.

258
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:25,359
Oh, So I'm the liar now.

259
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:30,961
Ma you gotta tell her that I love her.

260
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,758
Tell her, I ain't gonna leave her.
- Tell her yourself!

261
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,625
The Next time you call home you tell her yourself.

262
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,645
Or better yet, let her come visit you here.

263
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:49,125
She don't need to be exposed.
- You've already exposed--!

264
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,390
You've already exposed her to this.
- So, you gonna leave me?

265
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,821
You gonna leave me again, What kinda mom is you?

266
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,744
You wanna fuck around and leave me in here?

267
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,207
You ain't never have my fuckin' back anyway.

268
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,450
I'm being here by myself.

269
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,214
I love you Oscar..
I do.

270
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:16,646
And, I'm praying for you.

271
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,730
I'll see you when you get home.

272
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,420
Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug, Ma.

273
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,035
- Grant.
- I can't get a hug?

274
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:33,386
Ma, let me get a hug..Ma!

275
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:34,586

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,030
Sold it to a white boy.
- For real..For how much?

282
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,857
Gave me a rack for it.
- I was'nt gonna pay that high.

283
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:57,052
But, I still needed that though...

Carrot cake.

293
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,480
Why you didn't get ice cream?

294
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,320
Cause it aint your birthday.

295
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,442
You know it would be hella easier
if you just had your stuff at my spot right.

296
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,590
When you gonna move in.

297
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,450
Maybe, when you stop having trees
in the car before we pick up T.

298
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,519
Can you roll down the window, please?

299
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:35,189
Hey T. T, come here.

300
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,641
We played "Freeze Tag" today.

301
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:50,739
Did you win?
- They couldn't catch me.

302
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,970
You think you're fast huh?

303
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,770
Faster than daddy?

304
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,090

308
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:08,985
Ask your sister.
- But Rose got hella kids to watch.

309
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:13,472
But what's the difference between watching
six kids or watching seven kids?

310
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,093
<i>Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
- Si, si.</i>

311
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:34,020
Daddy, what's that on your shirt?

312
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:38,948
Daddy had an accident at work.

313
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:42,818
How's work? By the way.

314
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:46,875
Work is... work.

315
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,416

316
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:16,355

It's cool.

318
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:24,135
There a shirt on the bed for you, if you want.

319
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,349
Are you alright?

320

I lost my job.

323
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,690
For what?

324
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:06,673
Being late.

325
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,344
Missed a couple days when I had to get some money.

326
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,139
They told you today?

327
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:14,339
On your day off?

328
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,740
Keep it real, they told me two weeks ago.

329
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:23,106
My bad Phina -

330
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,500
I though I was gonna get my job back.

331
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,350
I thought I could talk to Emi...
- You think life a fucking joke...

332
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,483
You think you're gonna get fired and then
somebody is gona give you thier job back?

333
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,304
What?

334
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:44,799
You aint shit, you know that?

335
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,322
You lie to me, you lie to your fucking daughter.

336
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,656
I didn't have to tell you nothing!

337
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,766
I coulda kept gettin' it.
I don't wanna know shit.

338
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,166
So you would have just kept faking..

You been out bustin nocks? And doing whatever else,
or WHOEVER else you do while I'm at work?

340
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,458
You ain't even listening to me.

341
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:10,261
Not after you lie for two weeks get cornered,
and don't have a choice.

342
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,461
That's some pussy act shit.

343
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,896
What did you today. Hmm.

344
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:21,347
I bet you sold that fucking zip.
- I dumped that shit, Phina.

345
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,000
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

346
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,420
I'm tired.

347
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:34,176
Thought I could start fresh.
But that shit aint working like that.

348
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:50,177
You threw a whole zip of weed.
And you don't got a job.

349
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,996
I could slap you right now.

350
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,276
What are you gonna do?

351
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,826
Something legal.

352
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:17,265
Maybe if I can just not fuck up, for 30 days..

353
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:25,009
That's how long Oprah said to form a habit, right?

354
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,714
Look at me.

355
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:37,834
Don't make me have to do this shit alone, again.

356
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:39,213
You guys are just in time.

00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:05,801
Baby, You know all I needed was two,

360
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,068
You ain' gotta worry about that.

361
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,286
A Raiders fan, cheering for the Steelers.

362
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:30,899
Yes, A Raiders fan, cheering for the Steelers.

365
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:38,885
Coach even has a black wife.
I'm going with the Steelers.

366
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,917
You're insane, you know that?

367
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:09,309
Thanks for your help tonight.

368
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:13,079
Oh, Come'on Ma, You ain't gotta thank me.

369
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:15,413
You shouldn't even be doing this.

370
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:16,613
Relax.

371
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:20,734

Catch the fireworks
Probably roll around a bit after that.

379
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,490
Roll around?

380
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,388

Plus, Sophina's got work in the morning anyway.

382
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,673

00:41:56,873 --> 00:42:00,046
Mom, there ain't gonna be drinking.

Why don't you take the train out there?

386
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:12,531
That way you guys can drink and hang out,
and not have to worry about anything.

387
00:42:17,193 --> 00:42:18,538
No traffic either.

No you don't. Because then-
THE GUMBO MONSTER WILL GET YOU!!!!!

413

423
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,613
Those are just firecrakers.

424
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:01,430
You'll be safe inside, with your cousin.

01:10:14,852 --> 01:10:15,964
Scissors.

639
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:19,509
Suction.

640
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,512
Hey, listen.
None of that.

641
01:10:55,712 --> 01:10:56,712
None of that.

642
01:10:56,912 --> 01:10:58,730
It's not the time or the place.

643
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,820
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

644
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,269
We gotta.we gotta let these
people do their job.

645
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:17,469
He's gonna be fine.

646
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:20,579
Let's put all our energy toward Oscar right now.

647
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:21,779
I know y'all are upset.

648
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:25,732
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.

649
01:11:27,265 --> 01:11:28,793
Let's keep him lifted up.

650
01:11:40,616 --> 01:11:41,602
Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes.

651
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:44,748
How is he?
How is he?

652
01:11:44,948 --> 01:11:47,254
Mrs.Johnson, as you know..

653
01:11:47,454 --> 01:11:48,454
Your son has been shot.

654
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,584
We've stabilized him,

655
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:51,784
but he's critical.

656
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:55,178
Critical. What is that?

657
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:59,016
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.

658
01:11:59,216 --> 01:12:03,681
His lung? How is he...
How is he going to be able to breathe?

659
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,575
He's on a breathing machine, right now.

660
01:12:06,775 --> 01:12:07,775
His breathing is stable.

661
01:12:09,168 --> 01:12:11,360
The main problem is the internal bleeding.

662
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,995
We've had some difficulty stopping the bleeding..

663
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:17,296
That's getting his blood to clot.

664
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,067
He hasn't fully responded to the transfusions, yet.

665
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:22,970
But he's going to make it right?

666
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,170
But he's going to make it.

667
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,598
I promise you, we're gonna do everything we can okay?

668
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:36,539
Please do whatever you can, please.

669
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,523
We gotta lift him up, you all.

670
01:12:45,723 --> 01:12:48,140
We gotta lift Oscar up.

671
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,512
You all, let's pray.

672
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,360
<i>Heavenly father...</i>

673
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,939
<i>We kneel before you..
And ask you..</i>

674
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:51,237
<i>To put your healing hands around your child.</i>

675
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:54,475
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>

676
01:13:54,675 --> 01:13:57,280
<i>to operate through these doctors;</i>

677
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:04,130
<i>Breathe strength into their hands Lord,
as they work on him.</i>

678
01:14:06,268 --> 01:14:08,812
<i>We are asking you right now, to heal him.</i>

679
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:15,946
<i>Oh, Heal him lord,
so we can hold him and see his smile again.</i>

680
01:14:16,146 --> 01:14:20,123
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>

681
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,202
He didn't make it.

682
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:22,039
I need to see him.

683
01:15:24,098 --> 01:15:25,392
Okay, you can see him.

684
01:15:25,592 --> 01:15:28,281
But they don't want you go into the room and detach him.

685
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:30,493
Cos they ruled it a homicide.

686
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,028
I need to see him.

687
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:37,041
I need to see him.

688
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,241
I can take her.
- Okay.

689
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:23,133
I told him to catch the train.

690
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:27,371
I told him to catch BART!

691
01:16:27,571 --> 01:16:30,466
I didn't know they were gonna hurt him.

692
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:34,682
I should have just let him drive.

693
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:38,262
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.

694
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:45,561
You gotta let me hug him.

695
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:48,714
Please, let me hug him.
Please.

696
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:52,987
He didn't like to be alone!!

697
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,636
Come on, T.

698
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:37,789
Where's Daddy?

699
01:19:56,814 --> 01:20:01,239
