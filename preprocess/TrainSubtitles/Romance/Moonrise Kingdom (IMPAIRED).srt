In order to show you how

4
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,207
a big symphony
orchestra is put together,

5
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,374
Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,

6
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,207
which is made up
of smaller pieces

7
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,290
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.

8
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,165
These smaller pieces
are called variations,

9
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,749
which means different ways
of playing the same tune.

10
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,082
First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,

11
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,290
which is a beautiful melody

12
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,749
by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.

13
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:55,290
Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.

Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear
the four different families of the orchestra

17
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,540
playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.

18
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,415
First, we hear
the woodwind family.

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,165
The flutes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.

Here comes the brass family.

The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.

the violas, the cellos and the double basses.

30
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,749
And of course, the harp.

32
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,124

hear the theme by Purcell

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,665
played once more in its original
form by all four families together.

-Right here.

In fact, we've come to

because this is only the most recent

fair to the others, so, unfortunately,

we can't invite him
back at this time.

that Sam is an orphan?

as a matter of protocol.

You say you can't
invite him back? You say that he's an orphan?

I don't understand
how that works.

to do with him?

I heard he
never had any family in the first place.

That's probably
why he's crazy.

You really think
a 12-year-old boy

00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,332
could row this far
in a miniature canoe?

200

Most likely not.

It is possible, Counselor.

202
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,290
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

203
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,832
I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.

Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.

-Okay.

-Yeah.

them back in one day. I haven't decided yet.

them to have a secret to keep.

an example, if you'd like,

I am.

477
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,249
Well, I didn't know.

478
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,707
Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

479
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,832
Did you hit him?

480
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,040
No. He fell in a ditch.

481

Hey! Cat food!

All right,
we know they're together.

a certain radius of this spot.

with the county right now.

Until help arrives,
I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one,

489
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,082
and the boy with
the patch on his eye

490
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,499
to come with me in
the station wagon.

491
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:31,665
Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,

492
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,999
split up on foot.

493
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,165
Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over

494
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,707
this end of the island
and fly low.

497
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,832
They found the campfire.

What do you creeps want?

501
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,290
We're looking for you.

502
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,374
Why?

503
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,332
Well, because
you're a fugitive.

504
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,665
No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.

505
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,165
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.

506
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,540
We've been deputized.

507
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,874
Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?

508
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,332
Listen to some reason.

509
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:02,499
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

510
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,290
So, why don't you
just let us disappear?

511
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,165
Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.

512
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,582
You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.

Why not?

514
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,332
Because he's crazy.

515
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,249
Maybe you just
don't know him.

516
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,499
Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.

517
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,499
He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.

in the history of the island's

I recall his fascination with the idea

Well, normally,

the admissions panel

a psychological evaluation

727

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

794
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,207
I heard he's going
to reform school.

795
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:42,165
I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,

796
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,749
send him to
an insane asylum.

797
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:44,957
I like his girl.

798
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,124
She's too scruffy for me.

799
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,415
Supposedly,
they got to third base.

800
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,999
That's not true.
He just felt her up.

801
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,124
Over shirt or under shirt?

802
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,290
Damn us.

803
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,124
It's none of our business.

804
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:08,332
This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.

805
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:11,290
In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.

806
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,665
Why's he so unpopular?

807
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,040
I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,

808
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:24,624
but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

809
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,790
Nickleby?

810
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:27,665
Deluca?

811
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,415
Lazy-Eye?

812
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:30,957
Gadge?

813
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:34,707
He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.

814
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,540
Are we man enough
to give that

815
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,707
so part of his brain
doesn't get removed out of him?

816
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,249
They were prepared
to die for each other out there.

Okay. Okay.
What do you need?

819
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:52,540
For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,

820
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,874
some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.

821

In other words, it's over.

822
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:28,749
I guess so.
For the moment.

823
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,124
Until further notice.

824
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,332
That's right.

825
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:33,457
I understand.

826
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,249
I have to do better,
for everybody.

827

Except me.

828

Except you.

829
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:46,165
Well, I hope you can.
I think you will.

the right thing.

We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.

No, thanks.

842
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:00,207
Yes, thanks.
This is an emergency rescue.

843

It's worthless to me.
There's no point, not without Suzy.

How'd you get here?

They snuck me down
the laundry chute

01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,915
and left a papier-mâché
dummy in my bed.

He's a Falcon Scout,

SAM: Can we trust him?

854
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,915
SKOTAK: Normally, I'd say no.

855

Did you leave
another note for Lionel?

856
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,707
Not this time.
He can't keep his trap shut.

857
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:55,457
Besides, I'll probably
never see him again.

-Great.

It's not your fault.

Which injuries
are you apologizing for, specifically?

878
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:39,624
Specifically?

879
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:42,040
Whichever ones still hurt.

880
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:45,415
Half of those
were self-inflicted.

off without me.
