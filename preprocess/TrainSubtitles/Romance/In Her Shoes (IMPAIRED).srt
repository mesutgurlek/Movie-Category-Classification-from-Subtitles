Shoes like these should not

All right already.!

Oh, sorry.
I thought it was my son.

- I'll get my list.
- Okay.

478

I didn't know your son was here.
That's wonderful.

00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:55,408
Yeah, well,
he said he wants to see me.

00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:59,308
And where is he now?
He's on the beach, looking at bosoms.

Hey, Lewis, what's the matter?

482
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:04,039
You look like you just had a stroke.

483
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,449
- Hi, Mrs. Lefkowitz. Hi, Ella. I didn't see you.
- Hello.

It's soap.

go for the simplest box.

like around here, bungee jumping?

Where'd she go to anyway?

I don't know. My dad's, I guess.

Well, that's good. Gives Sydelle
one more thing to complain about.

"Boy, that sucks...

- My son, the joker.

that I don't see him on the holidays.

maybe instead of a reward...

557
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:15,061
you could offer your clients

I can make you any kind of eggs you'd like.

627
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,739
- I don't eat breakfast.
- Oh.

628
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,807
I drink coffee.

629
00:46:57,376 --> 00:47:01,506
So, my goodness. This is a surprise.

630
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:03,582
Such a lovely surprise.

631
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:07,019
After all this time.

632
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:11,455
- Yeah, what's up with that?
- I beg your pardon?

633
00:47:11,557 --> 00:47:16,358
Well, were you always out of the picture,
or just after Mom died?

634
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:21,593
Oh, your grandfather and I were never out
of the— I mean, we were always there.

635
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,600
We—

636
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:27,331
And even after your mom died, I wrote.

637
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,534
Birthday cards, every year.
And I never heard back.

638
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:33,578
Yeah, I know. You wrote
for a while. I just found them.

639
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,443
What do you mean, "just"?

640
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:40,610
I guess they got waylaid.
Thanks for the money.

641
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,984
You're telling me that your father
never gave you my cards?

642
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,251
Mm-mmm.

643
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:48,826
What must you have thought?

644
00:47:50,463 --> 00:47:53,261
I thought you both were dead.

645
00:47:57,937 --> 00:48:00,064
Does this place have a pool?

646
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:03,073
- Oh! Sorry.
- Whoa.

647
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:05,735
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

648
00:48:05,845 --> 00:48:08,177

Hey.

00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:25,127
Where'd she come from?

653
00:48:43,115 --> 00:48:45,140
Hi, sweetheart.

00:48:57,796 --> 00:48:59,764
Come on, come on.

Oh, Stein.

00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,422
How are you?

661
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:36,023
Man, you look great.
Not sick at all.

662
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:37,864
Why would I look sick?

663
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,404
Oh.

[Bell Tolls]

666
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,340
How 'bout that? Lunchtime.

667
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:53,748
- Hey, how does, uh— How does Japanese sound?
- I'm not hungry, Stein.

668
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:57,117
Oh, there's no such thing
as not hungry for sushi. Come on.

669
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:59,885
We'll bill it to one of your old clients.

Uh, thank you.
You eat everything?

671
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:03,962
- What do you think?
- Okay.

672
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:08,261
- Um, two orders of uni, one masago.
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:10,198
- Uh, two tako.
- Okay.

674
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,099
- Two hamachi.
- Mm-hmm.

675
00:50:12,204 --> 00:50:16,231
Then also that cod thing. It was a special
once, but it's not on the menu anymore.

676
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:18,310
- You know what I'm talking about.

- What am I, 12?
- Uh, I'm an expert orderer.

681
00:50:28,254 --> 00:50:30,119
- It's a gift.
- Is it?

682
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:32,850
Absolutely.

683
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:36,052
What was the last
great restaurant you went to?

684
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:39,892
- I took my sister to Le Bec Fin.
- Uh-huh.

685
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,130
And you both got the... snapper,
right?

686
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:47,296
Close. I got the snapper.

687
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:51,172
- She got three rum and Cokes
and the sommelier's phone number.
- [Laughs] Okay.

Well, I'll take you there,

the foie gras
with Roquefort-stuffed fig...

690

Scottish wood pigeon with cabbage...

and porcini cassoulet.

692
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:08,693
And the chocolate mousse...

with raspberries
and hazelnut macaroon.

- Mmm.

What are the other rumors?

00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:33,544
Ah. Um—

701
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:36,712
Rumor one: Mysterious illness.

702
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:39,882
Rumor two: Head-hunted
by Pepper and Hamilton.

703

Here. Try some of this.

- Rumor three?
- Um, soy?

Oh, come on.
What's rumor three?

really nice, but, um, I don't think—

00:52:33,345 --> 00:52:35,210
7:00 it is.

Mmm. That smells good.

There's a paper towel on the counter.

00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:07,838
Out of curiosity...

721
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:11,040
how long is this vacation of yours
going to last?

722
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,381
How come you don't have
any pictures of my mom around?

723
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,421
Don't you like thinking about her?

724
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:20,492
I don't need to have a picture
to think about my daughter.

725
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:32,468
You put out pictures,
people ask questions.

726
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:35,597
They expect you to tell 'em everything,
and I don't do that.

727
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:38,175
'Cause Mom was sick?

728
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:40,575
Because she's gone.

729
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,907
Is that why you pulled away from us?

730
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,485
So that you didn't have to talk
about her with us either?

731
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:50,578
I didn't pull away. I was pushed.

732
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,925
No, listen.

733
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:58,656
I'm not the one who didn't pass along
the letters. That was your father.

734
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:00,698
I'm not the one
who didn't want a relationship.

735
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:03,734
He said that? "I don't want you to have
a relationship with my daughters."

736
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,804
- [Chuckling] Oh, yes.
- When?

737
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:09,169
- At the funeral.
- Why? Why would he say that?

738
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:15,139
Because he's irrational. Yeah.
He blamed me for everything.

739
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:18,148
Every bad day, every bad episode.

740
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,447
He did not want me near her.

741
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,521
And after she was gone...

742
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:27,080
he didn't want me near you
or your sister.

743
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,797
I just wonder—

744
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,736
If you had tried harder,
you know, or, like, tried again...

745
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:44,104
after he'd gotten over the whole...

746
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,201
shock and grief of it, you know?

747
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:55,081
'Cause it would have been nice
having a grandmother.

748
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:57,155
Nice and...

749
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,351
maybe a little less lonely.

750
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:09,326
She sounds like a manipulative
little nincompoop.

751
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:13,131
- The girl lost her mother.
- So? You lost your daughter.

752
00:55:13,238 --> 00:55:15,229
- It's not the same.
- It's worse.

753
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,673
A parent burying a child
goes against the law of nature.

754
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:22,577
Well, so does a grandparent
abandoning her grandchildren.

755
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:25,309
You said yourself
he didn't want you around.

756
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:28,352
What were you supposed to do,
break down the door?

757
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:30,387
Yes.

759
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,326
For Caroline, yes.

760
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,661
For Caroline.
She was gone, cookie.

761
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:45,259
And you pushing your way into that house
wasn't gonna do a thing for her.

762
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,895
- She wanted me there.
- You don't know that.

763
00:55:48,006 --> 00:55:51,407
- Yes, I do. I know.
- How?

764
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:55,079
I just do.

765
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,080
How?

766
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:02,145
I've never told anybody this,
not even Ira.

767
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:06,418
I'll take it to my grave,
probably tomorrow.

[Chuckles]

769
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:13,197
It wasn't a car accident.

770
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:16,665
I mean, eh— it— it was a car...

771
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:21,535
and there was a crash, but—

772
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:25,609
How do you know it was on purpose?

773
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,348
She wrote a note.

774
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,844
It came the day after the funeral.

775
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:39,549
What'd it say?

776
00:56:39,658 --> 00:56:41,558
One line.

777
00:56:42,661 --> 00:56:45,528
"Please take care of my girls."

778
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:48,623
- And you didn't.
- [Restrained Sobbing] Mm-mmm.

779
00:56:48,734 --> 00:56:50,759
You didn't because you couldn't.

780
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:53,133
Now you can, so you will.

781
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:57,698
Ella, bubbeleh, you did the best
you could in a very bad situation.

782
00:56:57,809 --> 00:57:00,607
You got nothing to feel guilty about.

783
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,543
And you tell that
to Miss Hotsy-Totsy Pants.

784
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:07,619
[Chuckles]

785
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:18,922
So this is where all my boyfriends
have been coming from.

786
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,192
[Chuckles]

787
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:25,258
They took a vote. I don't know who
I pissed off, but somehow... I lost.

788
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,737
Or won. Either way, it's official.

789
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,673
I am the captain of the softball team.

790
00:57:31,777 --> 00:57:34,143
[Laughs]

791
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:36,146
Yeah.

792
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:41,446
Look, I know this isn't my business,
but I can't not say anything.

793
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:46,957
You have rights, legal options
for getting your job back.

794
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,959
I don't want it back.

795
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,723
You don't?

796
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,025
I thought you loved it.

797
00:57:54,132 --> 00:57:57,397
You were always the first one there in the morning
and the last one to leave at night.

798
00:57:57,502 --> 00:58:01,029
I know. Not because I loved it.

799
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:03,039
Then why?

800
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:06,076
I don't know.

801
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:10,012
Maybe... I was scared of what
would happen if I wasn't there.

802
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:13,278
Oh, what? Like the place
would fall apart without you?

803
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:17,014
- With law freaks like you there? Never.
- [Laughs]

804
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,455
No, I wasn't worried about the office.

805
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,824
I guess it was more... me...

806
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:26,921
and what would happen to me
without those people to please...

807
00:58:27,032 --> 00:58:29,660
and those tasks to get done.

808
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:33,534
Like... maybe... those were
the things holding me together.

809
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,275
And without them, I'd...

810
00:58:38,376 --> 00:58:40,344
fall apart.

811
00:58:42,547 --> 00:58:45,072
But you didn't.

812
00:58:45,183 --> 00:58:47,083
I guess not.

813
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:51,922
So what does hold you together?

814
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:03,930
For me, it's the law, politics...

815
00:59:04,035 --> 00:59:06,094
the Sixers and good food.

816
00:59:06,204 --> 00:59:11,164
If you ever want to join me
for a game or a meal...

817
00:59:12,277 --> 00:59:14,336
I hope you'll give me a call.

818
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:32,796
Ella?

819
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:10,732
[Gasps]
Oh. I was just looking for—

820
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:12,736
For what?

821
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,233
[Sighs]
Sorry, l—

822
01:00:19,344 --> 01:00:22,711
Wrong dresser.
It's in the sock drawer.

823
01:00:22,814 --> 01:00:24,839
What is?

824
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,886
My cash. That's what you were looking for,
right? That's what you want.

825
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:32,081
[Scoffs]
No. God.

826
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,751
[Clicks Tongue]
Oh, well.

827
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:38,659
I guess after being absent
for some 20-odd years or so...

828
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:41,698
I can't expect you to want
to have a relationship with me.

829
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,268
- How much?
- How much what?

830
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:48,931
Money, Maggie. How much money
were you hoping to get from me?

831
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:54,740
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

832
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:59,214
I want to go to New York.

833
01:00:59,317 --> 01:01:04,016
Maybe... act.
I think I'd be good at it.

834
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,319
Mmm, clearly.

835
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:09,450
- How much do you need?
- Three grand.

836
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:12,257
That you would not have found
in the sock drawer.

837
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:14,332
How much do you have?

838
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:19,969
Well...

839
01:01:20,071 --> 01:01:23,529
I won't give you $3,000,
but I'll do this.

840
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:26,736
They need help over
at the Assisted Living Center.

841
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:31,214
You get that job, stop loafing around
here like some princess...

842
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,784
and I will match what you earn,
penny for penny.

843
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:42,724
You would do that?

844
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,297
Why?

845
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:50,033
Because I'm your grandmother.

846
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:55,863
[Chattering]

847
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,442
[Woman]
Oh, I don't think so.

848
01:01:59,544 --> 01:02:03,503
Last time I ran anywhere was to my wedding.
Look what happened.

849
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,187
- Is that Corinne?
- No.

850
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:17,193
- Who is it?
- Maggie.

851
01:02:17,295 --> 01:02:19,661
Have we met before?

852
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:22,892
There's a pick-up line
with a little dust on it.

853
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,265
Fine. What's your sign?

854
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,702
I've been out of the game for a while.

855
01:02:27,806 --> 01:02:30,274
What, like 70, 80 years?

856
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,367
[Chuckling]
Give or take.

857
01:02:33,478 --> 01:02:35,446
Where's Corinne?
She's my number-one girl.

858
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:38,141
Well, excuse me, but what does
Corinne have that I don't?

859
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:42,811
- She reads to me.
- Oh.

860
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:47,290
You could do it, maybe nose her
out of first position.

861
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:51,262
Here.

862
01:02:53,365 --> 01:02:56,300
I'm a little busy right now.

863
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:59,893
Maybe you should wait for Corinne.

864
01:03:07,545 --> 01:03:10,343
- [Exhales Deeply]
- [Line Ringing]

865
01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:13,315
- [Simon] Hello?
- Are the Sixers basketball or hockey?

866
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,716
[OrganFanfare]

867
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,448
[Crowd Cheering]

868
01:03:18,556 --> 01:03:20,524
[Simon]
Come on, Eric.!

869
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,059
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

870
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:25,652
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Get back, get back!

871
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:28,892
That's Reggie Miller.!
You gotta get him.!

872
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,468
- [Sixers Fans Booing]
- He'll make it every time.

873
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:33,469
Boo! That's right.

874
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:35,664
- Boo!
- Good.

875
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:40,311
[Man]
I can't believe we lost the game.

876
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,880
- Why can't you believe it?
We've been losin' all season long.
- That's right.

877
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,609
We need a three-point man, a man who
can shoot the pill, a man who can thrill.

878
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:48,083
I don't care if you have the best
three-point shooter in the league.

879
01:03:48,186 --> 01:03:51,121
- You got to get back on defense.
- But at the same time, you need
to put points on the boards too.

880
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:54,020
Look at the best teams in history—
the Celtics, the Bulls, the Lakers—

881
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,025
all great defensive teams.

882
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:58,595
I mean, offense sells tickets,
but defense wins ball games.

883
01:03:58,696 --> 01:04:01,096
- He's right.
Without defense, you won't win games.
- Thank you.

884
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,502
[Sniffs]

885
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,372
Hmm.

886
01:04:14,012 --> 01:04:16,412
I see you're a fan of the classics.

887
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:20,341
Um, what?

888
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:28,223
- Oh, that. That-That's my sister's.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

889
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,760
I hope you like cheap, almost-stale red.

890
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:32,762
[Chuckles]
It's my favorite.

891
01:04:33,898 --> 01:04:35,957
What's she like— the sister?

892
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:39,332
She's, you know, a sister.

893
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:44,266
- You don't want to talk about your sister.
- I didn't say that.

894
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:49,570
I don't want to talk about my sister.

895
01:04:51,883 --> 01:04:53,851
Cheers.

896
01:05:01,326 --> 01:05:04,352
So what's he like,
this, um, Captain Jack?

897
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:08,933
"His fingers tangled in her curls...

898
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:12,992
"while his tongue plundered
the soft cavern of her mouth.

899
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:15,072
"She made no protest.

900
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:18,040
"Her furnace was alight.

901
01:05:18,143 --> 01:05:21,112
"Jack drew his lips from hers
and urged her forward...

902
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:24,113
"so he could take
one shirt-veiled nipple...

903
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:26,115
"into his mouth.

01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:29,050
"Kit's gasp urged him on.

905
01:05:29,154 --> 01:05:31,645
"He licked the material
until it clung...

906
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:33,656
"to the ripe peak...

907
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:37,125
"then drew the turgid flesh
deep into his mouth.

908
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:42,097
"Kit moaned, her body
spasming in response.

909
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,397
Her eyes were closed,
her lips parted."

910
01:05:47,105 --> 01:05:49,903
Okay, um, embarrassing
as this is to admit...

911
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:52,476
I'm officially turned on.

912
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:19,029
Does this mean that I'm your bitch?

913
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:23,366
Do you want to be my bitch?

914
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:32,239
I have wanted to be your bitch
since my first day at Dommel.

915
01:07:34,212 --> 01:07:39,172
That Chicago trip— I was convinced it was
all gonna come together for me there.

916
01:07:39,284 --> 01:07:44,085
- Was I unfriendly?
- Oh, no. I mean, not compared to, say, Stalin.

917
01:07:44,188 --> 01:07:46,156
[Both Laugh]

918
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:50,091
I'm sorry.

919
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:54,460
- Hmm. I was hideous.
- That's okay.

920
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:57,125
You have plenty of time
to make it up to me.

[Dogs Barking]

922
01:08:11,182 --> 01:08:14,879
- Go, go, go!
- [Barking]

923
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:18,287
Come on, come on!

- Yes! Go!

925
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:29,329
Yes! [Laughing] Yes!

926
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,431
So, how's it going with Hotsy Tots?

927
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:37,406
- [Chuckling] Oh, fine.
- "Fine," she says.

928
01:08:37,508 --> 01:08:39,942
- [Chuckles]
- What?

929
01:08:40,044 --> 01:08:42,069
There's no "fine" with grandkids.

930
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:46,014
It's either the best day of your life
or sheer torture.

931
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:49,177
- What do you do together?
- I don't know. We eat.

932
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:51,187
[Mrs. Lefkowitz]
Huh.! That's it?

933
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:53,382
Oh, do things she likes to do.

934
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:58,554
Read the fashion magazines, surf the Net,
watch the smut on the cable.

935
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:01,689
- I don't have cable.
- [Mrs. Lefkowitz] No cable?

936
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,927
And she wonders why she and the girl
aren't all buddy-buddy.

937
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:10,338
I don't need television to build
a relationship with my granddaughter.

938
01:09:10,441 --> 01:09:12,534
You're new to this. Trust me.

939
01:09:12,643 --> 01:09:14,611
It's all about surround sound.

940
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:22,713
[Woman On TV] I just needed
a little kiss to make me feel better...

941
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,187
but now it wasn't working.

942
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,190
- Maggie!
- Oh!

943
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:30,886
We're having Cosmopolitans.
Would you like one?

944
01:09:30,995 --> 01:09:34,761
[Woman On TV] I wasn't getting
the same rush. Tonight, I needed more.

945
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:36,766
No, thanks.

946
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:40,269
Meanwhile, uptown, Charlotte wondered
when relationships had gotten so complicated.

947
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:44,740
She yearned for the time when dinner
was followed by dessert, not lubricant.

948
01:09:44,842 --> 01:09:47,402
- [Gags]
- Ooh, whoops!

949
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:50,379
[All Laughing]

950
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:52,381
[Ella]
Oh, my.

951
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:55,008
I don't want to. Or maybe I do.
I don't know what I want, but—

952
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,577
- I've seen this one.
- [Charlotte] I can't.

953
01:09:58,689 --> 01:10:01,783
- I want children and nice bedding and—
- It's funny.

954
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:06,159
[Woman] That night, they made love
the Charlotte way—polite—

955
01:10:06,264 --> 01:10:08,164
[Mrs. Lefkowitz]
Oh, it was wonderful.

956
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:10,166
- I thought so.
- Oh, you would.

957
01:10:10,268 --> 01:10:12,293
- Now, walk up straight now.
- Thank you for everything.

958
01:10:12,403 --> 01:10:14,303
- Good.
- Have a very wonderful day.

959
01:10:14,405 --> 01:10:17,340
- Yes, and have a good sleep, and no sugar.
- Okay. And good night.

960
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,876
- Good night.
- Yeah.

961
01:10:19,977 --> 01:10:22,502
[Chuckling]
Well—Yeah, okay.

962
01:10:22,613 --> 01:10:25,207
Okay. Thank you. Good night.

963
01:10:39,797 --> 01:10:41,765
[Water Running]

964
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:46,770
What's up with Lewis?

965
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:50,500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

966
01:10:50,608 --> 01:10:53,600
I say go for it. Just jump him.

967
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:55,645
Maggie!

968
01:10:55,746 --> 01:10:58,306
Don't talk like that. Here.

969
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:03,519
Half the fun of sex...
is talking about it.

970
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:06,522
Well, I guess I missed that half.

971
01:11:06,624 --> 01:11:09,422
You never talked about sex?

972
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:13,293
[Sighs]
Occasionally with Ira.

973
01:11:13,397 --> 01:11:15,297
Kind of.

974
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:18,266
Yeah, but what about girlfriends?

975
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,564
The first time you got laid.

976
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:22,571
You had to tell someone that.

977
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:26,040
It was my wedding night.
It was assumed.

978
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:30,045
You missed out on one of the all-time
greatest conversations in life.

979
01:11:31,315 --> 01:11:33,283
Who'd you tell?

980
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:36,987
Rose.

981
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,386
Well, maybe if I'd had a sister.

982
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,958
Even when you were so small...

983
01:11:42,059 --> 01:11:44,584
you had a bond
that I'd never had with anyone.

984
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,062
You still close like that?

985
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,567
Sure.

986
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:54,433
- You don't talk about her.
- What do you want to hear?

987
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:59,576
We're totally fine. We're-We're tight.
We're thick as thieves.

988
01:11:59,677 --> 01:12:03,135
Let's ask her down.
I'd like to know her too.

989
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:06,182
You know, I doubt she would come.

990
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:09,378
She's, like, really busy.
She's a lawyer.

991
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:11,055
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

992
01:12:11,055 --> 01:12:13,114
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

993
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,957
[Amy] What do you do
once they've all peed?

994
01:12:17,061 --> 01:12:20,394
[Rose] Hmm. Give 'em a brush.
Take 'em all home.

995
01:12:20,498 --> 01:12:22,966
Make sure they have water to drink.

996
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:28,729
- After that.
- Then I'm done.

997
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,973
- So what do you do?
- Whatever.

998
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:38,981
- Shop for food, cook for my boyfriend.
- I know his name.

999
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:43,076
I know, but I've never really had a real,
live, grown-up boyfriend before...

1000
01:12:43,187 --> 01:12:46,179
and I'm gonna use the word
as often as I can.

1001
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,157
All right, first of all,
he's not grown up.

1002
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,160
None of them are.

1003
01:12:51,262 --> 01:12:55,858
You know, there's a consistency
to your cynicism which is truly beautiful.

1004
01:12:55,967 --> 01:12:58,094
Hmm. Just don't be surprised...

1005
01:12:58,202 --> 01:13:01,399
if he turns out to be...
less than perfect.

1006
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:03,973
And don't be surprised if he doesn't.

1007
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:08,512
- I gotta go.
- Good-bye.

1008
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:10,513
- Have fun.
- I'll call you.

1009
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:11,843
All right.

1010
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:16,011
[Old Man] You sound too pretty,
Maggie, to be cleaning bedpans.

1011
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,588
You're right. I am.

1012
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:22,125
I have a grandson, a doctor over in Tampa.
I should introduce you.

1013
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:25,320
- [Chuckles] You don't want to do that.
- Are you bad news?

1014
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:29,593
[Sighs] Well, you know,
I don't mean to be, but yeah.

1015
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,158
Well, since you're not gonna
marry my grandson...

1016
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,500
you might as well read to me.

1017
01:13:41,278 --> 01:13:43,439
- I'm kind of a slow reader.
- Perfect.

1018
01:13:43,547 --> 01:13:46,345
I'm a slow listener.

1019
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:59,862
"The... art... of...

1021
01:14:05,469 --> 01:14:08,836
- You know, I should just get back to work.
- What is it, dyslexia?

1022
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:11,339
- What are you, a teacher?
- Professor.

1023
01:14:11,442 --> 01:14:15,071
Retired.
Just take your time, Maggie.

1024
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:18,342
Listen to the words
as you're about to say them.

1025
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:20,917
Nine times out of 10,
you'll hear a mistake coming...

1026
01:14:21,018 --> 01:14:23,486
and you'll correct it
before you make it.

1027
01:14:23,587 --> 01:14:27,489
Then again, you might make
a total ass of yourself.

1028
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:46,436
Oh, come on.

1029
01:14:46,544 --> 01:14:49,513

Well, what do you think?

1065
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,621
[Sighs]
Good.

1066
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:23,257
Unacceptable answer.
What's the poem about?

1067
01:17:24,635 --> 01:17:27,103
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. What's it about?

1068
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:32,742
- Losing?
- What?

1069
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,880
- Love?
- Ah.

1070
01:17:37,982 --> 01:17:40,314
And how about that?

1071
01:17:41,585 --> 01:17:44,383
Is the love lost already?

1072
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:47,753
Is Bishop writing about it
as a possibility, a probability?

1073
01:17:47,858 --> 01:17:49,758
What?

1074
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:53,295
Well...

1075
01:17:54,798 --> 01:17:57,266
in the beginning,
she's talking about...

1076
01:17:57,368 --> 01:18:01,998
Iosing real things, like keys.

1077
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:07,333
And then she— she gets, like—

1078
01:18:07,444 --> 01:18:09,344
she lost a continent.

1079
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:12,540
- She's getting grandiose.
- Yeah.

1080
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:16,450
And the way she says it is like—
like it doesn't matter.

1081
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:18,453
Ah.

1082
01:18:18,555 --> 01:18:21,490
Her tone—
would you call it detached?

1083
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:26,420
I think she wants
to sound detached.

1084
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,626
You know,
she wants to... sound...

1085
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:32,634
like it doesn't matter...

1086
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:35,432
'cause she knows, deep down...

1087
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:38,099
how bad it's gonna feel to lose.

1088
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:40,108
Lose what?

1089
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:43,678
Or whom?

1090
01:18:45,049 --> 01:18:47,017
Is it a lover?

1091
01:18:51,488 --> 01:18:53,388
No.

1092
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:00,397
It's a friend.

1093
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,535
A-plus.

1094
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:09,535

- No, we just had a fight.

- About what?
- Can we talk about this later?

1106

Yes. Bad enough she monopolizes
the evening when she's here.

We're all blessed to be a part
of your happiness.

Your love bonds
notjust your two hearts...

Uh, it's hard to say.
She moves around a lot.

Well, I want to meet her eventually,

Oh.!

I should have used fresh vegetables
instead of frozen.

I don't think so. They were great.

Yes.

- No.

1135

- So she hasn't gotten back to you.
- About what?

1136
01:21:37,187 --> 01:21:39,678
You were going
to invite her down, Maggie.

1137

I don't know
where you got that idea.

1138
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:44,987
Maggie,
I specifically asked you to.

1139
01:21:45,095 --> 01:21:48,929
So? Just because you specifically asked
doesn't mean I'm going to.

1140

You shouldn't smoke.
You have a family history of lung cancer.

I have a family history
of car wrecks too.

1142
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:57,105
Does that mean I shouldn't drive?

1143
01:21:57,207 --> 01:21:59,505
- That is not funny.
- It wasn't supposed to be.

1144
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,874
All right, what is the problem
between you and Rose?

1145
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:05,278
- Why don't you want her to visit?
- Why do you?

1146
01:22:05,382 --> 01:22:07,942
I mean,
am I not good enough for you?

1147
01:22:08,051 --> 01:22:10,645
This has nothing to do with you.

1148

She's my daughter's daughter,
and I want to get to know her too.

I mean, as a mom,
how do you remember her?

Why don't you ask Rose?

1153

Maggie, please grow up.

1154
01:22:47,457 --> 01:22:49,357
She was special.

1155

Different than the other moms.

1156

She used to surprise us.

1157
01:22:56,733 --> 01:22:59,566
One time I opened up
my lunch box...

1158
01:23:00,671 --> 01:23:03,902
and there was a tiara inside.

1159
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:06,532
A tiara. With your sandwich?

1160
01:23:06,643 --> 01:23:08,543
Instead of a sandwich.

1161

What was she like as a daughter?

1162

No tiaras.

1163
01:23:18,755 --> 01:23:21,781
But I loved her so much.

1164
01:23:25,329 --> 01:23:28,958
But loving her in the right way
was difficult, for me, anyway.

1165
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:31,762
I didn't know there was
a right way and a wrong way.

Neither did I.

I had ideas—

01:23:37,808 --> 01:23:41,608
I had unwelcomed ideas
about how to keep her safe.

Like?

1170
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:47,380
Like, I thought she should have been
on her medication all the time.

1171
01:23:47,484 --> 01:23:49,816
I thought that her relationship
with your father...

1172
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,252
was far too passionate
for her to handle.

And as far as children
were concerned...

she was in no condition,
no condition at all.

You know what I wish, Maggie?

shut long enough...

01:41:21,163 --> 01:41:23,927
[Chuckling]
No. A date, to the Tea Dance.

1399
01:41:24,032 --> 01:41:26,830
And I'd be honored
if you'd go with me.

1400
01:41:29,538 --> 01:41:33,474
- I'd love to.
- Pick you up at 4:00.

1401
01:41:36,745 --> 01:41:40,875
- Lewis Feldman.
- Ooh.

1402
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:53,151
This place just keeps
getting better and better.

[Gasps]

1405
01:42:16,618 --> 01:42:18,586
What are you doing here?

1406
01:42:21,857 --> 01:42:23,950
I live here.
What are you doing here?

1407
01:42:24,059 --> 01:42:26,755
You live here?
In an old folks home?

1408
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:31,260
It's a retirement community
for active seniors.

1409
01:42:31,366 --> 01:42:34,631
Wait, so you—
you live with our grandmother?

1410
01:42:37,673 --> 01:42:40,198
How'd you find out about her?

1411
01:42:40,308 --> 01:42:44,267
I can't believe she wrote you
without telling me.

1412
01:42:46,248 --> 01:42:48,216
It's so sneaky.

1413
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:52,645
Does it offend
your strict moral code?

1414
01:42:56,024 --> 01:42:58,288
So, how's it going for you down here?

1415
01:42:58,393 --> 01:43:01,851
Who's buying your cocktails?

1416
01:43:01,963 --> 01:43:03,931
No one.

1417
01:43:04,032 --> 01:43:06,626
Oh, no.
Is your mojo failing you already?

1418
01:43:06,735 --> 01:43:08,635
My mojo's fine.

1419
01:43:08,737 --> 01:43:11,399
I just haven't felt like drinking.

1420
01:43:11,506 --> 01:43:14,669
Right. Probably haven't
felt like stealing...

1421
01:43:14,776 --> 01:43:18,576
or lying or having sex
with inappropriate partners either.

1422
01:43:20,582 --> 01:43:24,643
- Did you come down here just to abuse me?
- [Door Shuts]

1423
01:43:24,753 --> 01:43:27,313
Maggie.! I hope you are prepared
to be exceedingly rich...

1424
01:43:27,422 --> 01:43:29,390
because I booked you within an—

1425
01:43:31,593 --> 01:43:33,493
Rose. Oh.

1426
01:43:36,998 --> 01:43:38,989
Oh, Rose.

1427
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:41,126
Look at you.

1428
01:43:41,236 --> 01:43:43,568
Oh, look how lovely you are. Oh.

1429
01:43:43,672 --> 01:43:45,572
[Laughing]

1430
01:43:47,209 --> 01:43:49,905
Oh. Do you remember me?

1431
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,714
Yeah.

1432
01:43:53,815 --> 01:43:55,840
I remember you too.

1433
01:43:55,951 --> 01:43:57,919
You-You're exactly the same.

1434
01:43:58,019 --> 01:44:00,544
Smiley and huggable and—

1435
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,885
- Ooh, and engaged?
- What?

1436
01:44:03,992 --> 01:44:05,892
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:44:05,994 --> 01:44:09,794
- Holy shit. To who?
- No one you know.

1438
01:44:09,898 --> 01:44:11,889
Champagne. Now, come with me.

1439
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,696
Tell me all about it.

1440
01:44:18,006 --> 01:44:21,464
I can't believe you're marrying
somebody I haven't even met.

1441
01:44:26,314 --> 01:44:28,305
What's he like anyhow?

1442
01:44:31,953 --> 01:44:34,251
Why? You want to screw him too?

1443
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:41,458
I don't expect you to forgive me, Rose...

1444
01:44:45,734 --> 01:44:47,702
but I am sorry.

1445
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:57,169
[Squeaky Horn Tooting]

1446
01:44:57,279 --> 01:44:59,747
- [Maggie] Careful, Mrs. Haskell.
- I'm always careful!

1447
01:44:59,848 --> 01:45:03,375
She hit somebody last week.
It was a big to-do.

1448
01:45:03,485 --> 01:45:07,285
And there's a store where you can buy
eight different kinds of hemorrhoid creams.

1449
01:45:07,389 --> 01:45:09,653
All right.
Here come the Queen Bees.

1450
01:45:09,758 --> 01:45:13,250
Widows. They run the place.
Oh, watch out.

1451
01:45:13,361 --> 01:45:15,989
- Hello, ladies! This is my sister.
- Maggie.

1452
01:45:16,097 --> 01:45:17,997
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

1453
01:45:18,099 --> 01:45:20,067
Yep. Have a good day.

1454
01:45:21,703 --> 01:45:24,399
This is the exercise pavilion.
Hey, guys!

1455
01:45:24,506 --> 01:45:26,474
- Hi, Maggie.
- This is my sister, Rose.

01:45:26,575 --> 01:45:28,941
Hello, Rose!

01:45:29,044 --> 01:45:32,309
[Man] Good, Lydia. A good stretch.
That's it. And left.

1458
01:45:32,414 --> 01:45:34,314
Looking good, Mrs. Klein.

1459
01:45:34,416 --> 01:45:36,316

- Hi, ladies.

Hi!

I call these guys The Bench.
They're all former lawyers.

- Gentlemen! Hey.
- Hi, Maggie.

1463
01:45:45,694 --> 01:45:48,788
This is my sister, Rose.
She's a lawyer, too, from Philadelphia.

1464
01:45:48,897 --> 01:45:51,866
- Which firm?
- Uh, actually, no firm right now.

1465
01:45:51,967 --> 01:45:55,459
I'm just... taking some time off.

1466
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:58,038
- Me too.

- What are you doing, Ella?
- Sit down, girls.

1468
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:13,012
I've got some things here
I thought you might like to see.

1469
01:46:13,121 --> 01:46:16,056
- Whoa.
- Oh, God.

1470
01:46:16,157 --> 01:46:18,057
- [Chuckles]
- Look at you.

1471
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,719
- These are great.
- Hey, look. Our old living room.

1472
01:46:20,829 --> 01:46:22,922
Mm-hmm.

1473
01:46:23,031 --> 01:46:24,828
Oh, God.

1474
01:46:24,933 --> 01:46:28,164
Could Mom have been any prettier?

1475
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:30,932
Oh, you look exactly like her.
Doesn't she?

1476
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,475
- I wonder if there's a picture of Honey Bun.
- That'd be pretty impossible.

1477
01:46:34,576 --> 01:46:36,203
- Who's Honey Bun?
- Our dog.

1478
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,006
- You had a dog?
- For one day.

1479
01:46:38,113 --> 01:46:40,946
The greatest day.

1480
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:43,847
Mom woke us up really early.
It was a school day. It was still dark out.

1481
01:46:43,952 --> 01:46:45,852
It was winter.

1482
01:46:45,954 --> 01:46:49,856
And she put us in our best party dresses and
dragged us down to the kitchen, which was—

1483
01:46:49,958 --> 01:46:52,449
- A mess.
- Covered, every counter, in fudge.

1484
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,357
She'd been up all night making it.

1485
01:46:54,462 --> 01:46:58,091
We loaded it into the car,
and she drove us right past school...

1486
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:00,167
straight up to New York,
to Lord & Taylor.

1487
01:47:00,268 --> 01:47:02,736
Which was closed, because we got there
at 8:00 in the morning.

1488
01:47:02,837 --> 01:47:05,806
- That's right, and we hung out in the car.
- Eating fudge for breakfast.

1489
01:47:05,907 --> 01:47:08,967
Mom had heard about Mrs. Fields.
You know, the cookie lady?

1490
01:47:09,077 --> 01:47:12,308
And she figured that her fudge
was just as good as those cookies, so—

1491
01:47:12,414 --> 01:47:14,382
So she was gonna make a fortune.

1492
01:47:14,482 --> 01:47:19,283
When it finally opened, we went in
and, oh, God, she was so beautiful.

1493
01:47:19,387 --> 01:47:22,914
- She was wearing this long, velvety gown.
- At 8:00 in the morning?

1494
01:47:23,024 --> 01:47:25,754
Well, by this time it was 10:00.

1495
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:28,954
I guess she talked to some of the store people
about the fudge, but I don't remember.

1496
01:47:29,064 --> 01:47:31,862
Mmm, she spilled it,
all over the jewelry counter.

1497
01:47:31,967 --> 01:47:36,495
- There was a guy who just kind of looked at her.
- I don't remember a guy.

1498
01:47:36,604 --> 01:47:39,471
There was a guy,
and he looked at her.

1499
01:47:41,176 --> 01:47:44,839
Anyway, Mom said that we could
each get one present.

1500
01:47:44,946 --> 01:47:47,506
- And you got—
- A Nancy Drew book.

1501
01:47:47,615 --> 01:47:50,948
I asked for a puppy. And she got it!

1502
01:47:51,052 --> 01:47:54,749
[Sighs] He was so cute.
I named him Honey Bun.

1503
01:47:54,856 --> 01:47:57,791
Why'd you only have it for one day?

1504
01:47:57,892 --> 01:48:00,793
- I guess Dad thought it was a bad idea.
- [Ella] Why?

1505
01:48:00,895 --> 01:48:04,126
I don't know. I think he thought
I was too young.

1506
01:48:04,232 --> 01:48:06,291
No. He was just mad.

1507
01:48:06,401 --> 01:48:11,134
- About a dog?
- No, about the whole day.

1508
01:48:11,239 --> 01:48:15,300
He didn't have any idea where we were,
and school had called.

1509
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:18,140
- Oh.
- Really?

1510
01:48:18,246 --> 01:48:22,205
Yeah. He was really panicked
and really, really mad at her.

1511
01:48:22,317 --> 01:48:24,285
They had a huge fight.

1512
01:48:24,386 --> 01:48:27,378
I don't remember a fight.

1513
01:48:27,489 --> 01:48:30,515
You were in your room
with a record playing.

1514
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:32,684
- I was?
- Yeah.

1515
01:48:32,794 --> 01:48:36,958
I put you in there and turned the music on
so you wouldn't hear them.

1516
01:48:37,065 --> 01:48:40,694
[Ella]
Why? What were they saying?

1517
01:48:44,506 --> 01:48:46,474
He was saying...

1518
01:48:47,675 --> 01:48:50,143
she was unfit.

1519
01:48:50,245 --> 01:48:53,373
That's the word he used.

1520
01:48:53,481 --> 01:48:57,781
He said he was gonna... send her away.
Put her away. Something.

1521
01:48:57,886 --> 01:49:01,378
- He kept saying "away."
- Mmm. And her?

1522
01:49:01,489 --> 01:49:04,083
"Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.
I'm a good mother."

1523
01:49:04,192 --> 01:49:07,355
He'd say, "away,"
and she'd say, "I'm their mother!"

1524
01:49:07,462 --> 01:49:10,659
So he was—he was gonna
have her hospitalized.

1525
01:49:12,934 --> 01:49:14,834
Yeah.

1526
01:49:22,811 --> 01:49:24,711
Oh, God. The poor guy.

1527
01:49:27,882 --> 01:49:29,782
When exactly was this?

1528
01:49:29,884 --> 01:49:31,852
November 3.

1529
01:49:34,355 --> 01:49:37,381
No. No, it wasn't.
It was, like, months before that.

1530
01:49:37,492 --> 01:49:39,392
It was two days.

1531
01:49:39,494 --> 01:49:42,930
It was Tuesday,
and she died that Thursday.

1532
01:49:53,274 --> 01:49:55,640
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

1533
01:49:58,513 --> 01:50:00,743
The car, the tree.

1534
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:06,252
[Water Running]

1535
01:50:06,354 --> 01:50:08,822
Was it even raining that night?

1536
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,328
You were so little.

1537
01:50:16,431 --> 01:50:20,834
How do you tell a six-year-old
her mom left by choice?

1538
01:50:27,242 --> 01:50:29,267
Who told you?

1539
01:50:33,148 --> 01:50:35,582
No one.

1540
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:48,186
- Oh, God. Why can't I just stay mad at you?
- [Sniffling]

1541
01:50:48,296 --> 01:50:51,857
'Cause we're a pair,
like Sonny and Cher.

1542
01:50:51,966 --> 01:50:54,059
They split up.

01:50:54,169 --> 01:50:57,138
- But they remained quite close.
- [Chuckles]

1544
01:51:08,283 --> 01:51:10,513
I'm not engaged anymore.

1545
01:51:14,455 --> 01:51:16,355
Simon dumped me.

1546
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:25,460
Why are you still wearing the ring?

1547
01:51:27,135 --> 01:51:29,865
[Crying]
I like how it feels.

1548
01:51:33,841 --> 01:51:37,402
- Do you know his name?
- Simon Stein.

1549
01:51:37,512 --> 01:51:39,412
- Doctor?
