1
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,509
Oh, for a muse of fire...

2
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:17,947
that would ascend the
brightest heaven of invention.

3
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,499
A kingdom for a stage,

4
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,268
princes to act...

5
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,507
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

6
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:53,845
Then should the warlike harry,
like himself,

7
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,883
assume the port of Mars...

8
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,548
and at his heels,
leashed in like hounds,

9
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,992
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment.

10
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,993
But pardon, gentles all,

11
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,936
the flat, unraised spirits...

12
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:13,833
that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

13
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,100
to bring forth
so great an object.

14
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:22,075
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France

15
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,910
or may we cram
within this wooden "o"...

16
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,850
the very casques that did affright
the air at Agincourt?

17
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,381
Oh, pardon.

18
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:35,554
Let us, ciphers
to this great account,

19
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:38,187
on your imaginary forces work.

20
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,922
For it is your thoughts
that now must deck our kings,

21
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:44,501
carry them here, there,
jumping o'er times,

22
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:48,972
turning the accomplishment of
many years into an hourglass.

23
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:54,345
For the which supply,
admit me, chorus, to this history,

24
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:57,673
who, prologue-like,

25
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,578
your humble patience pray...

26
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,212
gently to hear,

27
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,051
kindly to judge...

28
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,517
our play!

29
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,132
My lord, I'll tell you.

30
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,706
That self bill is urged,
which, in the 11th year...

31
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,307
of the last king's reign was
like to have passed against us.

32
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,086
But how, my lord,
shall we resist it now?

33
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,084
It must be thought on.

34
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,982
If it pass against us, we lose the
better half of our possession.

35
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,121
But what prevention?

36
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,824
The king is full of grace
and fair regard.

37
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,695
And a true lover
of the holy church.

38
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,930
The courses of his youth
promised it not.

39
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,266
Since his addiction
was to courses vain,

40
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,837
his hours filled up
with riots, banquets,

41
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,475
sports and never noted
in him any study.

42
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,508
But, my good lord,
how now for the mitigation...

43
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,844
Of this bill
urged by the commons?

44
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,249
Doth his majesty incline
to it or no?

45
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,446
He seems...
indifferent,

46
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,282
or rather swaying more
upon our part.

47
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,124
For I have made an offer
to his majesty,

48
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,632
as touching France.

49
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,235
[Footsteps approaching]

50
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,018
Where is my gracious
lord of Canterbury?

51
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:43,778
God and his angels guard your sacred
throne and make you long become it.

52
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,514
Sure we thank you.

53
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,046
My learned lord,
we pray you to proceed...

54
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,814
and justly and religiously unfold...

55
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,920
why the law salique
that they have in France,

56
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,787
or should or should not
bar us in our claim.

57
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,001
And pray, take heed
how you impawn our person,

58
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,065
how you awake
our sleeping sword of war.

59
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:10,774
We charge you,
in the name of God, take heed.

60
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:16,074
For never two such kingdoms did
contend without much fall of blood.

61
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,783
Then hear me,
gracious sovereign.

62
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:27,323
There is no bar to make against
your highness' claim to France...

63
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,793
but this, which they
produce from Pharamond.

64
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,891
"In terram salicam
mulieres ne succedant."

65
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,433
"No woman shall succeed
in Salique land."

66
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,776
Which Salique land
the French unjustly gloze...

67
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,744
to be the realm of France.

68
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,579
Yet their own authors
faithfully affirm...

69
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,415
that the land Salique
lies in Germany...

70
00:07:56,556 --> 00:08:00,048
between the floods
of Sala and of Elbe.

71
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,387
Then doth it well appear
the Salique law...

72
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:07,023
was not devised
for the realm of France,

73
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
nor did the French possess
the Salique land...

74
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:14,638
until 421 years after
defunction of king Pharamond,

75
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:19,406
idly supposed
the founder of this law.

76
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:25,482
King Pepin,
which deposed childeric,

77
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:29,143
did, as heir general,
being descended of blithild,

78
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:31,380
which was the daughter
to king Clothair,

79
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,549
make claim and title
to the crown of France.

80
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,924
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the
crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine,

81
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,656
sole heir male of the true line
and stock of Charles the great,

82
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,634
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of France...

83
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:48,002
until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother,

84
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,004
was lineal
of the Lady Ermengare,

85
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:54,541
daughter to Charles,
the aforesaid duke of Lorraine,

86
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,348
by the which marriage the line
of Charles the great...

87
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,011
was reunited
to the crown of France.

88
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,085
So it is clear
as is the summer sun.

89
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,354
[Men chuckling]

90
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:15,500
All appear to hold in right
and title of the female.

91
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,902
So do the kings of France...

92
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,270
unto this day.

93
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:29,939
Howbeit, they would hold up
this salique law...

94
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:34,985
to bar your highness
claiming from the female.

95
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:40,858
May I, with right
and conscience,

96
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,726
make this claim?

97
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:49,397
The sin upon my head,
dread sovereign.

98
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:58,009
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.

99
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,411
Your brother kings
and monarchs of the earth...

100
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,673
do all expect that you
should rouse yourself...

101
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,409
as did the former lions
of your blood.

102
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,880
Never king of England had nobles
richer and more loyal subjects...

103
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,947
whose hearts have left
their bodies here in England...

104
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,184
and lie pavilioned
in the fields of France.

105
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,692
Oh, let their bodies follow,
my dear liege,

106
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,890
with blood and sword and fire
to win your right.

107
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,497
In aid whereof,

108
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:28,738
we of the spirituality
will raise your highness...

109
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:31,740
such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy...

110
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:34,711
at one time bring in to
any of your ancestors.

111
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,851
Call in the messengers
sent from the Dauphin.

112
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:51,393
Now are we well resolved,
and by God's help and yours,

113
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:56,034
the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours,

114
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,493
we'll bend it to our all...

115
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,934
or break it all to pieces.

116
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:19,747
Now are we well prepared to know the
pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.

117
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:24,153
Your highness, lately sending into France
did claim some certain dukedoms...

118
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,491
in the right of your great
predecessor, king Edward III.

119
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:30,126
In answer of which claim,
the prince, my master,

120
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,601
says that you savor
too much of your youth.

121
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:37,775
He therefore sends you, meeter for
your spirit, this tun of treasure.

122
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,647
And in lieu of this, desires
you let those dukedoms...

123
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,546
that you claim
hear no more of you.

124
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,251
This the Dauphin speaks.

125
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:53,014
What... treasure, uncle?

126
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,529
Tennis balls, my liege.

127
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,911
We are glad the Dauphin
is so pleasant with us.

128
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,684
His present and your pains
we thank you for.

129
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,745
When we have matched
our rackets to these balls,

130
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,055
we will in France,
by God's grace,

131
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:33,092
play a set shall strike his
father's crown into the hazard.

132
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,496
And we understand him well,

133
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,266
how he comes o'er us
with our wilder days,

134
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,934
not measuring what use
we made of them.

135
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:45,801
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state,

136
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:49,209
be like a king and show
my sail of greatness...

137
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,745
when I do rouse me
in my throne of France.

138
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,646
And tell the pleasant prince
this mock of his...

139
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,620
hath turned his balls
to gunstones,

140
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:01,594
and his soul
shall stand sore charged...

141
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,926
for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them.

142
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,022
For many a thousand widows
shall this his mock,

143
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,997
mock out of
their dear husbands,

144
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:12,468
mock mothers from their sons,
mock castles down.

145
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,072
And some are yet ungotten
and unborn...

146
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:17,701
that shall have cause
to curse the Dauphin's scorn.

147
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,603
So get you hence in peace,

148
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,247
and tell the Dauphin...

149
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:30,016
his jest... will savor
but of shallow wit...

150
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:34,319
when thousands weep
more than did laugh at it.

151
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,493
Convey them with safe conduct.

152
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,962
Fare you well.

153
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,010
This was a merry message.
[Scoffs]

154
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,846
We hope to make the sender
blush at it.

155
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:10,520
Therefore, my lords,
omit no happy hour...

156
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,597
that may give furtherance
to our expedition.

157
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,959
For we have now no thought
in us but France,

158
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:19,299
save those to God
that run before our business.

159
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,966
Therefore, let every man
now task his thought...

160
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:27,704
that this fair action
may on foot be brought.

161
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,850
[Chorus] Now all the youth of
England are on fire...

162
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:44,688
and silken dalliance
in the wardrobe lies.

163
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,592
For now sits expectation
in the air...

164
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,226
and hides a sword,
from hilts unto the point,

165
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:56,738
with crowns imperial,
crowns and coronets...

166
00:14:56,776 --> 00:15:00,439
promised to Harry and his followers.

167
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,814
[Meows]

168
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:18,057
Well met, Corporal Nym.

169
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,028
Good morrow,
Lieutenant Bardolph.

170
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,629
[Cat meows]
[Sniffs]

171
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:26,932
[Meows, paws running]

172
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:31,770
What, are you and Ancient Pistol friends yet?

173
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,905
For my part, I care not.

174
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,672
I say little,

175
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,587
but when time shall serve,
there shall be smiles.

176
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,118
But that shall be as it may.

177
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,987
Come, I will bestow a breakfast
to make you friends,

178
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,798
and we'll be all three
sworn brothers to France.

179
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,063
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.

180
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,468
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.

181
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,545
For certainly she did you wrong,
for you were betrothed to her.

182
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,710
- [Clattering]
- [Man, woman shouting, laughing]

183
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,255
How now,
mine host Pistol?

184
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,151
Base tyke!

185
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,285
Callest thou me host?

186
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,262
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!

187
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:28,628
Nor shall my Nell
keep lodgers!

188
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,426
No, by my troth,
not long.

189
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:34,165
For we can't lodge or board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen...

190
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,638
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

191
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:39,640
but it shall be thought
we keep a bawdy house straight.

192
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:43,144
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!

193
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,082
Good Corporal Nym,

194
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,252
show thy valor
and put up thy sword.

195
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,446
- Will you shog off?
- [Shouts]

196
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:56,022
Pistol, I will prick your guts
a little in good terms, as I may.

197
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,958
That's the humor of it.
[Groaning]

198
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,525
- Braggart vile!
- Ahh, hear me when I say,

199
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,701
he that strikes
the first stroke,

200
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,894
I'll run him up to the hilts,
as I'm a soldier.

201
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,336
An oath of mickle might,

202
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:12,602
and fury shall abate.
[Footsteps approaching]

203
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:13,869
My host Pistol!

204
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,372
You must come to my master,
and you, hostess!

205
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,449
He's very sick
and would to bed.

206
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,946
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his
sheets and do the office of a warming pan.

207
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,214
- Away, you rogue.
- [Sighs]

208
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:28,986
Faith, he's very ill.

209
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,192
By my troth,

210
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,932
the king has killed his heart.

211
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,366
Good husband,
come home presently.

212
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:52,781
[Sighs]

213
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,148
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.

214
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:00,221
Why the devil should we keep
nives to cut one another's throats?

215
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,162
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?

216
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,662
Base is the slave that pays.

217
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,995
By this sword,
he that makes the first thrust,

218
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,935
I'll kill him,
by this sword, I will.

219
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,909
If ever you come of women,
come in quickly to Sir John.

220
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:21,936
He is so shaked with
a burning quotidian fever...

221
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,682
that it is most lamentable
to behold.

222
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,852
Sweet men, come to him.

223
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,923
Poor Sir John.
[Crying]

224
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,650
A good portly man of faith.

225
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,328
[Men chattering, laughing]
## [Medieval]

226
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:45,270
[Man] Aye, to a cheerful look,
a pleasing eye...

227
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,436
and a most noble carriage.
[Laughing continues]

228
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:59,348
But do I not dwindle?
[Laughing continues]

229
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,886
My skin hangs about me
like an old lady's loose gown.

230
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,827
Company, villainous company
have been the spoil of me.

231
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,628
[Shouts, laughs]

232
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,298
Whoo!
Hey! Hey!

233
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,801
I was as virtuous
as a gentleman need to be. [snickers]

234
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,842
Virtuous enough.
Swore a little.

235
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,512
- [Murmuring in protest]
- [Clears throat]

236
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,648
Diced not above
seven days a week.

237
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,220
Went to a bawdy house
not above once in the quarter.

238
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,481
- Ohhh!
- [Shouting]

239
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,492
Paid money that I borrowed,

240
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,094
three or four times.

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,025
Lived well
and in good compass.

242
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,566
What? You were so fat,
Sir John,

243
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,600
that you must indeed
be out of all compass.

244
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,406
Do thou amend thy face,
and I'll amend my life.

245
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,377
[Men laughing]

246
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,674
[Sir John, Nell laughing]

247
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,487
[Exclaims, laughs]
[Laughing]

248
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,552
[Panting]

249
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:21,062
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked.

250
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:25,200
Mmm? If to be old
and merry is a sin,

251
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:28,473
if to be fat
is to be hated,

252
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:33,743
then no, my good lord,
when thou art king,

253
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,950
banish Pistol, banish Bardolph,
banish Nym.

254
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,679
But sweet Jack Falstaff,

255
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,215
Aliant Jack Falstaff,

256
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:50,619
and therefore more valiant
being as he is,

257
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,623
old Jack falstaff,

258
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,925
banish not him
thy Harry's company.

259
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:01,639
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

260
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,539
[Harry's voice]
I do. I will.

261
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:17,716
[Whispering] but we have heard the
chimes at midnight, master Harry.

262
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,660
[Whispers]
Jesus.

263
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,789
The days that we have seen.

264
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,468
[Harry's voice]
I know thee not, old man.

265
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,011
[Hoofbeats passing]

266
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:51,682
[Dog barking]

267
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:58,295
The king hath run
bad humors on the knight.

268
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,892
Nym, thou hast
spoke the right.

269
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,806
His heart is fracted
and... corroborate.

270
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:11,900
The king's a good king,

271
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,776
but it must be as it may.

272
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,308
He passes some humors
and careers.

273
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:21,680
Let us condole the knight,

274
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:26,683
for, lambkins,
we will live.

275
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:39,870
The French, advised
by good intelligence...

276
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,200
of this most dreadful
preparation,

277
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:43,741
shake in their fear...

278
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,907
and with pale policy seek
to divert the English purposes.

279
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:53,073
Oh, England, model
to thy inward greatness.

280
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,086
Like a little body
with a mighty heart.

281
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,051
What mightst thou do
that honor would thee do...

282
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,885
were all thy children
kind and natural?

283
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:06,593
But see, thy fault France
hath in thee found out.

284
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:11,228
A nest of hollow bosoms which he
fills with treacherous crowns...

285
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,363
and three corrupted men.

286
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,767
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge,

287
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,535
and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham,

288
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:21,976
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight,
of Northumberland,

289
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,239
have for the gilt of France...
oh, guilt indeed...

290
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:28,476
confirmed conspiracy
with fearful France,

291
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:32,750
and by their hands
this grace of kings must die,

292
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:34,682
ere he take ship for France.

293
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,618
The traitors are agreed.

294
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,797
The king is set from London,

295
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,563
and the scene
is now transported, gentles,

296
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:44,760
to Southhampton.

297
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,616
Before God, his grace is bold
to trust these traitors.

298
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,516
They shall be apprehended
by and by.

299
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:05,282
How smooth and even
they do bear themselves,

300
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:09,283
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

301
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:13,794
The king hath note of all they intend by
interception which they dream not of.

302
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,867
Nay, but the man
that was his bedfellow,

303
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,730
whom he hath dulled and cloyed
with gracious favors...

304
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:21,932
That he should,
for a foreign purse,

305
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,101
so sell his sovereign's life
to death and treachery. [clatter]

306
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,112
Now sits the wind fair,
and we will aboard. [chuckles]

307
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,995
My lord of Cambridge
and my kind lord of Masham...

308
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,495
and you, my gentle knight,
give me your thoughts.

309
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,530
Think you not that
the powers we bear with us...

310
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,367
will cut their passage
through the force of France?

311
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,873
No doubt, my liege, if each man
do his best. I doubt not that.

312
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,711
Never was monarch better feared
and loved than is your majesty.

313
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,008
We therefore have great
cause of thankfulness.

314
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:08,976
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the
man committed yesterday...

315
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,084
that railed against
our person.

316
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:15,520
We consider it was excess of
wine that set him on, [all chuckle]

317
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,455
And on his more advice
we pardon him.

318
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,063
That's mercy,
but too much security.

319
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:25,193
Let him be punished, lest example breed
by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

320
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,167
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

321
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,844
So may your highness,
and yet punish too.

322
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:35,812
Sir, you show great mercy
if you give him life...

323
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:38,007
after the taste
of much correction.

324
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,812
Alas, your too much love
and care of me...

325
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:44,287
are heavy orisons
against this poor wretch.

326
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,750
If little faults proceeding on
distemper shall not be winked at,

327
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:55,898
how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes, chewed,

328
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,525
swallowed and digested,
appear before us?

329
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,436
We'll yet enlarge that man,

330
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,373
though Cambridge,
Scroop and Grey,

331
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:10,036
in their dear care
and tender preservation...

332
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:13,049
of our person
would have him punished.

333
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,413
And now to
our French causes.

334
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,790
Who are the late commissioners?
[Cambridge] I one, my lord.

335
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,054
Your highness bade me
ask for it today. So did you me.

336
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,954
- And I.
- Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.

337
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,665
There yours,
Lord Scroop of Masham,

338
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:32,302
and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.

339
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:33,798
Read them...

340
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,337
and know...

341
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,942
I know your worthiness.

342
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,513
My Lord of Westmoreland,
uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.

343
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,020
Why, how now, gentlemen

344
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:55,723
what see you in those papers
that you lose so much complexion?

345
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:59,653
I do confess my fault and do
submit me to your highness' mercy.

346
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:03,667
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late...

347
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,033
by your own counsel
is suppressed and killed.

348
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:10,273
You must not dare for shame
to talk of mercy!

349
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:15,809
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you.

350
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,845
- [Shouting]
- [All shouting]

351
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:31,990
See you, my princes and my noble
peers, these English monsters.

352
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,363
What shall I say to thee,
Lord Scroop,

353
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,968
thou cruel, ingrateful,

354
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:42,472
savage and inhuman creature?

355
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:45,507
Thou knave thou!

356
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:48,978
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
that knewest the very bottom of my soul,

357
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,073
that almost mightst have
coined me into gold,

358
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,649
which thou have practiced
on me for thy use.

359
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,488
May it be possible
that foreign hire...

360
00:27:56,488 --> 00:28:00,857
could out of thee extract one spark
of evil that might annoy my finger?

361
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,990
'Tis so strange...

362
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:07,258
that though the truth of it stand
off as gross as black and white,

363
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:09,761
my eye will scarcely see it.

364
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:15,066
So... constant and unspotted
didst thou seem...

365
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:19,007
that this thy fall
hath left a kind of blot...

366
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,239
to mark
the full-fraught man...

367
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:26,005
and best indued
with some suspicion.

368
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,247
I will weep for thee.

369
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:38,991
For this revolt of thine, methinks,
is like another fall of man.

370
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:01,215
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.

371
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:07,486
I arrest thee of high treason by the name
of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.

372
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:14,062
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.

373
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,230
Hear your sentence.

374
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,399
You have conspired
against our royal person,

375
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,110
joined with an enemy
proclaimed and from his coffers...

376
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,475
received the golden earnest
of our death wherein.

377
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,809
You would have sold your king
to slaughter,

378
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:34,144
his princes and his peers
to servitude,

379
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,117
his subjects to oppression
and contempt...

380
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,323
and his whole kingdom
into desolation!

381
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:46,291
Get you therefore hence, poor
miserable wretches, to your death,

382
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:50,832
the taste whereof God of his mercy
give you patience to endure...

383
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:55,234
and true repentance
of all your dear offenses.

384
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:58,970
Bear them hence.

385
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:01,505
[Men shouting]

386
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,342
Now, Lords, for France,

387
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,981
the enterprise whereof shall
be to you, as us, like glorious,

388
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,158
since God so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way.

389
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:18,890
Cheerly to sea.

390
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,493
The signs of war advance.

391
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:25,668
No king of England
if not king of France.

392
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,836
[Sighs]

393
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,710
Prithee, honey-sweet husband,
let me bring thee to staines.

394
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:17,683
No, for my manly heart
doth yearn.

395
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:21,723
Bardolph, be blithe.

396
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:26,353
Nym, rouse
thy vaunting veins.

397
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:30,966
Boy, bristle
thy courage up.

398
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,296
For Falstaff is dead,

399
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,401
and we must yearn therefore.

400
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,843
Would I were with him, wheresome'er
he is, either in heaven or in hell.

401
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,310
Nay, sure,
he's not in hell.

402
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:46,247
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever
a man went to Arthur's bosom.

403
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:51,281
He made a finer end and went away
an it had been any Christian child.

404
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,328
He parted even
just between 12:00 and 1:00,

405
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,732
even at the turning of the tide.

406
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,362
For after I saw him
fumble with the sheets...

407
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:11,036
and play with flowers and
smile upon his finger's ends,

408
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:15,105
I knew there was
but one way.

409
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,809
For his nose
was as sharp as a pen,

410
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,114
and he babbled of green fields.

411
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:30,252
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.

412
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:31,794
"What, man?
Be of good cheer."

413
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,663
So he cried out,
"God, God,

414
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,864
God,"

415
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:44,636
Three or four times.

416
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:52,243
Now I, to comfort him, bid him
he should not think of God.

417
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:55,513
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself
with any such thoughts yet.

418
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,418
He bade me put
more clothes on his feet.

419
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:07,029
I put my hand under the bed
and felt them,

420
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,130
and they were as cold
as any stone.

421
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,003
Then I felt to his knees,

422
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:24,573
and so upward... and upward,

423
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:30,988
and all was as...

424
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,982
cold as any stone.

425
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:45,303
They say he cried out for sack.
[Laughs] That he did.

426
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,365
And of women.
No, that he did not.

427
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,897
[Boy]
Yeah, that he did.

428
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,109
He said they were...
devils incarnate.

429
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:54,844
He could never abide carnation.
It was a color he never liked.

430
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:59,074
He said once the devil
would have him about women.

431
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:04,388
Well, he did in some sort...
handle women.

432
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:06,022
[Laughing]

433
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:09,626
But then he was rheumatic and
talked of the whore of Babylon.

434
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:14,124
Do you not remember he saw a flea
stick upon Bardolph's nose?

435
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,592
He said it was a black soul
burning in hell. [chuckling]

436
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:20,867
Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

437
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:23,098
That's all the riches
I got in his service.

438
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:29,578
Whall we shog?

439
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:32,779
The king will be gone
from Southampton.

440
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:50,999
Farewell, hostess.

441
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:54,895
I cannot kiss.

442
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,035
That's the humor of it.

443
00:34:58,009 --> 00:34:59,237
But...

444
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,916
Adieu.

445
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:23,766
Let housewifery appear.

446
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:27,468
[Chuckles]
Keep close.

447
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:32,341
I thee command.

448
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:35,638
[Knocking]

449
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:38,480
Farewell.

450
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:51,993
[Whispers]
Adieu.

451
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,497
[Chorus]
Follow, follow.

452
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:06,271
For who is he whose chin is but
enriched with one appearing hair...

453
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:10,313
that will not follow these
culled and choice-drawn cavaliers...

454
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,449
to France?

455
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:38,405
Thus comes the English...
with full power upon us,

456
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:45,577
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defenses.

457
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,445
Therefore,
the dukes of Berri...

458
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,913
and of Bretagne,

459
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:57,222
of Brabant and of Orleans
shall make forth.

460
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,493
And you, prince Dauphin...

461
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,156
My most redoubted father,

462
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:05,700
it is most meet we arm us
against the foe.

463
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,768
For peace itself
should not so dull a kingdom,

464
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,703
but the defenses, musters,
preparations should be maintained,

465
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,608
assembled and collected,
as were a war in expectation.

466
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:19,144
Therefore, I say 'tis meet
we all go forth to view...

467
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,480
the sick and feeble
parts of France.

468
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,715
And let us do it
with no show of fear!

469
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,225
No, with no more than if we heard
that England were busied with,

470
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:31,453
uh, a Whitsun morris dance.
[Chuckling]

471
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:35,396
For, my good liege, she is so idly
kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow,

472
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,967
humorous youth,
that fear attends her not.

473
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:39,567
O peace, prince dauphin.

474
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,299
You're too much mistaken
in this king.

475
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,705
Question, your grace,
the late ambassadors.

476
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,080
With what great state
he heard their embassy,

477
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,947
how well supplied
with noble counselors,

478
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:56,778
how modest in exception
and withal how terrible...

479
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,853
in constant resolution.

480
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,023
Well, 'tis not so,
my lord high constable.

481
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,195
Though we think it so,
'tis no matter.

482
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,797
In matters of defense, 'tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems.

483
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,671
Think we king Harry strong.

484
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:22,370
And, princes, look you
strongly armed to meet him.

485
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:26,549
For he is bred
out of that bloody strain...

486
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:29,949
that haunted us
in our familiar paths.

487
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,856
Witness our too-much
memorable shame...

488
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:37,553
when cressy battle
fatally was struck...

489
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:42,399
and all our princes captived...

490
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,131
by the hand
of that black name,

491
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:47,734
Edward,

492
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:50,766
black prince of Wales.

493
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:58,575
This is a stem
of that victorious stalk.

494
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,848
And let us fear
the native mightiness...

495
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,487
and fate of him.

496
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:14,529
[Door opens]
[Footsteps approaching]

497
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:29,878
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England,
do crave admittance to your majesty.

498
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,244
Go and bring them.

499
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,256
You see, this chase
is hotly followed, friends.

500
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,897
Good my sovereign,
take up the English short,

501
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,672
and let them know of what a
monarchy you are the head.

502
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:01,201
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile
a sin as self-neglecting.

503
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,574
[Door opens]

504
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,059
From our brother England?

505
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:24,267
From him, and thus
he greets your majesty.

506
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,835
He wills you, in the
name of God almighty,

507
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,640
that you divest yourself
and lay apart...

508
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,870
the borrowed glories
that by gift of heaven,

509
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:36,907
by law of nature
and of nations,

510
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,641
belongs to him
and to his heirs.

511
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:43,344
Namely, the crown.

512
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,720
Willing you overlook
this pedigree.

513
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,893
And when you find him
evenly derived...

514
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:55,261
from his most famed of famous
ancestors, Edward the III,

515
00:40:55,399 --> 00:41:01,167
he bids you then resign your crown
and kingdom, indirectly held from him,

516
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:04,035
the native and true challenger.

517
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:06,937
Or else what follows?

518
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,876
Bloody constraint.

519
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:15,445
For if you hide the crown,
even in your hearts,

520
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,052
there will he rake for it.

521
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,751
Therefore, in fierce
tempest is he coming,

522
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,951
in thunder and in earthquake,
like a Jove,

523
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,660
that if requiring fail,
he will compel.

524
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:34,503
This is his claim,
his threatening and my message.

525
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:38,840
Unless the Dauphin
be in presence here,

526
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,376
to whom expressly
I bring greeting to.

527
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,713
For the Dauphin,

528
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,940
I stand here for him.

529
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,616
What to him from England?

530
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:58,521
Scorn and defiance,

531
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:02,026
slight regard, contempt...

532
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:06,200
and anything that might not
misbecome the mighty sender,

533
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,735
doth he prize you at.

534
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,597
Thus says my king.

535
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:16,446
Say, if my father render a fair
return, it is against my will,

536
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,606
for I desire nothing
but odds with England.

537
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:22,750
And to that end, as matching
to his youth and vanity,

538
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:25,478
I did present him
with the Paris balls!

539
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,555
He'll make your Paris Louvre
shake for it.

540
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,621
And be assured
you'll find a difference,

541
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:35,188
as we, his subjects,
have in wonder found,

542
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,897
between the promise of his greener
days and these he masters now.

543
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:42,437
Tomorrow...

544
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,032
Shall you know
our mind at full.

545
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,386
[Chorus] Thus with imagined wing
our swift scene flies,

546
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,015
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought! [explosion]

547
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:05,253
Work, work your thoughts, and
in them see a siege! [men shouting]

548
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,020
Behold the ordinance
on their carriages,

549
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,929
with fatal mouths gaping
on girded harflew.

550
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,904
Suppose the ambassador
from the French comes back,

551
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,599
tells Harry that the king does
offer him Katherine, his daughter,

552
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:19,505
and with her to dowry, some
petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

553
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:21,544
The offer likes him not.

554
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,772
And the nimble gunner with linstock
now the devilish cannon touches,

555
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,908
and down goes all before them!

556
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,785
[Explosion]
[Shouting continues]

557
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:41,487
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!

558
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:45,828
Once more, or close the wall up
with our English dead!

559
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:47,768
[Explosion]

560
00:43:56,781 --> 00:44:00,376
In peace there's nothing so becomes a
man as modest stillness and humility.

561
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:02,848
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears,

562
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:04,682
then imitate the action
of the tiger!

563
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,122
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood,

564
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,824
disguise fair nature
with hard-favored rage.

565
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,053
Then lend the eye
a terrible aspect.

566
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,859
Let it pry through the portage of
the head like the brass cannon.

567
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,093
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as
fearfully as doth a galled rock...

568
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,403
o'erhang and jetty
his confounded base,

569
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:22,698
swilled with the wild
and wasteful ocean.

570
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,105
Now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide,

571
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:31,306
hold hard the breath and bend up
every spirit to his full height!

572
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:34,876
On, on, you noblest England!

573
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:36,811
[Explosion]

574
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:44,050
Now attest that those whom you
called fathers did beget you.

575
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:47,795
And you, good yeoman, whose
limbs were made in England,

576
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:49,627
show us here the mettle
of your pasture.

577
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,133
Let us swear that you are worth
your breeding, which I doubt not!

578
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:58,965
For there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble luster in your eyes!

579
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,342
I see you stand like greyhounds in
the slips, straining upon the start.

580
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:06,143
The game's afoot!
Follow your spirit,

581
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:10,044
and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,

582
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:14,049
England and Saint George!"

583
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,021
[All] God for harry,
England and Saint George!

584
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,961
[All shouting]

585
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,795
[Shouts of
encouragement]

586
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:33,874
Up to the breach,
you dogs!

587
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,241
Avaunt, you cullions!

588
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,118
[Panting]

589
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,920
Captain Fluellen, you must
come presently to the mines.

590
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:53,153
The duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

591
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,228
Tell the duke it is not so good
to come to the mines.

592
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,836
For look you, the mines is not
according to the disciplines of war.

593
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:03,707
By Cheshu, I think he will
blow up all,

594
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:06,035
if there is not
better direction. [explosion]

595
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:09,237
The duke of Gloucester,
to whom the order...

596
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:13,042
of the siege is given, is altogether
directed by an Irishman.

597
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,718
[Trumpet blowing]
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?

598
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:20,185
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.

599
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:22,515
[Chuckles]
He has no more directions...

600
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:25,957
in the true disciplines of the
wars than is a puppy dog.

601
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,330
Here he comes, and the Scots
captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

602
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:34,229
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvelous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain.

603
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:38,799
I say... good day,
Captain Fluellen.

604
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:41,034
Good day to your worship,
good Captain James.

605
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:44,376
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines? By Christ, la.

606
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:46,479
The workish give over.

607
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:48,151
The trumpets
sound the retreat.

608
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:50,377
By my hand,
'tis ill done.

609
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,688
Captain Macmorris,
I beseech you now,

610
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:57,189
a few disputations as partly
touching the disciplines of the war,

611
00:46:57,394 --> 00:46:59,624
partly to satisfy
my opinion...

612
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:02,188
and partly for
the satisfaction of my mind,

613
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:05,330
as touching the direction
of the military discipline.

614
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,638
That is the point. It is no time
to discourse, so Christ save me.

615
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:10,970
The town is besieged, and the
trumpet calls us to the breach.

616
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,234
We talk, and, by Christ,
do nothing.

617
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:16,544
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine
take themselves to slumber,

618
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:20,348
I'll do good service, or I'll
lie in the ground for it.

619
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:23,047
Captain Macmorris,
I think, look you,

620
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,754
under your correction, there
are not many of your nation.

621
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,852
[Explosion]
What is my nation?

622
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,791
Who talks of my nation
is a villain...

623
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:35,057
and a bastard and a knave
and a rascal?

624
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:39,997
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise
than it is meant, Captain Macmorris,

625
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,163
peradventure I shall think
you do not use me...

626
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:46,972
with that affability as in discretion
you ought to use me, now look you,

627
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:49,909
being as good
a man as yourself.

628
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:52,839
I do not know you
so good a man as myself.

629
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:56,252
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!

630
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:02,450
[Shouts]
[Rumbling]

631
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,066
[Men shouting]

632
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,900
[Explosion]

633
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:26,375
How yet resolves
the governor of the town?

634
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:30,353
This is the latest parle
we will admit.

635
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:34,251
Therefore, to our best mercy
give yourselves,

636
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:37,952
or, like to men proud of
destruction, defy us to our worst.

637
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:42,256
For as I am a soldier, if I
begin the battery once again,

638
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,461
I will not leave
the half-achieved Harflew...

639
00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:47,430
till in her ashes
she lie buried.

640
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:50,731
Therefore,
you men of Harflew,

641
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:53,835
take pity of your town
and of your people...

642
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:56,980
whiles yet my soldiers
are in my command,

643
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,784
whiles yet the cool
and temperate wind of grace...

644
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:04,647
o'erblows the filthy
and contagious clouds...

645
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:09,421
of heady murder,
spoil and villainy!

646
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:14,960
If not, why, in a moment
look to see...

647
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,999
the blind and bloody
soldier with foul hand...

648
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:22,773
defile the locks of your shrill,
shrieking daughters,

649
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:25,298
your fathers taken
by their silvered beards...

650
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:27,808
and their most reverend heads
dashed to the walls,

651
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:31,770
your naked infants
spitted upon pikes...

652
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:36,648
whiles the mad mothers
with their howls confused...

653
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,378
do break the clouds!

654
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,014
What say you?

655
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:46,025
Will you yield and this avoid?

656
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,789
Or, guilty in defense,

657
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,398
be thus destroyed?

658
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:56,998
The Dauphin, of whose
succor we entreated,

659
00:49:57,207 --> 00:50:02,474
returns us that his powers are not
yet ready to raise so great a siege.

660
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,272
Therefore, dread king,

661
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:11,487
enter our gates,
dispose of us and ours,

662
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:16,751
for we no longer
are defensible.

663
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:20,892
[Sighs]

664
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,483
Go you and enter Harflew.

665
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:52,093
There remain and fortify it
strongly against the French.

666
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:56,057
Use... mercy to them all.

667
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:02,735
For us, dear uncle,
the winter coming on...

668
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:05,701
and sickness growing
upon our soldiers,

669
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,969
we will retire to Calais.

670
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:15,443
Tonight... in Harflew
will we be your guest.

671
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,213
Tomorrow... for the march
are we addressed.

672
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,671

[Sighs]

675
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:59,458
Alice,
tu as ete en angleterre,

676
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:01,587
et tu parles bien le langage.

677
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:03,957
Un peu, madame.

678
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:06,560
Je te prie, m'enseignez.

679
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:09,864
Il faut que j'apprenne
a parler.

680
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:13,275
Comment appelez-vous
la main en anglais?

681
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,440
La main?
Elle est appelee"de" hand.

682
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:20,408
"De hand."
Mm-hmm.

683
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,079
Et les doigts?

684
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:26,315
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.

685
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,685
Mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?

686
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:32,450
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles
"de fingres."

687
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:38,901
Le main, de hand.
Le doigts, de fingres.

688
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:40,834
Mm-hmm.

689
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,705
Je pense que je suis
le bon ecolier.

690
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:45,739
J'ai gagne deux mots
d'anglais vitement. [mutters]

691
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:49,237
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
Les ongles?

692
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:51,007
Nous les appelons
de nails.

693
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,908
"De nails."

694
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,646
Ecoutez, dites-moi
si je parle bien.

695
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:04,020
De hand, de fingres
etde nails.

696
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:07,189
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais. [laughs]

697
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:10,260
Dites-moi I'anglais
pour le bras.

698
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:12,726
De arm, madame.
Et le coude?

De tous les mots que vous
m'avez appris des a present.

703
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,181
Il est trop difficile,
madame, comme je pense.

704
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,344
Excusez-moi, Alice,
ecoutez: De hand, de fingres,

705

de nails, de "arma,"

O, seigneur dieu,

707
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,761
Comment appelez-vous

708
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:41,692

Le menton, de chin.

714

Oui, sauf votre honneur,

vous prononcez les mots aussi
droit que les natifs d'angleterre.

716

Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la
grace de dieu, et en peu de temps.

717

N'avez-vous pas deja oublie
ce que je vous ai enseigne?

718

Non, je reciterai

'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.

You have power enough.

Rouen bring him our prisoner.

shall see our army,

he'll drop his heart
into the sink of fear...

offer us his ransom.

haste on montjoy.

you shall stay with us in Rouen.

shall remain with us!

horse whinnies] [man shouts]

776
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:20,494
Come. Come in.

777
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,770
Captain Fluellen?

778
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,544
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?

779
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:35,050
De is not...
God be praised and blessed...

780
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:39,913
any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline.

781
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:45,919
Captain! I thee beseech
to do me favors.

782
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,122
The duke of Exeter
doth love thee well.

783
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,759
Aye, I praise God, and I have
merited some love at his hands.

784
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:58,139
Bardolph, a soldier firm
and sound of heart...

785
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:00,434
and buxom valor,

786
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:06,444
hath by cruel fate and giddy
fortune's furious, fickle wheel...

787
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,414
Touching your patience,
Ancient Pistol,

788
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,780
fortune is an excellent moral.

789
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:17,187
Fortune is Bardolph's foe
and frowns on him...

790
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,792
for he hath stolen a pax
and hanged must he be.

791
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:24,325
Therefore, go speak.

792
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:27,762
The duke will hear thy voice.

793
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:32,606
Speak, captain, for his life,

794
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:35,477
and I will thee requite.

795
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:39,979
Ancient Pistol, I do partly
understand your meaning.

796
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:43,514
Why, then,
rejoice therefore!

797
01:00:44,821 --> 01:00:47,153
'Tis not a thing
to rejoice at.

798
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:51,486
Look you, if he
were my brother,

799
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,321
I would desire the duke
to do his good pleasure...

800
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:56,658
and put him to execution.

801
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:00,025
[Fluellen]
Discipline ought to be used.

802
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:04,533
Then die and be damned...

803
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:08,808
and figo for thy friendship!

804
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:26,318
How now, Fluellen,
comest thou from the bridge?

805
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,492
Aye, so please your majesty.

806
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:32,126
The duke of Exeter hath very
gallantly maintained the bridge.

807
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:35,798
What men have you lost?

808
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:38,530
I think the duke
hath lost never a man...

809
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:46,538
but one that is like to be
executed for robbing a church.

810
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:51,745
One Bardolph, if
your majesty know the man.

811
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:56,425
[Fluellen] His face is all bubukles and
whelks and knobs and flames of fire.

812
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,518
His lips blows at his nose.

813
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:02,392
[Fluellen] 'tis like a coal of fire...
sometimes blue, sometimes red.

814
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:07,996
But his nose is executed
and his fire's out.

815
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,040
Get up!

816
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:26,682
[Thunder rumbling]

817
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,324

01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:46,970
- Oh!

820
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,942

[Laughing]

823
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,488
Do not, when thou art king,
hang a thief.

824
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,592
No,

825
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:15,000
thou shalt.

826
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,143
[Thunder rumbling]

827
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,174
We would have all such offenders
so cut off.

828
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:57,503
We give express charge
that in our marches...

829
01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:01,241
through the country there be nothing
compelled from the villages,

830
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:04,685
nothing taken but paid for,

831
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:10,782
none of the French upbraided
or abused in disdainful language.

832
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:15,994
For when lenity and cruelty
play for a kingdom,

833
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:23,063
the gentler gamester
is the soonest winner.

834
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:51,557
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,

835
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,793
"though we seemed dead,
we did but sleep.

836
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,438
"Tell him we could have
rebuked him at Harflew.

837
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,403
"Now we speak,
and our voice is imperial.

838
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:03,411
"England shall
repent his folly.

839
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:05,737
"Bid him, therefore,
consider of his ransom...

840
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:08,250
"which must proportion
the losses we have borne...

841
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:12,013
"which in weight to re-answer
his pettiness would bow under.

842
01:05:12,222 --> 01:05:16,454
"To this add defiance,
and tell him, for conclusion,

843
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:18,718
"he hath betrayed
his followers...

844
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,752
whose condemnation
is pronounced."

845
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:25,856
So far my king and master,
so much my office.

846
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:30,301
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.

847
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,370
Thou dost thy office fairly.

848
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:38,838
Turn thee back, and tell
thy king I do not seek him now,

849
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:41,883
but could be willing to march on
to Calais without impeachment.

850
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:45,347
Go, therefore,
tell thy master here I am.

851
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:49,148
My ransom is this
frail and worthless trunk,

852
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:52,859
my army but a weak
and sickly guard.

853
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,929
Yet, God before,
tell him we will come on,

854
01:05:56,332 --> 01:06:00,234
though France himself and such
another neighbor stand in our way.

855
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,067
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

856
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,770
The sum of all our answer
is but this:

857
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:09,177
We would not seek
a battle as we are,

858
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,813
nor, as we are,
we say we will not shun it.

859
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:18,911
So tell your master.

860
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,914
I shall deliver so.

861
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,054
Thanks to your majesty.

862
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,810
I hope they will not
come upon us now.

863
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:50,285
We are in god's hand, brother,
not in theirs.

[Thunderclap]

865
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:07,733
March to the bridge.

866
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:09,862
It now draws towards night.

867
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,903
Beyond the river
we'll encamp ourselves...

868
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:15,004
and on tomorrow...

869
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:21,580
bid them march away.

870
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:18,973
Now entertain
conjecture of a time...

871
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:22,077
when creeping murmur
and the poring dark...

872
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:25,339
fills the wide vessel
of the universe.

873

From camp to camp through
the foul womb of night...

874
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:33,455
the hum of either army
stilly sounds...

875
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:37,090
that the fixed sentinels
almost receive...

876
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:39,023
the secret whispers
of each other's watch.

877
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:41,821
Fire answers fire,

878
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:43,999
and through their paly flames,

879
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,791
each battle sees
the other's umbered face.

880
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:49,930
Steed threatens steed
in high and boastful neighs,

881
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,966
piercing the night's dull ear.

882
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:54,371
And from the tents,

883
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,942
the armorers,
accomplishing the knights,

884
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:03,045
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation.

885
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,986
Proud of their numbers
and secure in soul,

886
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,549
the confident
and over-lusty French...

887
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:12,059
do the low-rated English
play at dice...

888
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:16,061
and chide the cripple,
tardy-gaited night...

889
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:21,362
who, like a foul and ugly witch,
doth limp so tediously away.

My lord of Orleans
and my lord High Constable,

898
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:05,376
you talk of horse and armor?

899
01:10:06,549 --> 01:10:08,779
You are as well provided of both
as any prince in the world.

900
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,249
I will not change my horse...

for any that treads
but on four hooves.

When I bestride him,
I soar.

I am a hawk, and he is
pure air and fire!

The dull elements of earth
and water never appear in him,

905
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:32,173
but only impatient stillness
while his rider mounts him.

906
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:37,141
Indeed, my lord, it is a most
absolute and excellent horse.

[Chattering continues]

My lord constable,
the armor in your tent tonight...

01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:45,684
Are those suns
or stars on it?

910
01:10:45,988 --> 01:10:48,354
Stars, Montjoy.

911
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:51,058
Some of them will
fall tomorrow, I hope.

912
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:53,262
And yet my sky
shall not want.

913

Will it never be day?

914
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:04,764
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

915
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,903
and my way shall be paved
with English faces.

916
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:13,275
I will not say so, for fear I
should be faced out of my way.

917
01:11:22,124 --> 01:11:23,716
I'll go arm myself.

He longs to eat the English.

I think he will eat
all he kills.

922

He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.

the dawning as we do.

they would run away.

01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:25,018
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall
have each a hundred Englishmen.

933
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,590
The poor, condemned English,

934
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,531
like sacrifices,

935
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,597
by their watchful fires
sit patiently...

936
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:44,705
and inly ruminate
the morning's danger.

937
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,313
[Chorus]
And their gesture sad,

938
01:12:57,553 --> 01:13:01,614
investing lank, lean cheeks
and war-worn coats,

939
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,885
presenteth them
unto the gazing moon...

940
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:09,053
so many horrid ghosts.

941
01:13:09,498 --> 01:13:11,466
## [Flute]

942
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,565
Ahh.

943
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,152
[Laughing]

944
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,264
Oh, now,

945
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:48,632
who will behold the royal
captain of this ruined band,

946
01:13:50,005 --> 01:13:53,133
walking from watch to watch,
from tent to tent?

947
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:58,244
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"

948
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:03,344
For forth he goes
and visits all his host.

949
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:06,787
Bids them good morrow
with a modest smile...

950
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:11,786
and calls them "Brothers,
friends and countrymen."

951
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:15,924
A largesse universal,
like the sun...

952
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:19,093
his liberal eye
doth give to everyone,

953
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:21,998
thawing cold fear...

954
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:25,100
that mean and gentle all...

955
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,839
behold, as may
unworthiness define,

956
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:32,278
a little touch of Harry
in the night.

957
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:36,212
Good morrow, old
sir Thomas Erpingham.

958
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:40,279
A good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of France.

959
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:44,389
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better...

960
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:48,290
since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."

961
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:51,861
[Chuckles]
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

962
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,460
Brothers both, commend me
to the princes in our camp.

963
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:59,607
Do my good morrow to them, and
anon desire them all to my pavilion.

964
01:15:00,342 --> 01:15:01,502
We shall, my liege.

965
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:08,847
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.

966
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:12,410
I and my bosom
must debate a while,

967
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:15,450
and then I would
no other company.

968
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,719
The lord in heaven
bless thee, noble Harry.

969
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,064
God have mercy, old heart.

970
01:15:29,538 --> 01:15:31,335
Thou speakest cheerfully.

971
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,274
[Clears throat]
Qui va la?

972
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:46,444
A friend.

973
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:48,822
Discuss unto me.

974
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:51,693
Art thou officer...

975
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:55,359
or art thou base,
common and popular?

976
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:58,462
I am a gentleman of a company.

977
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:02,599
Trailest thou
the puissant pike? Even so.

978
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:07,540
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

979
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,101
Ah, then you are a better
than the king.

980
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:16,440
The king's a bawcock
and a heart of gold,

981
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,088
a lad of life,
an imp of fame,

982
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,825
of parents good,
of fist most valiant.

983
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:28,158
I kiss his dirty shoe,

984
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:32,696
and from heartstring,
I love the lovely bully.

985
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:39,333
What is thy name?

986
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:43,069
Uh, Harry Le Roy.
Le Roy?

987
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,670
A... a Cornish name?

988
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:47,977
No, I am a Welshman.

989
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:53,051
Knowest thou Fluellen?
Aye.

990
01:16:53,956 --> 01:16:58,017
Tell him I'll knock his leek about
his pate upon Saint Davy's day.

991
01:16:58,894 --> 01:17:02,159
Do not wear your dagger in your cap
that day, lest he knock that about yours.

992
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:05,626
Art thou his friend?

993
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:07,429
And his kinsman too.

994
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:10,764
The figo with thee then.
I thank you.

995
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:12,633
God be with you.

996
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:15,769
My name is Pistol called.

997
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:18,580
It sorts well
with your fierceness.

998
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:27,645
Captain Fluellen.
Shh!

999
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,155
In the name of Jesus Christ,
speak lower.

1000
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:42,733
If you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the great,

1001
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:48,535
you shall find that there is no Tiddle
Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.

1002
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,612
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.

1003
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,681
If the enemy is an ass and
a fool and a prating coxcomb,

1004
01:17:57,086 --> 01:17:59,247
is it meet that we should
also be an ass...

1005
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:03,151
and a fool and a prating coxcomb
in your conscience now?

1006
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,119
[Whispers]
I will speak lower.

1007
01:18:08,163 --> 01:18:10,256
I pray you and beseech you
that you will.

1008
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:20,604
[Man murmuring]

1009
01:18:22,444 --> 01:18:24,810
[Speaking in
foreign language]

1010
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:34,522
[Foreign language continues]

1011
01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:40,828
Brother John Bates,

1012
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:44,765
Is not that the morning
which breaks yonder?

1013
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:46,696
I think it be,

1014
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:50,833
but we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

1015
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:54,171
We see yonder
the beginning of the day,

1016
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,413
but I think we shall
never see the end of it.

1017
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:00,311
[Twig snaps]

1018
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:05,816
Who goes there?
A friend.

1019
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:08,322
Under what captain serve ya?

1020
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,419
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

1021
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:21,069
A good old commander
and a most kind gentleman.

1022
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:26,006
I pray ya, what thinks he
of our estate?

1023
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:29,471
Even as men
wrecked upon a sand...

1024
01:19:30,446 --> 01:19:32,641
that look to be washed off
with the next tide.

1025
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,744
He hath not told
his thought to the king?

1026
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:38,847
No, nor it is not
meet he should.

1027
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,248
I think the king
is but a man as I am.

1028
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:45,592
The violet smells to him
as it doth to me.

1029
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:48,358
His ceremonies laid by,

1030
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:50,762
in his nakedness
he appears but a man.

1031
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:54,233
Therefore, when he sees
reason to fear, as we do,

1032
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:57,496
his fears, out of doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are.

1033
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:59,664
He may show what
outward courage he will,

1034
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,500
but I believe as
cold a night as 'tis...

1035
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:05,179
that he could wish himself
in Thames up to the neck.

1036
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:09,074
[Bates] And so I would he were,
and I by him.

1037
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,612
At all adventures,
so we were quit here.

1038
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:16,922
I think he would not wish himself
anywhere but where he is.

1039
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,255
Then I would
he were here alone.

1040
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:24,831
Methinks I could not die
anywhere so contented...

1041
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:26,828
as in the king's company,

1042
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:31,036
his cause being just
and his quarrel honorable.

1043
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:34,206
That's more than we know.

1044
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:36,205
Aye, and more than
we should seek after.

1045
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,840
We know enough if we know
we are the king's subject.

1046
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:42,714
If his cause be wrong,
our obedience to the king...

1047
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:44,750
wipes the crime of it
out of us.

1048
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:49,881
But if the cause be not good,

1049
01:20:50,526 --> 01:20:53,393
the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make.

1050
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:57,061
And all those legs
and arms and heads...

1051
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:58,699
chopped off in the battle...

1052
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:02,131
will join together at
the latter day and cry all,

1053
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,801
"we died at such a place."

1054
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:11,068
Some swearing,
some crying for a surgeon,

1055
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:15,206
some upon their wives
left poor behind them,

1056
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:17,845
some upon the debts they owe,

1057
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:20,846
some upon their children
rawly left.

1058
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,264
I'm afeared
there are few die well...

1059
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:31,527
that die in a battle...

1060
01:21:32,134 --> 01:21:35,704
for how can they charitably
dispose of anything...

1061
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:38,138
when blood is their argument?

1062
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:43,210
Now if these men
do not die well,

1063
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,139
it will be a black matter for
the king that led them to it.

1064
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:53,254
So if a son that is by his father
sent about merchandise...

1065
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:55,481
do sinfully miscarry
upon the sea,

1066
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,188
the imputation of
his wickedness, by your rule,

1067
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,894
should be imposed upon
the father that sent him?

1068
01:22:01,897 --> 01:22:03,262
But this is not so.

1069
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:07,262
The king is not bound to answer the
particular endings of his soldiers...

1070
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:09,434
nor the father of his son,

1071
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,299
for they purpose not their deaths
when they purpose their services.

1072
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:19,278
Besides, there is no king,
be his cause never so spotless,

1073
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:23,848
can try it out with
all unspotted soldiers.

1074
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,285
Every subject's duty
is the king's,

1075
01:22:29,057 --> 01:22:33,426
but every subject's soul
is his own.

1076
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:42,770
'Tis certain.

1077
01:22:43,772 --> 01:22:46,866
Eevery man that dies ill,
the ill upon his own head.

1078
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:49,801
The king is not to answer it.

1079
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,508
I do not desire
he should answer for me.

1080
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:55,913
Yet I determine
to fight lustily for him.

1081
01:22:57,919 --> 01:23:00,012
I myself heard the king say
he would not be ransomed.

1082
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:03,324
Aye, he said so
to make us fight cheerfully.

1083
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:07,091
But when our throats are cut, he may
be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.

1084
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:10,862
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.

1085
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:12,856
You pay him then!

1086
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:19,200
You'll never trust
his word after?

1087
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:23,342
Come. 'tis a foolish saying.

1088
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:25,907
Your reproof
is something too round.

1089
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,641
I should be angry with you
if time were convenient.

1090
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,082
Let it be a quarrel between us,
if you live!

1091
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,753
Be friends,
you English fools! Be friends!

1092
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,255
We have French quarrels enough!

1093
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,707
Upon the king.

1094
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:03,851
Let us our lives,
our souls, our debts,

1095
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:07,451
our careful wives,
our children...

1096
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:11,051
and our sins lay on the king.

1097
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:14,257
We must bear all.

1098
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:18,262
Oh, hard condition.

1099
01:24:19,868 --> 01:24:21,426
Twin-born with greatness,

1100
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:24,871
subject to the breath
of every fool.

1101
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:29,108
What infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect...

1102
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,072
that private men enjoy?

1103
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:35,483
And what have kings
that privates have not too...

1104
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:38,214
save ceremony?

1105
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:42,187
And what art thou,
thou idle ceremony?

1106
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:47,922
What drinks thou oft instead of
homage sweet but poison flattery?

1107
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:52,763
Oh, be sick, great greatness,
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

1108
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:57,104
Canst thou, when thou
commandest the beggar's knee,

1109
01:24:57,672 --> 01:24:59,333
command the health of it?

1110
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:11,248
No, thou proud dream,

1111
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:16,556
that playest so subtly
with a king's repose.

1112
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:20,556
I am a king that find thee,

1113
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,487
and I know...

1114
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:29,570
'tis not the balm,
the scepter and the ball,

1115
01:25:30,472 --> 01:25:33,441
the sword, the mace,
the crown imperial,

1116
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:37,010
the intertissued robe
of gold and pearl,

1117
01:25:37,879 --> 01:25:40,404
the farced title
running fore the king,

1118
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:43,647
the throne he sits on...

1119
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:46,478
nor the tide of pomp...

1120
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:49,516
that beats upon the high shore
of this world.

1121
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:54,260
No, not all these,
thrice-gorgeous ceremony,

1122
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:58,528
not all these,
laid in bed majestical,

1123
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:02,294
can sleep so soundly...

1124
01:26:03,472 --> 01:26:05,372
as the wretched slave,

1125
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:10,076
Who, with a body filled and
vacant mind, gets him to rest,

1126
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:13,374
crammed with
distressful bread,

1127
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:16,381
never sees horrid night,
the child of hell,

1128
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:18,616
but like a lackey,
from the rise to the set...

1129
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:20,750
sweats in the eye
of Phoebus...

1130
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:24,324
and all night sleeps...

1131
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:26,286
in Elysium.

1132
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:30,724
Next day after dawn, doth rise
and help Hyperion to his horse...

1133
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:34,097
and follows so
the ever-running year...

1134
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,329
with profitable labor
to his grave.

1135
01:26:37,405 --> 01:26:41,432
And but for ceremony...

1136
01:26:43,778 --> 01:26:45,268
such a wretch,

1137
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:47,906
winding up days of toil...

1138
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,577
and nights with sleep...

1139
01:26:53,154 --> 01:26:56,055
had the forehand
and vantage...

1140
01:26:59,294 --> 01:27:00,556
of a king.

1141
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:08,093
My lord, your nobles,
jealous of your absence,

1142
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:10,363
seek through the camp
to find you.

1143
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:14,605
Good old knight,

1144
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,677
Collect them all together
at my tent.

1145
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,680
I'll be before thee.

1146
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,550
O God of battles,
steel my soldiers' hearts.

1147
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:30,584
Possess them not with fear.

1148
01:27:30,926 --> 01:27:32,985
Take from them now
their sense of reckoning...

1149
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:35,662
if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them.

1150
01:27:36,264 --> 01:27:39,131
Not today, o God,
oh, not today.

1151
01:27:40,268 --> 01:27:43,294
Think not upon the fault my
father made encompassing the crown.

1152
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:46,069
I Richard's body
have interred new...

1153
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:48,766
and on it have bestowed
more contrite tears...

1154
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:51,174
than from it issued
forced drops of blood.

1155
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:54,344
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay...

1156
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,177
who twice a day
their withered hands...

1157
01:27:56,351 --> 01:27:58,546
hold up toward heaven
to pardon blood.

1158
01:27:58,787 --> 01:28:01,381
And I have built
two chantries...

1159
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:05,115
where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for Richard's soul.

1160
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:07,356
More will I do...

1161
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:10,957
though all that I can do...

1162
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:13,766
is nothing worth...

1163
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:17,367
since my penitence comes,
after all,

1164
01:28:18,306 --> 01:28:21,104
imploring pardon.

1165
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:26,439
[Man] My liege!
My brother Gloucester's voice.

1166
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:29,782
I know thy errand.

1167
01:28:31,152 --> 01:28:33,120
I will go with thee.

1168
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:38,557
The day, my friends,

1169
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:42,793
and all things...

1170
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:45,163
stay...

1171
01:28:46,735 --> 01:28:48,066
for me.

1172
01:28:59,914 --> 01:29:01,506
[Drums beating]

1173
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:12,290
Hark how our steeds
for present service neigh.

1174
01:29:13,495 --> 01:29:16,396
Mount them and make incision
in their hides...

1175
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:19,362
that their hot blood
may spin in English eyes.

1176
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:23,270
Do but behold
yon poor and starved band.

1177
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:26,697
Your fair show shall
suck away their souls,

1178
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:29,306
leaving them but
the shales and husks of men.

1179
01:29:30,345 --> 01:29:32,472
There is not work enough
for all our hands.

1180
01:29:33,348 --> 01:29:35,282
Why do you stay so long,
my lords of france?

1181
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:39,712
Yon island carrions, desperate of their
bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.

1182
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:43,614
They have said their prayers,
and they stay for death.

1183
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:49,321
A very little little let us do,
and all is done.

1184
01:29:50,532 --> 01:29:53,865
Then let the trumpets sound the
tucket sonance and the note to mount...

1185
01:29:54,769 --> 01:29:57,533
for our approach will
so much dare the field...

1186
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:02,339
that England shall crouch down
in fear... and yield!

1187
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:10,546
[Chattering]
