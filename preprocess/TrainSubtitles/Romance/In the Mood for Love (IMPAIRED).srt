[baby crying]

2
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,329
- I know it's hard...

3
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,891
but you can't just leave him
in the hospital.

4
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,962
Why don't Fred and I keep him

5
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,066
just until
you get back on your feet?

6
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,410
- Yeah.

7
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,180

[snoring]

00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,148
- Flower?

10
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,312
Flower?

11
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,826
- What do you want?

12
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,126
- Did you buy
any chocolate milk?

13
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,574
- Did you see any in the fridge?

14
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,810
- No.

15
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,746
- Well, if I had bought some,
it would be in the fridge, right?

16
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,282
- Yeah.

17
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,924
There was a fox
at the foot of my bed last night.

18
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,292
- It was just a dream.

19
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,288
Down, down, down.

20
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,659
Yeah.

21
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,974
- Flower?

22
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,300
Flower?

23
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,846
Hey.

24
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,243
'Morning, Garnet.

25
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,513
'Morning, Flower.

26
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,111
- Did you stay all night?

27
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,621
- Yeah. I slept on the couch.

28
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,128
My head feels like a jackhammer's
been at it all night.

29
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,198
So I guess your father's
still sleeping.

30
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,670
Well, I guess I'll go home.
Um...

31
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,508
Yeah.

32
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,414
Hey, can I take
a little shampoo?

33
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,883
- Sure.

34
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,616
- I'll just put it in here
and I'll bring it back later.

35
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,385
- Okay.

36
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,919
- So I'll see you later.
See you, guys.

37
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,927
- See you.

38
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,226
Go away, Garnet.

39
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,663
I want to go back to sleep.

40
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,289
Garnet...

41
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,753
Go.

42
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,635
- Hey, Garnet.

43
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,702
Hey, look, I only took...
well, I took a little,

44
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,575
but I put the conditioner
in here as well,

45
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,114
so I only need one glass.

46
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,178
All right,
well, I'll see you later.

47
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,270
- What you doing, Garnet?

48
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,364
- Nothing.

49
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,602
- Looks to me
like you're eating dirt.

50
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,376
Well, if you're going to lay around
in back alleys all day,

51
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,143
just make sure
you don't get run over.

52
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,979
- Okay.

53
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,350
- Okay, then.

54
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,452
- Is grape your favourite?

55
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,546
- Mm-mm.

56
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,454
- My favourite's black cherry.

57
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,288
- Yeah, black cherry's good.

58
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,328
I'd have to say
it's my favourite, too.

59
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,990
- Really?

60
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,556
- Well, any kind of cherry.

61
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,198
- Anyway, I better go.

62
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,436
- You gonna come around
and see me again?

63
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,808
- Do you want me to?

64
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,847
- Of course.

65
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,781
Or maybe
I'll visit you sometime.

66
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:37,050
- Well, I guess you could
if you want, sometime.

67
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,088
Okay, bye.

68
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,536
- Hi, Garnet.

69
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,420
Your dad got a new mattress.

70
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
[beeping]

71
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,966
- Anything under five.

72
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,194
That's all you got.

73
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,760
You only play one card.

74
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,807
- Okay, I got a three.

75
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,810
- Play it.
- Okay.

76
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,743
- Maybe you should pass.

77
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,280
- No, I can play.

78
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,779
- And so how'd you lose
your licence?

79
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,945
- Drinking
under the influence of alcohol.

80
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,417
The suspension
is totally unfair.

81
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,957
You know,

82
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,822
they should measure out
how far you drive,

83
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,330
and I only drove two blocks,
so it's totally unfair.

84
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,126
[laughter]

85
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,834
- For nothing.

86
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,770
- Seven for nothing.

87
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,138
[laughter]

88
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,042
- Moths flying around
a street light?

89
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,581
- No.

90
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,949
- Stars?

91
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,715
- Yeah.

92
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,950
- I thought they were bugs.

93
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,423
- No.

94
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,652
- Birds?

95
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,027
- No.

96
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,132
- Erase it and start over.

97
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,242
The moon?

98
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,777
- No.

99
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,984
- Is it heaven?

100
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,451
[vehicle passing]

101
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,353
Who was that?

102
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,230
- I don't know.

103
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,239
[metal clattering]

[lullaby playing]

107
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,542
- What're you doing?

108
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,147
- Nothing.

109
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,624
Want some waffles?

110
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,296
- Not right now.

111
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,863
- Mr. Hansen threw these worms

112
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,873
into the back alley.

113
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,909
A car was gonna
run over them.

114
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,173
- Those worms are dead.
They need dirt to live.

115
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,681
Just dump those outside.

116
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,229

[television playing]

118

- Well, I'm gonna get going.

119
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,414
- I'll walk you to your car.

120
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,507
- Dad kissed Barb.

121
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,601
- You shouldn't spy on people.

122
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,814
Did you take something
from my room today?

123
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,657
- No.

124
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,255
- You better not
be taking things from my room.

125
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,700
- I didn't.

126
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,967
- In fact, don't even go
in my room when I'm not there.

127
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,304
- I don't.

128
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,900
- You better not be.

129
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,854
It'll be Garnet's birthday soon.

130
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,557
We should do something special
for him this year.

131
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,294
We should have a party

132
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,599
where we play
those old-fashioned games

133
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,639
that nobody plays anymore.

134
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,267
- Sounds good.

135
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,334
- Well, don't get
so damn excited,

136
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,243
for Christ's sake.

137
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,248
- Well, I said
it was a good idea.

138
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,750
Watch your language.

139
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,753
See who he wants to invite.

140
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,494
Maybe spend a little more
on his present this year.

141
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,462
Get him something special.

142
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,295
- I think you should get him
a present on your own this year.

143
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,827
- I wouldn't know
what to get him.

144
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,101
- Well, take a look at him.
What do you think he would like?

145
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,613
- Why don't you just go shopping
for the both of us?

146
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,629
- I'm getting him something
from myself this year.

147
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,663
- Hey, Garnet,
there's an ant war going on here.

148
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,505
Look at that.

149
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,477
See these big red bastards?

150
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,310
They're decimating
these little black ones,

151
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,680
so I'm like an act of God
making it fair.

152
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,351
You have a magnifying glass?

153
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,480
- No.
- No?

154
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,922
They're indispensable.

155
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,959
You know, you could get lost
in the woods or something,

156
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,427
and you'd be all right as long
as you had one of these.

157
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,487
Check it out.

158
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,931
Because...

159
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,469
you watch.

160
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:36,974
You, like, just focus...
focus the light here,

161
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,669
focus the beam.

162
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,836
Hmm, hmm.

163
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,543
You see that? You see that?

164
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,915
That's cool, huh?

165
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,919
Hey, would you like this?

166
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,287
- Okay.

167
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,458
- There you go.

168
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,859
There, all you need now

169
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,159
is a knife and a compass,

170
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,166
and you got all you need
to survive.

171
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,761
- You shouldn't have
burned those ants.

172
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,839
- They don't feel anything.

173
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,432
- If they didn't feel anything,

174
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,375
why would they
be running from it?

175
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,611
- Hey, Flower.

176
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,379
Hey, I just gave Garnet
this magnifying glass.

177
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,251
There's this ant war
going on here,

178
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,756
and I was helping out
the little guys.

179
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,385
Aren't you working today?

180
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,224
- No. I'm waiting for your dad.

181
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,491
- My dad had lunch
downtown today.

182
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,626
- Shit.
I'm gonna be late for work.

183
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,465
All right, see you guys later.

184
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,842
- Guess what, Garnet?

185
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,744
Dad and I are planning a party
for you this year.

186
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,577
Is there anything special
you'd like to do?

187
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,584
- A barbeque.

188
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,247
- A barbeque?
It's too cold for a barbeque.

189
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,289
- Thank you.

190
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,644
What?

191
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,712
- We just had sex,

192
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,379
we're sharing a cigarette,

193
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,184
and I'm wondering
what you're thinking.

194
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,125
That's pretty classic, eh?

195
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,288
- I'm not thinking anything.

196
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,956
- Nothing?

197
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,490
- I'm thinking
I should get back to work.

198
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,965
- Before that?

199
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,838
- Before that, I was thinking

200
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,639
that I should stop
sharing cigarettes

201
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,680
or I'm gonna get hooked again.

202
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,289
- My neighbours are gonna think
I'm a whore.

203
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,755
- Why would you say that?

204
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,591
- Because your truck's parked
out front of my place

205
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,759
for an hour
a couple of times a week.

206
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:20,271
- There's a big difference between
having a lover and being a whore.

207
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,034
- I don't know.
There's a grey zone.

208
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,048
- I told you this
when we started.

209
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,652
- It's been a year, Ed.

210
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,312
Everyone knows.

211
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,989
Everyone.

212
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,655
They do.

213
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,789
Everyone.

214
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,458
- The kids don't know.

215
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,367
- Well, so what if they did?

216
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,598
So what?

217
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,334
Anyway, Flower knows.

218
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,702
- You tell her?

219
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,713
- No, I didn't tell her.

220
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,239
Flower's quite capable
of figuring it out on her own.

221
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,454
- Well, Garnet doesn't know.

222
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,959
- I don't think you know
what Garnet knows.

223
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,095
- What's that supposed to mean?

224
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,463
- I just don't see you
talking to him very often.

225
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,142
- My kids
are not up for discussion.

226
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,710
- Well, what is
up for discussion?

227
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,124
- I'm not talking to you
when you're like this.

228
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,856
- Oh, okay.
Well, nice to see you.

229
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,024
Thanks for dropping in.

230
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,015
- This is the living room.

231
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,889
You see that macrame frog?

232
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,554
I made that
when I was in Grade Four.

233
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,326
And Garnet made
that one over there.

234
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,130
It's supposed to be a star,
but it looks more like bird poo.

235
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,700
- What's down there?

236
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,310
- This is my room.

237
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,855
This is my dresser,

238
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:56,087
and that's my teddy
that I've had since I was a kid.

239
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,460
- If your dad shows up,
I'm gonna have to bolt.

240
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,523
- He won't be back until dinner.

241
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,400
This is a picture of me
when I was little.

242
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,938
- You were cute.

243
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:13,105
Your boobs have grown a lot
since then.

244
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:17,308
- Of course. I was eight.

245
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,510
It was taken a few weeks
before my mom died.

246
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,351
This is her.

247
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,096
She was at the lake.

248
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,687
She was 27.

249
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,866
- I can see why
your dad married her.

250
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,635
- People say
that I look like her.

251
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,369
- You do.

252
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,114
- They say
that we have the same eyes.

253
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,377
- You have beautiful eyes.

254
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,682
I've always noticed you.

255
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,157
- You did not.
- I did.

256
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,465
I always thought
how I would love to kiss you.

257
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,966
- You did not.

258
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,502
- I did. I could tell
you had a hot body.

259
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,165
I thought you were special.

260
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,834
That you were so beautiful.

261
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,839
That you were the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

262
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,850
- We should close the door.

263
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,310
- When Barb stays overnight,

264
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,279
does it hurt, what you guys do?

265
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,449
- What are you talking about?
Barb doesn't stay over.

266
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,454
I mean, she has dinner here
sometimes,

267
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:15,618
we talk at night sometimes,
but she doesn't stay over.

268
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,526
What made you think
that she did?

269
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,564
- Nothing.

270
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,232
- Oh, man, I love this song.

271
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,775
Should have been all right

272
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,312
Could have been here tonight

273
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,314
Could have been
sweet as wine

274
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,977
Could have been a lady

275
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,679
So, Flower, huh?

276
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,657
- My dad would be so mad
if he found out you were driving.

277
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,661
- Hey, I can make up my own mind
about what I do.

278
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,321
It's not like I'm a kid.

279
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,367
You know, it's bad
to leave a car sitting.

280
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,664
An engine can seize, right?

281
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:02,137
They don't think of those things
when they take your licence away.

282
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,813
Hey, there's Henry
in his '68 Camaro.

283
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,781
Nice car.

284
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,649
Hey, looking good, Henry!

285
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,379
[laughter]

286
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,858
- Anybody want any ice
in their drink?

287
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,687
[laughter]

288
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,331
- Whose idea was it to have
a barbeque this time of year?

289
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,671
- Oh, damn.

290
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,373
- Garnet, where are you going?

291
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,610
- Washroom.

292
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,950
- Garnet...

293
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,822
you should open your presents
while everyone's still here.

294
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,926
Don't you want to make
a birthday wish?

295
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,107
[television playing]

296
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,350
When are you gonna
open your presents, Garnet?

297
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,345
I got you something special
just from me this year.

298
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,004
Go ahead, open it.

299
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,973
- What are you doing?

300
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,033
- It's a BB gun.

301
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,046
- I can see that.

302
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,749
- Garnet, you like it?

303
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,324
Here.

304
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,328
You hold the gun like this.

305
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,467
Move your hand down.

306
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,301
Okay, there.

307
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,707
You keep your finger off the trigger
until you're ready to shoot.

308
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,438
Okay, close your left eye and...

309
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,572
Close your left eye
and look through this notch

310
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,116
at the little tip here.

311
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,811
Okay, when you're ready,

312
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,581
you point it at the target,
you aim,

313
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,282
and then you pull the trigger
gently.

314
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,091
Okay, that's a start.

315
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,929
What were you aiming for?

316
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,263
Well, pick a target.

317
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,769
Make sure the tip is in the "V,"

318
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,099
but no higher
than the top of the "V."

319
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,140
Try Santa Claus.

320
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,336
Hey...

321
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,781
nice shot.

322
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,342
Okay, try to hit it again.

323
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,888
Try the goose.

324
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,090
Holy shit.

325
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,453
You sure
you haven't done this before?

326
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,999
The squirrel.

327
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,204
I think you found your calling.

328
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,213
- I'm too old for this shit.

329
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,279
- Why can't you just try
to enjoy what we have?

330
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,954
- 'Cause it's not enough.

331
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,087

She's gonna be helping us out
around here.

497
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:53,895
- Hi, Garnet.

498
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,613
[gunshot]

499
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,345
- Jesus Christ.

500
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,409
Donna keeps buying me
these goddamn bargain underwear.

501
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,180
- How much do they cost?

502
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,818
- About two bucks.

503
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,495
Only problem is,
most of the time

504
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,088
I've got
about a dollar-fifty of 'em

505
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,861
stuck up the crack of my ass.

506
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,347
- Up the crack of my...

507
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,204
- God bless her.

508
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,231
[crying]

509
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,542
What is it?

510
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:47,981
What?

511
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,075
Hey, you all right?

512
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,101
[gunshots]

513
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,224
- Hi, Garnet.

514
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,326
- Hi.
- What're you doing?

515
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,800
- Going home.

516
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,705
- How's it going?

517
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,311
- Are you coming home soon?

518
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:02,283
- I think I'm gonna get a place
of my own once the baby's born.

519
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,652
I heard Dad got a girl
to help around the house.

520
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,885
- Yeah.

521
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,427
- Is she nice?

522
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,658
Does she get the groceries now?

523
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,062
- Yeah.

524
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,193
- Does she remember
to get you chocolate milk?

525
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,601
- I didn't ask for any.

526
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,541
- Do you want to come to my place
for some hot chocolate?

527
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,077
- Okay.

528
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,248
- These are her eyelids.

529
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,314
They're closed now,
but they'll open later.

530
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,793
And this is her little nose

531
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,422
and mouth...

532
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,932
and her arms and her hands.

533
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:56,370
She has tiny,
tiny little fingers.

534
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:01,069
And this is her back...
and her legs.

535
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:05,079
She's only the size
of a grapefruit, but the doctor says

536
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,581
that she can curl up
and stretch out already.

537
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,311
He says that

538
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:13,378
it's gonna feel like there's
little butterflies inside me.

539
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,016
It'll just be her moving around.

540
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,619
And these are her little feet...

541
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,266
And up here is her little heart.

542
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:29,770
It sort of sounds
like a cricket.

543
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,036
Here.

544
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,077
Put your head here.

545
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,841
Can you hear it?

546
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,147
- No.

547
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,381
- Listen.

548
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,150
Here.

549
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,963
How about now?

550
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,794
- No.

551
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,358
- Listen.

552
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:03,937
You hear it?

553
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,441
Here.

554
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,978
Come here.

555
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:16,213
How you doing?

556
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,776
- Okay.

557
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:21,982
- Maybe you can come
to the clinic with me next time

558
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,685
and listen to her heart.

559
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,126
- Would you die if it died?

560
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,264
- Why would you ask that?

561
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,974
- You should get it out of you.

562
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,144
- What are you talking about?

563
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:50,549
- It's making you sick.

564
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,822
- Why can't you just be happy
for once in your life?

565
01:09:56,892 --> 01:10:00,020
You ruin it for everyone.

566
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,462
Go.

567
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,232
Get out of here.

568
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,373
[TV]: . . Than the lower part
of the uterus.

569
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,780
It is about
the same consistency

570
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,374
as the tip of your nose.

571
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,353
The cervix begins dilation

572
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,413
during the early
active labour stage,

573
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,923
when it will dilate

574
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,790
between
one and four centimetres.

575
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,294
During active labour,

576
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:40,268
dilation will continue to between
five to eight centimetres.

577
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,201
By the transition stage...

578
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,670
- Jesus.

579
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,106
dilation should be completed,
and the cervix...

580
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,910
You know, I may not be big now,
but I was a really big baby,

581
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,177
And my mom had no trouble
whatsoever.

582
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,853
- Giving birth
is the most common thing on earth.

583
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,483
- Yeah, exactly.

584
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,287
[door closing]

585
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,789
- You're late.

586
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,156
Tara had to stay
and keep me company.

587
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,253
Wash up for dinner.

588
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,662
- I'm not hungry.

589
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:49,364
- Garnet, wash up
and come and eat.

590
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,599
And I'll talk to you later

591
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,574
about missing school
this afternoon.

592
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,610
Come Monday, I'll drive you
to school myself.

593
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,918
- Hi.
- Hi.

594
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,320
- I came by to talk to you
about Flower.

595
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,320
You're gonna be there
when the time comes, right?

596
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,763
- 'Course I will.

597
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,434
- It's funny
the way things turn out.

598
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,438
- You want to come in?

599
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,639
- No.

600
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,839
I'm just going home from work.
I'm tired.

601
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,081
You have to resolve
this thing with her.

602
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:39,052
- She can come back
anytime she wants.

603
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,316
- Have you told her that?

604
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:45,156
- I never told her to leave
in the first place.

605
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,787
- I bet you didn't ask her
to stay either.

606
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,491
Right?

607
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,329
She told me she's scared

608
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,426
she could die during labour.

609
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,368
- The thing that happened
to her mom was a total fluke,

610
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,502
one in 10,000.
- I know.

611
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,012
I told her that.

612
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,447
She asked me to be with her
during the birth.

613
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,609
I said I would.

614
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,380
- Thanks.

615
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,650
- I'll see you.

616
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,271
- Is Flower coming home tonight?

617
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,368
- No.

618
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,633
- Flower, I was thinking that,
uh...

619
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:03,466
maybe I could help you out
with the baby.

620
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,473
- Yeah?

621
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,509
Like watching her
when she's a bit older?

622
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,443
- No, I... well...

623
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:16,280
Actually, I was thinking that maybe
I could be the baby's father.

624
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:21,254
- You don't know anything
about being a father.

625
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,813
- Yeah, I know what not to do,

626
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,620
and that's more than some,
you know.

627
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,423
Besides, I can learn from books
and videos, like you do.

628
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,761
- I don't think so, Ronnie.

629
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,628
- You know, Flower,
I could be a really big help.

630
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,638
You know, I could drive you

631
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,640
when you need to
take her somewhere.

632
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,699
You know, I can watch her
when you need to take a nap.

633
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,109
You're gonna have to take
a nap sometimes, right?

634
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,113
You know, when you do,
I'll watch her.

635
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,478
You know,

636
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,449
I'll take her to the park
when she gets older.

637
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,452
You know, you could come, too,
and we'll all go to the park.

638
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,648
- You could be her uncle.

639
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,391
- I'm gonna stop drinking,
Flower.

640
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,902
I'm gonna quit.

641
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,905
You know what? I quit right now.

642
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,907
You see, I just quit drinking.

643
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:16,570
I'm gonna stop
fucking up, Flower.

644
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,636
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

645
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,573
I just...

646
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,279
I've always loved you, Flower.

647
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,787
I would love your baby

648
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,790
more than anything
in the whole world.

649
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,629
- But I don't love you
like that.

650
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,198
- Well, maybe you would.

651
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,637
You know, after awhile,
you probably would, you know.

652
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,139
I mean, I would work.

653
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,937
I would give you the money,
you know,

654
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,944
to buy things for the baby,
you know,

655
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,980
and for yourself, too.

656
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,073
You know, I just...
I know I would be a good father.

657
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,449
- I just need you
to keep being my friend.

658
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,251
- Okay.

659
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,937
- You're gonna have to
be careful with that, you know.

660
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,438
It takes awhile

661
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,600
to properly heal
neck injuries.

662
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,438
- Oh, hi, Mr. Cooper.

663
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,003
What happened to you?

664
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,685
- Oh...

665
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,348
Well, I hope
you get better soon.

666
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,484
- I didn't expect
to see any cops.

667
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,289
- Pulling doughnuts
in front of the police station,

668
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:41,693
you didn't
expect to see any cops?

669
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,321
You were drunk.

670
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,594
- You destroyed that wall.

671
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,829
You're just lucky
you didn't kill yourself.

672
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,031
You're too old
for this kind of shit.

673
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,268
They'll send you away, you know.

674
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,212
- I know.

675
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,295
- Does it hurt?

676
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,268
- Yeah.

677
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,863
- Well, there's no point

678
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,374
in me hanging around here.

679
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,875
See you later.

680
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:35,612
- Well, I'm gonna go, too.
Do you want a ride, Flower?

681
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,812
- Oh, no. I'll walk.
- Okay. See you.

682
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,668
- I got you some butter tarts.

683
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,269
I've had such
a sweet tooth lately,

684
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,275
because I'm pregnant, I guess.

685
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,783
- Thanks.

686
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,765
- Is it good?

687
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,627
- Yeah.

688
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,776
- I wish I could be
a better friend.

689
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,140
- You've been my best friend,
Ronnie.

690
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,613
[gunshot]

691
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,348
[whimpering]

692
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:11,130
- It's gonna be okay.

693
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,605
It's all right.

694
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,234
Don't die.

695
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,044
Don't die.

696
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,095
- What happened to you?

697
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:48,268
- I want you to leave
and don't come back.

698
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:51,841
- Well, that's not up to you.

699
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,744
Your dad wants me to stay.

700
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,482
Did you hurt yourself?

701
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,321
Is that blood?

702
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,128
What is your problem?

703
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,015
What are you doing?

704
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:46,498
[gunshot]

705
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,477
- The doctor said he'd talk to you
about how you're feeling inside,

706
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,280
if you want.

707
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:08,922
- No.

708
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,625
- That's...
that's what I told him...

709
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,463
And, well,

710
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:20,695
Flower and l, you can...

711
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,533
you can talk to us
if you want...

712
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,802
You know,
if there's something you need.

713
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,109
- Okay.

714
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,016
[inaudible]

715
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:55,469
- Well, how did he get his hands
on it in the first place?

716
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,971
- Jesus Christ, Flower,
that gun's been around for years.

717
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,472
He never once
showed any interest in it.

718
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,838
- Until you bought him one
for his birthday.

719
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:04,936
- A BB gun is a perfectly
normal thing for a boy to have.

720
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,376
Look, you can blame me
all you want,

721
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,247
but I'm doing the best I can.

722
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,081
Okay? I'm doing the best I can.

723
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,745
You need to come home.

724
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,086
- I'm about to have a baby,
and you expect me to come home

725
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,682
after what he just did?
- He was playing with something

726
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,250
that he shouldn't have
been playing with,

727
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,091
and he's learned his lesson.

728
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:24,028
- I talked to Tara, your helper,

729
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,896
and he wasn't playing, okay?

730
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,803
- Look, you went and got him
when he was a baby.

731
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,605
- I'm gonna have
my own child now.

732
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,015
You've got to take care
of yours.

733
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:32,099
Barb...

734
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:36,600
It's happening.

735
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,838
- It's all right, love.
You're gonna be fine.

736
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:49,577
- I want my dad!
Somebody get my dad.

737
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,556
- Okay, Mr. Buttle,
come this way.

738
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:09,166
Flower, your dad is here.

739
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,207
- Hi.

740
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,277
- Hi.

741
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:28,316
[door opening]

742
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,323
- Hi, Flower.

743
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:34,861
I'm just going to do

744
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,420
a brief examination, okay?

745
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:41,802
I'll just get you
to roll over onto your back.

746
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:47,171
- There we go.

747
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,608
There.

748
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,412
- Just try
and breathe normally, okay?

749
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:16,901
Everything's fine.

750
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,545
I need you to keep an eye

751
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,103
on her blood pressure
and on her temperature.

752
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,581
If her temperature goes up,

753
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,083
give me a phone call
right away, okay?

754
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:31,618
- Yes.

755
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:39,090
Okay, Flower, would you like
to go back on your side?

756
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,593
- Another one's coming.

757
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:43,460
- Just keep rolling over...
[screaming]

758
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:46,295
- It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

759
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,104
- Come on.
[screaming]

760
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,965
Keep breathing.
Just keep breathing.

761
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,568
Just keep breathing.

762
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:01,206
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.
She's gonna be fine.

763
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:38,377
- Hi.

764
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:39,920
'Morning, Garnet.

765
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:42,149
- Where's my dad?

766
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,916
Go away.

767
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,930
- Garnet, let me talk to you.

768
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:09,343
- You should come in again.

769
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:11,385
- No, I'm just in the way.

770
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,585
- I think Flower liked
having you there.

771
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,761
Hi, Garnet.

772
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,562
- I want to see Flower.

773
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,865
- We're not allowed in there,

774
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:34,101
but Barb can go in
and tell Flower that you're here.

775
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:36,541
- I'll tell her.

776
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:38,238
She'll be glad.

777
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,482
- You might as well sit down.

778
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,094
You hungry?

779
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,239
They have cookies in here.

780
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,253
- Something's wrong with Flower.

781
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:57,257
- There's nothing wrong.
- I saw her.

782
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:59,691
There's something wrong.
- There's nothing wrong.

783
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:01,251
- She's dying.

784
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:04,389
- She's not dying. She's just
having a baby, for God's sake.

785
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,956
It's perfectly normal.
Why are you always making up problems

786
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:08,763
for yourself, always worrying?

787
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,770
Always did.

788
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:14,274
Always cried when you were little.
Drove me crazy.

789
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:19,241
Come on. The nurse
put out a blanket for you.

790
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:21,338
Let's go sit down.

791
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:48,804
- Fred, Garnet hasn't shown up
there by any chance, has he?

792
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:52,236
No, we've searched everywhere.

793
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,082
Well, he must be at the house.

794
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:00,712
No, no, no. I'll go.

795
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:01,686
Ok, bye.

796
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:03,754
I'll go check at home.

797
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:06,326
- All right.
Don't be long. She's close.

798
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:09,926
- If there's an emergency,
call me at the house.

799
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,799
Garnet?

800
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:25,269
[dring!]

801
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:26,931
Hello.

802
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,440
No, I can't find him anywhere.

803
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:35,839
Thanks.
I'II... I'll go check.

804
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:48,457
...the baby turns
to the posterior position,

805
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:52,158
which means she faces
the front of the pelvis.

806
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,894
If this happens,

807
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:57,062
her head puts added pressure
on the mother's back,

808
01:32:57,138 --> 01:32:59,868
which may cause
painful back labour

809
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,774
and slower progress.

810
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,811
Due to the force
of contractions

811
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:06,870
and the shape of the pelvis,

812
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,883
a posterior baby
will usually turn on her own

813
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:14,411
to the anterior position
prior to birth.

814
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:18,618
The practitioner may suggest
the use of labour positions

815
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:21,253
that can help a posterior baby
turn,

816
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,526
or may attempt
to rotate the baby manually

817
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,931
by turning the baby's head...

818
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:45,779
Flower's wondering
where you are.

819
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:50,413
She had her baby...

820
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,317
And they're both fine.

821
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:05,121
She told me
to come and find you.

822
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:12,066
She wants us to come
and visit her...

823
01:35:12,139 --> 01:35:14,869
and the baby.

824
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,214
She's waiting for us.

825
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:40,429
- You didn't want me.

826
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,435
- I wanted my wife back.

827
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:19,034
It wasn't your fault.

828
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,176
I'm sorry
I never told you that.

829
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:28,648
But it wasn't...

830
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:08,516
- How's Flower?

831
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,489
She's all right?

832
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:11,991
Good.

833
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:14,152
Well, does she look
just like her?

834
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:17,129
Yeah, her brown eyes?

835
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:18,563
Jeez.

836
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:20,566
Well...

837
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:24,365
Oh, that's great,
that's great.

838
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:26,702
Well, tell her I say hi.

839
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,208
Well, what's her name?

840
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:33,212
Oh, that's perfect,
that's perfect,

841
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,443
'cause it's like Rose
and her little...

842
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:39,782
Flower and her little Rose,
right, right.

843
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,321
Wow.

844
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:44,357
Okay, well,
I'll be home in 10 days.

845
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,222
Yeah.

846
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,124
Tell her I say hi.

847
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:50,493
Tell her I say hi, Ed.

848
01:37:50,564 --> 01:37:51,997
Okay.

849
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,228
Okay.

850
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:55,768
Okay, bye. Bye.

851
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,248
- Could I hold her, Flower?

852
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,884
- Careful, she's fragile.

853
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:55,019
- I know.
