"Jesus, Walt! What are you doing?

00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:35,906
Hell hath no fury
like a woman's scorn for Sega.

149
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,747
Wow, look at this
laundry list of complaints.

150
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:42,482
"You have no direction;
no college ambition; no job prospect."

151
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:46,583
It also says I have no dick,
but you'll notice that follows
the financial question...

152
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,788
proving once more
what women really look for.

153
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:52,424
- She calls you callow.
- You say that like it's bad.

154
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,094
Well, it means
"frightened and weak-willed."

155
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,467
Really?

156
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,939
Shit. That was the only part of the
letter I thought was complimentary.

157
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,519
Ah, well, you're lucky.

158
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:08,454
Unlike you, I didn't even get
a letter with obscure adjectives.

159
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:10,549
What are you
telling me here?

160
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,958
I, too, now am in
the framing business.

161
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,759
- Holy shit. Brandi dumped you?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:20,495
- Aren't you two supposed
to go to Florida?
- We should've left this morning.

163
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,097
Oh, it gets worse.
I was gonna propose to her.

164
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,937
- Where?
- On the Universal tour.

165
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,637
You're kidding!
What part?

166
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:32,442
When Jaws pops out
of the water.

167
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:36,281
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

168
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:39,253
Well, too bad I'm not
trying to marry you.

169
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:43,486
Let me ask you something.
Did you ever fart in front of her?

170
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,652
- [ Laughs ]
- Why do you ask?

171
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:48,424
I never farted
in front of Rene, not once.

172
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:51,728
Then last week, I let one slip.
Today, she dumps me.

173
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:55,669
- [ Both Laughing ]
- You think that
that's why Rene dumped you?

174
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,763
Come on, she's not
the shallow type.

175
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,400
- She was going down on me at the time.
- Shut up!

176
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:02,944
What can I say?
I was feeling very relaxed.

177
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:05,708
- When I'm relaxed... I squirt.
- Ohh!

178
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:10,241
- If all she did was dump you,
you got off light.
- I can't believe this shit.

179
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:13,755
Why are we trying to figure out where we
went wrong with our significant others?

180
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,757
We nailed it,
in your case.

181
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,921
There is something out there that can
help ease our simultaneous double loss.

182
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:23,625
- Ritual suicide?
- No, you idiot! The fuckin' mall!

183
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,361
- I prefer ritual suicide.
- Come on, it'll be great.

184

I love the smell
of commerce in the morning!

188
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:58,656
- Wow, you're really making that last.
- Waste not, want not.

189

- You wanna say something?
- Yeah, about a million things.

190
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,836
But I can't express myself
monosyllabically enough for you
to understand 'em all.

191
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:10,845
- Asshole.
- Prick!

192
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:12,847
- Fuck you.
- What was that all about?

193
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:17,284
He's the jerk from Fashionable
Male, this upscale, wanna-be
shop on the second floor.

194
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:21,722
He's the manager. The guy's always
giving me shit. I have no idea why.

195
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,692
- Thought everybody
loved you at this mall.
- "F" him.

196
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,285
- Where do you wanna go first?
- Back to Brandi's.

197
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:30,958
Brandi is the past, my friend.
She's behind you now.

198
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:35,936
You face forward, or you face
the possibility of shock and damage.

199
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:42,505
- You should learn
to heed your own advice.
- Where did that come from?

200
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:46,070
- What's going on here?
- Looks like a stage is being erected.

201
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:50,414
- What is this monstrosity?
- Maybe it's for the
Easter Bunny pictures.

202
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:53,649
Impossible! The Easter Bunny corner
is down at the other end of the mall.

203
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:57,159
It's been up since two days
after Christmas. I want answers!

204
00:13:57,226 --> 00:14:01,788
- Ask one of the workers.
- No. There's a soul
who might know what's up.

205
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:13,322

-Looking for the hidden picture.

you're supposed to see some hidden...

- You saw it too? Damn it!

- What?
- I've been staring at
this thing for a week now...

- and I can't see a goddamn thing!
- You gotta relax your eyes.

Everyone sees this thing
except me. Today's my day.
I brought a lunch and a soda.

I'm not gonna leave until I see this
sailboat everyone keeps talking about.

217
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,398
So, Willam, would you
happen to know...

218
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:58,127
what this stage business
is all about?

219
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:02,228
It's not a stage! I'm gonna see it
if I have to go blind trying.

220
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,604
No, man, this stage
over here.

Oh, that thing. Some game show in the
mall today. I think it's gonna be on TV.

or something.

Brandi's father's game show.
- What is it?

224

rip-off thing. It's supposed
to be for college kids.

with a staple of 70s television.

Why can't they bring back or remake
good shows like B.J. And The Bear?

227
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:27,963
Now, there's a concept I can't get
enough of; a man and his monkey.

You're breaking my concentration.

- Yeah, man, remember, relax your eyes.

off on live TV from a mall.
- Not a mall. The mall.

But it doesn't have to go down
like that if we trash the thing.

235
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:06,869
There's a unique way of getting
back in her good graces--
ruining her father's show.

[ Mother ] All right, go ahead.
But hurry, the Easter Bunny's waiting.

287
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,677
Wow, it's a schooner.

288
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:32,241
[ Chuckles ]
You dumb bastard.

289
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,617
It's not a schooner;
it's a sailboat.

290
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:37,452
A schooner is a sailboat,
stupid-head.

291
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:43,122
You know what?
There is no Easter Bunny!

292
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:46,928
Over there,
that's just a guy in a suit!

293
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:52,138
- But they're engaged.
- Doesn't matter, it can't happen.

294
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:54,674
- Why not? It's bound to come up.
- It's impossible.

295
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:56,675
Lois could never have
Superman's baby.

296
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:59,541
Do you think her fallopian tubes
could handle his sperm?

297
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:03,049
I guarantee he blows a load
like a shotgun right through her back.

298
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:06,211
What about her womb? You think
it's strong enough to carry his child?

299
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:08,811
- Sure. Why not?
- He's an alien, for Christ's sake!

300
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:12,825
His Kryptonian biological makeup
is enhanced by Earth's yellow sun.

301
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:15,828
If Lois gets a tan, the kid
could kick right through her stomach.

302
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:19,593
Only someone like Wonder Woman has a
strong-enough uterus to carry his kid.

303
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,966
Only way he could bang regular
chicks is with a Kryptonite
condom, but that would kill him.

304
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:26,972
How is it I go from the verge
of hot Floridian sex with Brandi...

305
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,975
to Man of Steel coital debates
with you in the food court?

306
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:33,274
- Cookie stand is
not part of the food court.
- Of course it is.

307
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,145
The food court is downstairs;
the cookie stand is upstairs.

308
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:38,309
We're not talking
quantum physics here.

309
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:40,751
The cookie stand counts as an eatery;
the eatery's part of the food court.

310
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:45,485
Bullshit. Eateries that operate
within the square downstairs
qualify as food court.

311
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,153
Anything outside
of said designated square...

312
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:51,686
is considered an autonomous unit
for mid-mall snacking.

313
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:57,533
If you're gonna wax intellectual
about the subject-- Holy shit!

314
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,367
- Wait here.
- Where you going?

315
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,037
[ Sighs ]
Chercher la femme.

316
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:13,176
- That would look terrible on you.
- Didn't I dump your ass this morning?

317
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,416
Look, I know you've had some time to
think about the mistake you've made...

318
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,118
and I just wanna let you know
you don't have to apologize.

319
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:22,629
- I'm sure you were just P.M.S.ing.
- What kills me about you...

320
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:26,393
is your inability to function
on the same plane of existence
as the rest of us.

321
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:28,400
Piss off.

322
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:32,734
Okay, okay, I see you wanna continue
with this charade of ending our union.

323
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:37,266
Fine, I'll play along.
If we're divorced, we're gonna
have to divide our possessions.

324
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:39,312
What the hell
are you talking about?

325
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,577
You have my Punisher War Journal
number six, my copy of Fletch,
and the remote to my TV.

326
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,552
It's gonna be hard to give this stuff up
because of its sentimental attachment--

327
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:52,115
Sentimental attachment?
lf I have that crap, it's 'cause
you brought it over and left it.

328
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:58,291
- Let's talk about a schedule
for visitation rights?
- For what?

329
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:02,999
For the mall. You can have the odd days,
I'll take the even days and weekends.

330
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,338
- When there's any special
function like a sidewalk sale--
- Brodie. Brodie!

331
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:11,340
I have always taken you
with a grain of salt.

332
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:16,614
Your birthday, when you asked me
to do a striptease to the theme
from Mighty Mouse, I said okay.

333
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:22,592
On prom night, you asked me
to sleep under the bed in case
your mother burst in, I did.

334
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,289
And even when we were
at my grandmother's funeral
and you told my relatives...

335
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:30,231
that you could see her nipples through
her burial dress, I let it slide.

336
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:34,067
But if you think I'm gonna suffer
any more of your shit with a smile...

337
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:36,902
you're in for some serious
fucking disappointment.

338
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:42,578
What?

339
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:47,276
[ Jay ] Phase one. You take a run at
LaFours with a sock full of quarters.

340
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:50,946
I'd do it, but I pulled my back out
humping your mom last night.

341
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:54,115
You clock him on his headpiece
and knock his ass out cold.

342
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,991
That's when phase two kicks in. I attack
the structure, Wolvie-berserk style...

343
00:22:58,062 --> 00:23:01,930
knock out the fuckin' pin, and
bickety-bam-- the motherfucker's rubble.

344
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,933
Hence, no game show.

345
00:23:06,337 --> 00:23:08,567
[ Coins Jingling ]

346
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:53,245
Ah, fuck!

347
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:06,919
[ T.S. ]
You know that kid?

348
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:11,331
- I hope his pants get caught
and a bloodbath ensues.
- What is with you today?

349
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:15,065
I don't wish the kid harm,
but his mother should suffer
that horrific ordeal...

350
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:19,337
- so she'll learn how
to manage her child!
- Sort of a harsh lesson.

351
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,537
Man, there's not
a year goes by...

352
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:25,548
that I don't read about some escalator
accident involving some bastard kid...

353
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:29,450
that could've been easily avoided had
some parent-- I don't care which one--

354
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,015
but some parent conditioned him
to fear and respect that escalator!

355
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,859
Wow, look who it is.

356
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,061
- Jerk.
- Little Tricia Jones.

357
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:51,130
What's a pretty girl like you
doing alone in the middle of
this monument to consumerism?

358
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,644
Updating my calendar and waiting
for Jay and Silent Bob.

359
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:58,169
And I suppose you're here
with no agenda, as per usual.

360
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:02,014
On the contrary, I'm here for comics.
T.S. Quint, Tricia Jones.

361
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:05,350
- They call her Trish the Dish.
- Nobody calls me that.

362
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:09,552
Our little Tricia here is only 15,
but somehow she's a senior.

363
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:11,992
- How'd you manage that?
- [ Slurping ]

364
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:15,088
- Don't listen to him.
I studied my ass off.
- Yeah, right.

365
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:18,328
- So, what do you say?
You wanna nail T.S. or what?
- Jesus, Brodie!

366
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:23,101
Calm down. Tricia's compiling
data for this book she's writing
about the sex drive of men...

367
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:26,108
ages 14 to 30.

368
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:30,476
If I remember correctly, it's
titled Bore-gasm: Study of the
Nineties' Male Sexual Prowess.

369
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:33,482
Ready to get sick?
Tell him about the advance you got.

370
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,281
Pendant Publishing gave me $20,000 based
on a treatment and a sample chapter.

371
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:41,120
- You're kidding.
- [ Brodie ] She'll be the youngest
author to tackle the subject.

372
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:44,126
Tricia here sleeps
with a bunch of guys as research.

373
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:47,391
- And if that's not enough,
she videotapes all of them.
- What?

374
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,955
I get everybody's consent
before we do it.

375
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:53,264
Most guys get off on it.
Men are easily amused.

376
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,897
Wh-What are you writing
in the calendar?

377
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,908
- I was coding last night's research.
- She means sex.

378
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:02,104
I know what she meant!
What kind of codes?

379
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,206
Here, look. The smiley face
is for when I go down on a guy.

380
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:09,446
The smiley face with lashes
is for when the guy goes down on me.

381
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,287
The circle is when we have sex.
The circle with the "X"
is for when I have an orgasm.

382
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:17,759
The little house is when we do it
inside, and the grass is for outside.

383
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,388
That kid is back
on the escalator again!

384
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:23,024
How old was last night's subject,
if you don't mind?

385
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,092
Twenty-five. It was the guy who runs
that store Fashionable Male.

386
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:31,038
-Holy shit! You slept with that asshole?
-I needed a 25-year-old.

387
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:35,408
- And he has quite a distaste
for you, I might add.
- He mentioned me during sex?

388
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:39,711
Afterwards. He says he wants
to kick your ass. I'd steer
clear of him if I were you.

389
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:41,717
-Tell me you videotaped him saying that.
-No.

390
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:46,313
I shut the camera off after
the sex. You should've heard
the stuff he wanted to do.

391
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,086
I'm having a hard time with this.
Do your parents know about this?

392
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,093
- Of course.
- It's remarkable.

393
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:56,326
That's criminal. That kid--
that kid is back on the escalator again!

394
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,493
- Would you leave it alone?
- What?

395
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:02,437
I heard you were going to propose
to Brandi Svening in some theme park.

396
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:05,669
When are men going to learn
women want romance...

397
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,540
not Mr. Toad's Wild Ride?

398
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:12,776
Be fair, all right? Everyone wants
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

399
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:15,943
- We gotta go.
- [ Sighs ]

400
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,785
And remember my offer. I'm young,
virile, sensitive to a woman's needs.

401
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:25,021
Somehow I doubt it, Sega boy.
Good luck with the comic book store.

402
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:27,029
"Sega boy."

403
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:31,329
God, Rene's got a big mouth.
What does that mean, "Good luck
with the comic book store"?

404
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,199
How does that junior Masters and Johnson
know about my proposal?

405
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:37,638
- It's not like she's in
an exclusive club.
- What are you talking about?

406
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:41,576
- Sean Hartle's giving
everyone the inside scoop.
- What's he saying?

407
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:45,604
How her father made her do the game show
so you couldn't take her to Florida.

408
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:47,673
Now what the hell
is this shit?

What do you gotta do to get comics
around this place? One side, Red!

410
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:55,491
- Hey, what the hell's going on here?
- I was warned about you.

411
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,290
- Take it easy before I have you
removed from the mall.
- What are you talking about?

00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:02,298
- Tell him, Steve Dave!
- Fuck you, fan-boy!

You two testosterone-seething, he-man
comic book fans finish up with this.

that need answering.
- Who's in there?

reads comics, he can't start some shit!

a little boy caught in the escalator!

- Why is there a line?
- Stan Lee's signing comics.

424
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,383
Stan Lee?

00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,680
[ Jay ] Okay, lunch box,
let's try this again.

426
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:50,020
We tie you to the roof
and you jump off and sail like
a spitfire passing over LaFours.

427
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:52,686
You then swing up to the stage
and knock out the pin.

428
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:56,663
When that's gone, the stage is trashed,
and we go smoke a bowl. You got it?

429
00:28:56,732 --> 00:29:01,032
Now, get your fat ass up there.
And, dude, don't forget
your helmet. Snoogins.

430
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:36,563
Fly, fatass, fly!

[ Woman ] Security? This is
Popular Girl. We had something
crash through the wall.

434

How does something as big as the
creator of the most important
titles in comics history...

I'd love to ask him.
- Her father.

438

I knew this game show was just a beard
for an attempt at breaking us up.

Why can't he leave us alone and let us
follow through with our plans?

What kind of man
are you anyway?

441
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:29,682
I'm talkin' comics, and you bring up
chicks and romance.

442
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:34,718
While we're on the subject, why get
married now anyway? You're in college.

443
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:37,732
I was just gonna propose. The wedding
wouldn't be 'til after we graduate.

444
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,636
Waste of time. My grandmother
always said, "Why buy the cow
when you get the sex for free?"

445
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:45,764
- She did?
- All the time.

446
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:49,937
Of course she became a lesbian
on her 60th birthday,
but that's beside the point.

447
00:30:50,012 --> 00:30:53,743
Where the hell are these two
going in such a hurry?

- Is he gone?
- Halfway to Buy Me Toys by now.

Damn, that bastard's faster
than Walt Flanagan's dog.

-[ T.S. ] What the hell happened to him?

451

The human brown-eye here
is a walking calamity.

452
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:25,536
We gotta take a pass on stage
trashing business, otherwise
he's liable to kill himself.

- Sorry, bro.
- No hard feelings. Isn't that Rene?

454
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:33,118
[ Brodie ] Oh, yeah. She's probably
looking for me. I better go talk to her.

I don't know. She's with somebody.
Wait a minute. Isn't--

- Could be. It'll explain
why he hates me so much.

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,169
There's one way to find out.
Can you run interference with the lug?

00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:52,002
- What are you gonna do?
- Get some answers.

460
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:08,482
You work at the Fashionable Male,
don't you?

461
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:11,185
Yeah. So?

462
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,752
Uh, that's a great store
you got there.

463
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,199
Thanks. Listen, I'm trying to spend
my lunch hour with my lady friend.

So, why don't
you beat it?

and get the hell outta here,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

"The customer's always right"?
-[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

Let me tell you something.
The customer's always an asshole!

-Jesus Christ!
-What the hell gives with the cover boy?

471

None of your business, but he'll kick
your ass if he knows what you pulled.

472

Are you insane? The guy looks like
a date rapist. Is that my jacket?

473
00:32:56,872 --> 00:32:59,773
- Start the elevator.
- Not until you tell me the situation...

with you and
the Sperminator!

- Since I mustered the good sense
to send you packing.

- He's a much more suitable
companion than you any day.
- Are you nuts?

477
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:13,147
The guy's pure testosterone. He's
a walking hard-on looking for a hole.

478

I'm need testosterone after baby-sitting
you. I forgot what real men were like.

I can't believe you have the nerve
to come to my mall and pick up guys!

Oh, no. Shannon did the
picking up. He's already taken
me to lunch at the Cheese Haus...

in that shitpit dirt mall has
the latest Godzilla bootlegs?

Do you call eating pizza in the same
dive pizzeria every night eating out?

to his mother.
- Really?

He was at work by 9:00 this
morning, unlike my ex-boyfriend
who would sleep until 1:00...

495

she's looking forward to it.

563
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:35,629
It'll give her a chance
to find herself a decent guy.

564
00:38:35,698 --> 00:38:39,031
- Somebody with a brain.
- So you admit it. You
are behind our break-up.

565
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:43,765
Admit it? Hell, I'm as proud of it
as I am this game show here.

566
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,838
T.S., listen to me.

567
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,573
It's over between you two.

568
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:56,243
The sooner you get that,
the better off we're all gonna be.

569
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:00,049
Understand me?
You don't.

570
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:03,853
[ Sighs ] Guard, come here.
Get this guy off my set.

571
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:08,056
If he gives you any shit, you have
my permission to castrate him.

572
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,463
- [ T.S. ] You can't do this!
- I just did.

573
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:18,830
- Get me LaFours.
- Right away, sir.

574
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:20,864
Well, go on!

575
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:23,865
- How 'bout these?
- Very sexy.

576
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:26,926
- That sounds convincing.
- I'm preoccupied.

577
00:39:27,004 --> 00:39:30,496
T.S., she told you.
She's doing it as a favor to her father.

578
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:33,566
- Regardless--
- It's not like she'll
fuck the guy on public access.

579
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:36,169
- She might as well.
- You're overreacting again.

580
00:39:36,246 --> 00:39:40,080
You know, that's why your relationships
fail. It's certainly why ours did.

581
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,246
You got bent out of shape the same way
over that costume party in high school.

582
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,449
You fucked Rick Deras
on a pool table with everyone watching.

583
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:50,857
It was a costume party, T.S.
No one could tell it was me.

584
00:39:50,928 --> 00:39:54,364
Besides, who else but you
remembers shit like that?

585
00:39:54,431 --> 00:39:58,299
- I would've been a sexy chick.
- Brodie, you remember
that costume party?

586
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:01,929
Might that have been the one where you
banged Rick Deras on the pool table?

587
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:05,702
- Nobody remembers that?
- How is it that you recall
the most trivial events?

588
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:09,507
I'll never forget it; how many
chances do you get to see
Smokey fuck the Bandit?

589
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,983
- Didn't I look just like Burt Reynolds?
- [ Both ] Except for the moustache.

590
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:16,383
They have a whole room
you're supposed to do that in.

591
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:21,390
Well, some pervert wanted
to see me naked so badly,
he busted in on me twice.

592
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,894
- This saves some of the effort.
- Oh. Oh!

593
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:28,659
How much longer we gonna be in
this chick store? I'm startin'
to get a mean hard-on.

594
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:31,326
Brodie, tell me
about the Rene breakup.

595
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:33,835
-I threw her away like a parking ticket.
-Ha!

596
00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:38,170
Don't front, Brodie. I talked to Rene's
cousin this morning. It was vice versa.

597
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:41,905
They certainly aren't acting broken up.
Ask him about the elevator.

598
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:46,416
- Tell me about the elevator.
- It goes up and down.
[ Imitating Rim Shot ]

599
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:50,783
- Rene seems so coarse anyway.
What was it like to date her?
- Ever slept with somebody?

600
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:54,153
- Uh, yeah.
- No, I mean really slept with somebody.

601
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:57,682
Beside them, not just fucked them
on a gaming table.

602
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,425
- We slept together one time
in high school, the ski trip.
- That was you?

603
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:06,094
Yes, Brodie, I have slept
beside many people.

604
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:08,694
You know how when someone
lays with their back to you...

605
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:12,139
and you lay behind them really close
and you throw one arm over them?

606
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:15,372
- It's called spooning.
- Yeah, but you gotta put
the other arm somewhere.

607
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:18,346
You can either lay on it
or shove it between your bodies.

608
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:21,043
The only other option is
to stretch it above your head.

609
00:41:21,118 --> 00:41:24,952
But sometimes my arm pops out
of socket when I'm sleeping like that.

610
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:30,483
So I was constantly searching
for someplace to keep my arm
while still laying close to her.

611
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,688
- And?
- What do you mean, "And"?

612
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:37,462
That's like a metaphor
for our whole relationship.

613
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:40,332
I'm all out. I'll meet you
at the food court.

614
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:45,536
I know exactly how he feels.
Excuse me. [ Crying ]

615
00:41:48,312 --> 00:41:51,008
Fill this with Coke,
no ice.

616
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:57,146
Want a sip of my soda?

617
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,780
[ Grunts ]

618
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:02,757
- [ Groans ]
- Smart-ass ex-boyfriend.

619
00:42:02,826 --> 00:42:05,488
- [ Groans ]
- Now, I got two things to tell you.

620
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:08,497
One: I don't like you.
I see you every week in this mall.

621
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:10,499
I don't like
shiftless layabouts.

622
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:13,502
You're one of these
loser fuckin' mallrat kids.

623
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,166
You don't come down here to work
or shop; you hang out all day,
act like you fuckin' live here.

624
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:21,267
I have no respect for people
with no shopping agenda.

625
00:42:21,345 --> 00:42:24,610
Is this is what's known
as motivated salesmanship? [ Groans ]

626
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:31,217
Rene told me to leave you alone,
but she's fuckin' clueless.

627
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:35,053
[ Groans ]

628
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:39,624
You see, Bruce...

629
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:43,826
I like to pick up girls on the rebound
from a disappointing relationship.

630
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,562
They're more vulnerable,
in much more need of solace.

631
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:49,299
And they're fairly open
to suggestion.

632
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:53,275
And I use that to fuck them some place
fairly uncomfortable.

633
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:55,868
What, like the back
of a Volkswagen?

634
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:59,643
No. Like someplace
girls dread.

635
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:03,351
Hey, whoa.
[ Laughing ]

636
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,719
- Did we ever get along?
- Once or twice.

637
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,850
-How come we went out as long as we did?
-You had cable.

638
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:13,692
- You gonna stay for the show?
- Absolutely not. As soon
as he gets back here, I'm gone.

639
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:17,131
T.S. Quint, where's
your sense of chivalry?

640
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,567
Oh, my God,
is that Brodie?

641
00:43:20,637 --> 00:43:22,662
You're fuckin' kidding?
The Easter Bunny did this?

642
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,402
All I said was "The Easter Bunny at the
Menlo Park Mall was more convincing,"

643
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:29,445
- and he just jumped the railing
and knocked me down.
- He's dead!

644
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:32,414
- Let it go. He's under
a lot of pressure.
- What happened to him?

645
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:35,542
- The Easter Bunny kicked his ass.
- I had it coming.

646
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,588
- Fuck all that shit.
Come on, Silent Bob.
- What really happened?

647
00:43:38,655 --> 00:43:42,386
The proprietor of Fashionable Male
beat a rain check into my stomach.

648
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,484
- Shannon Hamilton?
- You know that guy?

649
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:48,895
I went out with him after we
dated. He tried to screw me
somewhere very uncomfortable.

650
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:51,525
- Like the back of a Volkswagen?
- Sounds like his M.O.

651
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:53,660
- Can you get up?
- Am I still glowing?

652
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:55,967
Barely breathing.
Was Rene involved in this?

653
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,030
This was an independent
act of aggression.

654
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:01,043
He told me that his intentions
were to penetrate my ex-girlfriend...

655
00:44:01,111 --> 00:44:04,239
-in the most notorious of body cavities.
-Sounds like him.

656
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:07,806
- You better tell Rene.
- If she's not smart enough
to see him for what he is...

657
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:09,818
then she deserves
the discomfort.

658
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:13,879
I have had just about all
the discomfort I can stand for a day.

659
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:17,290
- I'm late. I gotta go.
- You're just gonna leave
with him in this condition?

660
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,922
- You gonna be okay, Brodie?
- Couple pins in the hip,
I'll be as good as new.

661
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:26,628
That's my boy. [ Kisses Cheek ]
Bye, guys. Be good.

662
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:30,503
Women. Always leaving you when you've
just had the crap kicked out of you.

663
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:35,011
You look like you're gonna live.
Stay here. I gotta hit the bathroom.

664
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:38,172
Please, don't say "hit."

665
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:41,183
[ Woman ] # Here comes
Mister Easter Bunny #

666
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,846
All right, honey. Don't forget to look
for your Easter eggs on Sunday.

667
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:48,186
-Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.
-[ Easter Bunny ] All right, who's next?

668
00:44:48,258 --> 00:44:50,624
It's hot
in this goddamn suit.

669
00:44:50,694 --> 00:44:54,630
Hey, guys, wait in line like
everybody else. What the hell is this?

670
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:57,258
This is for Brodie.

671
00:44:57,334 --> 00:45:00,326
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Easter Bunny Groaning ]

672
00:45:00,403 --> 00:45:03,839
[ Children Yelling ]

673
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,471
Oh, God.

674
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:11,605
- He's here.
- What?

675
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:15,640
- Him and Brodie.
- Don't sweat it. He's leaving. Oh.

676
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:18,552
He seems really broken up
over this whole thing.

677
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:21,557
Maybe because we're broken up
for good this time.

678
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:26,927
I remember when I dumped T.S.,
I was all right with it
until he started dating you.

679
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:30,057
- A little jealousy residue?
- I thought so, at first.

680
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:33,068
Then I realized
it was more than that.

681
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:36,071
When I saw how he was with you, how
well you two complimented each other...

682
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,539
it finally hit me
that T.S. is a great catch.

683
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:41,042
[ Laughs ] Gwen, you were always
cheating on him.

684
00:45:41,111 --> 00:45:44,911
Capricious youth. Doesn't mean
I wasn't regretful about it.

685
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:49,475
Jesus, Gwen, the last thing I need at
this point is a lecture on my love life.

686
00:45:49,553 --> 00:45:52,579
All I'm saying is that the really
good guys are few and far between.

687
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:55,819
In fact, I haven't
met one since T.S.

688
00:45:55,892 --> 00:46:00,454
Even if I did meet one, I'd use
him as a basis for my comparison.

689
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:04,626
- You can have him if you want him.
- I might consider trying.

690
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:07,499
If he weren't
so hung up on you.

691
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,705
Well, I gotta get home.

692
00:46:11,775 --> 00:46:14,801
- Have a great show.
- Okay. Bye.

693
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:27,712
[ Sighs ]
Chocolate covered pretzel?

694
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:30,555
This is Roddy,
Mr. "Zvening's" assistant.

695
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:35,121
- Mr. Svening would
like to have a word with you.
- Where?

696
00:46:35,198 --> 00:46:38,497
- These are melting.
- Copy that. By the stage.

697

Tell him I'll be there
in a minute.

698
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,436
- What do you think?
- I don't trust it.

699
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:48,807
Maybe he's calmed down.
We'll talk about it reasonably.

700
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:51,871
Reasonably, schmeasonably. You should
go over there and give him shit.

701
00:46:51,948 --> 00:46:53,618
- I'm trying to marry his daughter.
- So you can't scream at him.

702
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,415
- I'm trying to marry his daughter.
- So you can't scream at him.

703
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,287
- But after all he's done to you,
you should stick it to him.
- How do I do that?

704
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:01,848
- You stink-palm him.
- Stink-palm?

705
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:04,190
You take your hand
and you stick it in your ass.

706
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:08,096
You been walkin' all day and you're
nervous, so you'll be sweaty as hell.

707
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:11,226
You should see yourself. A grown man
with his hand down his pants.

708
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:13,237
I probably look like
my old man.

709
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:17,833
You shake hands with the guy.
"Hey, Mr. Svening. How've you been?"

710
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:20,537
- What's the point?
- You know how long it takes
for that smell to come off?

711
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:24,013
Scrub all you like,
it'll stick around for two days.

712
00:47:24,082 --> 00:47:26,050
How does he explain it
to his colleagues and family?

713
00:47:26,117 --> 00:47:28,176
They'll think he doesn't
know how to wipe his ass.

714
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:32,622
- Meanwhile, you are left with
a hand that smells like shit.
- Small price to pay...

715
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:36,718
- for the smiting of one's enemies.
- I think I'll pass.

716
00:47:36,795 --> 00:47:39,764
Do me a favor.
Stay here while I go talk to him.
