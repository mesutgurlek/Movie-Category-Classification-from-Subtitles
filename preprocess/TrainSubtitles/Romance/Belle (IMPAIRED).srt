- A lady.

To inherit the entire
Ashford fortune.

He has much to recommend him.

278
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,719

what is the importance of the <i>Zong?</i>

Well...

304
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,064
it is a ship.

305

I am aware of that.

306
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,226
It is... a human cargo ship.

307
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,261
Oh.

308
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,986
It... it lost most of its slaves
before arriving at its destination.

309
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,906

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,708
Permit me to ask, but...

318
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,479
why do you not dine
with your family ever?

319
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,319
That is not correct.

320
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,919
Forgive me but twice now I have seen
you separated from the gathering.

321
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,479
I am confounded.

322
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,599
And well you might be...

323
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,950
when the son of clergy is permitted to
the table before a lady of the house.

324
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,359
Is that a reminder of my place?

325
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,311
No. It is a statement of mine.

330
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,079
Your ruling could bring the
slave trade to its knees...

331
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,399
entirely destroying an economic
foundation of this land.

332
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,239
Is that pressure not
maddening, my Lord?

The insurance claim states

336
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,399
the slaves were thrown overboard
for the safety of the ship.

337
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,559
That there wasn't sufficient water
to survive the rest of the voyage.

338
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,919
- It does.
- Then, if I'm correct, the case hangs on...

339
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,199
it hangs on 'absolute necessity'.

340
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,039
If the killing of the negroes
was truly necessary...

341
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,359
to save the ship, as
the captain contends.

342
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,959
But is that where it hinges?

343
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,740
No man happily
disposes of his cargo.

344
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,119
Let me ask you: were
you to enter a port...

345
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,108
with barely one piece of merchandise
left to trade, what would you do?

346
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,103
Swallow financial ruin or seek
recompense from your insurer?

347
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,064
With due respect...

348
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,424
I should question whether human life
should be insurable as cargo at all.

349
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,423
A gentleman rather like him
once showed me great interest.

350
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,999
Mr. Davinier?

Really, Mary?

352
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,942
Well, don't look at me like that.

353
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,461
It was my mama who intervened.

354
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,469
I thought he had a very
great sense of duty.

367
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,429
I was curious.

368
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,581
Quite a task... to sit
for so many hours.

Of course.

Perhaps yours is a life less
concerned with such matters.

Why do you judge me so?

373

It is a fact that I have contemplated
on the matter for many hours and I...

374
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,439
I do not think the
slaves could have been

375

into the waters...

chained together as one.

387

worth more as dead insured merchandise,
than as alive spoiled goods.

390
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,199
But the insurers are appealing?

They are refusing to pay
for murdered slaves.

Thank you.

You told her they were
wantonly drowned?

394
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,879
They were diseased, but it was essential
that they die on the journey...

395
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,559
or they would not come under
the insurance consideration.

396
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,639
Neither, too, if they had expired of their
diseases. That is why they were killed.

You have taken advantage of

Her precious care is in my hands...

ready for such realities...

I wonder whether the value you extend
to your very precious mulatto niece...

Any gentleman of good breeding...

would be unlikely to form a

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,986
I learned yesterday...
Mr. Davinier is in town.

635
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,266
I'm not surprised Dido is beginning
to sound very much like him.

LORD ASHFORD: I had the pleasure of
laying eyes on your adopted girl.

639
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,870
You have raised a lovely young lady and
though I understand she is kept under...

640
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,839
interesting rules, she
raises questions.

641
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,439
Oh?

642
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,399
Her introduction to society comes at
a key time in the insurance appeal.

643
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,559
Parliament is nervous
that the situation

644
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,759
in your family will
color your judgment.

645
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,199
I will not have pressure put on me,

646
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,519
either from the inside
or the outside.

647
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,319
You are the highest
judge in the land.

648
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,159
In you they see a man who is of the
persuasion and the power to bring down...

649
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,879
the greatest trade of our time and the
commercial health of this country.

650
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,799
Some will say that,
next to our King,

651
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,719
you're the most powerful
man in England.

652
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,399
And the same will ask how you,
our Chief Justice, can be fair?

653
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,759
There are rules in place
which dictate how we live.

654
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,839
If that were not the case...

655
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,119
I would not have had the mandate

656
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,239
to give shelter to my
nephew's daughter.

657
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,759
She is his blood and mine...

658
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,559
and is rightfully entitled to be
brought up on the family estate.

659
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,999
If the law supports the
<i>Zong</i> slave owners...

660
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,199
as strongly as Murray blood runs
through the veins of Dido Belle...

661
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,188
then make no mistake, the
insurers will be forced to pay.

796
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,110
Must not a lady marry even
if she is financially secure?

797
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,959
For who is she without a
husband of consequence?

798
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,199
It seems silly... like a free negro

799
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,839
who begs for a master.

800
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,141
Well...

801
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,265
unless... she marries her equal.

802
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,262
Her true equal.
A man who respects her.

803
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,940
I remember my father's eyes.

804
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,465
They were kind, gentle.

805
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,502
- A little like yours.
- Mine?

806
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,267
I mean... in color.

807
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,905
He showed me much love though
I only knew him a few hours.

808
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,630
What of your own mother?

809
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,359
I know very little of her

810
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,519
other than the color

811
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,981
she has given me.

812
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,945
Well then, at least you
know she was beautiful.

813
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,502
I am to marry... shortly.

814
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,344
Mr. Ashford.

815
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,101
Oh.

816
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,541
He is amiable and of good family.

817
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,866
Is it... what you want?

818
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,199
The alternative is
to replace Lady Mary

819
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,999
in her responsibilities at Kenwood.

820
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,159
But she's a spinster.

821
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,079
Papa did not trust I
could achieve a match

822
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,986
that would raise my
rank or even equal it.

823
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,906
You are above reducing
yourself for the sake of rank.

824
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,268
I pray he would marry you
without a penny to your name...

825
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,270
for that is a man who
would truly treasure you.

826
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,399
(SIGHING)

827
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,750
What if I shall never find someone
so incomparably suitable?

828
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,784
And wealthy?

829
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,919
What if he is suitable but you
do not feel 'yourself' with him?

830
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,020
Oh, Dido. He understood me.

831
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,799
And whenever he looked at me I
somehow felt better in this world.

832
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,759
I am convinced his
affections are growing

833
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,759
and I feel certain of my own love.

834
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,639
Oh, stop it! It is not love.

835
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,749
You stop it.

836
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,547
You know no more of love
than I myself, do you?

837
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,749
Do you, Dido?

838
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,461
No.

LADY ASHFORD: Oliver and Miss
Lindsay make a blissful match.

841
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,279
Exactly when is she due to
receive her inheritance?

842
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,106
And tell me, are you an only son?

843
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,079
I have 6 brothers, madam.

844
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,510
Six? Goodness. And...
are they all...

845
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,467
Older, madam? Yes.

846
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,825
Oh, do look. Here comes
the Baroness in her boat.

847
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,999
Oh, how dreadfully
wonderful, Lady M.

848
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,359
Your girl is a picture. An utter
picture. With her intended?

849
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,679
Indeed, Baroness Vernon.

850
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,119
And I see the other
does not give up.

851

So terribly endearing.

Mama, Mr. Vaughn approaches.

LADY MANSFIELD: I have checked,
he has no London home...

856
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,879
but he achieves an income of
no less than £4,000 a year.

857
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,182
Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield.

858
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,359
I trust your stay in London is
proving pleasant, Miss Murray.

859
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,469
Oh, most certainly.

860
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:48,311
I wonder if you might permit me to
call upon you at home... some time?

861
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,021
Oh.

862

With her Ladyship's permission?

863
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,302
I will make arrangements.

Good Lord, I forgot...

01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,661
you have ensnared my brother.

868
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,908
Tell me, are you to share his
dining room as well as his bed?

869
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,959
Oh, Mr. James, your manners are as
poor as your brother's finances.

870
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,959
And you are foolish enough to
marry him. I, on the other hand...

871
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,264
have no further use for
your impoverished cousin.

Now let me be clear...

1169
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,346
the loss of water on a ship constitutes
a singularly dangerous affair.

<i>to share diminished water reserve
amongst all those living, at best.</i>

Each implies a severe threat

because water supplies ran low.
