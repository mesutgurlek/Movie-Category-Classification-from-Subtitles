Then I found a lovely little park.

1307
01:48:40,112 --> 01:48:42,137
I sat down in the park

1308
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:46,114
and ate a sandwich that I'd bought.

It tasted very good.

a feeling came over me.

1319
01:49:37,403 --> 01:49:42,500
It was like remembering
something I'd never known before

1320
01:49:42,675 --> 01:49:45,041
or had always been waiting for,

1322
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:51,239
Maybe it was something
I'd forgotten

or something
I've been missing all my life.

But not too much sadness

Yes, alive.
