1
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:57,201
Look. This is a big claim. The cops
want to nail the guy who stole it too.

2
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,204
The difference is we have to make good
the 30, 000 bucks. They don't.

3
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,206
To them it's another heist.

4
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,000
Or, has the owner stashed it
away someplace,

5
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,878
and is she trying to defraud us
out of a lot of money?

6
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,506
If you have large sums
of cash around the house,

7
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,009
we would insist on certain
alarm and security precautions,

8
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,470
which my supervisor
would have to approve.

9
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:21,016
What we usually do in a case like this
is handle the installation ourselves.

10
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,688
Sweetheart, can I get you?
John, can I bother you for a minute?

11
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,941
- I haven't had lunch yet.
- What do you want?

12
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,320
Let me have a cherry cheesecake, a prune
Danish and a couple of Hershey bars.

13
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,532
And I should have something sweet. Let
me have some chocolate-covered raisins.

14
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,825
- I found the missing Picasso.
- I don't believe it.

15
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,703
I-- It's at Galaxy Opticals.

16
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,747
They cut the thing out of the frame.

17
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,874
They rolled the canvas up,
and it's in one of the telescopes.

18
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,669
- How'd you figure it out?
- It wasn't easy.

19
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,797
I'm supposed to be looking
for a picture of a woman with a guitar.

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,051
But it's all little cubes.
It took me two hours to find the nose.

21
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,221
- You should call the cops.
- Yeah, right away.

22
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,390
Would you excuse me?

23
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,435
Rosie, would you get me the fingerprints
on the Leland claim?

24
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,897
- Who won the sixth race at Aqueduct?
- Your horse came in seventh.

25
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,984
Seventh? Never bet on a horse
who has Parkinson's.

26
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,028
Congratulations. I heard
you recovered the stolen Picasso.

27
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,407
- Yeah, congrats on the art burglary.
- It was a breeze.

28
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,450
C.W., I brought you something
till your order gets here.

29
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,536
Thank you.
You want to be my date tonight?

30
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,538
- What's tonight?
- George's birthday.

31
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,082
- We're taking George out.
- All right. I'd love to.

32
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,626
But you have to have me home
and in bed by midnight.

33
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,171
That's exactly what I was planning.

34
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,924
[Man] My God, that girl's got
a body that won't quit.

35
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,553
Quit? It won't take
five minutes off for a coffee break.

36
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,556
- Oh, Briggsie, I forgot to tell ya.
- What?

37
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,058
- Hey, where are my-- Rosie!
- What?

38
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,228
- Where are my files? Where's my files?
- They're moved.

39
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,272
- What do you mean moved?
- They're all moved.

40
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,274
- Why?
- They're streamlining.

41
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,944
- This is Fitzgerald?
- Who else?

42
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,918
Did you take the files
out of my office?

43
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,837
Would you like to go out and try
coming back in like a human being?

44
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,925
- Did you move my files?
- if you don't like the human
idea, come in like an orangutan.

45
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:22,137
- That would be a step up too.
- Put them back... now-- this instant.

46
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,223
You knew we were
rearranging this floor.

47
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:28,685
Take my files--
Put them back in my office now.

48
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,896
You had plenty of time
to transfer them yourself.

49
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,774
Fitzgerald, if you were a man,
I would slam you in the teeth.

50
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,027
If I was a man,
you'd be hiding under the desk.

51
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,822
- This is what you do
- when I give you an order?
- Give me an order? You?

52
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,242
Who do you think I am,
some peroxide little stenographer...

53
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,827
with her brains in her sweater
whose rear end you pinch?

54
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,413
Pinch it?
I couldn't get my arms around it.

55
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,999
I don't take orders from you.
I work directly for Mr. Magruder.

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,210
We're in the process
of turning this place around.

57
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,297
I've been working here 20 years.
You're here six months.

58
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,008
I'm not interested in
your ideas about turning--

59
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,886
Get my files. Put 'em back now.

60
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,681
- Or what?
- "Or what?"

61
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:10,519
This is the question
you ask me? "Or what?"

62
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:15,232
"Or what?"
Are you saying "or what" to me?

63
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,318
If you don't get off my toe,
you're going to be singing
castrati with a glee club.

64
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,281
I... hated you, Fitzgerald, from
the day you set foot into this office.

65
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,700
You'd hate any woman who doesn't have
a double-digit I. Q

66
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,702
I'm a good judge of character.

67
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,205
I hate you, and I hate the chancellor
of Germany...

68
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,624
with the little mustache,
but not in that order.

69
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,626
Be careful when you leave.

70
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,045
Don't let the door hit you on the back
and fracture your pelvis.

71
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,924
So, did you tell her who's boss?

72
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,968
Is she kiddin',
talkin' to me like that?

73
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,012
It's 'cause she thinks she's smarter.

74
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:48,724
'Cause she graduated from Vassar,
and I went to driving school.

75
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,352
Does she have any idea
how many cases I cracked here?

76
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,605
Never trust a woman who
whistles for her own cabs.

77
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,607
[Boy]
Excuse me. Miss Fitzgerald?

78
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,067
- Is that Miss Fitzgerald's lunch?
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,070
- Sorry we're so late. We're jammed up.
- That's okay.

80
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,531
- Here. Keep that. It's for you.
- Thanks.

81
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,992
This is Fitzgerald's lunch.
She's been waiting a long time for it.

82
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,036
I'll deliver it to her.

83
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,914
You got to come to some terms with this
woman. This thing is only gettin' worse.

84
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,000
What do we need an efficiency expert
here for?

85
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,461
When the old man was here,
this never could have happened.

86
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,922
Thought you were gonna take her out
for a drink, clear the air.

87
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,342
I did. I took her two weeks ago
to Rocky's Bar.

88
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,886
You and Fitzgerald at Rocky's Bar?

89
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,304
## [Piano ]

90
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:27,930
## [Piano ]

91
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:41,443
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem. It's just
an hour and 15 minutes.

92
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:45,781
- My meeting ran long.
- I-- I understand.

93
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,701
We're revamping the offices, getting rid
of that antiquated filing system.

94
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:53,747
Yes? I can find anything I need.

95
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,626
I can locate it like that. I got a feel
for where all the stuffis in my office.

96
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,713
We're making a central data file on the
second floor. You'll get used to it.

97
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,174
What's the matter?
You look flushed.

98
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,427
No, I'm just--
I'm just a little warm. That's all.

99
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,013
You have all your
business meetings here?

100
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:15,435
It's near the office. The coat check
girl's pretty. don't you like it?

101
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,232
No, it's fine. Gives new meaning
to the word "dive, " but it's convenient.

102
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:25,612
I- I thought you'd appreciate
the thick smoke. You don't
have to put on as much makeup.

103
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,282
- [Man] What's the lady havin'?
- Tequila.

104
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,617
Hmm. Tsk.

105
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,828
So, um--

106
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,291
Betty-- Betty Ann--

107
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,460
Um, c-can-- s-should I call you--

108
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,464
I can call you Miss Fitzgerald,
which is fine with me.
I have no problem with that.

109
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,385
I-- I--
Tell me about yourself.

110
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,598
- Myself?
- Your hopes, your dreams, you know.

111
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,893
You married?
I mean, obviously you're not married,

112
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,897
'cause then it would not be Miss
Fitzgerald, so you have a boyfriend?

113
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,232
Is this why you got me here?

114
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,611
I just, um-- So--

115
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,239
What is your life like?
I mean, do you have any hobbies?

116
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:13,368
- I have a meeting in 15 minutes, so--
- I-I-I-I--

117
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,163
Not-- I didn't mean to ask
about your marital status.

118
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,042
That's none of my business. Maybe
you're-- It's a touchy point with you.

119
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,878
You're possibly divorced or widowed.

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,715
Maybe your husband committed suicide.
I could understand that.

121
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:31,261
Mr. Magruder hired me to streamline
the office, and I'm going to.

122
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:36,099
But if something is not broken, you know
what I say? I say, why fix it?

123
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,394
There's a reason North Coast has slipped
from the top five insurance companies.

124
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,105
There's an enormous amount
of waste and duplication.

125
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,233
Yeah, not-- not in my department.

126
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,402
There's not a single department
that couldn't be run more
efficiently or economically.

127
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,572
I'm not even sure North Coast
wouldn't be better off not carrying...

128
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,742
an investigative division and just
farming out each case privately.

129
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,747
[ Stammers ]

130
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,961
Would it be possible to meet at some
point and have a drink and discuss that?

131
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,797
- We are having a drink.
- [ Exhales ]

132
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,466
Look, I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

133
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,969
I think you came in here
like a steamroller--

134
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,013
You felt threatened by me
from the first day I got on this job.

135
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,476
Not only was I an efficiency
expert and a challenge to your
little state within a state,

136
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,604
but I'm not one of those windup dolls
you can tickle at the water cooler.

137
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,148
I'm smarter than you. I'm faster.

138
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,235
I can see right through you.
You're right to feel threatened by me.

139
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,656
I... am threatened by you?

140
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:38,078
It's fascinating, as a female
executive, how many men I meet
with a fragile masculinity.

141
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,122
A fragile masculinity?

142
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,500
You make one more crack about
my religion, and woman or no woman--

143
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:48,005
- I have to go.
- Hey, listen, honey,
- let me level with you here.

144
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,633
Despite all your high falutin talk
about streamlining the office,

145
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:55,304
what you really need is
a good old-fashioned roll in the hay.

146
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,639
Ha! You wouldn't know
which end is up.

147
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,684
Well, in your case,
it would be hard to tell.

148
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,187
Don't bother seeing me to the door.
Someone might think we're together.

149
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:07,274
- Why? Do I look like an organ grinder?
- No, just an organ.

150
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,319
- So the drink didn't smooth things out.
- No, not exactly.

151
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,446
You better get used to her,
'cause she's here to stay.

152
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,700
There's something about that broad that
I don't trust. She's got an evil streak.

153
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,621
We got a reservation for 8:00
at the Rainbow Room for George's 50th.

154
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,706
That'll be fun.
We'll split a cab uptown.

155
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,878
C.W. I'm not going to have time to go
home to change, so does this look okay?

156
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:32,257
Sweetheart, no matter how bad
the economy gets, you will never starve.

157
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,259
Good.

158
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,182
Oh, wait. Come here.
Miss Fitzgerald? Okay, take a card.

159
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,976
You gotta see this, Fitz.

160
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,978
All right, that's a six of hearts.

161
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,482
- That's amazing. How'd you do that?
- It's magic.

162
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,361
- He could do it all afternoon.
- I want you to teach me.

163
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,531
Mr. Magruder, I'll have that report
for you first thing in the morning.

164
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,575
Fine. Are you coming to celebrate
George Bond's birthday with us tonight?

165
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,786
Not really.
I'm up to my neck in work.

166
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,038
Why don't you come?
It'll be fun. George is a great guy.

167
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,582
Most of the personnel
here seems very nice.

168
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,544
The only one that gives me
the dry heaves is Briggs.

169
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,797
C.W.? He's cracked a lot of cases.

170
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,466
Of course, I don't see how.
Such a drone.

171
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,846
Gets his tips from street contacts
like ex-cons and blind beggars.

172
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,223
There's something about him
I don't trust.

173
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,392
- Any examples?
- Many.

174
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,062
He's smarmy with those office wisecracks
and double-meaning jokes.

175
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,106
I mean, who is he, really?

176
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:34,236
He's this shallow,
skirt- chasing egomaniac who's
probably more lucky than good.

177
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,073
Sometimes it's better to be lucky.
I think you're being too rough on him.

178
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,410
It's more that he's just
kind of a schnook who’s more
insecure than anything else.

179
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,620
He's got no wife, no family.

180
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,957
Well, he was married.
Short and stormy. Picked a tramp.

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,334
- That's a surprise.
- Excuse me, fellas.

182
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,131
Come tonight.
It'll give us a chance to be together,

183
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,968
and I have the perfect excuse at home--
an employee's birthday.

184
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,305
- How much longer is this gonna go on?
- Not longer, Betty Ann.

185
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,057
I'll be free by the end of the year,
and then we can be together openly.

186
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:08,270
You love me, but you spend
all the important holidays with her.

187
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,398
Life can get so damn complicated
when you think it's simple.

188
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,483
Come tonight.

189
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,779
So we can eye each other and steal
touches and play little games in code?

190
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,990
Yes, that's part of the romance.

191
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,076
Someday we'll be able to look back
and know that at one time in public...

192
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,496
when one of us brought up the subject of
Paris, it meant at that very moment...

193
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,249
that we were dying to make love
with one another.

194
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,753
- You're such an adolescent.
- But cute?

195
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,053
[ Chattering, Laughing ]

196
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,435
- Look at this.
- Oh! Oh!

197
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,646
Happy birthday, George.

198
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,316
Here's to George Bond,
insurance man, father.

199
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:58,320
- Amateur magician.
- Please, no card tricks tonight, huh?

200
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,781
- Happy 50th, George.
- Thank you.

201
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,284
Everyone, I'd like to make
a toast to C.W. Briggs.

202
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:08,664
Thanks to you, the police now have
the stolen Picasso in their possession.

203
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,666
- Attaboy, C.W.
- C.W.!

204
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,836
By the way, where'd you come up with
the idea of looking in the telescope?

205
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,881
What I do is I put myself
in the criminal's position.

206
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,593
I try and anticipate what would he
do next, what his next move would be.

207
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,972
- I think like him.
- That's fantastic.

208
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,099
I would hate to have me after me.

209
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,394
- [ Group Laughing]
- [Woman ] Very good, very good.

210
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,939
What are you thinking, Mr. Magruder?
You look lost in reverie.

211
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,109
Sorry. I was thinking about
a column I read in the paper...

212
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,611
about all these Germans occupying Paris.

213
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,823
- Yeah, it doesn't look good.
- C.W., you ever been to Paris?

214
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,033
[ C.W. ]
I've never been out of the country.

215
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:49,288
Zero- dash-six, eight-dash-five,

216
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,331
eight, five, seven.

217
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,918
That's right. That's exactly correct.

218
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,049
And now for something I call
the power of the Jade Scorpion.

219
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,635
- For this I'll need a few victims--
- [Laughing]

220
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,347
I mean, volunteers from the audience
and help from a few nice people.

221
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:10,559
- Oh, yes.
- Go on.

222
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,936
- Sir?
- We got another one. C.W.!

223
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,898
- Go ahead.
- We got another one forya.

224
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,650
There's a sucker born every minute.

225
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:22,696
- Represent us well, Briggs.
- [Magician] Many years ago...

226
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:28,702
an emperor in China received as a gift
this precious pendant--

227
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,747
a Jade Scorpion.

228
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,541
It was said to possess
extraordinary powers--

229
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,419
the power to darken men's minds.

230
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,631
I can't get hypnotized.
I'm not a good subject.

231
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,966
[Magician ]
Eyes only on the scorpion, please.

232
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,092
Ears open only
to the sound of my voice.

233
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,010
Ears open only
to the sound of my voice.

234
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,429
Please, sir.
Sir, look at the scorpion.

235
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,933
The surrender of the mind-

236
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,811
The surrender
of the mind--

237
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:59,107
They resist and resist,

238
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,903
but the scorpion likes resistance.

239
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,406
[Magician ]
What is your name, sir?

240
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,492
C.W. Briggs.

241
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,036
What do you do, Mr. Briggs?

242
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,664
I'm an insurance investigator...

243
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,960
for North Coast Casualty
and Fidelity of New York.

244
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,338
- What is your name, miss?
- Betty Ann Fitzgerald.

245
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,508
I also work at North Coast.

246
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,553
- So you work together?
- I can't stand her.

247
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,555
- [Laughing]
- Oh, come now.

248
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,557
Don't pay attention to him.

249
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,561
He's a sleazy little megalomaniac
who's frightened of women.

250
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,604
- Enough. Sleep.
- [Laughing Continues]

251
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,815
Silence.

252
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,150
You are now at the
first level of trance,

253
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:46,029
but the Jade Scorpion wants you
to go to the deepest level.

254
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,574
When I say the word Constantinople,

255
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,702
you will instantly drop into
the deepest hypnotic trance.

256
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,413
All resistance will disappear.

257
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,582
When I say the word Madagascar,

258
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,877
you will go immediately to
the deepest level of hypnotic sleep,

259
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,588
and you will obey all my orders.

260
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:07,134
Ready now.
Constantinople. Madagascar.

261
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:12,139
C.W. Briggs and
Miss Betty Ann Fitzgerald,

262
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,642
I now pronounce you man and wife.

263
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:20,147
When I snap my fingers, you will awaken.
You will not know you were in a trance.

264
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,941
You will be madly in love
with each other.

265
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,403
You're on your honeymoon
on a deserted desert island.

266
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,405
Maestro.

267
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,034
The moon shines down
its magical glow...

268
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,077
on you two honeymooners.

269
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,205
You're deeply, deeply in love.

270
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,833
Are you ready?
One, two, three.

271
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,045
Awaken to your tropical paradise.

272
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,637
What are you thinking?

273
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,559
I'm thinking that...
I'm the luckiest man in the world...

274
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,187
to have you.

275
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,689
I'm the lucky one, C.W.

276
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:07,861
I was in love with you from
the first moment that I saw you.

277
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:12,699
Make love to me here under the stars...

278
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,244
- to the sound of the ocean.
- Miss Fitzgerald.

279
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,747
Aren’t you making a mistake?
I'm no longer Miss Fitzgerald.

280
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,918
- I'm Mrs. C.W. Briggs.
- Oh! Betty Ann!

281
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,255
- Make love to me here... now.
- Betty Ann.

282
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,550
Stop. Enough.

283
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,929
Unfortunately, every dream
must turn to reality.

284
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:38,392
When I snap my fingers, you will awaken
and have no memory at all of this event.

285
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,395
You will return to your regular lives
as they exist...

286
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:45,566
with whatever destinies await you, and
let us all hope they are pleasant ones.

287
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,901
Are you ready to awaken?
On the snap of my fingers.

288
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,571
One: You're
beginning to come up.

289
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,073
Two: The memory
is fading completely.

290
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:58,161
Three: The Jade Scorpion
has created the miracle of love.

291
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,623
- And four: Awaken.
- [Applause]

292
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,751
- How do you feel?
- Still waiting for something to happen.

293
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,212
- [Laughing]
- How do you feel, miss?

294
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,757
- I'm afraid I'm not a very good subject.
- No, me neither.

295
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,428
- I told you this would not work.
- Well, I tried my best.

296
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,265
Come on, George. Back me up.
Briggsie, I'm tellin' ya.

297
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,642
You gazed deeply into her eyes
and told her you loved her.

298
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,729
You're crazy.
I would never do such a thing.

299
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,148
This is a conspiracy
to make me appear crazy.

300
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,692
I hope somebody talks to me
like that someday.

301
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,777
I can't bear Fitzgerald.

302
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:35,782
Speaking of that, isn't it-- Should we
be getting home to, uh, feed your cat?

303
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,994
That would be fun,
but I'm getting a cold,

304
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,872
so I just want to get to bed
with some tea, you know?

305
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,626
If you've got a cold, somebody's
got to rub your chest down with Vicks.

306
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,337
- This is what I'm for.
- Anybody rubs my chest down
better bring a ring.

307
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,380
Good for you.

308
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,180
- Good night, baby.
- Good night, Chris.

309
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:01,808
I knew we'd get a little time
alone tonight if you came along.

310
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,852
I'm glad I came.

311
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,177
[ Sighs ]

312
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,015
[ Exhales ]

313
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,021
[ Ringing ]

314
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,112
[ Sighs ]
Hello?

315
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,657
Constantinople.

316
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,326
You are in a deep trance.

317
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,497
You will fall deeper and deeper
under the sway of my words.

318
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,834
You will obey
my instructions carefully.

319
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,420
You will proceed to
the Kensington estate...

320
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:16,466
where you will obtain the jewels-- all
the jewels-- from the Kensington safe.

321
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,261
You will do this
with the utmost secrecy,

322
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:23,098
using all the information
and techniques at your command.

323
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,934
You'll do it with
great ease and facility.

324
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:30,189
Then you will return to your apartment,
taking the jewels with you.

325
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,692
You'll hide them in
a safe and secure hiding place,

326
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,695
awaiting further instructions from me.

327
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:40,282
You will then fall into a deep slumber
from which you will awake refreshed,

328
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,994
and you'll have no memory
of anything that has occurred.

329
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,455
You will wait to hear from me again.

330
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:51,502
Your life will be simply as
your life is until you hear from me.

331
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,755
Remember. You will obey
my instructions to the letter.

332
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,258
You will remember absolutely nothing
that occurred under trance.

333
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,469
Is that clear to you?

334
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,513
Very clear.

335
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:06,558
Go. The Jade Scorpion commands it.

336
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,744
Awfully late, Mr. Briggs.

337
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,746
Hot on a case, eh?

338
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,041
The Kensington safe
was broken into last night.

339
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,670
Somebody got on the estate.
Jewels worth millions, all gone.

340
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,048
The cops don't have a clue,
and Magruder is numb.

341
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,052
I don't understand.
I made that place burglar proof myself.

342
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,180
Well, tell that to the perpetrator.

343
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,601
We are on the hook for big money here,
so you better get over there darn fast.

344
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:36,523
By now those stones could be
on the market in Tangier or-- or Cairo.

345
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:41,486
Everything, everything--
My emerald tiara and my sapphire
necklace from India--

346
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,239
That sapphire is the most
perfect in the world.

347
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,867
No fingerprints,
but we got a partial shoe print.

348
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,203
- Man or woman?
- I really can't be sure.

349
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:52,206
I want to interview everybody
that works here-- the whole staff--

350
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,583
the butlers, the gardeners, everybody.

351
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,545
- Something's goin' on.
- This time I think your gut
reaction is betraying you.

352
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,590
Nobody in this house is involved.
I'd bet my life.

353
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,343
I want to search the up--
I want to go up-- Can I go upstairs?

354
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,762
If you must,
but would you make it fast?

355
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,805
We've had enough excitement
for one day.

356
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,518
Mrs. Kensington, you know
Alfie and I would never--

357
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,770
Lotte, of course not.

358
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:29,034
What are you doin'
in my mother's closet?

359
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,078
Well, hello.

360
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:37,167
You're one of those grubby little
private detectives, aren’t you?

361
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:42,130
A private eye, they're called,
a shamus, a gumshoe.

362
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:45,801
Oh, I'm-- I'm a grubby little
insurance investigator.

363
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,263
The private eyes are romantic.
I- I-I'm just grubby.

364
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,307
So what? You always get your kicks
fondling women's shoes?

365
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,852
Once in a while I'll fondle
the whole woman, you know--

366
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:58,313
Hmph. You have a fresh mouth.
I'm not sure I like you.

367
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:03,652
Well, I tend to grow on people.
We could meet later, and I could
grow on you, if you like.

368
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,488
You don't seem tough enough
to go after criminals.

369
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,491
Really? Maybe if I slapped you around
a little bit, you'd change your mind.

370
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:14,162
- I could slap you back.
- It's starting to sound like fun.
Should we put some music on?

371
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:18,584
- Why are you snooping around?
- You're Laura Kensington, right?

372
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:23,755
Yeah, that's right, and I have a
strawberry mark on my thigh to prove it.

373
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,843
- Would you like to see it?
- Maybe later when
I can take the full tour.

374
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,346
Huh. My fiancé
might not appreciate that.

375
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:35,684
- Yes? Which one?
- Oh, so you follow my life.

376
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,187
Well, I read the tabloids,
if that's what you mean.

377
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,190
So you've seen photos of me
diving into public fountains.

378
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:45,861
And getting arrested for speeding
and throwing champagne at El Morocco.

379
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:50,824
And while I'm out living the
fast life, you're hard at work
snooping in people's closets.

380
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,410
Can I help it if they
pay me by the clue?

381
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:58,373
- Did the burglar leave any?
- He didn't leave any
because he's still among us.

382
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:03,086
- Says who?
- Says the little man
that lives inside me.

383
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:06,507
So you're C.W. Briggs.

384
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,511
I hear you’re a very sharp investigator
with an impressive record.

385
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,596
I looked forward to meeting you.

386
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,184
- They say I always get my man.
- Me too.

387
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,062
[ Exhales ]
Right.

388
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,982
I'm glad we could
have this little chat.

389
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:27,528
- Too bad there's a houseful of people.
- Where shall we go tonight?

390
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,781
Hmm? Chinatown or Harlem?

391
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,825
You prefer jazz or opium?

392
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:37,246
I prefer the rug
in front of my fireplace.

393
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:41,583
Oh, directly to your apartment, eh?
You always begin with the dessert?

394
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,920
Well, depends what I'm eating.

395
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:49,842
This will be a very interesting
experiment for me.

396
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:54,388
I usually prefer more attractive,
athletic, muscular men.

397
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:58,350
Maybe I could get in a few
push- ups before you came over.

398
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,186
I-- [ Clears Throat]
What about your fiancé?

399
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,940
If you don't invite him, I won't.

400
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,949
- Any leads?
- It's an inside job.
No question about it.

401
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:17,160
- That's not what the cops say.
- They're wrong. It's inside. I can tell.

402
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,371
- Are the Giants playing this afternoon?
- Yeah.

403
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:22,124
They're playing
the Cardinals in St. Louis.

404
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:26,086
Call my bookmaker Frankie. I want to get
a bet down. Hundred bucks on the Giants.

405
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,338
- On the Giants to win.
- To win, naturally!

406
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,382
What do you think, to place?

407
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,635
Mr. Magruder? Oh, tilt.

408
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,180
- Anything on the Kensington situation?
- It's an inside job.

409
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:40,267
- I bet my life on it.
- You bet your life on the Giants,
too, and they're in sixth place.

410
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,477
Can we talk without
the warden being here?

411
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,230
Please, Miss Fitzgerald
is a part of this company now.

412
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,983
We must all learn to
work together in harmony.

413
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,527
What makes you so positive
it's an inside job?

414
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,322
It couldn't be that smooth
unless it was inside.

415
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,158
Miss Fitzgerald is suggesting,
given the magnitude of the loss,

416
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,493
that we expand our investigation.

417
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,664
- Meaning what?
- I appreciate the value
of intuition to a point.

418
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:05,667
But we're moving into a decade
of scientific innovation.

419
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:09,880
Miss Fitzgerald has suggested
that perhaps we might
get you a little help...

420
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:13,467
by farming out part of the work
to an outside private detective agency.

421
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,803
- What?
- To help you-- test the waters--

422
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,806
see if a new approach
and fresh techniques make a difference.

423
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,808
Don't feel threatened immediately.

424
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,645
According to you, I'm only threatened
by women with high I. Qs.

425
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,647
Did you hire a female detective?

426
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,358
North Coast has got to get
with the progress of the marketplace.

427
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,485
There's a lot of money at stake here.

428
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,779
The more time passes, the colder
the trail grows. You know that.

429
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,199
So if the Coopersmith Private Detective
Agency makes a contribution, then fine.

430
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:39,284
If not, we're only out a few bucks.

431
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,246
The Coopersmiths?
Those guys are like Fric and Frac.

432
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,958
- They're sub-mental.
- We are moving into
a new decade, the 1940s.

433
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,001
That means things are different.

434
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,129
Do me a favor. Max Baer's
looking for sparring partners.

435
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,215
Why don't you go down to the gym?

436
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,843
You're the only person I've received
this kind of bitter resistance from.

437
00:27:55,968 --> 00:28:01,223
You're a dinosaur with your street ways
and disorganized hunt-and-peck methods.

438
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:04,393
Please. My father
always stressed harmony.

439
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,104
I gotta go.
I'm working on a case.

440
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,063


441
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,691


442
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,360
Watch out for the traffic.

443
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:17,573
Don't get hit by a bus,
your body mangled beyond recognition.

444
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:21,326
I ain't heard a word about any job.

445
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,997
Nobody tried to fence anything
or do any braggin'.

446
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:29,084
Charlie, you gotta help me with this.
Keep your ears open.

447
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:33,797
Anything you hear, I gotta know.
It's very important, okay?

448
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,884
Fifty? You must be desperate.

449
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:42,598
You know where to reach me. Keep eating
the carrots. I think they're workin'.

450
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,647
I think Joe said they're
all gone up there, Mr. Briggs.

451
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:54,276
I'm just gonna check something out.
I'll be down in five minutes.

452

[Door Opens]

453
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,041
You startled me.
I was working late.

454
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,753
Oh, 'cause Eddie said he didn't
think anybody was up here.

455
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:17,925
Well, I'm here. [ Chuckles ]
Obviously I'm here.

456
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,345
- What Are you so nervous--
- I'm not nervous.

457
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:26,642
Why would I be nervous? Working up here
alone, I didn't expect to see you.

458
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:30,979
Don't you work late all the time?
That's what they tell me.

459
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,357
What is this, 20 questions?
You scared me.

460
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,568
I'm working up here alone.
I'm filling out some reports.

461
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:40,113
What are you gonna do, ask Magruder
to take out all the water coolers?

462
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:43,075
Why don't you make your wisecracks
somewhere else? I'm busy.

463
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,328
I'm outta here.
You know, I-I-- Don't work too late,

464
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,872
'cause the bags under
your eyes are getting bigger.

465
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:52,125
Have a good evening, and
if you find you're going to have
a sudden coronary thrombosis,

466
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,379
you should probably drive
directly to the hospital.

467
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,719
[ Magruder ] You were right.
We shouldn't fool around at the office.

468
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,723
- He gives me the willies.
- He's a harmless sort.

[Keys Jingling]

470
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:34,877
- Hey. How'd you get in?
- It wasn't very hard.

471
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,254
Really? What'd you do, have
your father buy the building?

472
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,340
A small tip to the super
was all it took.

473
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,303
For you maybe. I give the super
a small tip, he spits on my shoes.

474
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:49,308
I brought some very expensive
Russian vodka, 120 proof.

475
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,352
Don't drop that, you know.
You're liable to blow up the building.

476
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:57,149
I got bored waiting. There's
nothing to read but detective
magazines and the racing form.

477
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,736
I got a deck of playing cards with naked
women on them. You could've, you know--

478
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:04,823
Let me guess.
You use it to play solitaire.

479
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,409
I used to date the six of spades.

480
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,620
I love where you live.

481
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:13,665
It's just what I thought it would be--
a grimy little rat hole.

482
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,168
Oh, thank you.
I'll tell my decorator you said that.

483
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,462
It's the effect we were going for.

484
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,256
You dying to see my,
uh, strawberry mark?

485
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,468
If it's in the same spot it was this
afternoon, I'd like to check it out.

486
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,428
This is truly a novelty for me.

487
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,640
I'm used to pent houses and yachts--

488
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:33,310
gorgeous European lovers who buy me
presents and sweep me off my feet.

489
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,356
And yet, somehow, I find it strangely
exciting standing here...

490
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:42,402
in a grungy hovel
with a myopic insurance clerk.

491
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:47,199
I know there's a compliment in there.
I just don't know where it is.

492
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:50,285
You gonna take that coat off?

493
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:53,747
It hasn't rained in
this apartment in 20 years.

Oh, well.

If I happen to pass away
while we're doing anything,

497
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:11,348
just have the embalmer
leave the smile on my face.

- [Phone Ringing]
- Perfect timing.

499
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,522
I'll slip into something a little more
comfortable, wait for you in bed.

500
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:23,277
More comfortable than that? What are
you going to put on, Jergens lotion?

501
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,489
- Hello?
- [ Magician ] Constantinople.

You are in the power
of the Jade Scorpion.

00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:34,288
You will proceed to
the Dill worth mansion.

504
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,208
You will enter and open the safe.

505

Have you ever heard of an Indian book
called the Kama Sutra?

I'm sorry, Laura, but we're going to
have to postpone our little rendezvous.

- Pardon me?
- I just recalled a previous engagement.

I hope you don't mind.

Thank you very much.
- You are jokin', of course.

I'll turn around and you can get
dressed, and please try and hurry.

- Have you got a loose screw?

Tonight was very meaningful to me.
Really.

I'll always think of it
in a very cherished way.

If you're in the neighborhood again,
drop in.

What's come over you?

Should you want any peanuts
to snack on on the way home,

I think I have a whole dish
of them in the other room.

You hate women, don't you?

Not at all. Actually,
they're a splendid gender.

Really. A very pleasant variation.

- I should have known.
- No, Laura, don't be cross.

Do drop in again in the springtime.
The oleander will be in bloom.

I'm going! I'm getting out!

526

I'm not used to getting kicked out of a
man's bed, but it could have been worse.

You think somebody from the
Kensington household came over
and pulled this one too?

have been grilling them all morning.

Geez. You mean--
I can't believe it.

538

She convinced Magruder
to put the Coopersmiths on.

- Hey, they called us.
- That was their first mistake.

Maybe they think you're slippin'.

- You know my brother Joe?
- The one that died at birth?

Yeah? What?
Wanna share them with me?

550
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:48,148
I'll let you know if they're real clues
or if you found your own laundry list.

551
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:52,653
We'd like to make this collar. It'd mean
a long-term deal with North Coast.

I hear they're makin'
some changes up there.

Fellas, I'm gonna
make this bust,

then you guys are gonna be back at your
old jobs tracking down lost poodles.

555
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:06,458
We had to laugh when we heard
you thought the Kensington heist
was an inside job.

I can see already we're gonna
be trippin' all over each other.

- One of us is gonna fall down.
- We don't plan on fallin'.

You're in over your heads--
all four of'em.

This is a very smart burglar.

who did it when you get a confession.

Belly button in or out?

00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,945
[Coopersmith] Now, if he's short
at that weight, he's fat--

566
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,947
too fat to squeeze
through the kitchen window.

567
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,991
Wanna show him the big clue?

568
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,119
What's the big clue? The guy
leave behind his birth certificate?

569
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,121
Show him.

570
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:48,083
No one in this house
was ever to Rocky's Bar.

Hey-- I've been to Rocky's Bar.

572
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:55,048
You got a matchbook. Big deal.
Six million people eat at Rocky's Bar.

We're gonna nail this guy.

574
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,554
The important thing is that you
don't think of us as competition.

575

Don't worry. I don't.

576

What are you so upset about?
We'll get the guy.

Can you believe she talked Magruder
into hiring these two jerks?

578
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,112
You've been moping around all day.

It's not like you.
What's goin' on?

580
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:23,785
- Al, I got a confession to make.
- What?

581
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:28,665
I woke up this morning. I found
this on the floor in my apartment.

582
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:33,337
- Yeah, so?
- I have no memory of being
with anybody last night.

583
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,131
Come on. How many times has that

acting so strange.

727
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,832
You have a Rocky's matchbook.
I saw you put it in your--

728
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,460
Remember we had a drink at Rocky's Bar?
It didn't go too well.

729
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:37,047
So you broke into my apartment illegally
and spied on me?

730
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:40,634
I wasn't spying. What's wrong with you?
I was rummaging.

731
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,595
- I'm a big rummager.
- You what?

732
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,600
I was rummaging in the afternoon.
I saw "dinner with my sister."

733
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:53,063
All those sisters- all those dinners-
Those were with Magruder, right?

734
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,065
Oh, God! I'm mortified!

735
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:59,069
Stop it. If it wasn't for me being here,
they'd be scraping you up with a spoon.

736
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:01,071
That's none of your business,
you slimy little weasel.

737
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,282
And over a jerk like Magruder.

738
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:07,077
He's not a jerk. He's wonderful.
He's twice the man you are, you roach.

739
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,164
Don't you see? He gives you these
stories so he can get into your pants.

740
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,251
- He's not gonna leave his wife.
- You witnessed my humiliation.

741
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:18,422
The only humiliating thing
is how this guy takes advantage
of a smart woman like you.

742
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:21,300
You're not fit to discuss
Chris Magruder.

743
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:24,428
Look at this. She still loves the guy.
I can't believe it.

744
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,723
Get out before I call the police
and have you arrested
for breaking and entering.

745
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:31,226
I'm not letting you alone here tonight.
Are you crazy? Look at you.

746
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,229
I'd ask if you had any friends,
but I know the answer.

747
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:38,901
- [ Groans ]
- Give me this. Jesus. What--

748
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:42,446
What-- [ Groans ]
Great.

749
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,241
- Are you okay?
- [ Sniffles ]

750
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:48,577
- Hello?
- Oh.

751
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,579
[ Sighs ]
Jesus.

752
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:18,607
- [Liquid Pouring]
- What the hell Are you doing here?

753
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:20,776
I'm making coffee.

754
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:23,111
Oh, God!
It's all coming back to me now.

755
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:25,864
You came here last night because
you thought I stole some jewels!

756
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:28,367
This happens to be
a very confusing case.

757
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,911
I'll say you're confused.
Why didn't you go home to sleep?

758
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:33,705
- Are you kidding?
- And let you do something crazy?
- Like what?

759
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:35,791
Like take a swan dive out the window.

760
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,918
How do you know I wouldn't take
a swan dive with you here?

761
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,797
- Because I watched over you.
- You stayed up all night watching me?

762
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,216
That's exactly right. Yes.

763
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,010
And you snore like a grizzly bear
with a sinus condition.

764
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:49,054
I had a bad moment last night.
I'm fine now.

765
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:52,683
- You talk in your sleep.
- You probably took notes,
- you suspicious little inchworm.

766
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:55,602
- Who's Rita?
- Rita's the woman
- my ex-husband ran away with.

767
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:59,231
- Anything else?
- You certainly know how to pick men.

768
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:01,400
Check your sex.
There's not a lot to pick from.

769
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,319
And you mentioned my name too.
I thought you were awake.

770
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:06,989
- You said that I should rot in hell.
- I was probably awake.

771
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,991
I figured you were feeling better.

772
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:13,412
Now, if you'll go, I gotta
be at work in 30 minutes, and
don't gossip about what you saw.

773
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:18,417
Nobody's gonna gossip.
I couldn't care less about your
life. It means nothing to me.

774
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,962
I couldn't stand you when I met you,
and I can't stand you now.

775
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:25,007
I find you obnoxious and pompous--
Do me a favor.

776
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:28,844
When you see me in the office-- do me
a favor-- walk the other way, okay?

777
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:32,097
And if Magruder tells you
he's gonna leave his wife,

778
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:35,601
if I were you,
I would keep my legs crossed.

779
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:38,020
Don't choke on your breakfast
and die of as phyxiation.

780
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:42,649
You'll wind up unable to
dislodge a large piece of toast,
no matter how hard you cough.

781
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,699
Mr. Magruder, you sent for--

782
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:55,954
Oh. If you'll all open
your hymn books to page 90--

783
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:59,541
Sit down, C.W.
We have a situation.

784
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,419
Your brother looks good.
The embalmer did nice work.

785
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:04,922
I'll let the Coopersmiths
bring you up to date.

786
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:09,510
After careful search, using some of
the most up-to-minute techniques,

787
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:11,595
we found some interesting clues.

788
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,056
Yeah? Leading to who,
Eleanor Roosevelt?

789
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:17,267
We got a shoe print off the
parapet at the Kensington place.

790
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:18,727
So?

791
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,855
An eight-and-a-half
"C" Florsheim cordovan.

792
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:24,316
Only worn by 20 million Americans.

793
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:27,611
I mean, I wear an eight-and-a-half"C"
cordovan Florsheim shoe.

794
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:31,323
For the money, you cannot
get a better shoe.

795
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:33,742
We also found a couple of hairs.

796
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:38,205
One on the rug at the Kensington
place, the other one actually
inside the Dillworth safe.

797
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,207
They match.

798
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,751
Forgive me if I'm not knocked out.

799
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:46,630
Oh, we don't mean just to each other.
They match yours.

800
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,466
Just like the eight-and-a-half
"C"cordovans.

801
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,178
Hey, fellas. I know you guys
are angling for my job--

802
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:55,764
We also got a fingerprint
off the matchbook.

803
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:58,392
You got a fingerprint
off a matchbook?

804
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:01,144
The Coopersmith lab uses
highly sensitive apparatus.

805
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,940
- You're not gonna tell me it's mine?
- It is, C.W.

806
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:08,443
Well, so what?
So I leave a footprint on the parapet,

807
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,154
or I inadvertently drop a matchbook.

808
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:14,116
The matchbook was found before
you got over to the place.

809
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:17,452
You guys don't doubt my honesty,
do you?

810
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:19,997
Let me tell you, I was
a Boy Scout for three years.

811
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,000
I got a number of merit badges
home, and my clergyman,

812
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:27,004
who happens right now to be wanted
for pederasty, will vouch for me.

813
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,048
Nobody's making any accusations.

814
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,718
You do have some outstanding debt
from expensive sports betting--

815
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:34,720
baseball, the ponies.

816
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:36,805
Are you guys investigating me?

817
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:41,935
C.W., I assure you, this is only
an inquiry in-house at this time.

818
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:45,606
We don't want the police
to know about it, and we're
not looking for bad publicity.

819
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:48,567
Miss Fitzgerald, what do you think?
Say something.

820
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,112
You're a bright woman.
You think I did it?

821
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:56,325
Please, C.W. let's not have
our daily bloodbath between
you and Miss Fitzgerald.

822
00:51:56,366 --> 00:52:00,037
- She's not an investigator.
- But she's a very bright woman.
- She's got a lot of ideas.

823
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,581
She was the one who brought these
two mouth breathers in on this case.

824
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:05,459
It's nothin' personal.
We're just building a case.

825
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,921
We all want to catch a jewel thief.
I'm on your side.

826
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,924
Fellas, I think
we gotta get team jackets.

827
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:17,638
I want a resume of every employee who
works here messengered to my apartment.

828
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,059
Don't worry, C.W.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

829
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,853
Oh, Miss Fitzgerald,
I wanted to meet with you later.

830
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:28,148
- About what, Mr. Magruder?
- Our Paris account.

831
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,192
As I recall,
that account is closed.

832
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:32,611
I have to see you later.
Just to talk.

833
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:36,406
I behaved like such a fool.
Later, f-for a drink. Just for a drink.

834
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,588
[Doorbell Ringing]

835
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,311
Oh. Well.

836
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,730
Can I come in?

837
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,233
Yeah, sure. I-I'm shocked.

838
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:13,235
I-- The place is a little messy.

839
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:16,363
if I knew you were coming, I would have
had the maid rearrange the dirt.

840
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,448
Are you alone?

841
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,534
Alone? Yeah. Of course.

842
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:24,079
I would have called, but I decided
it was safer to talk to you in person.

843
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:27,082
- What do you mean, "safer"?
- I can't stay long.

844
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,084
Why? You gonna meet
Magruder in Paris?

845
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,378
That's none of your business.

846
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,382
Thanks for coming to my defense today in
the office. It was really nice of you.

847
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,467
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

848
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:41,513
The Coopersmith brothers had Laura
Kensington in for questioning today.

849
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,057
She told them she was with you
the night before last...

850
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:47,978
and that you got a phone call
in the middle of the night
and began acting strangely...

851
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:50,856
and got rid of her because you
had to go someplace at midnight?

852
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,317
Well, let me tell you, she's lying.

853
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,278
- Why would she lie?
- Wh-- Use your head.

854
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,282
Would I kick Laura Kensington
out of my bed at midnight?

855
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:02,284
Even if the president needed me.

856
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:05,871
- Why Are you lying to me?
- Why did you come here
- with this crazy story?

857
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:08,415
Because i should have spoken up
at that meeting today.

858
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:10,876
Because while I think you're
a mealy-mouthed little...

859
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:14,046
- Reptile.
- reptile-- Thank you--
I don't think you're a jewel thief.

860
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,965
- What makes you so positive?
- It's too daring for you.

861
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,302
You're not romantic enough.
It requires flair and imagination.

862
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,638
My instinct's telling me
you're not the one.

863
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:25,265
- I didn't think you had instincts.
- I have them.

864
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:28,310
I don't usually trust them, especially
when it comes to sizing up men,

865
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,312
but this time I can feel it.

866
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,482
You're good at weaselly type things,
like snooping and spying.

867
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,692
You're not man enough
to be a cat burglar.

868
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:39,488
- You sound like you're attracted
- to men who break the law.
- We're not here to discuss me.

869
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,325
We're here to talk about what Laura
Kensington told the Coopersmiths.

870
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,452
Laura Kensington wasn't here.

871
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:48,622
She-- You're making--
Laura Kensington was not here.

872
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:51,667
She said she left her stocking here.

873
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,169
Hey, that could be anybody's.
I don't know--

874
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,255
A lot of women pass
through this apartment.

875
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:59,132
I'm not saying they're all winners,
but there's a lot of action here.

876
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,635
I 'm sure you're not overly particular.

877
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:04,304
Look. What do you want from me?
[Stammering]

878
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:09,101
I happen to enjoy the proximity
of a well-proportioned member
of the opposite sex.

879
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:13,647
That's how God created us,
and why should I be the one
to quibble with His concept?

880
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:17,025
I came to tell you a case is building
against you. Be honest with me!

881
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,486
- I'm honest. I'm honest.
- Where did you get this stocking?

882
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:21,488
It's some broad's.

883
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,533
The women that are here, they lose
an earring, a stocking, I don't know.

884
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,369
Laura Kensington says it's hers.
She also says she tipped the super.

885
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:30,747
He let her in here,
and that story checks out.

886
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,542
- Whoever that is, I'm not here.
- What? Wh--

887
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:38,172
- Who is it?
- It's Herb and Joe C.oopersmith.

888
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,215
I don't want to be seen here!

889
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:42,384
Why? What's the problem?
What am I, a leper?

890
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,012
You're under suspicion.
I would have a lot of explaining to do.

891
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,431
You know, I think you're still hooked
on Magruder.

892
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:50,017
That's why you don't--
Go down the end of the hall.

893
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,060
There's a bedroom.
Shut the door. Go in the bedroom.

894
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:55,063
Can I sit down in there,
or will I catch something?

895
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:58,066
Germs can't live in your bloodstream.
It's too cold.

896
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,909
[Herb]
Let's go, C.W. Open up.

897
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,952
Coming!

898
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:20,172
Hey, fellas.
You sure you got the right apartment?

899
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:22,925
The traps with the cheese
are in the basement.

900
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,260
- Can we come in?
- Now, wait a minute.

901
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:28,931
I got a chorus girl in the back room,
and if I don't hurry up--

902
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:31,433
Wouldn't be Laura Kensington,
would it?

903
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,519
Laura Kensington?
I don't know.

904
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:35,854
They all look the same upside down.
I can never tell.

905
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,940
She says she was here
the other night,

906
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:41,568
till you dumped her to go out on
mysterious middle-of-the-night business.

907
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:45,030
Hey, would I dump Laura Kensington?
I eat Wheaties.

908
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:50,327
Problem is, Eddie, the night guard from
the North Coast building, says you, uh,

909
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,622
made some strange middle-of-the-night
visits to your office...

910
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,874
both nights the robberies took place.

911
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:58,168
Fellas, I'd love to chat
with you, but, you know,

912
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:00,504
there's a nurse in
the other room there, and--

913
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:02,589
I thought you said
she was a chorus girl.

914
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:05,175
Who does a little nursing?
Give me a break.

915
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,136
Come on. We can discuss this
tomorrow, can't we?

916
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:11,223
I don't know how you can still make love
with this on your mind.

917
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:13,225
You know, you're facing
a long jail sentence.

918
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:16,061
That's exactly why I gotta
get in all I can now.

919
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:19,106
Yeah? Well, we're gonna turn this over
to the police tomorrow.

920
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:22,693
You can see. There's a case developing
that's pretty incriminating.

921
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,987
This is circumstantial evidence.
That's all you got.

922
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:28,740
Many a man's gone to the gallows
on circumstantial evidence.

923
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,742
Well, fellas, the gallows
are gonna have to wait,

924
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,662
because I got a cocktail waitress
in the other room now, and I--

925
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,415
- Cocktail waitress?
- Yeah, a nurse, you know,

926
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:39,001
who-- who's a little bit
of a chorus girl,

927
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:41,003
and she works a lounge now and then.

928
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:43,088
If you catch the jewel thief,
let me know.

929
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,215
- I'll get you both new yo-yos.
- Yeah.

930
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,596
They're--

931
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,184
- What is this?
- I was...

932
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:57,186
browsing through your bookshelf,

933
00:57:57,227 --> 00:58:01,815
and I found this deck
of naked playing cards and these.

934
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,817
This is-- What do you--

935
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:05,777
This is-- This is
the Kensington jewels.

936
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:09,281
This is the-- This is
the Dillworth jewels and the-- the--

937
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,325
This is--
What Are you--

938
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,912
What Are you looking
at me like that for?

939
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:19,208
Because you found them in amongst
my collection of female art studies?

940
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:21,210
What is the implication here?

941
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,212
I used to go with the six of spades.

942
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:25,964
Then the four of diamonds
caught us together and there was a--

943
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:29,468
I was aware that you sneaked up
mysteriously to the office
in the middle of the night...

944
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:31,470
and the lobby guard saw you.

945
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,972
I know you have Laura Kensington's
stocking, and she swears...

946
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:37,684
you kicked her out of bed to
take care of sudden business,
which your super corroborates.

947
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:40,646
They have a footprint,
a match book with your fingerprint,

948
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:44,191
and still I believed
that you didn't do it.

949
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:48,737
But now the actual stolen property
turns up hidden in your bedroom.

950
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,365
So what Are you saying?
This makes you suspicious of me?

951
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:55,327
I was actually a bit touched that you
stayed up all night watching over me.

952
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,748
I began to think, " Maybe he's not the
scummy little vermin he seems to be. "

953
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:03,043
I maybe a scummy vermin,
but I'm an honest scummy vermin.

954
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:05,671
- I didn't take these jewels.
- How can you deny it?

955
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:08,215
- You've been caught red-handed.
- Yes, I--

956
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:11,760
What-- I'm-- I grant you,
there's a fingerprint of me,

957
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:15,472
and they have a footprint,
and the jewels are in my bedroom.

958
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:17,474
This I give you.

959
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,270
- I'm starting to think
- I'm in tremendous trouble here.
- I'm calling the police.

960
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:24,565
No. Will you forget about logic
and give me the benefit of the doubt?

961
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:27,109
- Ha! That makes me an accessory.
- Not if I'm innocent.

962
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:29,361
You don't have a kosher bone
in your body.

963
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:33,073
That's exactly why you get your selves
into these problems.

964
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,617
That's why Magruder's
waiting for you, right?

965
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:38,787
You make all the wrong decisions
'cause you make 'em here, not here.

966
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:41,623
Decisions made here
are not as reliable as here,

967
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,251
because this is gray cells
and this is blood,

968
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,253
and blood circulates
through the body.

969
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:48,589
It gets around.
It knows what the score is.

970
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,550
But up here, gray cells
just lay there and think.

971
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:52,759
- You see what I'm saying?
- [Phone Rings]

972
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:55,804
- You see what I'm saying?
- [Phone Rings]

973
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,765
- Hello?
- Constantinople.

974
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,436
You will take the jewels,
each and every one of them.

975
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:02,477
You will take the jewels,
each and every one of them.

976
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,479
Make sure you have them all.

977
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:08,483
Wrap them tightly in brown paper
so it's impossible for anyone
to tell what they are.

978
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:12,487
Go to Grand Central Station.
Rent a locker. Lock them in.

979
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:16,116
Go home, taking the key with you,
and put the key in your mailbox.

980
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,744
Make sure to leave the mailbox open.

981
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:22,164
Then you will go into a deep,
refreshing slumber, and when you awake,

982
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:24,291
you will remember nothing
of what has transpired.

983
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:26,752
Is that clear?

984
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:34,134
Miss Fitzgerald?

985
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,471
Have-- Have I ever told you...

986
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:42,226
that you're one of the most
beautiful women I've ever met?

987
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:45,979
- I'm turning you in.
- No, I mean it.

988
01:00:46,063 --> 01:00:49,691
That's what made me first fall in love
with you is those beautiful eyes.

989
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,861
I can't believe it. You're actually
trying to sweet-talk me?

990
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:55,405
I resisted because, well, down deep...

991
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,407
I thought that you might hurt me,

992
01:00:57,491 --> 01:01:00,077
and I didn't want to put myself
in that position again.

993
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,287
C.W., let me set you straight
once and for all.

994
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:05,415
I wouldn't be interested in you
if you were the last man on Earth.

995
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,751
Not only that, I find it insulting
that you could think...

996
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,837
I would fall for such
a heavy-handed ploy.

997
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:12,005
What a low opinion
of me you must have.

998
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,924
Thank you for dropping by.

999
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:17,719
I'm a little busy right now,
but tomorrow night,
maybe we could have dinner.

1000
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:19,721
I know a candlelight restaurant.

1001
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:23,141
I could look into your eyes
and tell you how crazy about you I am.

1002
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:26,770
if I didn't know what a squirming
little trapped rat you were,

1003
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:28,772
I'd think you had a brain tumor.

1004
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:49,293
- You're late.
- God, I'm still trembling.

1005
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:51,378
Over last night?
I couldn't sleep a wink.

1006
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,755
It's not that, Chris. It's Briggs.

1007
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,468
He's guilty, isn't he?
It's a sad story.

1008
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,762
Please don't make me
go into all the details,

1009
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:04,683
but I wonder if he's having some kind
of mental breakdown.

1010
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:07,227
He may be realizing
the consequences of his deeds.

1011
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:10,105
- The Coopersmiths are closing in on him.
- Could he have...

1012
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:12,107
a split personality?

1013
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:15,736
A lot of criminals have been
known to play crafty games
when it suited their purposes.

1014
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:18,739
I need a drink.

1015
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,451
if I tell you something, do you promise
not to go off half-cocked?

1016
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:25,537
Okay, but hurry.
I've got some big news.

1017
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:27,581
- I found the jewels.
- What?

1018
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:41,929
And keep me apprised, will you?
Thank you.

1019
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:47,476
The police are on the way, thank God.

1020
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,478
It's an open-and-shut case.

1021
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,481
Much as I cringe at the publicity,
I'm elated at the recovery.

1022
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:55,943
It's clear there's
so much more to this, Chris.

1023
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:59,947
Oh, I've seen men driven to extremes
before being around big money.

1024
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,074
These guys earn their living exposing...

1025
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:05,577
all kinds of exotic schemes
to defraud and rob people.

1026
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,872
Sometimes they start thinking,
" Hey, I'm on the inside.
I know why these schemes fail.

1027
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,874
I won't make the same mistakes. "

1028
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:14,503
You're saying he's cracked
from so many years of hard work?

1029
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:18,966
He's a driven man.
Had a terrible marital experience.

1030
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,177
Turned him off women, except for
the little no-threat secretaries...

1031
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:24,680
and barflies he picks up.

1032
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:27,057
Crushed when he caught
his wife cheating.

1033
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,059
He's feeling older
and looks around and says,

1034
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:32,145
" Hey, maybe it's time
I get mine and get out. "

1035
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,606
Guy named Peterson
a couple of years ago tried the same.

1036
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,651
Of course, he's a houseguest
at Sing Sing these days.

1037
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:40,904
Well, I'm sure you know him
better than I do.

1038
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,031
It'll resolve itself.

1039
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:46,827
Um, Betty Ann, I spoke with Caroline.

1040
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:51,498
- You did?
- I told her I wanted my freedom.

1041
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,919
- Really?
- Isn't that fabulous?

1042
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:57,921
It's surprising.

1043
01:03:58,005 --> 01:03:59,923
I thought you'd be
knocked off your feet.

1044
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:03,051
Well, I mean, it was last night.

1045
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:05,596
- It's sort of like a roller coaster.
- Forget about last night.

1046
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,140
I knew I'd made a mistake
the minute I left your apartment.

1047
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,309
What did she say?

1048
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:13,187
I think she sensed
we'd been drifting apart.

1049
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,189
she was very poised.

1050
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,858
Said if I was sure
that's what I wanted, uh--

1051
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,570
- Thank you.
- I'll have another one of these, please.

1052
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,822
Sure.

1053
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:26,617
You're certainly not as euphoric
as I'd imagined.

1054
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,954
Well, you can't expect me to just
change gears and turn on a dime.

1055
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:34,249
- Have you changed your mind?
- Mmm.

1056
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,462
- No.
- You haven't met someone else, have you?

1057
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,547
No, no, I haven't.

1058
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:53,477
I don't understand, fellas.
What-- What's going on? What'd I do?

1059
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,397
Yes, those are the ones.
They were in his bookcase.

1060
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:02,319
He bets every day, and, uh,
and he usually loses.

1061
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,863
I knew he was into the bookmakers
for a bundle.

1062
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:07,908
Look, I was with him on Tuesday night
till about 12:00.

1063
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,995
Then suddenly he got a phone call
and he was like a different man.

1064
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,165
if It was anyone else but C.W.,

1065
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,085
we wouldn't even be discussing this.

1066
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,879
The jewels were in his locker.
It's an airtight case.

1067
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:23,423
Listen, fellas,
I know you guys wanted my job,

1068
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:26,051
but I could get 30 years
up the river for this.

1069
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,595
With good behavior,
you'll be out in 20.

1070
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:30,764
- [ Laughing ]
- I'll get you. No matter where you are.

1071
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:33,934
I'll check every low-I. Q club in town,
and I'll find you. I'll kill you.

1072
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:36,478
- Low I. Q Some genius.
- I'll kill these guys.

1073
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:38,981
- Take it easy.
- I'm not one to give pious lectures,

1074
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:41,483
but if you needed money,
you could have come to me.

1075
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:44,403
I would have listened.
I warned you about your gambling habit.

1076
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:46,697
Can’t you see
what a conspiracy this is?

1077
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,782
They plant a footprint
and a fingerprint,

1078
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,993
and the night watchman
forges my signature.

1079
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:54,997
It's easy. And this crazy girl
who smokes opium makes up a story.

1080
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,082
And Fitzgerald plants
the jewels in my apartment.

1081
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:59,960
There's a word for people who think
everyone is conspiring against them.

1082
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:02,045
- That's right. Perceptive.
- C.W.,

1083
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:05,716
you tried to swallow the key to
the locker at Grand Central Station...

1084
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:07,718
where we found the stolen goods.

1085
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:10,137
- You got any witnesses?
- Yeah, me!

1086
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:12,431
You gonna take your word over mine?

1087
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,474
Let's get him over to the courthouse
and book him.

1088
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:16,476
You better get a lawyer, C.W.

1089
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:18,520
I'm shocked.
This is one of my best men.

1090
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,023
You know how long I've known this guy?
Tommy, come with me.

1091
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,817
Yeah, Mike, I'm right behind ya.
I'm sorry about this, C.W.

1092
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:25,903
I'll make the arrangements.
Stick around.

1093
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:45,672
Well, well, well.

1094
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:48,091
if It isn't
Mr. Fast-Talkin' Investigator...

1095
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:51,178
who got caught with his hand
in the cookie jar.

1096
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:53,347
Did I really throw you out of bed?

1097
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:56,725
Why? You planning on using
the insanity defense?

1098
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:59,978
Listen, honey, I gotta get some help,
and you're gonna help me.

1099
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:02,689
- Am I?
- Yes.

1100
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,358
- And what makes you think that?
- This is your kind of thing.

1101
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:06,068
- And what makes you think that?
- This is your kind of thing.

1102
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,070
This'll look great on your resume.

1103
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:12,282
A suspected felon, a daring escape from
police headquarters, broad daylight.

1104
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:14,868
[Stammering]
You like this kind of thing.

1105
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:16,954
Go over to that top drawer over there.

1106
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,748
They took the handcuffs
outta the second drawer from the left.

1107
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,792
- There's gotta be a key in there.
- Nervous.

1108
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:25,629
See if there's a key.
Go. Hurry up. Come on.

1109
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:27,714
Don't-- Hur--
Gotta make this fast.

1110
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,800
Otherwise, I'm gonna be--
They'll put me away.

1111
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:32,386
I'll be showering with all men
for the rest of my life.

1112
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,888
Hey, miss, I'm sorry.
No one's allowed in here.

1113
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,350
You wanna come with me?

1114
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,948
Let's go, miss.
You're not allowed in here.

1115
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:55,075
Come on. Unless you
wanna get locked up too.

1116
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,620
- I'm sorry things didn't work out, C.W.
- Come on. Let's go.

1117
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:01,039
- Yeah? You wanna lock me up?
- What's wrong with you?

1118
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:04,334
- Just take your hands off me!
- Something wrong with you?

1119
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,907
Caroline and I are working on the
details of the separation agreement now.

1120
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:38,202
I'll be out of the house in two weeks.
The divorce will take longer.

1121
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:40,871
That's why the agreement
has to be securely in place.

1122
01:08:40,954 --> 01:08:44,208
Otherwise, it could get killed
if we were found together.

1123
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:47,211
- Where Are you?
- do you think he's really guilty?

1124
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:51,381
- Is that what you're thinking about?
- I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

1125
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,675
What? That he's innocent?
He was caught red-handed.

1126
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,094
Believe me,
it just doesn't feel right.

1127
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:59,765
I don't see that snoopy little termite
as a romantic jewel thief.

1128
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:02,059
Well, I'd hardly call
breaking the law romantic.

1129
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,645
- [Phone Ringing]
- I didn't mean it that way.

1130
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,356
What did you mean? The evidence
against him is overwhelming.

1131
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:10,526
- I don't know what I mean anymore.
- [Ringing Continues]

1132
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,778
Hello? Yes.

1133
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,282
Yes, he is. Hold on.

1134
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,326
- It's the Coopersmiths.
- Thank you.

01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,704
Hello. No.

01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:27,251
Really? Oh-- Oh, how?

1137
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:32,464
Okay. Yes, I certainly will.

1138
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:36,468
if you had any doubts about his
culpability, this should allay them.

1139
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:39,054
- He escaped.
- He did?

1140
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:42,516
Slipped out of the handcuffs and leaped
across to the building next door.

1141
01:09:42,558 --> 01:09:46,228
- C.W. Briggs?
- Like a common burglar.

1142
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:50,107
I'm starting to realize that none of us
really knew him all these years.

1143
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,109
I have to go down
to police headquarters.

1144
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,903
It looks like your little termite
ate his way out.

1145
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,547
- Did you forget--
- Resist the temptation to scream.

1146
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,967
- What Are you doing here,
- you little jewel thief?
- No, I'm not a thief.

1147
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,011
I- I'm suspect.
It's the complete different.

1148
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:21,930
I'm a very promising suspect,
but I didn't do it,

1149
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:23,974
and I gotta have time to prove that.

1150
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,476
Other wise, they're gonna lock me up
in a concrete building...

1151
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,812
and you'll only be able
to insult me on visiting days.

1152
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:31,982
- Why did you come here?
- Because I have no one else to turn to.

1153
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:33,984
Everybody knows how much you hate me,

1154
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:36,069
so no one will look for me here.

1155
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:38,197
I gotta have a place to sleep.
I'm exhausted.

1156
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,033
You can't sleep here.
I couldn't afford the fumigating bills.

1157
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,118

No. I've had the strangest dreams.

The details of the crime were
the same as the first two this week.

1245
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:45,063
In addition to over
a million dollars in jewelry,

1246
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:47,733
the thief got away
with a like amount of cash.

1247
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:50,986
Police had recovered the jewels
from the earlier burglaries,

1248
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:54,990
which led to the capture and arrest
of the prime suspect, C.W. Briggs.

1249
01:16:55,073 --> 01:16:56,992
So that's why you escaped
from the police.

1250
01:16:57,075 --> 01:17:00,537
Not to try to prove your innocence,
but because you had unfinished business.

1251
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:02,664
What kind of business?
I was here with you!

1252

Yeah, well, for some reason,
I'm having trouble remembering
all of that, but I was asleep.

01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:09,338

you could have awakened,

but I didn't.

You tried to undress me and kiss me.

You are feeding me the wrong lie.

1259

I've never tried
to undress you in my life,

if we were marooned
on a desert island for 20 years.

We would never be marooned for 20 years,
'cause after 20 minutes,

or trying to kiss you,

I must have multiple personalities.

you're not gone when I get out,
I'm calling my local precinct.

1449
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:08,348
You're the bravest, most brilliant,

1450
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:10,517
most courageous man I've ever met,

1451
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:14,062
and I would go to the end
of the earth with you.

1452
01:29:14,104 --> 01:29:17,941
You know, everybody should have somebody
that they feel that way about.

1453
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:20,944
It's-- It's-- You know, it's such
a shame that you're gonna have to...

1454
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:24,948
actually wake up from this,
this fabulous illusion.

1455
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,952
Just--Just once...

1456
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:33,123
before the ugly curtain of reality...

1457
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:35,209
drops on both of us.

1458
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:52,351
[ Fitzgerald ]
Oh, you kiss great.

1459
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:02,236
- What a wrap-up, huh?
- Did you see the look
- on Herb Coopersmith's face?

1460
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:04,279
- Serves him right.
- Hey, Al.

1461
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:06,323
Where do you think Miss Fitzgerald
and Mr. Magruder...

1462
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:08,450
are gonna go
for their romantic getaway?

1463
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:12,162
His divorce doesn't come
through for months. I hear
his wife couldn't care less.

1464
01:30:12,246 --> 01:30:14,122
- I hear they're gettin' married in June.
- No.

1465
01:30:14,206 --> 01:30:16,250
I think I heard him
talking about going to Paris.

1466
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,210
- Paris? Wow!
- [ Chattering ]

1467
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:24,633
Mr. Magruder, I'm--
I just came to say I'm leaving.

1468
01:30:24,716 --> 01:30:28,846
Ah, C.W. Well, what can I say?
We all make mistakes, huh?

1469
01:30:28,929 --> 01:30:32,516
'Course, you've gotta admit, they did
have a pretty strong case against you.

1470
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:35,435
- I don't know.
- I know you could get a job anywhere.

1471
01:30:35,519 --> 01:30:37,479
if you decide to go,
you'll have our blessings.

1472
01:30:37,521 --> 01:30:39,481
if you stay, you'll have a raise,

1473
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:42,317
and I'll see to it Miss Fitzgerald
keeps out of your way.

1474
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:46,321
Between us boys, once we marry,
she's gonna retire
whether she wants to or not.

1475
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:50,325
I'm not having a wife at work
in my own office, for good measure.

1476
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:53,537
Well, think positively. I'll be away
for a couple of weeks myself.

1477
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,581
Miss Fitzgerald and I
are going to Paris.

1478
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:58,125
- Oh, yes? The actual city?
- Huh?

1479
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:00,335
- No. Nothing.
- You need a vacation.

1480
01:31:00,419 --> 01:31:03,380
Why don't you see if you can get
that Laura Kensington girl to go with?

1481
01:31:03,463 --> 01:31:05,674
I wouldn't mind
some of that action myself.

1482
01:31:05,757 --> 01:31:07,676
She seems struck by you.

1483
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:12,973
She's a little demented, but, in
a hotel room, that can be a lot of fun.

1484
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:19,146
Just came to say good-bye.

1485
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:22,232
Right. Chris and I
have a plane to catch.

1486
01:31:22,316 --> 01:31:25,611
No, by good-bye I mean I'm leaving.
I'm quitting.

1487
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:28,655
Oh?

1488
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:32,201
Should make you very happy.
You can en joy your vacation now.

1489
01:31:32,242 --> 01:31:35,329
'Cause when you come back,
you don't have to see me again.

1490
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:37,915
You can revamp everything here.
No static.

1491
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:43,587
Want to have a parting drink?

1492
01:31:43,712 --> 01:31:46,006
A drink at 10:00 in the morning?

1493
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:49,885
It's only tequila.

1494
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:55,724
What can you say about a woman who keeps
a bottle of Mexican booze in her desk?

1495
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:59,019
Let's drink to both of our futures.

1496
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:01,897
Yeah?

1497
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:05,359
Today, Mr. Magruder.
Tomorrow, the world.

1498
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,070
I will let that pass
because this is good-bye.

1499
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:11,073
Mm. You're really gonna marry him?

1500
01:32:11,156 --> 01:32:13,075
I- I-- You know.

1501
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:15,577
For a brilliant woman, I gotta say,

1502
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:18,872
you have the worst taste in men.

1503
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:21,917
I didn't take up with you.
How bad could my taste be?

1504
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:27,089
You know, behind--
underneath all those nasty remarks...

1505
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:30,300
is a very vulnerable,
sweet, sexy woman.

1506
01:32:30,384 --> 01:32:32,261
But don't ever let it come out,

1507
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,430
because, you know, you could
run the risk of being happy,

1508
01:32:35,514 --> 01:32:37,432
and I know that would kill ya.

1509
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:39,518
Chris and I plan
on being very happy.

1510
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,187
Your instinct told you
he would never leave his wife.

1511
01:32:42,271 --> 01:32:45,315
My instincts are good,
but they're not infallible.

1512
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:48,485
So this was one where I was wrong.

1513
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,737
Have a-- Have a terrific
rest of your life...

1514
01:32:50,863 --> 01:32:53,532
and try not to jump
out of any windows.

1515
01:32:53,615 --> 01:32:55,909
Make sure the elevator's there
before you get in,

1516
01:32:55,951 --> 01:32:59,913
because I heard of a man who plunged
15 stories and wound up a vegetable.

1517
01:32:59,997 --> 01:33:02,958
I'll let that pass
'cause this is good-bye.

1518
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:09,756
- That's what she said--
- Hey, Briggsie, I was just tellin' 'em.

1519
01:33:09,798 --> 01:33:11,884
You quit, I go with ya.

1520
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:15,637
[John] That's right. C.W., you are
our hero. This was a tough nut to crack.

1521
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:17,639
No, this was all luck.

1522
01:33:17,723 --> 01:33:20,434
If George didn't know
magic or hypnosis,

1523
01:33:20,517 --> 01:33:22,686
you know,
I never would have known anything.

1524
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,771
It's an amazing thing.

1525
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:28,275
You can actually put somebody
under and then force them to do
the most outrageous things.

1526
01:33:28,358 --> 01:33:30,319
That is absolutely wrong.

1527
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,947
A person will not do
anything under hypnosis that
they wouldn't do in real life.

1528
01:33:33,989 --> 01:33:36,158
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
- What Are you saying?

1529
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:38,368
Th- Th-That I'm, at heart, a thief?

1530
01:33:38,452 --> 01:33:42,956
Well, we know there's
a little bit of larceny in you.

1531
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,126
I mean, you're the one who's always
saying it takes one to catch one.

1532
01:33:46,168 --> 01:33:49,296
Oh, well, there's also a little bit
of larceny in Miss Fitzgerald.

1533
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:51,340
I mean, that was kind of a shock.

1534
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:55,177
- There's a lot of surprises in her,
- it turns out.
- Hey, come here.

1535
01:33:55,302 --> 01:33:56,637
Hey.

1536
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:57,638
Hey.

1537
01:33:57,763 --> 01:34:00,182
You got a little crush
on her, don't ya?

1538
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:02,601
- Who? Fitzgerald? What, Are you--
- [ Cackling ]

1539
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:06,230
- What Are you talking about?
- Well, come on. I've always known it.

1540
01:34:06,313 --> 01:34:08,357
You can't hate somebody that much
without there being...

1541
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,651
at least a little bit of attraction
underneath it all.

1542
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:13,612
- Says who?
- It's my instinct. Against all logic.

1543
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:16,615
Come on, Briggsie. You were the one
who taught me to trust it.

1544
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,161
I think I'm in love with her, but I--

1545
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:24,706
It's the stupidest thing that's ever
happened to me. It's embarrassing.

1546
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:27,626
Yeah, well, uh, you better take
the bull by the horns.

1547
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:29,503
She's out of here in about
three minutes. Look.

1548
01:34:29,545 --> 01:34:29,545
She's out of here in about
three minutes. Look.

1549
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:36,260
Go!

1550
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:44,476
Miss Fitzgerald, [ Clears Throat]
marry me.

1551
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,062
- What?
- I guess C.W.'s had a few.

1552
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:50,399
- Pretty early for that, don't you think?
- I've had a little tequila, but--

1553
01:34:50,482 --> 01:34:52,568
Otherwise I wouldn't have
the nerve to say this.

1554
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:54,570
I'm in love with you.
I want you to marry me.

1555
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:56,572
Mr. Briggs, you're embarrassing me.

1556
01:34:56,655 --> 01:34:59,408
You don't want to spend the rest of
your life with the wrong person...

1557
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:02,411
- when it's me you really love.
- C.W., you're making her uncomfortable.

1558
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:07,082
Whatever could make you think
I could, in my wildest dreams,
think of you that way, you--

1559
01:35:07,165 --> 01:35:10,043
Yeah, I know. " Nearsighted little
cockroach, " or something like that.

1560
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:12,504
But can't you see the venom under that?
That's the beauty.

1561
01:35:12,588 --> 01:35:14,756
Betty, let's go.
C.W. leave here at once.

1562
01:35:14,882 --> 01:35:18,135
I think your idea of moving
on professionally wasn't so crazy.

1563
01:35:18,218 --> 01:35:20,179
Hey, look, I'm opening up to you.

1564
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:22,222
I'm putting my heart in your hands.

1565
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:25,684
I've been difficult because
I feared you, just like you feared me.

1566
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:28,937
Because underneath, we know this is
the real thing, and it terrifies us.

1567
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:31,023
Yes, I fear you.
You and Boris Karloff.

1568
01:35:31,106 --> 01:35:33,066
- [ Sighs ]
- Out of the way, C.W.

1569
01:35:33,108 --> 01:35:35,569
Your heroics do not entitle you
to be an obnoxious boor.

1570
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:38,530
How can a man confessing love
be an obnoxious boor?

1571
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:41,617
[ Scoffs ]
I'm afraid Betty and I have big plans,

1572
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:43,660
and they don't include you.

1573
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:46,663
I- I-- You wanna spend the rest of
your life married to the wrong guy?

1574
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:49,708
What makes you think I'd marry you
even if I wasn't gonna marry him?

1575
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:52,711
- Stop talking about me
- like I'm not here.
- Because it's me you love.

1576
01:35:52,794 --> 01:35:56,048
[ Scoffs ] You are too old for me.
You are too nearsighted for me.

1577
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:58,634
- You're too short for me.
- You're leaving out the best part.

1578
01:35:58,717 --> 01:36:01,929
- I'm also losing my hair.
- All right, C.W. Good-bye.

1579
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:04,264
- And I mean for good.
- Wait-- Wait a minute.

1580
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:07,768
[ Stammering ] Betty Ann.
Betty Ann, where Are you going?

1581
01:36:07,809 --> 01:36:11,772
- Madagascar?
- Someone call the plane
and tell them we might be late.

1582
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:15,776
You go ahead, Chris.

1583
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:19,446
I'm staying here.

1584
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,823
[Magruder]
What?

1585
01:36:21,907 --> 01:36:23,825
I'm staying with C.W.

1586
01:36:24,993 --> 01:36:26,912
We have an announcement to make.

1587
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:32,626
Betty Ann, you have
a crazy look in your eye.

1588
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:35,504
I've never felt
so normal in my life.

1589
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:39,925
I can't guarantee that every time
I kiss you there's gonna be fireworks.

1590
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:43,929
I think I fell in love with you
the first second I laid eyes on you.

1591
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:46,974
I want this woman helped!
Get an ambulance!

1592
01:36:47,057 --> 01:36:50,519
Uh, Miss Burke. Call my wife's attorney.
Have him halt the separation.

1593
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:53,272
- I see trouble on the horizon.
- Don't worry, Mr. Magruder.

1594
01:36:53,355 --> 01:36:56,817
She'll take you back. There'll be a few
new ground rules, but you can adapt.

1595
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,695
- Gosh, so much passion
- in a lousy insurance office.
- I know.

1596
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:01,697
- No kiddin'.
- You never know.

1597
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:05,325
Hey. Congratulations.

1598
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,204
A little, uh,
going- away present forya.

1599
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:14,585
So, should we...

1600
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:19,423
get out of here and find someplace where
we can start making up for lost time?

1601
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:22,050
How about my place?

1602
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:24,553
I think I can live with that.

1603
01:37:24,636 --> 01:37:26,763
Um, God bless everyone,

1604
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:30,058
and, uh, God bless Tiny Tim.

1605
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:32,561
- Shall we?
- Good luck, you two.

1606
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:36,982
Hey, so, what's gonna happen
when she, you know,

1607
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:39,234
wakes up and she's back
to her old self?

1608
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:42,863
Guess the first word out of his mouth
every morning has to be " Madagascar. "

1609
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:45,699
My gosh, who'd have thunk it.

1610
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:48,035
Hey, what a break for C.W.
that in all the commotion...

1611
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:50,454
you forgot to deprogram
Miss Fitzgerald, huh?

1612
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:56,043
What are you talking about?
I didn't forget anything.
I deprogrammed her last night.

1613
01:37:56,126 --> 01:37:58,504
You don't have to worry.
I'll never leave you.

1614
01:37:58,587 --> 01:38:00,631
It's something you don't even
have to think about.

1615
01:38:00,756 --> 01:38:02,674
Tell me how you feel about me.

1616
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:08,639
You're the most wonderful man
in the world-- the handsomest,
the most brilliant, the sexiest.

1617
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:11,350
You know, someday I'm gonna
make you feel those things.

1618
01:38:11,433 --> 01:38:13,477
Just, just really feel them.

1619
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,521
Anything's possible.
