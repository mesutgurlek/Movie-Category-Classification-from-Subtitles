158
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,219
touching my own penis.

159
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,145
Right, so were there
terrible sexual problems?

160
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,977
Does he have tremendously niche desires?

161
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,652
Did he want to touch you here?

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,783
- Uh...
- Never with a pen.

163
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,409
Look, Nat's amazing, obviously.
She's wonderful.

164
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,616
And I think we both really want
to make this work.

165
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,745
But is it possible

166
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,203
that some people
just aren't supposed to be married?

167
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,458
Truthfully, there's just something
in our marriage

168
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,085
that hasn't quite...

169
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,007
- Clicked.
- ...jelled.

170
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,300
So? Was it like a dream?

171
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,681
Well, we ticked every wedding box.

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,604
Cake, sweaty uncles dancing to Queen.

173
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,399
People we thought were dead
flying in from Canada.

174
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,397
It was very wedding-y, right?

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,819
It was so romantic.

176
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,294
It was just like a Hugh Grant film.

177
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,439
- It was amazing, wasn't it?
- Mmm!

178
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,321
Did you like all the flowers?
We got the most...

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,652
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
But can we do this at lunch?

181
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,614
- Right. Absolutely, Helen.
- Thanks.

182
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,665
Ruthlessly efficient, as always.

183
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,787
We should not be talking about

184
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,744
- lace halter necks on company time.
- No.

185
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,839
- What's the story?
- While you were on your holiday,

186
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,215
I took the initiative

187
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,551
and I started gathering ideas
for Guy Harrap.

188
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,343
He's taken over his father's
industrial solvent and bleach empire.

189
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,223
You weren't here, but he basically wants
to make solvents and bleach sexy.

190
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,270
- Fuck off.
(PHONE RINGING)

191
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,934
JOSH OVER SPEAKER: <i>Is that
my dirty little slut of a wife?</i>

192
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,810
Hey!

193
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,146
<i>What are you doing?</i>

194
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,105
Uh, middle of a meeting. What's up?

195
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,284
Maybe I'm just missing
the sexiest wife in the universe.

196
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,578
- Not working today?
- I've got writer's block.

197
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,958
I can't work out whether to call
my main character Ezra

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,794
- or David.
- Um, David.

199
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,542
I was at school with an Ezra
who got expelled

200
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,982
for punching a swan in the throat.

201
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,882
<i>Who said the second novel
would be tricky?</i>

202
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:49,964
<i>Anything else?</i>

203
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,796
No, no, no. I'll see you at three.

204
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,381
- Love...
(DIALLING TONE)

205
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,056
...you.

206
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,806
Sorry, that was my husband.

207
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,353
He has writer's block.

208
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,305
Did I mention that
he was a writer, of books?

209
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,436
- Only about a million times.
- Yeah, Clare mentioned it,

210
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,688
but I've never heard of him. (COUGHS)

211
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,152
Sorry, sorry.

212
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,485
You do realise you're not going
any faster than walking, don't you?

213
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,661
You've got all the superficial
trappings of a run

214
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,909
but there's people walking
much faster than you.

215
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,249
You're just expending
a lot of surplus energy.

216
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,409
Thank you for that analysis.

217
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,790
How late are we?

218
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,964
Well, you, my little friend,
are 10 minutes early.

219
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,758
I told you the wrong time because I knew
you'd never be on schedule.

220
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,511
- Right.
- Mmm!

221
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,465
I'm just trying to work out
if I find that endearing

222
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,097
or it makes me want to bludgeon you
to death with a shovel.

223
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,849
- No, it's endearing.
- I think it's a shovel.

224
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,101
- It's endearing.
- Do we have a shovel?

225
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,434
Well, firstly, a hearty "mazoltov"
for your marriage.

226
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,440
- I think it's "mazel tov", isn't it?
- Thank you.

227
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,567
- Mmm?
- I always thought it was "mazel tov".

228
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,106
I don't know, I'm not Jewish.

229
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,570
Oh.

230
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,784
But, as you know, whilst everything
may seem so happy now,

231
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,206
of course you could be
struck down at any time.

232
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,253
Cancer. Heart disease. Meningitis.

233
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,996
Hit by a truck.

234
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,501
- Bam!
(GASPS)

235
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,261
I had a client who was kicked to death
by a group of disaffected youths

236
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,712
high on meow meow.

237
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,968
She'd just left the house
to get potatoes.

238
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,634
- Just potatoes.
- Shit.

239
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,969
And the tragedy was,

240
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,849
she hadn't thought to make a will.

241
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,602
- Or a Tesco home delivery.
(CHUCKLES)

242
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,807
What?

243
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah.

244
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,150
She was only identifiable
by her dental records.

245
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,656
Why, what had they done to her?

246
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,484
They'd made impressions of her teeth.

247
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,450
Still, fortunately, you two have had
the presence of mind

248
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,576
to plan for your future.

249
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,033
So, have you considered
what would happen

250
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,539
if either of you
fell into a persistent...

251
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,292
(STUMBLES) - ...vegetatative state?
- A what, sorry?

252
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,294
Persistent vegetatative state.

253
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,047
Mmm.
One too many T's there. "Vegetative."

254
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,636
Have you considered what would happen
if you fell into...

255
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,807
one of these guys?

256
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,552
Just pillow talk, really.

257
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,939
No, I think we did decide
that we'd both like to be left to die.

258
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,604
Excellent, yes.
We just switched off my aunt.

259
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,234
- I'm sorry.
- Aw.

260
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,312
No, it's all right.
It's no quality of life.

261
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,996
And we freed up a socket
for a lava lamp.

262
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,273
Ah.

263
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,478
It's transformed the lounge.

264
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,571
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

265
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,947
Largely losing her, to be fair.

266
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,290
Now, can we go through a few of these?
Just give me a yes or no.

267
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,369
Are we switching the life support off?

268
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,498
Brain dead?

269
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,252
BOTH: - Switch it off.
- Switch it off. Get it off.

270
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,378
Locked-in syndrome?

271
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,609
That's the one where you're paralysed
but you can still wink.

272
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,928
It's all the...

273
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,799
It's the dribble, isn't it,
that I couldn't handle.

274
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,322
- Constantly mopping up phlegm.
JOSH: - I wouldn't want that.

275
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,220
You wouldn't want that.
That's why you're murdering your wife.

276
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,304
(GRUNTS)

277
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,548
So, are you switching it off?

278
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,772
- Sorry, what are you doing?
NAT: - Off!

279
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,145
- Switch it off, yeah.
- Off she goes!

280
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,943
Night-night.

281
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,281
Um, brain-damaged and vegetative.

282
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,858
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

283
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,780
Um, brain stem undamaged.

284
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,738
So you're breathing,
you're swallowing, you're fine,

285
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,825
but you are still literally
a shell of a person

286
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,582
with no capacity
for any emotion or thought.

287
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,380
Much like my Susan.

288
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,256
My little joke.

289
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,714
(CHUCKLES)

290
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,636
- Off, off.
- Off, yeah, off.

291
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,591
Get that off, off, off, off!

292
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,431
Well, this is slightly more depressing

293
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,682
- than I'd imagined.
- Oh, no. Come one.

294
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,980
And you haven't even
received my bill yet. (CHUCKLES)

295
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,523
(LAUGHS)

296
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,243
That's a good 'un. That is a good 'un.

297
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,652
- An electric peppermill?
(WHIRRING)

298
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,577
I can't believe you got
an electric peppermill.

299
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,493
We thought we had to have
at least one dinner party

300
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,246
to use all the crap we got bought.

301
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,376
At least that's a useful gift.

302
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,375
D'you know what I mean?
I hate those gifts where someone says,

303
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,501
"Do you know what I've done for you?"

304
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,957
"I've donated to charity
on your behalf."

305
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,882
"Have you? Really?" Bollocks to that.

306
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,461
If I'm getting married, why should some
African fella get a couple of goats?

307
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,745
I want a fucking smoothie maker,
d'you know what I mean?

308
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,226
- Did you get them goats?
- Four of them.

309
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,348
- Four goats?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,467
That's a lovely gift, that,
because they need goats.

311
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,477
African fella's pleased.

312
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,107
Go on, tell us about your honeymoon.

313
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,818
It was lovely. It was idyllic.

314
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,194
Morocco's beautiful.

315
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,673
- Amazing place, yeah.
NAT: - Yeah.

316
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,988
It was just a bit long, really.

317
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,068
I was really sad when we came back.

318
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,655
NAT: Well, things hit a low point
when we found ourselves

319
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,911
in the Essaouira Museum
of Leather Manufacturing

320
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,081
discussing if we had a superpower,
what would it be?

321
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,164
I actually really enjoyed that.
I thought that was really fun.

322
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,748
DANNY: I think if I was
gonna have any superpower,

323
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,583
it would be the ability
to speak Spanish.

324
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,961
That would be amazing, wouldn't it?
Because you could say stuff like,

325
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,593
- <i>Hola</i>, gazpacho.
NAT: - You just said it.

326
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,232
JOSH: - You're saying it now.
- Oh, wow.

Hmm.

328
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,102
Not strictly speaking a superpower,
though, is it, really?

329
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,137
Otherwise everyone in Brazil
would be superheroes.

330
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,563
Mmm, true.

331
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,399
They speak Portuguese in Brazil.

- Keep it for the car.

335
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,066
Um, so... Wait, so, Josh,

336
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,072
- what did you choose?
- Boring, really. Super-strength.

337
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,824
That's what I would choose, too!

338
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,040
I think it would be so handy
to be able to open, like, jam jars.

339
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,242
Jam jars! That's exactly...
Isn't that exactly what I said?

340

- That's exactly what you said.
JOSH: - That's exactly what I said.

This is what children talk about.

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,258
All right, Nat, calm down,
we were only having a joke.

344
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,505
Yeah, joke's over.

To be honest, I'm not sure
you could get a divorce

348
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,929
because I'm not even sure
you're officially married.

349
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,573

it's pretty funny, really,

356

because, um, when I left for Africa,

357

we sort of never formally ended it.

358

That's an impressive thing.
I couldn't do that.

Maybe pop out and get a drink sometime?

And let's emphasise the online campaign
we did for Greenpeace.

Our job is to convince people

his solvents won't render the planet
a barren, lifeless husk

Well, if he's a cheapskate like his dad,

481
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,365
we suggest making the typeface
green and yellow

482
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,789
and sticking some sort of
sunflower or butterfly on the logo.

that Austin Powers accent.

So I was thinking about your book.

"Ezra" to "David" as a name.

(SIGHS)

940
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,982
Listen, I'm completely all right.

941
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,360
I promise not to end it all.

942
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,655
I don't even own a razor. I wax.

943
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,612
I think it's pretty hard
to wax yourself to death.

944
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,997
(CHUCKLES)

945
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,247
You can leave. I'm okay.

946
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,086
No, it's all right.

947
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,670
I'm putting off my Christmas shopping.

948
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,506
I'm trying to figure out
what to buy Nat.

949
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,881
What does she like?

950
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:41,765
I've no idea.

951
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:46,183
- I was thinking casserole dishes, maybe.
(GROANS)

952
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,730
I simply cannot let you
get your new wife

953
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,523
- casserole dishes for Christmas.
- Why?

954
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,732
(LAUGHS) I mean...

955
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,572
- Let me help you out.
- A griddle pan.

956
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:57,906
- No!
- A set of knives.

957
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,534
Enough. I'm gonna go and get changed.

958
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,366
(SIGHS)

959
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,617
Thanks, Josh.

960
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,585
Ah, it's all right.

961
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,594
Excuse me. Thank you.

962
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,717
- Hey.
- Hello.

963
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,720
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm. Can I ask...

964
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,563
why we're meeting in your hotel?

965
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,677
You do know I'm not going
up to your room, don't you?

966
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:35,232
Oh! No, of course not. Purely business.

967
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,279
No sexual tension whatsoever.

968
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,905
No undercurrent of erotic electricity

969
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,945
between two ludicrously attractive
single people.

970
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,701
None. Absolutely not.

971
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,457
Good.

972
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,451
It's your time you're paying for.

973
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,083
So, we need to lock down a date
for the website.

974
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,964
It's just there are some tiny kittens
up in my room

975
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,585
playing adorably with a ball of wool.

976
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,633
- If you're interested.
- Cat faeces makes you go blind.

977
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,803
- I'm not going to your room.
- Okay. You win.

978
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:09,395
We'll work and completely ignore the
palpable sizzle of sensual possibility

979
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,564
every time our bodies
accidentally touch.

980
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,318
I've booked a boardroom down the hall.

981
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,270
Shall we?

982
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,606
Yeah, basically, I'm looking
for something for my wife.

983
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,993
You know, pair of pants
and a brassiere, perhaps.

984
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,823
Something that's long-lasting
and practical.

985
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,491
Goodness, is that man-made fibre?

986
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,244
Or is it, um, natural?

987
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,171
Or is it a mixture of the two?
Because that's often the way these days.

988
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,507
Helps with, um, durability and so on.

989
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,171
I mean, that's a lovely bit of kit.
Look at that.

990
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,965
That's a formidable gusset.
You could not break that.

991
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,846
- Were you looking for a panty?
- Christ. Am I...

992
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,466
(BURBLES)

993
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,599
A panty.

994
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,348
Uh... (MUMBLING)

995
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,266
He has trouble with the word "panty",
I think.

996
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,098
No, I don't. "Panty."
I'm looking for a panty, <i>mon chéri.</i>

997
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,980
A portion of your
finest panties, milord.

998
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,026
Right.
Um, perhaps I should just ask you.

999
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,364
After all, you are standing right here.

1000
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,028
(IMITATES BUZZING)
(LAUGHING)

1001
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,528
Oh, God, no, no, no. I'm not his wife.

1002
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,038
- No way.
- I'm just helping out,

1003
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,704
making sure he doesn't buy
his actual wife vouchers.

1004
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:12,950
Well, you can't actually go wrong
with vouchers.

1005
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,706
Christ, is that really the price?

1006
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,298
I could buy half an 18-litre
dehumidifier for that.

1007
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,966
- Sir.
- Yes.

1008
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,964
We like to celebrate the erotic here.

1009
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,512
Celebrate.
"One-nil. Oy-oy! I scored a goal."

1010
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,389
- You don't need to be ashamed.
- I'm not ashamed of anything.

1011
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,388
- Embrace it.
- I'll embrace you.

1012
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,947
I didn't mean that, I'm really sorry.

1013
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,059
It's all right. Why don't you tell me...

1014
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,686
- Yeah?
- ...what turns you on?

1015
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:41,403
Uh... What turns me on?

1016
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,405
I don't... What, really?

1017
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,819
I, uh, I like it...
I like it when she...

1018
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,333
dresses up like a policewoman,
or estate agent.

1019
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:01,003
We haven't met,
and she forces me to do things to her

1020
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,419
that I would never normally do.

1021
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,677
- Right.
- Yeah.

1022
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,601
I was thinking
more along the lines of lace.

1023
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,768
Were you?

1024
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,433
- Satin?
- Satin.

1025
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,181
Fishnets?

1026
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,939
Fishnets, the fish of the sea.
Fish of the sea. A trawlerman.

1027
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,613
I once saw a trawlerman.

1028
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,782
You must know the lucky lady.

1029
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,034
Any thoughts?

1030
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,509
You're as useless at all this sexy stuff
as I am, aren't you?

1031
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:34,786
You're happy with a thermal nightie,
a Stieg Larsson and a nice milky tea.

1032
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,454
(CHUCKLES)

1033
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:41,623
I'm just gonna go have a browse.
Leave you to it.

1034
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,130
Oh, this is nice.

1035
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,470
They also have a wonderful restaurant.

1036
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,469
I wouldn't think of staying
anywhere else when I'm in London.

1037
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:57,147
So, what is our strategy
when it comes to online awareness?

1038
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:01,150
So, the idea is to drive the consumer
to the site through...

1039
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:02,981
Oysters?

1040
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,817
Oysters?

1041
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,989
Seriously, Guy.

1042
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,277
They must have run out
of Highland shortbread.

1043
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,664
To drive consumers to the site
through a unified multiplatform...

1044
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,158
(WHIRRING)

1045
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,830
A unified multiplatform approach,
accessible with...

1046
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,667
(PLAYING SOFT MUSIC)

1047
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,510
Yes, go on. Platforms, that was good.

1048
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:33,850
Well, traditional media
should not be ignored, either.

1049
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,928
Doves? Really?

1050
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,521
I think you're amazing, Nat.

1051
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,312
I know it's unprofessional
and cliché, but...

1052
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,942
I'm married.

1053
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,190
What?

1054
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,027
I'm married. I have a husband.

1055
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,866
How can you?
Why didn't you say something?

1056
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,160
For all this time,
you didn't think to tell me?

1057
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,952
I didn't say anything because
I thought we'd get the account if...

1058
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,000
if I flirted with you.

1059
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,542
And then I liked flirting with you
too much for any of this to stop.

1060
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,545
Well, this wouldn't be happening
if you were happy with your husband.

1061
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,714
What am I supposed to say?

1062
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,559
I can't leave him, he'd be destroyed.
Look, I'm really sorry,

1063
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,053
but that dove's getting
awfully close to the ceiling fan.

1064
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,563
Who is this guy? Do you have children?

1065
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,688
- How long have you been married?
- Look, that's irrelevant. He's...

1066
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,568
He's dependable and...

(SCREAMS)

1068

...and he's kind and safe,

1069
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,817
and I can't throw that all away for you.

1070
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,369
I mean, you're charming and twinkly.

1071

and right now...

1072

behind the wheel of a Volvo.

I need reliability

1076
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,722
and to be able to get from A to B
safe and unhurt.

1077
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,097
Oh! God!

Dove down, dove down!

1079

It's okay, I think it's just stunned.
Can you...

1080

- Do you want me to stop now?
- Yes.

I've thought of nothing else.

Do you think I care if our logo
has a drop shadow or is italicised? No.

Ugh! God!

- That's supposed to be lucky.

Poor Chloe could probably think
of nothing worse,

went out together sometime,

- Ooh!

couldn't you, Nat? Is that all right?

Yes, yes, absolutely.

Yeah. Look, if this is weird, I can go.

and you didn't seem to mind.

No, I don't mind, it's not weird.

01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,424
(LAUGHS)
- Exactly why is it good

1398
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,382
to get on like a house on fire? I mean,
there might be small kids left inside.

1399
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,556
- Think of them.
CHLOE: - I know!

1400
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,135
And the possibility of asphyxiation...

1401
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,266
JOSH: Or at the very least,
the loss of any no-claims bonus.

1402
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,517
(LAUGHS)

1403
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,981
It's just a metaphor.

1404
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,525
It means something that's
uncontrollable, has momentum.

1405
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,610
Exactly. So, tell me this.

1406
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,246
What would be the first thing
you'd save in a fire? Let me guess.

1407
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,274
- Jimmy Choos.
- Your wedding ring.

1408
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,358
(LAUGHS)

1409
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,944
Well, obviously my wedding ring.

1410
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,451
But I've got two hands, haven't I?

1411
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,032
She does love that ring.

1412
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:42,210
The first thing I noticed about you.
Wasn't it?

1413
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,764
(SIGHS)

1414
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,058
Sorry, Nat. Excuse me.

1415
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:08,691
Fuck off.

1416
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,280
Yeah, that's too bad.

1417
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,859
I'd probably rescue that necklace
that I got you

1418
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,739
when we got engaged in Venice.

1419
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,946
That's sweet. It's beautiful.

1420
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,494
How about you, Chloe?

1421
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,290
I'm guessing something
sentimental, emotional?

1422
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,166
Um...

1423
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,043
- It's your shot, Guy.
- Sorry?

1424
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,875
- It's your shot, mate.
- Sorry.

1425
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,211
You wouldn't really head for the shoes,
though, would you, Chloe?

1426
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,967
Fashion's not really your thing.

1427
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,302
GUY: Why would it be?
I mean, look at her.

1428
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,640
She'd make anything look fantastic.

1429
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,808
(SCOFFS)

1430
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,808
- She'd make a sack look incredible.
(CHLOE GIGGLING) - Thanks.

1431
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,013
Good shot.

1432
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:47,271
Yeah, it's like, what's the opposite of,
"You cannot polish a turd"?

1433
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,276
She's an already polished turd.

1434
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,154
She's a turd buffed to a high sheen.

1435
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,316
Thanks.

1436
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,904
JOSH: Unlucky, pal.

1437
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,405
Yeah, honestly, if the stuff burnt up,

1438
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,329
I think I'd just view it
as a chance to start over,

1439
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:04,785
you know, have a new adventure. I'm not
too bothered by material possessions.

1440
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,336
All right, come down on it a bit.

1441
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,167
Come on.

1442
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,007
And use your arm
to go back and forth with it

1443
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,641
so you really get a nice pumping action.

1444
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,043
Then go through the ball,

1445
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,095
and you want to hit it
on the edge there.

1446
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,922
Ah, ah, ah! If you put the cue

1447
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,773
between your thumb
and your first finger,

1448
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,927
you'll find it easier to get...
That's it.

1449
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,938
Now get this moving
before you take the shot.

1450
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,133
Come down a bit lower on it.

1451
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,812
Don't take the...
Come on, not that low.

1452
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,942
That's it.
Now play through the ball, and breathe.

1453
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,319
There's no point, is there?

1454
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,993
If we're not gonna do it properly,
it's like, what's the point?

1455
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,445
- There's no point in playing, is there?
- Nice try.

1456
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,326
CHLOE: Oh, I think it's my shot.

1457
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:43,782
I think Chloe's right.

1458
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:48,120
I mean, nice things is great,
but ultimately, so what?

1459
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,204
As long as the people you love are safe.

1460
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,374
That's it. You got that?

1461
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,716
(GUY LAUGHS)
JOSH: - Good shot, Chloe.

1462
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,214
(LAUGHS)
- Did you see that?

1463
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,092
That was... Wow!

1464
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,424
CHLOE: I can't believe it. Oh!

1465
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,639
- It'll never happen again.
- Oh, it will. Be positive.

1466
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:06,312
CHLOE: No. Once in a lifetime.

1467
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,641
It's so sweet,
what you said about that necklace.

1468
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:10,725
JOSH: Yeah.

1469
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,652
- I should wear it more often.
- Okay. What do you think?

1470
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:16,902
- I think you're good on your own.
- Oh, you touched the cue ball.

1471
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,358
- Oh.
- So...

1472
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,034
- Really?
- I mean, if you want to play proper...

1473
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,986
No, it's fine if you want to...

1474
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,537
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1475
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,035
- Happens all the time, don't worry.
- I'm sorry.

1476
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,286
It's two shots if...

1477
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,868
- No, no, it's cool. You...
- All right. No, no. No, go ahead.

1478
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,328
- I don't want to be a dick about it...
- No!

1479
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,451
- Too late.
- Are you sure?

1480
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:32,656
- Take your two shots.
- Fine.

1481
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,791
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah.

1482
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,501
We should do it again.
What do you say, Josh?

1483
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,131
Give you Brits a chance for revenge?

1484

Oh, yeah, 'cause...
When my elbow's a bit better,

I'll be able to give you
a much better game. Probably win.

1486
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,346
Yeah, that sounds fun.

1487
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,517
Can I walk you to your car?

1488
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,229
Oh, you know,
I'm just gonna catch a cab,

1489

but you can wait with me if you like.

1490

- Be my pleasure.
- Okay.

1491
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,986
Actually, Guy, do you mind
if I quickly grab you for two minutes?

1492
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,189
Just to talk packaging
before the meeting.

1493

Is that okay?

01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,484
- Sure.
- Thanks. Sorry.

1495
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,329
Well, I could help you
get a cab, if you want.

And I'll wait with you.

01:24:58,635 --> 01:24:59,727
But just not for me.

1703
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,016
I've waited my whole life
for the right girl to show up.

1704
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,185
And it turns out that you weren't it.

1705
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,859
I don't find the way that you crinkle
your nose when you laugh adorable,

1706
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,235
the way you flick your hair,

1707
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,817
- it's quite frankly irritating.
DANNY: - Hear, hear.

1708
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,901
I wanted to cherish
everything about you,

1709
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:17,955
but it just didn't happen.

1710
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:21,996
So I guess what I'm trying to say is...

1711
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:24,540
Natasha Moss...

1712
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:27,339
will you divorce me?

1713
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,088
Yes.

1714
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:33,762
Yes. Yes! I will!

1715
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,589
- I absolutely will!
- That's so amazing!

1716
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,424
- Do you really mean it?
- Absolutely!

1717
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,602
I've been waiting for this moment
for months, hoping it would happen.

1718
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,038
I can't believe that you asked me.

1719
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,522
Why didn't you just say something, then?

1720
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:46,521
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I thought it would break your heart.

1721
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,229
You've made me the happiest woman
in the world.

1722
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,402
I love you.

1723
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,857
But you're not in love with me.

1724
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,113
No! God, no.

1725
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,070
Unequivocally not in love with you.

1726
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,618
The opposite. The opposite of love.
Misery.

1727
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,620
- Me, too!
(LAUGHS)

1728
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,540
I can't believe
we felt the same for so long.

1729
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,419
Well, listen,
now we have the rest of our lives

1730
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,087
not to be together.

1731
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,512
Cheers?

1732
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:17,840
Look, this is amazing, it's magical.

1733
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,095
It's better than I could
ever have imagined,

1734
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,972
but there's somewhere else
that I really need to be right now.

1735
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,179
Oh, go! Seriously, go.
Do you need money for a cab?

1736
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,308
No, I'm all right, I'm in the car,

1737
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,311
but it was a nightmare trying to park,
so I'm basically in a...

1738
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:29,519
Oh, God, stop it. Stop it.
It's so boring.

1739
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,319
- It's just, the car's in your name...
- It's so boring.

1740
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,489
- We should sort that out, actually.
- It's so boring. I don't care.

1741
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,657
- All right, but...
- Honestly. Just go.

(LAUGHS)

1743
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,923
I will never have to see you again.

- Stand back.
- Oh, my God.

I can't be without you, Chloe.

1759

I think about you
every second of the day.

I need to be with you.

And I know
you want to be with me as well.

You can't just turn up
and try and steal my girlfriend away.

You're married. You're a married man.

- You split up with Nat?

1768

Ever since you came back into my life,
I've known that I had to be with you.

- No, I, uh...

- Actually, I'm...
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

You're perfect for each other.

the kind of guy that you should go for.

1787

Do you remember when I said to you
when I was trying to...

Oh, I do remember that!
I remember when you said that,

1789
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,194
and at the time, I agreed.

1790
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:19,358
And I thought in my mind,

1791

"I think he's right,
I should be with him."
