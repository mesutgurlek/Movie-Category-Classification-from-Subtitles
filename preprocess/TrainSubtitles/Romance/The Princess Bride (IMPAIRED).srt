163
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,529
That would be inconceivable.

164
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,949
Despite what you think,
you will be caught.

165
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,202
And when you are,
the Prince will see
you all hanged.

166
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,080
Of all the necks
on this boat, Highness,

167
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,958
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

168
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,133
Stop doing that!
We can all relax.
It's almost over.

169
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,926
You are sure
nobody's follow us?

170
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,011
As I told you,

171
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:42,515
it would be absolutely,
totally and in all other ways
inconceivable.

172
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,517
No one in Guilder knows
what we've done

173
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,896
and no one in Florin
could have gotten here
so fast.

174
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,400
Out of curiosity,
why do you ask?

175
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,570
No reason.
Suddenly, I just happen
to look behind us

176
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,863
and something is there.

177
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,031
What?

178
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,085
Probably some local fisherman
out for a pleasure cruise
at night through

179
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,337
eel-infested waters.

180
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,797
(WATER SPLASHES)

181
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,675
What? Go in! Get after her!

182
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,926
I don't swim.

183
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,261
I only dog paddle.

184
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,554
(GRUNTS)

185
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,973
Veer left!

186
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,104
Left! Left!

187

(SHRIEKING)

188
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,572
VIZZINl: Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

189
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,534
Those are
the shrieking eels!

190
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,036
If you don't believe me,
just wait.

191
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:50,291
They always grow louder
when they're about to
feed on human flesh!

192
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,459
(GASPS)

193
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,591
If you swim back now,
I promise no harm
will come to you.

194
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,970
I doubt you'll get
such an offer
from the eels.

195
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,430
(SHRIEKING)

196
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,937
(SCREAMING)

197
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,149
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

198
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
What?

199
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,360
The eel doesn't get her.

200
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,238
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

201
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,658
I wasn't nervous.

202
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,164
Maybe I was
a little bit concerned,
but that's not the same thing.

203
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,624
Because we can stop now
if you want.

204
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,462
No, you could read
a little bit more if you want.

205
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,507
"Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

206
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,760
"Those are
the shrieking eels."

207
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,262
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

208
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,598
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

209
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,851
I did. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon.

210
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,146
All right. All right.
Let's see,
she was in the water.

211
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,773
The eel was coming after her.

212
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,610
She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her,
and then...

213
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,573
Put her down.
Just put her down.

214
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,996
I think he's getting closer.

215
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,832
He's no concern of ours.
Sail on!

216
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,877
I suppose you think
you're brave, don't you?

217
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,546
Only compared to some.

218
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,721
INIGO: Look!
He's right on top of us!

219
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,516
I wonder if he is using
the same wind we are using.

220
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,102
Whoever he is,
he's too late. See?

221
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,982
The Cliffs of Insanity!

222
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,486
Hurry up! Move the thing!

223
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,405
And that other thing!

224
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,408
Move it!

225
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,208
We're safe. Only Fezzik
is strong enough
to go up our way.

226
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,419
He'll have to
sail around for hours
till he finds a harbor.

227
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,741
(BIRDS CAWING)

228
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,594
He's climbing the rope
and he's gaining on us.

229
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,762
Inconceivable.

230
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,224
Faster!

231
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,268
FEZZIK: I thought
I was going faster.

232
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,437
You were supposed
to be this colossus.

233
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:01,024
You were this great
legendary thing.
And yet, he gains!

234
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,736
Well,
I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

235
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,112
I do not accept excuses.

236
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,489
I'm just going to have to
find myself a new giant,
that's all.

237
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,492
Don't say that, Vizzini.
Please?

238
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,002
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

239
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,648
He's got very good arms.

240
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,444
He didn't fall?
Inconceivable.

241
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,822
You keep using that word.

242
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,199
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

243
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,912
INIGO:
My God. He's climbing.

244
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,291
Whoever he is, he's obviously
seen us with the Princess
and must, therefore, die.

245
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,336
You, carry her.
We'll head straight
for the Guilder frontier.

246
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,549
Catch up when he's dead.
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.

247
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,968
I'm going to duel him
left-handed.

248
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,012
You know
what a hurry we're in!

249
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,180
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.

250
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,850
If I use my right,
over too quickly.

251
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,476
Oh, have it your way.

252
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,404
You be careful.
People in masks
cannot be trusted.

253
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,949
I'm waiting!

254
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,380
Hello there!

255
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,343
Slow going?

256
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,222
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is not
as easy as it looks,

257
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,850
so I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

258
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,852
Sorry.
Thank you.

259
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,906
I don't suppose
you could speed things up?

260
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,659
If you're in such a hurry,
you could lower a rope
or a tree branch,

261
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,120
or find something
useful to do.

262
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,083
I could do that.
I've got some rope up here.

263
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,585
But I do not think
you would accept my help,

264
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,171
since I am only waiting around
to kill you.

265
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,007
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

266
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,595
But I promise
I will not kill you until
you reach the top.

267
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,599
That's very comforting,
but I'm afraid
you'll just have to wait.

268
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,351
I hate waiting.

269
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,354
I could give you my word
as a Spaniard.

270
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,982
(GRUNTING) No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.

271
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,485
Is there any way
you'll trust me?

272
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,612
Nothing comes to mind.

273
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,324
I swear on the soul
of my father,
Domingo Montoya,

274
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,701
you will reach the top alive.

275
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,995
Throw me the rope.

276
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,235
Thank you.

277
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,155
We'll wait... wait... wait
until you're ready.

278
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,907
Again, thank you.

279
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,256
I do not mean to pry,

280
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,886
but you don't by any chance
happen to have six fingers
on your right hand?

281
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,848
Do you always begin
conversations this way?

282
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,518
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

283
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,818
He was a great sword maker,
my father.

284
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,863
When the six-fingered man
appeared and requested
a special sword,

285
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,740
my father took the job.

286
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,994
He slaved a year
before he was done.

287
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,464
I've never seen its equal.

288
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,885
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it,

289
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,305
but at one-tenth
his promised price.

290
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,891
My father refused.

291
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:31,145
Without a word,
the six-fingered man
slashed him through the heart.

292
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,898
I loved my father.

293
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,652
So, naturally, I challenged
his murderer to a duel.

294
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,154
I failed.

295
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,533
The six-fingered man
leave me alive.

296
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,495
But he gave me this.

297
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,666
How old were you?

298
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,334
I was 11 years old.

299
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,712
When I was strong enough,

300
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,174
I dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

301
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,179
So, the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

302
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,226
I will go up
to the six-fingered man
and say,

303
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,188
"Hello. My name
is Inigo Montoya.

304
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,443
"You killed my father.
Prepare to die."

305
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,156
You've done nothing
but study swordplay?

306
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,826
More pursue it
than study, lately.

307
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,161
You see,
I cannot find him.

308
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,373
It has been 20 years now.
I'm starting
to lose confidence.

309
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,917
I just work for Vizzini
to pay the bills.

310
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,044
There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

311
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,216
Well, I certainly hope
you find him someday.

312
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,467
You're ready then?

313
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,261
Whether I am or not,
you've been more than fair.

314
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,723
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

315
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,434
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

316
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,603
Begin.

317
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,096
You are using
Bonetti's defense
against me, huh?

318
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,058
I thought it fitting,
considering
the rocky terrain.

319
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,894
Naturally,
you must expect me
to attack with Capo Ferro.

320
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,106
Naturally. But I find
that Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro, don't you?

321
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,651
Unless the enemy
has studied his Agrippa.

322
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,613
Which I have!

323
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,037
You are wonderful.
Thank you.

324
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,705
I've worked hard
to become so.

325
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,707
I admit that you are
better than I am.

326
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,833
Then why are you smiling?

327
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,211
Because I know something
you don't know.

328
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,253
And what is that?

329
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,671
I am not left-handed.

330
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,640
(GRUNTING)

331
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,851
You are amazing.

332
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,187
I ought to be,
after 20 years.

333
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,189
(GRUNTING) There's something
I ought to tell you.

334
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,315
Tell me.

335
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,526
I'm not left-handed either.

336
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,096
Who are you?

337
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,681
No one of consequence.

338
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,099
I must know.

339
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,851
Get used to disappointment.

340
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,352
Okay.

341
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,633
(GRUNTING)

342
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,686
(PANTING)

343
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,105
Kill me quickly.

344
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,982
I would as soon destroy
a stained-glass window

345
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,692
as an artist like yourself.

346
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,653
However, since I can't have
you following me, either...

347
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,779
(GROANS)

348
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,243
Please understand, I hold you
in the highest respect.

349
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,758
Inconceivable!
Give her to me.

350
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,426
Catch up with us quickly.

351
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,636
What do I do?

352
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,096
Finish him.
Finish him your way!

353
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,933
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

354
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,560
Which one's my way?

355
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,980
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

356
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,900
In a few minutes,
the man in black will come
running around the bend.

357
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,779
The minute
his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

358
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,408
My way's not
very sportsmanlike.

359
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,316
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.

360
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,110
I believe you.

361
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,654
So what happens now?

362
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,282
We face each other
as God intended.

363
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:21,829
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.
Skill against skill alone.

364
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,624
You mean,
you'll put down your rock
and I'll put down my sword,

365
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,252
and we'll try
and kill each other
like civilized people?

366
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,713
I can kill you now.

367
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:35,926
Frankly, I think the odds
are slightly in your favor
at hand-fighting.

368
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,971
It's not my fault
for being the biggest
and the strongest.

369
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,764
I don't even exercise.

370
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:54,653
(GRUNTING)

371
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,579
Look,
are you just fiddling around
with me, or what?

372
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,081
I just want you to feel
you're doing well.

373
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,292
I hate for people
to die embarrassed.

374
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,962
You're quick.

375
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,130
And a good thing, too.

376
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,548
Why are you wearing a mask?

377
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,842
Were you burned by acid
or something like that?

378
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,802
No, it's just that they're
terribly comfortable.

379
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,929
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

380
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,729
(GRUNTING) I just figured why
you give me so much trouble.

381
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,481
(GROANING)

382
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,775
Why's that, do you think?

383
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:37,863
Well, I haven't fought
just one person for so long.

384
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,076
I've been specializing
in groups,

385
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,954
battling gangs
for local charities,
that kind of thing.

386
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,460
Why should that make
such a... difference?

387
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,380
Well, you see,
you use different moves

388
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,634
(GRUNTING)
When you're fighting
half a dozen people

389
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:04,765
than when you only have to be
worried about one.

390
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,115
I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

391
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,119
But in the meantime,
rest well and dream
of large women.

392
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,640
There was a mighty duel.

393
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:53,313
It ranged all over.
They were both masters.

394
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,442
Who won? How did it end?

395
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,695
The loser ran off alone,

396
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,115
but the winner

397
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,869
followed those footprints
toward Guilder.

398
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,538
Shall we track them both?

399
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,625
The loser is nothing.
Only the Princess matters.

400
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,171
Clearly, this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

401
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,090
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

402
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,050
Could this be a trap?

403
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,428
I always think
everything could be a trap,

404
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,472
which is why I'm still alive.

405
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,526
So, it is down to you

406
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,779
and it is down to me.

407
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,534
If you wish her dead,
by all means,
keep moving forward.

408
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,287
Let me explain.

409
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,830
There's nothing to explain.

410
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,792
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

411
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,711
Perhaps an arrangement
can be reached?

412
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,632
There will be no arrangement,
and you're killing her.

413
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,883
(GASPS)

414
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,638
Well, if there can be
no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

415
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,725
I'm afraid so. I can't compete
with you physically,

416
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,144
and you're no match
for my brains.

417
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,229
You're that smart?

418
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,396
Let me put it this way.

419
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,775
Have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?

420
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,818
Yes.

421
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,944
Morons.

422
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,195
Really?

423
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,907
In that case, I challenge you
to a battle of wits.

424
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,451
For the Princess?

425
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,829
To the death?

426
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,372
I accept.

427
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,582
Good, then pour the wine.

428
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,725
Inhale this,
but do not touch.

429
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,854
I smell nothing.

430
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,356
What you do not smell is
called iocane powder.

431
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,067
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid,

432
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,611
and is among
the more deadly poisons
known to man.

433
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,737
Hmm.

434
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,383
(CHUCKLES)

435
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,220
All right.
Where is the poison?

436
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,222
The battle of wits
has begun.

437
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,433
It ends when you decide,
and we both drink

438
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:38,437
and find out who is right
and who is dead.

439
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,314
But it's so simple.

440
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,692
All I have to do is divine
from what I know of you.

441
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,235
Are you the sort of man

442
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,447
who would put the poison
into his own goblet
or his enemy's?

443
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,408
Now, a clever man
would put the poison
into his own goblet

444
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,745
because he would know
that only a great fool would
reach for what he was given.

445
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,874
I'm not a great fool,
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

446
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,418
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

447
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,422
You would've counted on it,
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

448
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,215
You've made your decision,
then?

449
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,508
Not remotely.

450
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,095
Because iocane
comes from Australia,
as everyone knows,

451
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,806
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals,

452
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,184
and criminals
are used to having people
not trust them,

453
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,769
as you are not trusted by me,

454
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,730
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

455
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,440
Truly, you have
a dizzying intellect.

456
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,442
Wait till I get going.

457
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,402
Where was I?
Australia.

458
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,612
Yes. Australia.

459
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,323
And you must have suspected
I would have known
the powder's origin,

460
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,784
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

461
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,035
You're just stalling now.

462
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,537
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

463
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,707
You've beaten my giant,
which means you're
exceptionally strong,

464
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,793
so you could've put the poison
in your own goblet,

465
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,336
trusting on your strength
to save you,

466
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,130
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

467
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,009
But you've also bested
my Spaniard, which means
you must've studied,

468
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,096
and in studying,
you must have learned
that man is mortal,

469
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,391
so you would've put the poison
as far from yourself
as possible,

470
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,394
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

471
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,647
You're trying to trick me
into giving away something.
It won't work.

472
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,607
It has worked!
You've given everything away.

473
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,192
I know where the poison is.

474
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,443
Then make your choice.

475
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,237
I will, and I choose...

476
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,155
What in the world
can that be?

477
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,157
What? Where?

478
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,493
I don't see anything.

479
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,662
I could've sworn
I saw something.

480
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,497
No matter.

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,042
What's so funny?

I'll tell you in a minute.

484
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,838
First, let's drink,

485
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,091
me from my glass
and you from yours.

488

You only think
I guessed wrong.

489
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,528
That's what's so funny.
I switched glasses
while your back was turned!

490

(LAUGHING) You fool,
you fell victim to one
of the classic blunders.

491

never get involved
in a land war in Asia,

492

but only slightly less
well known is this.

when death is on the line!

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,975
Who are you?

496
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,727
I'm no one to be trifled with.

497
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,854
That is all
you ever need know.

498
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,900
To think, all that time
it was your cup
that was poisoned.

499
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,651
They were both poisoned.

500
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,323
I spent the last few years
building up an immunity
to iocane powder.

501
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,995
Someone has beaten a giant.

502
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,042
There will be great suffering
in Guilder if she dies.

503
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,809
Catch your breath.

504
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,268
If you'll release me,

505
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,772
whatever you ask for ransom,
you'll get it, I promise you.

506
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,357
(LAUGHING)

507
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,693
And what is that worth,
the promise of a woman?

508
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,403
You're very funny, Highness.

509
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,366
I was giving you a chance.
It does not matter
where you take me.

510
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,868
There's no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

511
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,038
He can track a falcon
on a cloudy day.
He can find you.

512
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,790
You think your dearest love
will save you?

513
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,708
I never said
he was my dearest love,

514
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,294
and yes, he will save me.
That I know.

515
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,548
You admit to me
you do not love your fiancé?

516
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,550
He knows I do not love him.

517
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,094
Are not capable of love,
is what you mean.

518
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,559
I have loved more deeply
than a killer like yourself
could ever dream.

519
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,980
That was a warning,
Highness.

520
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,481
The next time,
my hand flies on its own,

521
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,609
for where I come from,
there are penalties
when a woman lies.

522
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,243
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.

523
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,288
And there are
the Princess's footprints.

524
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,249
She is alive, or was,
an hour ago.

525
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:14,379
If she is otherwise
when I find her,
I shall be very put out.

526
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,345
Rest, Highness.

527
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,430
I know who you are.

528
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,724
Your cruelty
reveals everything.

529
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,934
You're the
Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

530
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,438
With pride.
What can I do for you?

531
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,608
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

532

(CLICKING TONGUE)

533
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,361
Hardly complimentary,
Your Highness.

534
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,405
Why loose your venom on me?

535
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,283
You killed my love.

536
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,995
It's possible.
I kill a lot of people.

537
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,917
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?

538
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,753
Ugly, rich and scabby?

539
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,173
No, a farm boy. Poor.

540
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,634
Poor and perfect.

541
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,304
With eyes like the sea
after a storm.

542
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,309
On the high seas
your ship attacked,

543
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,686
and the Dread Pirate Roberts
never takes prisoners.

544
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,396
I can't afford
to make exceptions.

545
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,566
I mean, once word leaks out
that a pirate has gone soft,
people begin to disobey you,

546
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,027
and then it's nothing
but work, work, work
all the time.

547
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,487
You mock my pain!

548
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,739
Life is pain, Highness.

549
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,325
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

550
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,249
I remember this farm boy
of yours, I think.

551
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,252
This would be what?
Five years ago?

552
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,171
Does it bother you to hear?

553
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,049
Nothing you can say
will upset me.

554
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,678
He died well.
That should please you.

555
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,806
No bribe attempts
or blubbering.

556
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:53,895
He simply said,
"Please. Please,
I need to live."

557
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,023
It was the "please"
that caught my memory.

558
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,360
I asked him what was
so important for him.

559
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,487
"True love," he replied.

560
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,202
And then he spoke of a girl
of surpassing beauty
and faithfulness.

561
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,204
I can only assume
he meant you.

562
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,415
You should bless me
for destroying him

563
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,042
before he found out
what you really are.

564
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,711
And what am I?

565
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,505
Faithfulness
he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness.

566
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,465
Now tell me truly.
When you found out
he was gone,

567
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,092
did you get engaged
to your prince
that same hour,

568
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,303
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

569
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:30,557
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!
I died that day!

Disappeared.
He must have seen us
closing in.

577
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,890
Which might account
for his panicking into error.

578
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,726
Unless I am wrong,
and I am never wrong,

579
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,896
they are headed dead
into the Fire Swamp.

580
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,034
Can you move at all?

581
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,745
Move? You're alive.

582
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,122
If you want, I can fly.

583

I told you I would always
come for you.

584
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,799
Why didn't you wait for me?

585
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,052
Well, you were dead.

586

Death cannot stop true love.

All it can do
is delay it for a while.

What's the matter?

They're kissing again.
Do we have to hear
the kissing part?

mind so much.

about saying
"please" was true.

629
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,195
It intrigued Roberts,
as did my description
of your beauty.

630
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,448
Finally Roberts
decided something.

631
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,659
He said, "All right, Westley.

632
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,579
"I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.

633
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,914
"I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

634
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,833
Three years, he said that.

635
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,918
"Good night, Westley.
Good work.

636
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,754
"Sleep well.
I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

637
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,382
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning
to fence, to fight,

638
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,342
anything anyone
would teach me.

639
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,970
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends.

640
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,388
And then it happened.

641
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,890
What? Go on.

642
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,019
Roberts had grown so rich
he wanted to retire,

643
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,230
so he took me to his cabin
and told me a secret.

644
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,901
"I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts," he said.

645
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,445
"My name is Ryan.

646
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,114
"I inherited the ship
from the previous
Dread Pirate Roberts,

647
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,199
"just as you
will inherit it from me.

648
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,369
"The man I inherited it from
was not the real
Dread Pirate Roberts either.

649
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,624
"His name was Cummerbund.
The real Roberts has been
retired 15 years

650
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,959
"and living like a king
in Patagonia." Thank you.

651
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,503
Then he explained the name
was the important thing

652
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,505
for inspiring
the necessary fear.

653
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,551
You see,
no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

654
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,180
So, we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew,

655
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,182
and he stayed aboard
for a while, as first mate,

656
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,517
all the time
calling me Roberts.

657
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,728
Once the crew believed,
he left the ship,

658
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,938
and I have been Roberts
ever since.

659
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,774
Except, now
that we're together,

660
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,193

and hand the name over
to someone else.

but Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse."

Didn't I tell you she'd never
marry that rotten Humperdinck?

788
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,363
Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.

789
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:49,285
It comes to this.
I love Westley.
I always have.

790
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,704
I know now,
I always will.

791
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,790
If you tell me
I must marry you in 10 days,

792
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,459
please believe
I will be dead by morning.

793
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,261
I could never cause you grief.

794
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,847
Consider our wedding off.

795
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:15,477
You, uh, returned
this Westley to his ship?

796
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,937
Yes.

797
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,023
Then we will
simply alert him.

798
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,567
Beloved,

799
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,195
are you certain
he still wants you?

800
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,616
After all, it was you
who did the leaving
in the Fire Swamp.

801
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,538
Not to mention that, uh,
pirates are not known
to be men of their words.

802
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,166
My Westley
will always come for me.

803
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,877
Uh...

804
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,632
I suggest a deal.

805
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,802
You write four copies
of a letter.

806
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,139

my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

is always close to Florin
this time of year.

808

We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

809
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,565
If Westley wants you,
bless you both.

If not,

811

please consider me
as an alternative
to suicide.

812
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,952
Are we agreed?

813
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,335
Your princess is really
quite a winning creature.

814
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,088
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

815
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,298
I know. The people
are quite taken with her.

816
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,841
It's odd,

817
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,095
but when I hired Vizzini
to have her murdered
on our engagement day,

818
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,554
I thought that was clever.

819
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,139
But it's going to be
so much more moving

820
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,683
when I strangle her
on our wedding night.

821
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:40,104
Once Guilder is blamed,
the nation will be
truly outraged.

824
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,945
Now, where is that
secret knot?

825
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,989
It's impossible to find.

my wedding to arrange,
my wife to murder,

834
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,387
and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.

00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,625
Took me half a lifetime
to invent it.

I'm sure you've discovered
my deep and abiding
interest in pain.

840

At present, I'm writing
the definitive work
on the subject.

totally honest with me

makes you feel.

of sucking water,
I'm sucking life.

01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,021
Don't bother me with trifles.

944
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,816
After 20 years,
at last my father's soul
will be at peace.

945
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,026
There will be blood tonight!

946
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,789
Rise and report.

947
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,833
YELLIN: The Thieves' Forest
is emptied.

948
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,793
Thirty men guard
the castle gate.

949
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:03,338
Double it.
My princess must be safe.

950
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,340
The gate has but one key.

951
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,677
And I carry that.

952
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,637
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

953
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:14,349
Ah! My dulcet darling.

954
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,311
Tonight, we marry.

955
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:21,690
Tomorrow morning,
your men will escort us
to Florin Channel,

956
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:26,778
where every ship in my armada
waits to accompany us
on our honeymoon.

957
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,948
Every ship
but your four fastest,
you mean.

958
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,786
Every ship
but the four you sent.

959
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,957
Yes. Yes, of course.
Naturally, not those four.

960
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,669
(CLEARING THROAT)
Your Majesty.

961
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,300
You never sent the ships.

962
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,343
Don't bother lying.

963
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,389
It doesn't matter.
Westley will come
for me anyway.

964
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,141
You're a silly girl.

965
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,184
Yes, I am a silly girl,

966
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,937
for not having seen sooner
that you are nothing
but a coward

967
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,689
with a heart full of fear.

968
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,819
I would not say such things
if I were you.

969
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,156
Why not? You can't hurt me.

970
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,701
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love.

971
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,912
And you cannot track that,

972
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,039
not with
a thousand bloodhounds.

973
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,959
And you cannot break it,
not with a thousand swords.

974
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,670
And when I say
you're a coward,

975
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:30,133
that is only because
you are the slimiest weakling
ever to crawl the earth!

976
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,347
I would not say
such things if I were you!

977
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:54,032
You truly love each other,
and so you might have been
truly happy.

978
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,618
Not one couple in a century
has that chance,

979
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,703
no matter what
the storybooks say.

980
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,957
And so,
I think no man in a century

981
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,542
will suffer as greatly
as you will.

982
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,172
Not to 50!

983
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:22,727
(YELLING)

984
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,238
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.

985
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:34,823
Do you hear?

986
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,617
That is the sound
of ultimate suffering.

987
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:41,121
My heart made that sound
when Rugen slaughtered
my father.

988
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,622
The man in black
makes it now.

989
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,873
The man in black?

990
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,917
His true love is marrying
another tonight,

991
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,461
so who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

992
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:52,465
Excuse me. Pardon me,
it's important.
Fezzik, please.

993
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,884
(SHOUTING) Everybody, move!

994
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,636
Thank you.

995
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,022
INIGO:
Where is the man in black?

996
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,941
You get there
from this grove, yes?

997
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,112
Fezzik, jog his memory.

998
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,495
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't meant to jog him
so hard.

999
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,789
Inigo?

1000
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,378
Father, I have failed you
for 20 years.

1001
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,506
Now, our misery can end.

1002
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,550
Somewhere...

1003
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,970
Somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

1004
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:45,060
I cannot find him alone.
I need you.

1005
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,147
I need you to guide my sword.

1006
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,149
Please.

1007
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,153
Guide my sword.

1008
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,704
He's dead.

1009
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,499
Just is not fair.

1010
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,669
Grandpa, Grandpa,
wait. Wait.

1011
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:54,921
What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?

1012
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,715
I mean, he didn't mean "dead."

1013
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:02,178
Westley's only faking, right?

1014
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,140
You want me
to read this or not?

1015
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,433
Who gets Humperdinck?

1016
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,144
I don't understand.

1017
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,312
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?

1018
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,565
At the end?
Somebody's gotta do it.

1019
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,650
Is it Inigo? Who?

1020
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,278
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

1021
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,071
He lives.

1022
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,698
You mean, he wins?

1023
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,701
Jesus, Grandpa,
what did you read me
this thing for?

1024
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,370
You know,
you've been very sick

1025
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,414
and you're taking this story
very seriously.

1026
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,916
I think we ought to
stop now.

1027
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,919
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1028
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,714
Sit down. I'm all right.

1029
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,258
Okay.

1030
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,802
All right, now, let's see.
Where were we?

1031
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,388
Oh, yes.

1032
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,266
In the Pit of Despair.

1033
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,020
Well...

1034
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,814
The Montoyas have
never taken defeat easily.

1035
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,816
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.

1036
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,109
The body?

1037
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,236
Have you any money?

1038
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,571
I have a little.

1039
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,116
I just hope it's enough
to buy a miracle, that's all.

1040
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,955
MIRACLE MAX: Go away!

1041
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,877
What? What?

1042
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:18,796
Are you the Miracle Max
who worked for the King
all those years?

1043
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,924
The King's
stinking son fired me,

1044
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,760
and thank you so much
for bringing up
such a painful subject.

1045
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,595
While you're at it,
why don't you give me
a nice paper cut

1046
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,846
and pour lemon juice on it?

1047
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,223
We're closed!

1048
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,728
Beat it, or I'll call
the Brute Squad.

1049
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:35,230
I'm on the Brute Squad.

1050
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,898
You are the Brute Squad.

1051
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,234
We need a miracle.
It's very important.

1052
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,569
Look, I'm retired.
And besides,

1053
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,947
why would you want someone
the King's stinking son fired?

1054
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,199
I might kill whoever
you wanted me to miracle.

1055
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:48,201
He's already dead.

1056
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,287
He is, huh? I'll take a look.
Bring him in.

1057
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,512
I've seen worse.

1058
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,143
Sir?

1059
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,562
Sir?
Huh?

1060
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,606
We're in a terrible rush.

1061
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,360
Don't rush me, sonny.
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

1062
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:23,861
You got money?

1063
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,029
Sixty-five.

1064
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,949
(SCOFFING)
I never worked for so little,

1065
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,451
except once, and that was
a very noble cause.

1066
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:32,745
This is noble, sir.

1067
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,040
His wife is crippled.

1068
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,502
His children are
on the brink of starvation.

1069
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,796
Are you a rotten liar.

1070
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,800
I need him
to help avenge my father,
murdered these 20 years.

1071
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:48,636
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cranny?

1072
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,723
He probably
owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

1073
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,891
He's dead. He can't talk.

1074
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,268
(SCATTING)

1075
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,186
Look who knows so much, huh.

1076
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,357
Well, it just so happens
that your friend here
is only mostly dead.

1077
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,610
There's a big difference
between mostly dead
and all dead.

1078
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,112
Please, open his mouth.

1079
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,659
Now, mostly dead
is slightly alive.

1080
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,829
Now, all dead...
Well, with all dead,

1081
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,998
there's usually only one thing
that you can do.

1082
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,207
What's that?

1083
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,752
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

1084
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,467
Hey!

1085
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,428
Hello in there! Hey!

1086
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:35,058
What's so important?
What you got here
that's worth living for?

1087
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,646
True

1088
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,482
love.

1089
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,359
True love. You heard him.

1090
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,402
You could not ask for
a more noble cause than that.

1091
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:50,865
Sonny, true love is
the greatest thing
in the world,

1092
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,367
except for a nice M.L.T.

1093
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,826
A mutton, lettuce
and tomato sandwich

1094
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,745
when the mutton
is nice and lean

1095
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,121
and the tomato is ripe.

1096
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,457
(SMACKING LIPS)
They're so perky. I love that.

1097
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,127
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said,
"To blave."

1098
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,506
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff."

Humperdinck in a little less
than half an hour,

Man and wife.

1256
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,600
Escort the bride
to the honeymoon suite.
I'll be there shortly.

1257
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,145
He didn't come.

1258
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,807
Kill the dark one
and the giant,

1259
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,351
but leave the third
for questioning.

1260
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,563
(GRUNTING)

1261
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:54,325
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1262
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:59,163
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

1263
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:26,231
Fezzik! I need you!

1264
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,942
I can't leave him alone.

1265
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,528
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik! Please!

1266
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,406
Fezzik!

1267
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,577
I'll be right back.

1268
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,621
(GRUNTING)

1269
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:48,087
Thank you.

1270
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,965
Strange wedding.

1271
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,509
Yes, a very strange wedding.

1272
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,303
Come along.

1273
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,811
What was that for?

1274
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:06,146
Because you've always been
so kind to me.

1275
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,982
And I won't be
seeing you again,

1276
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:11,276
since I'm killing myself
once we reach
the honeymoon suite.

1277
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,989
Won't that be nice?
She kissed me!

1278
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,073
(LAUGHING)

1279
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,032
(GROANS)

1280
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,538
Sorry, Father.

1281
01:24:05,331 --> 01:24:09,043
I tried.

1282
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,713
You must be
that little Spanish brat

1283
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:15,507
I taught a lesson to
all those years ago.

1284
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,469
Simply incredible.

1285
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:22,014
Have you been chasing me
your whole life,
only to fail now?

1286
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,809
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

1287
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,479
How marvelous.

1288
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,352
WESTLEY: There's a shortage
of perfect breasts
in this world.

1289
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,813
It would be a pity
to damage yours.

1290
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:14,233
Westley!
Oh, Westley, darling!

1291
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:20,322
Westley,
why won't you hold me?

1292
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,573
Gently.

1293
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,825
At a time like this?

1294
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,702
That's all you can
think to say? "Gently"?

1295
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,204
Gently!

1296
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:28,914
(GRUNTS)

1297
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,388
TYRONE: Good heavens.
Are you still trying to win?

1298
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,811
You've got an overdeveloped
sense of vengeance.

1299
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,231
It's going to get you
into trouble someday.

1300
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,498
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1301
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,334
You killed my father.

1302
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,378
Prepare to die.

1303
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,180
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1304
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,348
You killed my father.

1305
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,559
Prepare to die.

1306
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,065
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1307
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,693
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

1308
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:41,820
Stop saying that!

1309
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:43,989
(GROANS)

1310
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:48,452
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya!

1311
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:49,995
You killed my father!

1312
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,955
Prepare to die.
No!

1313
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,790
Offer me money.
Yes.

1314
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,001
Power, too.
Promise me that.

1315
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:58,879
All that I have and more.
Please.

1316
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,715
Offer me everything I ask for.

1317
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,800
Anything you want.

1318
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:05,886
(GROANS)

1319
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,805
I want my father back,
you son of a bitch.

1320
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:26,156
Westley,
will you ever forgive me?

1321
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:28,492
What hideous sin
have you committed lately?

1322
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:32,537
I got married.
I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

1323
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,081
It never happened.
What?

1324
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:35,165
It never happened.

1325
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,416
But it did. I was there.

1326
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:37,960
This old man said,
"Man and wife."

1327
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,753
Did you say, "I do"?

1328
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:43,715
No. We sort of
skipped that part.

1329
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,259
Then you're not married.

1330
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,220
If you didn't say it,
you didn't do it.

1331
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,099
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?

1332
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:55,978
A technicality that will
shortly be remedied.

1333
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,189
But first things first.

1334
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,652
To the death.
WESTLEY: No!

1335
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:05,529
To the pain.

1336
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,366
I don't think
I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

1337
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,659
I'll explain.

1338
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:13,870
And I'll use small words,
so that you'll be sure
to understand,

1339
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,707
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1340
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:22,921
That may be
the first time in my life
a man has dared insult me.

1341
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:24,965
It won't be the last.

1342
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,092
"To the pain" means
the first thing you lose

1343
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:29,469
will be your feet,
below the ankles.

1344
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:33,390
Then your hands at the wrists.
Next, your nose.

1345
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:37,352
And then my tongue, I suppose?
I killed you too quickly
the last time,

1346
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:40,480
a mistake I don't mean
to duplicate tonight.

1347
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,857
I wasn't finished!

1348
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:44,860
The next thing you lose
will be your left eye,
followed by your right.

1349
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:48,155
And then my ears.
I understand.
Let's get on with it.

1350
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,867
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why.

1351
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,997
So that every shriek
of every child at seeing
your hideousness

1352
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:58,915
will be yours to cherish.

1353
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,752
Every babe that weeps
at your approach,

1354
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,671
every woman who cries out,
"Dear, God,
what is that thing?"

1355
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,591
Will echo
in your perfect ears.

1356
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,594
That is what
"to the pain" means.

1357
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:12,763
It means I leave you
in anguish,

1358
01:29:13,222 --> 01:29:16,600
wallowing in freakish
misery forever.

1359
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,687
I think you're bluffing.

1360
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,564
It's possible, pig.

1361
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:24,399
I might be bluffing.

1362
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:27,736
It's conceivable,
you miserable, vomitous mass,

1363
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,906
that I'm only lying here
because I lack the strength
to stand.

1364
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:33,784
Then again,

1365
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:37,120
perhaps I have
the strength after all.

1366
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,807
Drop your sword.

1367
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:00,811
(SWORD DROPS)

1368
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:02,813
Have a seat.

1369
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,819
Tie him up.

1370
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,863
Make it as tight
as you like.

1371
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:13,573
HUMPERDINCK: Oh.

1372
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,078
Where's Fezzik?

1373
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:20,247
I thought
he was with you.
No.

1374
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,832
In that case...

1375
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,500
Help him.

1376
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,669
Why does Westley
need helping?

1377
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,170
INIGO: Because he has
no strength.

1378
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,923
I knew it.
I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.

1379
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,842
Shall I dispatch him
for you?

1380
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,593
Thank you, but no.
Whatever happens to us,

1381
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:36,513
I want him to live
a long life, alone
with his cowardice.

1382
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:38,306
FEZZIK: Inigo!

1383
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,518
Inigo, where are you?

1384
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:44,771
Oh, there you are.

1385
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:47,607
Inigo, I saw
the prince's stables.

1386
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,527
And there they were.
Four white horses.

1387
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:55,282
And I thought,
"There are four of us,
if we ever find the lady."

1388
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,367
Hello, lady.

1389
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:01,663
So I took them with me,
in case we ever bumped into
each other.

1390
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:03,957
I guess we just did.

1391
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:07,085
Fezzik, you did
something right.

1392
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,213
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

1393
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:32,986
You know,
it's very strange.

1394
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,906
I have been in
the revenge business so long,

1395
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,575
now that it's over,

1396
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:41,119
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1397
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,414
Have you ever
considered piracy?

1398
01:31:44,707 --> 01:31:46,917
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

1399
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,931
GRANDFATHER:
"They rode to freedom.

1400
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,435
"And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew
they were safe.

1401
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:08,063
"A wave of love
swept over them,

1402
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:10,273
"and as they reached
for each other..."

1403
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,694
What? What?

1404
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,113
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1405
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,867
I... I don't mind so much.

1406
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:24,246
Okay.

1407
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:29,417
"Since the invention
of the kiss, there have
been five kisses

1408
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,921
"that were rated
the most passionate,
the most pure.

1409
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:35,423
"This one left them
all behind.

1410
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,972
"The end."

1411
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,810
Now, I think
you ought to go to sleep.

1412
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:59,114
Okay.

1413
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,992
All right.

1414
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:05,996
So long.

1415
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,541
Grandpa?

1416
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,339
Maybe you could come over
and read it again
to me tomorrow.

1417
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:20,302
As you wish.

1418
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:18,878
(STORYBOOK LOWE PLAYING)

1419
01:35:22,174 --> 01:35:26,428
Come my love
I'll tell you a tale

1420
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:31,433
Of a boy and girl
and their love story

1421
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:37,230
And how he loved her
Oh, so much

1422
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:42,152
And all the charms
she did possess

1423
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:47,824
Now this did happen
once upon a time

1424
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,996
When things
were not so complex

1425
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:58,251
And how he worshipped
the ground she walked

1426
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,754
And when he looked
in her eyes

1427
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,673
He became obsessed

1428
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:09,429
My love is like
a storybook story

1429
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:14,642
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1430
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:19,981
My love is like
a storybook story

1431
01:36:20,357 --> 01:36:25,361
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1432
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:30,575
It's as real
as the feelings I feel

1433
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:46,508
He said, "Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much

1434
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:51,346
"And lay my heart
at the foot of your dress?"

1435
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:57,060
She said, "Don't you know
that storybook loves

1436
01:36:57,853 --> 01:37:02,607
"Always have
a happy ending?"

1437
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:07,904
Then he swooped her up
just like in the books

1438
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:12,784
And on his stallion
they rode away

1439
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:18,581
My love is like
a storybook story

1440
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:23,962
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1441
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:29,551
My love is like
a storybook story

1442
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:34,722
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel
