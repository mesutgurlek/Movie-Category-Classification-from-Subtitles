I thought you didn't watch TV.

1075
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:05,163
-lt smells like beef in here.
-It's the carniceria,

1076
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:08,972
Is that why you came here?
To smell my office?

1077
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:12,239
Ha ha.

1078
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,646
So, interesting books you've got here.

1079
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,916
What is this? Pleasure reading?

1080
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,884
My sister works
for The New York Review ofBooks,

1081
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:26,478
So, she sends me the ones
with the funniest titles.

1082
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,286
And, yes, I do read them. I like to read.

1083
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,052
So, sister, huh?

1084
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,690
That's something we have in common.

1085
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:37,358
Yeah, it's probably about the only thing
we have in common.

1086
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,368
Well, you're awfully quick to judge.

1087
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,963
As much as I'm enjoying
your spontaneous attack

1088
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,166
on my character and office smell,

1089
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,937
would you do me a favor
and get to the point?

Just a second.

1092
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,576
-Hey, Tanz.
-Hey! Check this out.

1093
01:05:55,686 --> 01:05:58,780
I compared the formula in the testing
to the current Everdew formula,

1094
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,322
-And Dad changed it,
-No way.

1095
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:03,359
Yes way.
He took the isopropyl lanolate out,

1096
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,485
but there's no records of this in the files.

1097
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,828
I'm telling you, Ava,
this thing is screwier than Courtney Love.

1098

-Okay, well, just see what you can find,
-Okay.

-You don't have a case.
-What?

1100
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:18,205
Not one of these people
had a permanent reaction.

1101
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,038
And then we find out
that the formula was changed.

1102
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,339
Someone had to have fabricated
those testimonials.

1103

-You don't have any proof, though.
-Yes, we do.

-No, you don't.
-Sure, we do.

No, you don't.

With us today is Ned Nakamori,

1108
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:37,953
the reporter who first broke
that story in Los Angeles,

1109
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:41,326
Ned, is it true that this is the end
for the troubled company?

1110
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,729
Is a sale to Fabiella Cosmetics imminent?

1111
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,132
That's right, Christiane, It's expected that

1112
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:49,137
when Marchetta Cosmetics ' shareholders
vote in Iess than two weeks,

1113
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:52,697
they will overwhelmingly approve a sale

-Hi, Gene. I'm Tina.
-Hey, Tina.

1122
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,836
Did anyone ever tell you
you look like Tanzie Marchetta?

1123
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,741
-Thanks.
-You're much prettier, though.

1124

-Thanks.
-No problem.

1125

I'm sure you're a lot nicer than they are.

1126
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,116
What spoiled jerks.
Screwing over all those people like that.

1127
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:13,519
Hey, Gene.

1128
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,992
Believe it or not, I'm actually on the prowl
for some of those release forms

1129
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:21,087
that people have to sign
before they go on television.

1130
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:24,757
I mean, everyone you air
has to sign one of those things, correct?

1131
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:26,597
Yeah, that's right.

1132
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:31,863
So, I was wondering if I could just get
a little look-see in that file room.

1133
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:35,602
-Oh, I am not authorized to do that.
-Gene.

1134
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,971
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

1135
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:42,742
My boss needs them for a TV emergency.

1136
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:47,048
If you could just help me
this eensie-weensie little bit?

01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,131
You're gonna be quick, right?

01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:17,577
Hurry!

1139
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,259
What the hell's going on in here, Gene?

1140
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:29,698
Well, well. What have we here?

1141
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,734
Her boss is having a TV emergency.

1142
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,666
Gene, you must be a stone moron.
Do you know who that is?

1143
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:39,173
-That's Tanzie Marchetta.
-No.

1144
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,309
You're in big trouble.

You haven't had Domino's before?

1148

Well, once at Brigitta's
white-trash hoedown party.

1149
01:09:58,061 --> 01:10:01,087
But, other than that,
our chef always made us low-carb pizza.

1150
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:02,597
Good Lord.

1151
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,202
Look. Thanks for helping us.

1152
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:14,209
All of our so-called friends have treated us
like lepers since this happened.

1153
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:17,610
Yeah, I know about the leper thing.
I was a debate team nerd in high school.

1154
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,205
-So...
-Really? That's cute.

1155
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:24,754
-Nerds are, like, really in right now.
-Yeah? They weren't back then.

1156
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:29,082

wouldn't have given me the time of day.

1157
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:31,491
I don't know about beautiful.

1158
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:34,189
I gained two pounds since I've been poor.

1159
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:36,891
I used to make fun of regular people
with their eye bags

1160
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,369
and their love handles,
but worrying about money is really tiring.

1161
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,100
I got my first eye bag yesterday.

You could use a little
Preparation H for that.

1163
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:53,942
You still look pretty great to me.

1164
01:10:55,485 --> 01:11:00,286
My mom was a model, so looking great
was considered a genetic requirement.

1165
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,827
Where is your mom, anyway?

1166
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:08,757
She's in Europe with an Egyptian prince.

1167
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,668
She changed her name to lsis,
and she calls us her cousins.

1168
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:16,302
We get e-mails every few years.

1169

You wanna know something
really funny, though?

1170
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:24,272
I can remember living in

1171
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,576
and being really happy.

but I totally do.

to believe in us, and you were right.

She was born with a skin disease.

that Marchetta paid for.

Your time is up.

1519
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:30,692
And I even forgot my line.
So whassup, whassup, whassup?

1520
01:32:30,776 --> 01:32:33,076
-WOMEN: Exfoliation.
-Exfoliation.

1521
01:32:33,155 --> 01:32:36,391
Yes! Now, LaFonda. LaFonda!

1522
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:39,769
-I need something fine but grainy...
-Oh, I got a bagel in my bra.

1523
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:41,856
-Just give me a minute.
-I can't look at your face.

1524
01:32:41,942 --> 01:32:42,985
Something fine but grainy.

1525
01:32:43,067 --> 01:32:45,732
Oh! I got a chunky
peanut butter sandwich in my bra.

1526
01:32:45,813 --> 01:32:48,158
-Just give me a minute.
-No, my gosh.

1527
01:32:49,709 --> 01:32:52,579
I got a tube of toothpaste in my bra.
Just give me a minute.

1528
01:32:52,717 --> 01:32:53,679
That's okay.

1529
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:55,929
Something fine and grainy...

1530
01:32:56,012 --> 01:32:57,964
I got a jar of maraschino cherries
in my bra,

1531
01:32:58,052 --> 01:32:59,513
if you just give me a minute.

1532
01:32:59,961 --> 01:33:01,316
No, that's okay.

1533
01:33:02,707 --> 01:33:03,562
(LAUGHlNG)

1534
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:05,735
Would you just grow up, for God's sakes?

1535
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:07,177

(ALL LAUGHlNG)

1537
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:14,205
-This skin show's disgusting! Stop!
-I find it comforting.

1538
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:15,201
Well...
