CAVIL:
I was doing fine here.
Thanks for exposing me.

9
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,956
BROTHER CAVIL:
You weren't doing fine,
thank goodness.

10
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,458
If you'd wiped
out this fleet,

11
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,585
you'd have made us
even more irredeemable

12
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,003
in the eyes
of our parents.

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,589
No, I'd have proved us
to be superior.

14
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,342
No, no, see,
I've figured out
what went wrong.

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,261
Well, that's a very useful
revelation to have

16
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,806
when you're standing
in front of an airlock.

17
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,143
Nonetheless...
Our failure is obvious.

18
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,773
We had our foot on the throat
of humanity and we failed
to step down hard enough.

19
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,899
That was our error.

20
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,777
Have you learned
nothing in all this
time in this fleet?

21
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,572
Because I learned
a great deal among
the rebels on Caprica.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,576
Every killing
of a human being
was a grievous error.

23
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,120
Do you want to know why?

24
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,288
I really don't.

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,957
Are you certain?
Because it's fascinating.

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,336
Listen, Brother,
if you're right,

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,839
that means this whole project
was doomed from the beginning.

28
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,717
Yes.
From the very top.

29
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,756
CAVIL: Dad.

30
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,592
Mom.

31
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,098
Dad. Mom. Dad.

32
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,978
Our parents will be
back with us soon.

33
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,564
Of course,
skin and veins and bones,

34
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,108
they won't survive
the death of the Colonies.

35
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,278
Life among humans
will have humbled them.

36
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,364
When they resurrect,
they'll return

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,659
with apologies tumbling
from their lips like jewels.

38
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,745
Yes. Be prepared for
some very sticky hugs.

39
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:30,293
CAVIL: You know, I've got
a yen to experience a nuclear
holocaust in person.

40
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,880
Perhaps with our dear
mother here,

41
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:38,092
I'll slide in another tub,
and we can download
side-by-side,

42
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,553
after the bombs
hit on Picon.

43

Well, indulge
yourself if you want.

44
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,767
But I'll be on Caprica,
making final arrangements
with our contact.

45
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,021
So if you're going to go,
go soon.

46
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,766
BALTAR: It may interest you
to know that the final results
of the CNP project

47
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,645
are working close
to 95% efficiency
throughout the Fleet.

48

Hold your applause, please.

49
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,982
NO. 6: No applause for me?

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,778
I doubt you would've
ever completed
the project without me.

51
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,947
Yes. Well,
you helped a bit.

52
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,115
I rewrote
half your algorithms.

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,533
All right,
you were extremely helpful,

54
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,161
but let's not forget,
you got something out of it.

55
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,998
All that poking around
inside the defense mainframe.

56
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,796
It should give you
a huge advantage bidding
for the contract next year.

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,215
You know that's not
really why I did it.

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,509
No. You did it
'cause you love me.

59
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,512
I have to go.
I'm meeting someone.

60
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,888
Right.

61
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,601
Really? Who is he?
I'm insanely jealous.

62

So touchy today.

64
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,610
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm meeting someone, too.

You'll call me later,
right?

67
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,759
It's about time.
I wondered when
you'd get here.

68
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,886
Are you clear
on the timing?

69

0700 tomorrow,
Caprica City time.

70
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,770
I recommend you leave
this body behind.

00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,315
The alternative won't make
for a very pleasant memory.

a Three or a Four here.
That's interesting.

The plan is everything

All the humans are dead,
and we Cylons all download,

326

and the universe
basks in justice.

327

However...

328
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,950
It didn't
frakking happen.

329

Exactly.
So it's up to us.

We can all get weapons,
work separately.

Oh, there's a proposal
on the table.

Over 10,000 victims each.
We'll be busy.

333

We can't do this

take out Galactica. With it
gone, the Fleet's dead.

We also have to think
defensively. Avoid

about scrambling

458
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,332
Chief Tyrol loves me.

459
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,792
Chief Tyrol?

460
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,669
(LAUGHS)

461
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:43,797
That's an interesting
human to choose
among all humans.

462
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:49,553
You're a machine, Eight.
Go get some explosives,
blow up the tank,

463
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,513
and then have
a fatal accident.

464
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,223
Right now,
I'm late for dinner.

465
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,443
Let's thank the Gods.

466
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,403
SIMON: Yes. Yes,
let's thank the Gods.

467
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:12,743
GIANA: Thank you, Lords of
Kobol, for uniting our family
in the midst of great tragedy.

468
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,827
We pray.

469
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,219
Well, so it is you.
I thought I recognized you
from the other day.

470
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,471
How come you
didn't stop by?

471
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,808
Hello. I'm Brother Cavil.

472
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:36,934
Hello.

473
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,728
Honey, Brother Cavil
was my childhood priest.

474
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:41,939
Is this your family?

475
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,025
Hmm?

476
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,654
I'm Giana O'Neill,
Simon's wife.

477
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,448
This is Jemmy,
from my first marriage.

478
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:58,789
I don't think I've ever met
anyone from Simon's childhood.
Please, sit down.

479
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,499
Oh, I'm sure we'd have
loads to talk about,

480
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,293
but I'm so busy right now,
you can't imagine.

481
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:07,172
Stop by sometime.
And remember,
I know where you live.

482
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,564

it would be so hot
and dirty. The smell is...

485
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,183
I know.
The Centurions should
be doing this.

(WHISPERING)
Frakkers look like us now.

491
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:28,045
Listen to me. We have
to get out of here, okay?
You need to be very quiet.

492
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,632
Okay? All right.

493
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,639
(SHUSHING)
Just follow me out.
Here we go.

494
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,350
Come on, come on, come on.

495
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:48,440
I was underwater
and I started to lose it.
And to lose who I am.

496
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,947
I didn't know where I was
and... I started to panic
and I tried to breathe.

497
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,156
We shouldn't need
to breathe.

498
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,617
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
I'm not sure.

499
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,079
I'm not sure if we should
detonate the charges.

500
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:07,793
I mean, these humans,
there are so few of them.
They're no threat.

501
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,504
They are manifestly
a threat.

502
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,925
They're a threat
because of the power they
have to make you do this.

503
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,928
Of all Cylons,
you should see that.

504
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:25,477
(CHUCKLES) Now,
you really ought to get
out of those wet clothes.

505
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,692
Fine. Be a prude.

setting you up to take

508

That's what it is.

You wake up somewhere,
you don't know how
you got there or anything.

510
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:22,534
You're drugged,
or manipulated,
or who knows what. Something.

511
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,497
What do we do?

512
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,044
Because if I report
what's happened, they're gonna
think I'm a Cylon agent.

513
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:36,173
No, they're not. No, no,
they're not. Why would
they think that? That's crazy.

514
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,926
People are
getting crazy, okay?
You heard the rumors.

515
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,347
Cylons who look like humans,
sleeper agents
hiding in the Fleet.

Yeah, just saw him.

You sure?
Yeah.

539
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,343
(LAUGHS) Good job.

540
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,557
BROTHER CAVIL: You know,
there are those who think
this current devastation

541
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,601
is punishment
for man's sins.

542
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,062
Is that what you believe,
Brother?

543
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,648
I don't believe
it's punishment
from the Gods, no.

544
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,985
But perhaps...

545
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:11,698
Perhaps the Cylons
have assumed the role
that the Gods once had.

(SCOFFS)

That's a pretty
trippy thought.

548
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,833
Yeah, well,
they're smiting us
pretty well,

549
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,295
and there's certainly
an abundance of sins
to judge.

Do you, you know,
hear confessions?

551
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,310
I can, of course.
Yes, I can.

552
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,692
Good. We'll talk later.

553
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:49,152

I'm very glad to
see you. Very glad.

around here, eh?

Oh.

563
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:31,611
Yes, I found a Three
with a similar problem.
I let her pursue her path.

564

But you...

565
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,742
Oh, did you happen to hear
about the courageous Five

566
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:42,122
that wore an explosive vest
into the corridors
of Galactica recently?

567
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,125
I'm a medic.

568
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,168
There are other things
that I can do.

00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,712
Oh, yes.

570
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,550

That's a fine, fine option.

are you reluctant to do
more for your people?

574
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,812
I'm just asking
a general question.

575
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,397
(LAUGHS)

576
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,860
This is all improv,
isn't it? You're scared,
you're outmanned.

577
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,405
You're surrounded by humans
who weren't supposed to be
alive in the first place.

578
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:21,077
No one was supposed
to be alive! Our people were
supposed to be positioned

579
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,997
to cause destruction,
not mop up afterwards.

580
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:31,546
My Two was
the Defense Minister's
yoga instructor,

581
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,466
if you can believe that,
and one of the Sixes
was a prostitute.

582
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,343
But the only one
in a position to do
any frakking damage

583
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,013
was a Five on this ship,
and he frakked it up!

584
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,727
Now, the universe
still has these
cockroaches in it,

585
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,898
and we can't have any peace
until we step on them all.

586
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,650
(CHUCKLES)
And don't you think
for a moment

587
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:57,489
that I'm gonna be moved
by the sweet, adorable fact
that you married one of them.

588
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:05,914
You come back tomorrow, and
we'll talk about you blowing
up that ship you live on.

589
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:17,759
You're the one
who let the Cylons
into the defense mainframe.

590
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:22,138
You betrayed your colony,
your home, your entire race.

591
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,141
You're the man
responsible for
the Holocaust

592
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:27,018
and I'm here to see
that you're exposed

593
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:30,063
and sentenced to death
as the traitor
you really are.

594
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:36,903
NO. 6: There's also this.
BALTAR: What
the frak's that?

595
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,532
NO. 6: On the disk is a photo.

596
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,492
It was captured from
the security camera

597
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,285
in the defense
mainframe on Caprica.

598
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,329
It shows the doctor
entering the mainframe

599
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,082
without permission
the day before the attack.

600
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,297
As you can see, the man
in the photo is carrying
an explosive device.

601
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,591
Sorry, he's what?

602

HOTDOG ON RECORDER: I'm hit!
STARBUCK: I got you, Hot Dog!

603
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,725
We're going to
make it through this.

604
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,353
Break right. Now! Now! Now!

605
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,523
Frak! I just lost
all three mains.

606
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,775
It's all right, Hot Dog.
You did good.

607
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,319
You're gonna be okay,
I promise you.

this wasn't gonna

This isn't an interrogation,
but it is an investigation.

924
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,653
Do you think he was a Cylon
because he killed himself?

925
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,155
We could use more
Cylons like that, huh?

Good.

929
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,664
Sir, I don't know
how he knew
how to rig an airlock,

930
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:58,376
but he was a smart man.
He learned it somewhere.

murder if their husband
or wife died like that.

but...

933
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,305

just say that.

the old man.

than that. It's like she

frakked it up on purpose,
knowing that the Marines
would take her head off

she could see.

isn't it?

1089
