1
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,398
(drill sergeant)
Guards! Royal salute! Present arms!

2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,675
(stomping boots / gun salute)

3
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,515
(woman) Some people are born
more fortunate than others.

4
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,909
Such was the case with me.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,676
But as a child,
I was convinced of quite the opposite.

6
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,513
What little girl does not dream
of growing up as a princess?

7
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,194
But some palaces
are not at all what you'd think.

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,716
Even a palace... can be a prison.

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,791
(rattling)

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,310
Mama never explained why she
would have someone taste my food.

11
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,871
Why I couldn't attend school with
other children or read popular books.

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,312
When my father died,

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,154
Mama and her adviser,
Sir John Conroy, created rules.

14
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,073
He said they were for my protection,

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,436
and he called it the Kensington System.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,750
I could not sleep in a room
without Mama

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,196
or even walk downstairs
without holding the hand of an adult.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,590
I learned the reason for all this
when I was 1 1.

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,028
My uncle William
was the King of England.

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,148
Yet he and his three brothers
could boast only one living child.

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,716
And that was me.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,758
Sir John's dream
was that the King would die

23
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,956
and there would be a Regency,

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,875
where my mother would rule England
and he would rule my mother.

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,317
So I began to dream of the day
when my life would change...

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,835
.. and I might be free.

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,832
And I prayed for the strength
to meet my destiny.

28
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,399
(whispers) I will be good.

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,870
# ("Zadok the Priest" by Handel)

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,750
(all) God save the Queen!

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,231
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!

32
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,117
(silence)

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,035
(single bell tolls)

34
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,031
(bells chime)

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,119
(man) Sign it!

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,794
Are you sure
that we're doing the right thing?

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,871
We've waited long enough.

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,633
Now, for the last time,
you will sign this order.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,392
I will not sign it.

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,712
I say you will!

41
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,394
- I say I will not.
- How dare you, you...!

42
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,914
Sir John.

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,314
We were just...

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,710
It's time for the Princess's medicine.

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,471
- Shall l?
- I'll do it.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,351
Well, if you're sure.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,354
- Good night, mein liebling.
- Good night, Mama.

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,158
How are you?

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,674
(Leopold)
I've received a letter from England.

50
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,151
My sister says Victoria won't sign
the order for her Regency.

51
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,117
And why would she sign it?

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,159
The Princess is nearly 1 8. Why
would she sign away her own powers?

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,674
Because she is an ignorant baby.

54
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,878
Because she needs guidance and time
to prepare for her role as Queen.

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,389
Until then, my sister
will take her place as Regent.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,392
Sir John Conroy would be Regent.

57
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,109
Unfortunately, the Duchess
is controlled by her controller.

58
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,591
It may be in Your Majesty's interests
to abandon Conroy and your sister,

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,832
before it's too late,
and support the future Queen instead.

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,593
Of course, the Duchess won't like it.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,834
Baron, I was born the younger son
of a penniless duke.

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,354
Now I'm King of the Belgians.

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,672
Such journeys are not managed
without hard decisions.

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,552
Besides,
who controls a young girl most?

65
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,950
Now go to Germany
and finish my nephew's training.

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,917
(man) Albert!

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,871
(Victoria) I suppose you want
to walk with me this afternoon.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,393
Really? Just the two of us alone?
What would Mama say?

69
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,032
(she chuckles)

70
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,238
Hold still
or I'll never get your nose right.

71
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,356
(dog whines)

72
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,590
Oh, I give up!

73
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,152
I give up. You are impossible.
You are impossible. You are impossible.

74
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,437
(Lehzen)
Victoria, your mother's waiting.

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,272
(Victoria) Come on!

76
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,239
Dash!

77
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,472
- Where is the Duchess?
- In the drawing room, Your Highness.

78
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,234
(Conroy) It will take them three days
to arrive by coach from Coburg. Dashy!

79
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,551
- How did you come downstairs?
- I walked.

80
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,437
- Not alone?
- No, not alone.

81
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,795
- Lehzen was with me.
- She held your hand?

82
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,075
She did. Though why she still has to...

83
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,709
Because not everyone in England
wishes you well.

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,631
Put the book down, please.

85
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,792
(chuckles) Dashy!

86
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,678
England is the key to peace in Europe.

87
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,639
Your uncle's throne is six years old
and born of civil war.

88
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,793
He only took the crown of Belgium
because England pledged her support.

89
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,237
And if he's to survive, he must have
English force at his disposal.

90
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,912
Favourite novels?

91
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,868
- Sie hat nicht viele Romane gelesen.
- English. Always English.

92
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,756
She has not read many novels.
They were forbidden until last year.

93
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,910
- But she did like...?
- The Bride of Lammermoor.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,194
- By?
- Sir Walter Scott.

95
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,750
- Other recreations?
- Drawing. The famous dolls, of course.

96
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,958
Piano. Music, generally. It's hard
to believe she knows so little Schubert.

97
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,474
Never mind Schubert.
She likes modern composers.

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,599
- Is she permitted the theatre?
- Only the opera and ballet.

99
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,875
Which opera does she like best?

100
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,231
- Norma?
- (thumps table)

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,117
I Puritani!

102
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,749
(sings aria)

103
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,392
(man) In order to maintain control
over Princess Victoria,

104
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,792
Sir John and the Duchess keep her
away from King William's court.

105
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,758
Thus when she does
make a public appearance,

106
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,230
her mere presence causes quite a stir.

107
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,110
You must win her favour
before anyone else has the chance.

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,231
You still don't look well.
Maybe we should go away for August.

109
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,039
- No, Mama.
- What do you mean, no?

110
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,317
We missed the Queen's birthday.
We will not miss the King's.

111
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,755
We've accepted. We're going.

112
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,834
Really, Victoria, don't issue
orders to me. I'm not a servant.

113
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,674
Well, you've already disobeyed
about the extra rooms. That's enough.

114
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
Are we to live like rabbits,
crammed in a hutch?

115
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,636
We live in a palace, Mama.
We're a lot better off than most people.

116
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,234
The rooms which I took were empty.

117
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,029
Keeping us out of them
was... almost immoral.

118
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,918
- That's what John says.
- I knew he'd have a part in it.

119
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,998
My dearest child,
he only wants what's best for you.

120
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,150
I wish you could believe that.

121
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,156
I've invited the Coburg brothers
to come and stay.

122
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,391
- You ought to know them better.
- Why?

123
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,471
Because you should.

124
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,272
- Uncle Leopold thinks it's a good idea.
- (sighs)

125
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,557
You stick one more pin in me,
I swear I will call the guard.

126
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,231
Your first visit is the most important.
We can not have any mistakes.

127
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,915
And always remember,
you're first a Coburg.

128
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,554
The King of the Belgians is a Coburg.
The King of Portugal is a Coburg,

129
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,997
so is the Queen of England's mother.
And you are the next piece in the game!

130
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,548
(Leopold)
Now go to England and make her smile.

131
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,148
(footman) Is this all the luggage?

132
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,438
- What if she wants to dance?
- It's your first visit. She won't.

133
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,072
- Your Serene Highnesses, welcome.
- Thank you.

134
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,551
I'm Sir John Conroy, controller of the
Duchess's household. This way, please.

135
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,637
The Duchess is in the drawing room.

136
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,590
- Ah! May I present her Royal...
- Hello.

137
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,708
I'm Ernst, ma'am.
This is my brother, Albert.

138
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,914
- We haven't interrupt your studies?
- No, not at all.

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,310
- How was your journey?
- Long, but not too bad.

140
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,992
We had books to keep us busy.

141
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,959
As matter of fact, I passed the time
reading The Bride of Lammermoor.

142
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,632
By Sir Walter... Scott.

143
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,512
Yes.

144
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,758
Do you want to come and meet Mama?

145
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,231
(birdsong)

146
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,678
Of the modern composers, I suppose
Vincenzo Bellini is my favourite.

147
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,435
What a coincidence! So is mine.
Which of his operas do you enjoy most?

148
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,275
- No, wait, let me guess. I Puritani?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

149
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,989
I used to like it too.
Now I prefer Norma.

150
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,115
(dog barks)

151
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,351
Dashy! Go fetch it! Fetch it, Dash!

152
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,032
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

153
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,873
- Have I offended you in some way?
- No.

154
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,430
And Schubert.

155
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,511
I like Schubert.

156
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,036
I think...
I think perhaps you don't,... but I do.

157
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,950
I don't mind Schubert.

158
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,952
Good.

159
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,432
Do you ever feel like
a chess piece yourself?

160
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,990
In a game being played
against your will?

161
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,277
- Do you?
- Constantly.

162
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,273
I see them leaning in
and moving me around the board.

163
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,397
The Duchess and Sir John?

164
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,189
Not just them. Uncle Leopold.

165
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,717
The King. I'm sure half the politicians
are ready to seize hold of my skirts

166
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,588
and drag me from square to square.
(laughs)

167
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,431
Then master the rules of the game
until you play it better than they can.

168
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,149
You don't recommend I find a husband
to play it for me?

169
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,550
I should find one to play it with you,
not for you.

170
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,759
Why don't we ring for some music?
And then we could dance.

171
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,913
I've recently discovered the waltz
and I am quite in love with it.

172
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,236
- Waltzing is not really my forte.
- Oh, dear.

173
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,713
What a shame.

174
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,831
You know the King wants me to marry
my cousin George?

175
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,552
Hmm.

176
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,551
What's he like at chess?

177
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,832
(giggles)

178
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,072
Victoria.

179
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
It's alright, Lehzen,
Albert can take me up.

180
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,357
You'll have to hold my hand.
Mama insists. I hope you don't mind.

181
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,237
Not in the least.

182
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,511
What did you want to say?

183
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,111
Only that I understand more
than you think of what your life is.

184
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,633
Do you?

185
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,110
My childhood wasn't easy either.
I lost my mother when I was a boy.

186
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,555
- I know. She died.
- No, er...

187
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,916
That is, she did die eventually, but...

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,037
she was sent away long before that.

189
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,588
There was some difficulty.

190
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,070
It was all hushed up
and... no one talks of it now.

191
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,551
But I know what it is to live
alone inside your head,

192
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,837
while never giving a clue
as to your real feelings.

193
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,514
Did Uncle Leopold
ask you to tell me that?

194
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,831
No. Er, he actually told me
never to mention it.

195
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,152
(giggles) Well, how little he knows me.

196
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,752
Hmm.

197
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,911
May I write to you?

198
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,914
(she hums)

199
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,072
You'll miss the princes
when they're gone, ma'am.

200
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,912
Don't be impertinent.

201
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,592
(Victoria giggles softly)

202
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,439
- Those boys pester you.
- Oh, please, Lehzen.

203
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,116
You don't think I've come this far
to walk into another jail, do you?

204
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,473
- You must marry one day.
- Well, I don't see why.

205
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,596
And if I do, I shall please myself,

206
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,435
not Mama or Uncle Leopold or the King
or anyone else. Trust me.

207
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,318
(hums / giggles)

208
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,192
- Must l?
- Yes, you must.

209
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,749
Be on your guard.

210
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
We are going to Windsor
for my uncle's birthday party.

211
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,438
- In the castle of the enemy.
- Your enemy, Sir John, not mine.

212
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,512
- Agree to nothing.
- What should I say about the rooms?

213
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,275
You needed the space.
Appeal to the Queen. It's ridiculous.

214
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,352
I wish you were coming with us.

215
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,276
You're very intent, Baroness.
Are you making a study of me?

216
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,793
Someone should.

217
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,191
(horses whinny)

218
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,909
- Present Prime Minister?
- Melbourne.

219
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,991
Lord Melbourne.

220
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,596
The Liberal leader who'll probably be
in power when the Princess succeeds.

221
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,353
- He may be troublesome.
- Why?

222
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,830
He puts the interests of England
above those of Europe.

223
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,913
- Which is bad?
- Which is not useful to us.

224
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,596
He wouldn't spill one drop of
English blood to save a foreign throne.

225
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,035
(Lord Chamberlain)
The Viscount Melbourne.

226
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,473
Why would he save a foreign throne
if it wasn't in England's interest?

227
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,759
That is just the kind of thinking
your Uncle Leopold is afraid of.

228
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,630
Which is why he's content to find his
niece is the future Queen of England.

229
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,790
(Lord Chamberlain)
The Duke of Wellington.

230
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,396
In the public mind, the leader of the
Conservative opposition is a pet hero,

231
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,278
Napoleon's conqueror,
the grand old Duke of Wellington.

232
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,794
- But not in fact.
- No.

233
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,678
- You look in very good health, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

234
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,514
- I wish I was. Enjoy the meal.
- Thank you.

235
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,479
The next T ory Prime Minister
will be Sir Robert Peel.

236
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,312
(Lord Chamberlain)..and Lady Peel.

237
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,240
Which side does Victoria favour?

238
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,440
She's a Liberal. Above all,
she favours Lord Melbourne.

239
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,193
And he'll take full advantage of it.

240
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,912
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Victoria of Kent.

241
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,434
Her Royal Highness,
the Duchess of Kent.

242
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,511
The Lady Flora Hastings.

243
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,308
- Hello, Uncle.
- Look at that demure little head.

244
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,676
And all of us
wondering what's inside it.

245
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,671
We'll find out soon enough.

246
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,550
Lord Melbourne will make her fall
in love with him. It's his method.

247
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,479
- Don't underestimate Victoria.
- Don't underestimate Melbourne.

248
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,514
(King William) My dearest niece.

249
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,559
- Won't you greet your cousin George?
- Good evening, George.

250
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,950
How can my niece and nephew have
grown up so when I wasn't looking?

251
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,476
Whereas you are quite unchanged
and as handsome as ever.

252
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,599
If I put my head very close to yours
and speak softly,

253
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,989
- they'll think we're hatching a plot.
- Yes.

254
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,150
If I look a little surprised,... (gasps)

255
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,710
- well, then they'll know it.
- (both laugh)

256
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,035
I wish we saw more of you. But then,
nor you nor I are to blame for that.

257
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,113
The plain fact is, madam,
you have stolen 1 7 rooms!

258
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,630
One cannot steal a room, sir.
The rooms are where you left them.

259
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,314
Now they are used,
before they were empty.

260
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,358
I see. So I have no say
in my own palaces?

261
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,432
Why not move in here
and bring your lrish tinker with you?

262
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,478
The Queen and l
will be happy enough in the lodge!

263
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,839
So would I be, sir, if I thought that
people there would be polite to me!

264
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,798
- How dare you talk...!
- Enough!

265
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,591
You have exhausted the topic.

266
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,594
Conroy tried to force the Princess
Victoria's agreement to a Regency.

267
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,390
She wouldn't sign it, sick as she was.
That says something for her spirit.

268
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,398
Your next birthday
will be quite a landmark.

269
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,155
- I hope we'll see more of you at Court.
- I hope so too, Lord Melbourne.

270
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,673
(woman laughs)

271
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,839
You know,
should you ever need an ally,...

272
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,309
you have one in me.

273
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,790
The Prime Minister
has more important calls upon his time.

274
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,189
Not at all.
I knew the late Duke of Kent.

275
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,555
Naturally,
I take an interest in his daughter.

276
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,872
- You knew my father?
- Yes.

277
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,838
I'm sorry.
Is it difficult to speak of him?

278
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,675
No. I love to hear from someone who
knew him. For I never did, you see.

279
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,517
Well,... he was a great gentleman.
Of that you can be sure.

280
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,033
Indeed I am.

281
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,910
Excellent company like his brother, the
Regent, but not quite so extravagant.

282
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:22,236
And kind, like his brother, the King,...
but perhaps not so talkative.

283
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,151
(laughs)

284
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,357
Well, you make him sound
as though he were the best of them.

285
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh, I think so, ma'am.

286
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,395
Your leader is hard at work, Duchess.

287
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,429
You see him hover with his net
to catch the pretty butterfly.

288
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,752
And when your party is back in power,
Duke, will you not do the same?

289
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,435
(laughs)
Not nearly as well as Melbourne.

290
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,991
Unfortunately, I have no small talk.
Peel has no manners.

291
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,510
And I would have a hard time
praising her father.

292
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,876
The most brutal officer
I ever encountered.

293
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,513
(orchestra stops playing)

294
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,750
(he sighs)

295
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,829
(he sighs)

296
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,151
(slurred) I thank you
for your good wishes on my birthday.

297
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,354
It has been a long life...
and an interesting one.

298
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,270
But I shall be content
with only a short while more.

299
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:09,152
Just enough... to dispense
with any thought of a Regency,...

300
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,875
..so that I may pass the Royal
Authority directly to that young lady.

301
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,188
And not... to the hands...
of a person now near me...

302
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,269
..who is surrounded by evil advisers

303
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,957
and who cannot act with propriety in
the station in which she's been placed!

304
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,793
I have been insulted!

305
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,395
Grossly and continually insulted!

306
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:50,477
She has kept her daughter,
my brother's child, from my Court!

307
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,793
But from now on,
I'd have her know that I am King!

308
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,668
And I will not be flouted
or disobeyed by her

309
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,355
or by that jackanapes
she keeps about her!

310
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,996
Are you alright?

311
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,150
(heavy door slams)

312
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,232
Families, who'd be without them?

313
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,712
(insects chirrup)

314
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,677
Are you listening?

315
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,032
What?

316
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,712
- Well?
- Ma'am, you do have a letter,

317
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,837
but it's not from Germany,
it's from the King.

318
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,439
So it is. Thank you, Watson.

319
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,836
- Don't you see what he wants?
- He increases my income

320
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,879
once I'm 1 8 and he asks to see me
at Court, what is wrong with that?

321
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,556
The King wants to separate you from
your mother. He wants to control you,

322
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,757
to take you from those whose sole aim
is trying to protect you!

323
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,150
No need to shout. The people
will find out our business soon enough

324
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,471
without hearing it from your lips.

325
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,836
Tell her. Make her understand.

326
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,719
What Sir John means is that you're
unprepared for the task ahead of you.

327
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,711
And if I am, whose fault is that?

328
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,598
You're too young! You've no experience!

329
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,478
You're like a china doll
walking over a precipice!

330
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,394
Well, then, I must smash!
For it's too late to mend my ways now!

331
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,916
- So if you'll excuse me...
- But I will not excuse you!

332
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,958
Now this is what you will do!

333
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,192
First, you will refuse the money and
demand that it be given to your mother.

334
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,592
Next, you will appoint me
your private secretary from today.

335
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,558
Finally, you will agree
to be co-regent with the Duchess

336
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,156
until your 25th birthday.
Neither she nor I will accept less!

337
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,198
You may do
what you like with the money.

338
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,714
Now, get out of my way!

339
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,916
And if you think that I will ever forget

340
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,470
that you just stood by silent
and you watched him treat me thus,

341
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,551
you are dreaming!

342
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,277
(dog whimpers)

343
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,198
(King William) Is there no limit
to this disobedience?

344
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,989
Mark my words!
The reign of King Conroy is coming!

345
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,471
My poor sister-in-law. What is the hold
that wicked man has over her?

346
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,396
What about her uncle in Brussels?
Could he not be of assistance?

347
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,951
King Leopold is as slippery
as a barrel full of eels.

348
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,238
If he did dislodge Conroy, it'd only be
to tighten his own grip on the girl.

349
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,673
Mightn't there be some benefit
if I pay Princess Victoria a visit

350
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,548
before Conroy
has a chance to usurp her?

351
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,677
(sighs) Very well.

352
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,196
Lord, in your mercy, get me past May!

353
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,469
That way she'll be of age and we'll
have killed off the Regency at least.

354
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,758
I tell you, Lord Melbourne,
his behaviour to me

355
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,072
makes it impossible to keep him
in any post near my person.

356
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,549
Any post whatever.

357
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,031
You don't think it more dangerous
to cut him loose?

358
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,477
I know things that mean
I could never have confidence in him.

359
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,074
Now, I see I must endure Lady Flora.

360
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,993
Mama cannot appear at Court
without a lady-in-waiting,

361
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,071
but I draw the line at Conroy.

362
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,391
And once I'm Queen, I do not wish
to look upon his face again.

363
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,436
Well, we can't prevent the Duchess

364
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,875
from keeping him
in charge of her own affairs.

365
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,952
That will be her mistake, not mine.

366
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,469
(Albert)
My dear Victoria, when I think...

367
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,915
Dearest Victoria,
if ever you should need...

368
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,599
What? Like a vulture? T o hover
at the edge until the King is dead?

369
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,912
And, ma'am, you needn't worry.

370
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,675
I'll be your private secretary.
For now, at least.

371
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,593
Thank you, Lord Melbourne.
That is a great comfort to me.

372
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,878
- Wenn er tot ist, dann gibt es mehr...
- Ernst! English, please!

373
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,112
When he is dead, there'll be more
than one vulture to contend with.

374
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,317
We should consider
the new appointments.

375
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,868
Your ladies-in-waiting and so forth.

376
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,953
Perhaps the Duchess of Sutherland
for Mistress of the Robes?

377
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,678
Oh, I don't really know her.

378
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,150
Ma'am, she's a dear friend of mine.
You'll enjoy her enormously.

379
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,312
I should be lost without your guidance.

380
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,279
- I hope you know how grateful I am.
- I'll draw up a list.

381
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,476
What is it? Don't you like her?

382
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,279
Yes, I like her.

383
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,237
More than I dared hope.

384
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,393
But it's not up to me, is it.
What do you call a man

385
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,075
who waits for a rich woman to decide
whether or not she wants him?

386
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,350
- Then, why not tell her how you feel?
- (sighs)

387
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,554
(Albert) My dear Victoria,

388
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,918
these days will be full of sadness
since I know the King is dear to you.

389
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,676
Will you allow me to offer my support,
albeit at a distance?

390
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,273
If I cannot be with you,

391
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,876
then I pray you will hear my voice
in the music that I send.

392
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,679
You know my love of Schubert.

393
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,790
This is his "Swan Song".
And I play it with you in my heart.

394
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,273
- Is he ready?
- Well, he may be, but she isn't.

395
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,112
Let her enjoy succession
and the freedom it'll bring.

396
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,150
We must wait for disillusion,
and the loneliness that follows.

397
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,791
(Duchess of Kent) Victoria.

398
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,711
You must come now.

399
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,515
Long live the Queen.

400
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,875
(door opens)

401
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,114
I'm going back to bed.

402
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,078
I imagine Lord Melbourne
will be here quite early.

403
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,393
Make sure he has everything he needs
if I am not ready to receive him.

404
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,471
Of course, Your Royal...

405
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,991
Your Majesty.

406
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,677
Victoria, wait. I will hold your hand.

407
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,432
No. Thank you, Mama.

408
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,432
And, Lehzen, in the morning,
arrange for my bed to be moved

409
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,112
into a room of my own?

410
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,476
- Surely there's no need...
- As soon as possible, Lehzen.

411
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,237
The Council is assembled,
Your Majesty.

412
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,669
(Lord Chamberlain)
Her Majesty the Queen!

413
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,913
(clears throat)

414
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,115
It is with a sense
of reverence and honour

415
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,112
that I address you,
my Privy Councillors,

416
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,839
as your Sovereign and Queen.

417
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,516
I mourn sincerely the death
of my dear uncle, the King,

418
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,391
but I know I may count on you to serve
me as loyally as you served him.

419
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,597
(clears throat)

420
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,319
I am young, but I am willing to learn.

421
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,313
And I mean to devote my life
to the service of my country

422
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,868
and my people.

423
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,872
I look for your help in this.

424
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,191
I know I shall not be disappointed.

425
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,077
Thank you.

426
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,113
She starts on your watch,
Lord Melbourne.

427
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,272
Guard her well
and keep her safe from harm.

428
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,952
(door closes)

429
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,515
(exhales deeply)

430
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,149
As a matter of interest, will a time
come when I read them first?

431
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,392
You'll enjoy this.
She has a real flair for description.

432
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,473
Present arms!

433
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,517
(Victoria) Dearest Albert, on Tuesday,
I went to inspect Buckingham Palace.

434
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,628
It is only just finished and I shall be
the very first sovereign to live there.

435
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,272
As I stepped out of the carriage,

436
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,911
for the first time in my life,
I felt freedom.

437
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,638
- Splendid, is it not?
- Y es!

438
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,313
(Queen Adelaide) You'll have to decide
on a husband soon.

439
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,072
What about Leopold's candidate?

440
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,469
I can't marry the man
they want me to marry.

441
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,312
Oh!

442
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,393
Every suitor
will come with strings attached.

443
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,031
Can't I be my own mistress for a while?
Haven't I earned it?

444
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,874
Dear Lord M, he's so very kind. I
couldn't have asked for a better tutor.

445
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,191
You may dream of independence,
but you won't get it.

446
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,193
From now on, everyone will push you
and pull you for their own advantage.

447
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,999
Melbourne more than the rest.

448
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,073
Just remember, you are the Queen,
he's a politician.

449
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,199
And politicians, whatever their creed,
always resent a monarchy.

450
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,397
They pass through. You stay.

451
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,951
So just keep "dear Lord M"
in his proper sphere.

452
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,077
He's already chosen the new household.

453
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,594
About my ladies-in-waiting...

454
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,390
Yes, I'll have a list brought
over later. They've all accepted.

455
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,712
Only my aunt advised me not to be,
well, too partisan in my choice.

456
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,155
With respect, Your Majesty,

457
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,392
I think I understand these things at
least as well as the Queen Dowager.

458
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,833
I know that, of course.

459
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,959
And we want our friends around us,
of course, surely,

460
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,235
as we begin our labours.

461
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,677
We don't want to find Sir John Conroy
sneaking his feet back under the table.

462
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,957
No. Not if we have to line up
every friend we both possess.

463
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,830
Well, quite, ma'am. It's very cold
in here. Why haven't they lit the fires?

464
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,230
It seems the fires are laid
by the Lord Steward's department,

465
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,072
but lit by the Lord Chamberlain's,

466
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,870
and no one knows which footmen
should do it. It's not very sensible.

467
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,270
Well, if that's the way things are done,
I shouldn't meddle.

468
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,954
We must improve where we can.

469
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,634
If I've discovered anything
from touring England,

470
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,915
it's the suffering that needs my help.

471
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,911
Never try to do good, Your Majesty.

472
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,514
- It always leads to terrible scrapes.
- (laughs)

473
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,309
Lord Melbourne, that is not
what is preached from the pulpit.

474
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,311
No. That's why I never go to church.

475
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
One always hears
the most extraordinary things.

476
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,156
(laughs)

477
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,511
I've made no promise to him.

478
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,516
But sometimes I feel
quite alone in the world.

479
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,797
Never while I'm here, Your Majesty.

480
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,397
(Victoria)
Lord Melbourne is akin to a miracle.

481
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,153
He has proved to be most generous
and sensitive,

482
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,312
quite wondrous in a politician,

483
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,630
someone I trust and hold dear.

484
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,269
- He is the best company imaginable.
- (bell tinkles)

485
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,558
Sometimes we laugh so much,
it's as if we were naughty children.

486
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,038
Oh, Albert, I so look forward to the day
when you can know and value him

487
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,997
as I do.

488
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,233
Yours affectionately, Victoria.

489
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,597
Plenty of praise for Lord Melbourne
and not much of anything else.

490
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,550
- Everything comes to he who waits.
- And if nothing comes, what then?

491
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,518
You've played with me, Baron.

492
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,751
And now it is enough.
I'm going back to England.

493
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,832
There must be a reason
if you wish to visit Her Majesty.

494
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,718
(Albert) Then find me a reason.

495
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,751
Ich will diesen...

496
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,879
So, are you going to propose?

497
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,628
What? What am I supposed to think?
You're going to enjoy the weather?

498
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,314
I'm going to spend some time with her,
that's all.

499
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,395
Besides, I am forbidden.

500
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,199
It has to come from her, apparently.

501
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,831
So I could not propose,
even if I wanted to.

502
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,751
And do you want to?

503
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,869
(coachman) Walk on! Hup, hup!

504
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,516
(Victoria) Please hold still. I'm afraid
I always find noses a challenge.

505
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,474
Am I permitted to talk?

506
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,949
Yes, but you can't move.

507
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,518
There's nothing to rival
an English garden.

508
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,479
Of all my life in Kensington,
it's the only part I'll miss.

509
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,074
But the gardens at Buckingham Palace,
surely...

510
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,072
- You're moving!
- Oh.

511
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,549
Now you're smiling.

512
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,554
(laughs) lmpossible!
You're worst than him!

513
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,511
(both laugh)

514
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,798
I believe we have a duty
to those in need of our protection.

515
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,757
It is the business of every sovereign

516
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,469
to champion the dispossessed,
for no one else will.

517
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,836
Take housing. May I show you?

518
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,751
Industry is expanding so fast

519
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,913
that people are not considering
where the workers will live.

520
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,356
But I've been experimenting.
By building these in units of two,

521
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,436
you can build safe, clean homes for
two families for less than the cost...

522
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,317
I'm sorry. I don't mean to preach.

523
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,551
No, there's no need to apologise
for being passionate.

524
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,909
It seems I have a lot to learn.

525
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,717
With all my duties and...

526
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,509
- And I do take them very seriously.
- I know you do.

527
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,955
But plenty of people
will expect me to fail.

528
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,713
And there are even more
trying to take advantage

529
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,473
of my youth and inexperience.

530
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,472
Then, they don't know you like I do.

531
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,877
May I keep this?

532
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,790
So, remember, the first thing
is to find an anchor point.

533
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,031
So, take your hand back
to beneath your chin.

534
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,588
Good. This is where
it will come every time.

535
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,910
Now, release the bow.

536
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,309
Your hand must cover the leather,
like this.

537
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,834
And make a firm claw.
One finger, two fingers.

538
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,708
- Claw.
- Yes, and back to beneath the chin.

539
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,157
Bend this arm slightly.
Rotate to catch the arrow.

540
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,719
Good.

541
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,951
Very good. Now, try with an arrow.

542
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,749
- Ah. He's still here?
- At my mother's insistence.

543
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,751
Certainly not mine.

544
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,711
(Duchess of Kent) Where am I to live?

545
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,519
Am I to be abandoned here?

546
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,795
Or am I to beg along the highways
for a crust?

547
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,668
Come now. You will move
into the palace with the Queen.

548
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,672
But she's arranged
a separate apartment for you.

549
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,876
It will allow you both more privacy.

550
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,112
I... I don't want privacy
from my own child!

551
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,397
To exclude us will launch
the new reign in a cloud of scandal.

552
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,153
(Duchess) I know your game, my lord.

553
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,756
You want to be her father, her mother,
and who knows what else.

554
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,794
If I'm not to be her private secretary,
then what?

555
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,396
I'm sorry. I can see
that I am not speaking clearly.

556
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,911
You have played the game and lost.

557
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,036
The Prime Minister is here,
Your Majesty.

558
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,156
Thank you, Duchess.

559
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,958
Have I thanked you properly
for accepting the post?

560
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,634
It will involve
a good deal of inconvenience.

561
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,314
To be Mistress of the Robes
is a great honour.

562
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,470
I'm only anxious to prove worthy of it.

563
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,994
My Lord Melbourne
thinks you'll be perfect.

564
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,110
(Leopold) How is Albert's visit going?

565
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,990
(Stockmar) He writes Victoria is under
Melbourne's control. He's frustrated.

566
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,672
Then he must stay in England

567
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,469
until the Queen thinks more of him
than she does of Melbourne.

568
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,552
(Melbourne)
Queen Elizabeth never married.

569
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,676
It didn't spoil things for her.

570
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,038
Are you familiar with the Coronation
Chair and the ancient Stone of Scone?

571
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,511
Familiar, yes,... but quite in awe.

572
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:42,436
I'm terribly afraid of disappointing
on a day I so want to do it perfectly.

573
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,511
Just be yourself. Your instincts
are always to your credit.

574
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,710
(man clears throat)

575
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,712
I'm sorry. They're preparing
the Abbey for the ceremony.

576
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,793
I'm told they asked permission
for a glimpse of Your Majesty.

577
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,317
- Don't be sorry.
- God bless, Your Majesty.

578
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,749
I do want to help them,
whatever you say.

579
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,628
And not just the labouring poor,
but the hungry and the homeless.

580
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,594
There are people who are lost. Whose
business is it to see to their welfare?

581
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,629
Well, in my experience, it's best
to let these things develop naturally.

582
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,393
If you interfere,
you risk overturning the cart.

583
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,076
Prince Albert doesn't agree. He's made
a study of the working man's condition.

584
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,038
He's full to the brim
with ideas for their improvement.

585
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,829
Is he indeed? How inspiring.

586
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,275
Well, good. He sounds like a young man

587
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,874
ready to take charge
at the first opportunity.

588
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,834
Then, you had better master
the rules of the game

589
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,309
until you play it better than they can.

590
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,352
Are you quite sure about that, ma'am?

591
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,433
Make your move.

592
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,878
(chess pieces clatter)

593
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,188
(gasps)

594
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,031
(door closes)

595
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,471
Well?

596
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,439
You may not accompany me
to the Proclamation Ceremony.

597
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,792
You may not attend the Coronation.

598
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,798
# ("Zadok the Priest" by Handel)

599
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,755
Perfect.

600
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,515
- (Duchess of Kent) You're unprepared.
- (Conroy) No experience! Too young!

601
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,273
(Albert)
Then, they don't know you like I do.

602
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,632
(bells ring)

603
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,593
(distant applause / cheering)

604
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,431
(glass smashes)

605
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,758
(laughs) Don't look so surprised.
The Queen has many different duties.

606
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,277
It's heartening to see she won't
neglect them, even on Coronation Day.

607
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,273
- I don't think Dash would allow it.
- Try to get some rest before the ball.

608
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,592
I will. Since I firmly intend
to dance until dawn.

609
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,036
(she hums softly)

610
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,391
(orchestra tunes up)

611
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,549
(Lord Chamberlain)
Her Majesty the Queen.

612
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:08,258
Are you sure this is wise?

613
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:13,658
(orchestra starts up)

614
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,780
(music stops)

615
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:55,186
It's been quite a day. Are you tired?

616
00:54:55,269 --> 00:54:58,147
Oh, no.
Ah, well, not really. It's just...

617
00:54:58,229 --> 00:55:00,379
Well, I'm stronger than I look.

618
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:04,779
- How much longer are you in London?
- Only until Friday.

619
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:08,623
Then home via Brussels.
Uncle Leopold must have his report.

620
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:12,224
- (laughs)
- (music starts)

621
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,665
Oh, dear. I have a quadrille
with the Prince of Prussia next.

622
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:19,378
My poor little toes.
I feel sorry for them already. (laughs)

623
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:22,580
Your Majesty.

624
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:45,462
(Victoria)
I've had a letter from King Leopold.

625
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:48,985
He proposes
extending this visit of Prince Albert.

626
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:52,459
- And what have you answered?
- Nothing yet.

627
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,863
Well, perhaps you should tell your uncle

628
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:58,861
you need to focus
on your new duties right now.

629
00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:01,258
(thunder)

630
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:03,425
(both laugh)

631
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,147
(she laughs)

632
00:56:09,189 --> 00:56:11,703
Thank you for being my messenger.

633
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:15,225
I hope I've given my uncle enough
detail. Fill in anything I've missed.

634
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:19,348
- He takes a great interest in you.
- Yes, don't I know it.

635
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:22,819
You should see the questions
he asks by every letter.

636
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:26,060
- Like a never-ending examination.
- (both laugh)

637
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,619
Lord Melbourne calls him this...
(laughs)

638
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:32,701
What about Lord Melbourne?

639
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,543
Nothing.

640
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:41,977
- The French Ambassador is here.
- Right. Erm...

641
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:45,179
I wish you a good journey.

642
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:54,099
Victoria?

643
00:56:55,069 --> 00:56:59,187
(sighs)
I would so like to be useful to you.

644
00:57:00,229 --> 00:57:02,379
If there is ever an opportunity.

645
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:04,664
I know you would.

646
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:08,624
But not yet.

647
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:45,223
- (inhales)
- (Leopold) Have you read this?

648
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:47,300
No, sir.

649
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:52,909
It seems
she does not think it appropriate

650
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:56,948
to discuss politics in our otherwise
"delightful correspondence".

651
00:57:57,029 --> 00:58:00,624
- Which was dictated by Melbourne.
- Damn it!

652
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:03,742
(Leopold) Do something!

653
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:05,899
(Stockmar) I can't get past Melbourne.

654
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:11,427
Then get him past Melbourne!
Get him into her bed!

655
00:58:11,509 --> 00:58:14,740
(Albert) My dear Victoria,
Uncle Leopold is full of ideas

656
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:17,662
of how you and I may spend
more time together.

657
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:21,981
And I must say I hope that some
of them, at least, will come to pass.

658
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:24,503
(clock chimes)

659
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:42,106
(Victoria) Dear Albert,
you've been keeping secrets.

660
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:45,340
When did you learn
to dance so beautifully?

661
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:48,501
Lord M assures me
the next several months

662
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:52,264
will be particularly gruelling
and busy for me as a new Queen.

663
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:56,342
Thus, I am not certain
when I shall see you again.

664
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,860
I look forward to your every letter,

665
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:05,181
enjoying the detail of life in Germany,
and wishing to share more.

666
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:10,661
- Waterloo might not...
- Yours affectionately, Victoria.

667
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:14,981
Ah, this quite inoffensive little game
can turn into an effective weapon!

668
00:59:15,069 --> 00:59:17,344
(all laugh)

669
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,466
Lord Melbourne says
French doctors kill their patients.

670
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:23,939
- English ones just let them die.
- (all laugh)

671
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,781
I thought he might be here tonight.

672
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:28,429
(Victoria) He's thrown me over
for Lady Holland.

673
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:32,707
- I expect Your Majesty will miss him.
- Not too severely. He's back tomorrow.

674
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:35,428
No, no, no.
I meant when he's out of power.

675
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:37,625
What?

676
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:43,418
Well, only, I don't wish to crow, but...
I thought it was common knowledge

677
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:46,501
that he's about to lose the vote.

678
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:56,906
Schatzi?
I thought you were in your bedroom.

679
01:00:07,989 --> 01:00:10,378
(sobs)

680
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:18,461
Never mind.

681
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:23,145
- (sobs)
- (Lehzen) Shh. Shh.

682
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:26,141
- You won't desert me, will you?
- Never.

683
01:00:26,229 --> 01:00:28,265
Mein liebes Schatzi.

684
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:38,225
Every one of your ladies is the wife
of a friend of Lord Melbourne.

685
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:40,140
Surely you can see how that looks?

686
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:43,266
You should not set such store
by appearances, Sir Robert.

687
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:47,501
I only ask for a token. For two ladies,
even one, who supports my cause.

688
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:51,582
Otherwise, it must seem as if
Palace and Parliament have fallen out.

689
01:00:51,669 --> 01:00:54,103
- I want to go in.
- I beg your pardon, ma'am.

690
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:58,182
Her Majesty is with the Prime Minister
and cannot be disturbed.

691
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:00,464
But that will not apply to her mother.

692
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:02,938
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

693
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,621
Let me understand you.

694
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:09,258
Are you saying it is the Prime Minister
who selects my household?

695
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:12,227
- Has the law changed in this regard?
- No, of course not.

696
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:15,267
Well, then, there cannot be
much more to be said.

697
01:01:18,149 --> 01:01:22,745
- (bell rings)
- Good day, Sir Robert.

698
01:01:27,189 --> 01:01:30,499
Could you please ask Lady Portman
to come in as you leave?

699
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:33,580
Yes, ma'am.

700
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:46,501
I wonder if you could have a note
delivered to Lord Melbourne.

701
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:48,261
Of course, ma'am.

702
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,020
# ("King Arthur" by Purcell)

703
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:03,263
# What power...

704
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:05,943
(woman) Mrs Melbourne!

705
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:07,428
# Art thou...

706
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:11,707
- Good God! What are we coming to?
- Who was it? I didn't see.

707
01:02:13,389 --> 01:02:19,828
The Duchess of Montrose. That's
the end to her career at Court, I hope.

708
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:26,862
If I ban everyone who thinks me wrong,
you and I will be alone in the ballroom.

709
01:02:28,629 --> 01:02:31,746
- (hubbub)
- With sorrow, I must inform the House

710
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:34,184
that I have been unable
to persuade the Queen

711
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:38,660
that her ladies should not solely
adhere to the views of my opponents.

712
01:02:38,749 --> 01:02:41,946
- (hubbub)
- I have therefore informed Her Majesty

713
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:44,338
that I am not qualified
to form a government,

714
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:47,227
if I do not enjoy her confidence.

715
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:48,662
(hubbub)

716
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:52,298
Mr Speaker, are we to understand
that the great Sir Robert Peel

717
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:55,745
has been frightened off
by a few frilly petticoats?

718
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:58,741
(laughter / hubbub)

719
01:02:58,829 --> 01:03:00,785
(Speaker) Prime Minister!

720
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,780
(Peel) Mr Speaker, what frightens me

721
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:05,986
is to see the Crown
used as a shuttlecock

722
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:09,618
- in the game of politics!
- (hubbub)

723
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:12,906
Which, apparently,
Lord Melbourne plays better than you!

724
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,786
- (hubbub)
- Order!

725
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:16,461
Constitutional crisis!

726
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:20,542
(newsboy) Queen flouts Prime Minister!
Threat to bring down Tory government!

727
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:22,745
- Order!
- Constitutional crisis!

728
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:25,059
(Peel) You should be
ashamed of yourself, sir.

729
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:27,538
If the Queen has been foolish,
she can plead youth.

730
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:29,699
You are old enough to know better.

731
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:33,304
What troubles you is that Lord
Melbourne is Prime Minister again.

732
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:35,425
I do hate a bad loser.

733
01:03:35,509 --> 01:03:39,980
We are all losers in this, sir.
Most especially the Queen.

734
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:42,264
(Adelaide)
You have to understand you reign

735
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:45,147
by right of Parliament.
Work with the voters' choice.

736
01:03:45,229 --> 01:03:48,187
- Lord Melbourne says...
- He says what suits his interest.

737
01:03:48,269 --> 01:03:49,987
He has used you to punish his enemies

738
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:52,299
without a thought
for the damage to the Crown.

739
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:55,745
The Queen is in the clutches
of Melbourne, the great seducer!

740
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:59,105
And when he is silent,
who does she listen to?

741
01:03:59,189 --> 01:04:03,819
- Her German mother.
- I'm glad he thinks I listen to Mama.

742
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:08,300
You are confusing stubbornness
with strength, my dear.

743
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:11,381
And I warn you,
the people will not like you for it.

744
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:13,664
(hubbub)

745
01:04:17,429 --> 01:04:20,387
(Ernst) She's brought down
a government over her ladies?

746
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:23,108
- Apparently.
- Then she's a fool.

747
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:26,704
No, she is not a fool.
But she has listened to a fool.

748
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:29,747
Then she had better change her advisor.

749
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:33,219
(Ernst) Or things will get worse
before they get better.

750
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:44,219
- (protesters shouting outside)
- Open the door.

751
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:46,459
"Not all the water
in the rough, rude sea

752
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,383
can wash the balm off
from an anointed king."

753
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:55,027
"The breath of worldly men

754
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:59,660
cannot depose the deputy
elected by the Lord."

755
01:04:59,749 --> 01:05:02,502
- (shouting outside)
- "For every man..."

756
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:04,307
Sir John, what are you doing here?

757
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:07,347
- I must speak to the Queen.
- You know that's impossible.

758
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,980
(he whispers)

759
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:14,459
"Welcome, my lord.
How far off lies your power?"

760
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:19,506
An armed man
has been found in the gardens.

761
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:22,740
- What?!
- He said he wished to harm the Queen.

762
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:26,663
"..discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but..."

763
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:29,821
(glass smashes /hubbub)

764
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:45,062
(shouting outside)

765
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:49,347
They think I have interfered in matters
that do not concern me.

766
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:54,745
It'll pass, ma'am, you'll see.

767
01:05:57,349 --> 01:06:00,739
(Albert) My dear Victoria,
while these days may feel endless,

768
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:04,424
please do not lose faith
in yourself or your people.

769
01:06:04,509 --> 01:06:06,659
We are all allowed to make mistakes,

770
01:06:06,749 --> 01:06:09,821
most especially when
we have looked to others for guidance.

771
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:15,939
(Victoria) The storm still rages
outside the palace walls.

772
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:19,066
I wonder now if everyone was right.

773
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:24,348
Perhaps I am too young and
inexperienced for my position.

774
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:30,468
(Albert)
Open your mind, examine your choices,

775
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:33,541
and your honesty
will take you through the storm.

776
01:06:33,629 --> 01:06:36,701
I promise that you can do this work
and do it well.

777
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:38,586
You have courage and heart

778
01:06:38,669 --> 01:06:42,298
and you said yourself
you're stronger than you look.

779
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:47,506
(footsteps)

780
01:06:49,749 --> 01:06:51,819
(Lehzen) A letter from your mother.

781
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:55,940
(Duchess of Kent) My dearest child.

782
01:06:56,029 --> 01:06:58,589
You will not let me come to you,

783
01:06:58,669 --> 01:07:01,058
and that I may deserve,

784
01:07:01,149 --> 01:07:03,379
but however you resent me,

785
01:07:03,469 --> 01:07:08,668
however I have failed,
I am still and always your mother.

786
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,661
What troubles you, troubles me.

787
01:07:11,749 --> 01:07:15,025
What pleases you, pleases me.

788
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:16,747
I love you.

789
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:22,108
And my only prayer is that one day
you will understand how much.

790
01:07:22,189 --> 01:07:26,102
Goodnight, mein Liebling.
Your own Mama.

791
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,701
(sobs)

792
01:07:36,509 --> 01:07:38,739
(Victoria) My dearest Albert.

793
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:42,663
You asked me once
if you could be of help to me,

794
01:07:42,749 --> 01:07:49,302
and I so proud and confident
of my great powers replied, "Not yet".

795
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:55,026
But since that day
so much has changed.

796
01:08:02,709 --> 01:08:05,701
I'm not forgiven yet.

797
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,381
Not yet, but soon.

798
01:08:07,469 --> 01:08:10,586
Just wait for unseasonal weather
or the news of some elopement,

799
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,705
and it'll all be forgotten.

800
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,587
You don't have a very high opinion
of ordinary people,

801
01:08:15,669 --> 01:08:17,182
do you, Lord Melbourne?

802
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,700
With respect,
I have lived longer than Your Majesty.

803
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:24,542
I said once I didn't understand

804
01:08:24,629 --> 01:08:28,099
whose task it was
to see to the public welfare.

805
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:31,864
Ma'am, in my lifetime,
I have seen with my own eyes,

806
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:34,099
what happens
when the rabble is empowered.

807
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:35,702
Lord Melbourne.

808
01:08:35,789 --> 01:08:41,068
I want a report on living conditions,
on parish benefits,

809
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:45,745
housing, all of it.
And by the end of the month.

810
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:51,988
And one more thing,... I have invited
Prince Albert for another visit.

811
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:54,060
Very good, Your Majesty.

812
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:59,101
When you get there, don't be a spy
or Uncle Leopold's puppet.

813
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:01,578
It's your life, Albert. Live it.

814
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:03,864
For yourself and for Victoria.

815
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:08,098
Our uncle wouldn't thank you for that.

816
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:10,906
I don't care.

817
01:09:17,549 --> 01:09:21,542
- I should have worn the red.
- You look beautiful, Your Majesty.

818
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:31,381
His Serene Highness Prince Albert of
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Your Majesty.

819
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:24,065
I only just got your note.

820
01:10:25,069 --> 01:10:26,661
I was riding.

821
01:10:29,469 --> 01:10:31,061
Sit. Please.

822
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:44,699
- The park is marvellous.
- I'm so pleased you like it.

823
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:49,145
I do want you to feel quite at home.

824
01:10:52,309 --> 01:10:56,587
I'm sure you're aware
why I wished you to come here.

825
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:00,987
Because it would make me happier
than anything,...

826
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:06,306
.. too happy, really,
if you would agree to what I wish.

827
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:09,426
- And stay with you?
- And stay with me.

828
01:11:09,509 --> 01:11:13,741
- And marry you?
- And marry me. (laughs)

829
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:47,897
Wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife?

830
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:51,264
T o live together
after God's ordinance,

831
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:56,264
- in the holiest state of matrimony?
- I will.

832
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:48,189
Now I am quite married.

833
01:12:51,749 --> 01:12:54,263
- You know when we're old...
- Hmm.

834
01:12:55,589 --> 01:12:57,898
..and surrounded by our children,...

835
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:03,140
..we will remember this
as the day our lives began.

836
01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:06,858
Not too surrounded, please.

837
01:13:12,469 --> 01:13:14,460
And not too soon.

838
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:19,263
Oh? I should warn you that
I am expecting a very large family.

839
01:13:19,349 --> 01:13:21,305
(she giggles)

840
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:29,701
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning.

841
01:13:32,429 --> 01:13:34,420
(Victoria giggles)

842
01:13:38,469 --> 01:13:40,380
(Lehzen) Have you woken Her Majesty?

843
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:43,222
- No, ma'am.
- Don't you think you should?

844
01:13:43,309 --> 01:13:46,301
No, ma'am. Not this morning, I don't.

845
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:56,308
Let's take a little tour
and visit Scotland.

846
01:13:56,389 --> 01:14:00,143
I hear if any part of Britain is like
Germany, it's the Scottish Highlands.

847
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:03,380
- Yes, we must one day.
- No. Straight away. Now.

848
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:06,188
- Now? (laughs)
- Only for a few weeks.

849
01:14:06,269 --> 01:14:09,227
You're a bride.
They can't expect you back before that.

850
01:14:09,309 --> 01:14:12,221
Dearest, I may be a bride
but I'm also a queen.

851
01:14:12,309 --> 01:14:15,699
I cannot be away
for more than three days at the most.

852
01:14:19,469 --> 01:14:21,187
What are you doing?

853
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:24,659
- Well, if we've only got three days...
- (both laugh)

854
01:14:24,749 --> 01:14:26,387
(both laugh)

855
01:14:26,469 --> 01:14:29,779
So tell me, will the weather
be this fine for all of the three days?

856
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:31,666
(laughs) Yes.

857
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:45,984
Albert, where are you going?

858
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:48,458
(she laughs)

859
01:14:52,509 --> 01:14:54,465
(both laugh)

860
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:03,945
- Seriously, is it always like this?
- (laughs) Yes!

861
01:15:07,709 --> 01:15:09,700
(she laughs)

862
01:15:56,509 --> 01:15:59,228
We will take care of each other,
won't we?

863
01:16:00,309 --> 01:16:01,503
Always.

864
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:19,220
(she laughs)

865
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:25,866
- (crowd cheers)
- How changeable they are.

866
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:30,419
They hate you. They love you.
They hate you.

867
01:16:31,389 --> 01:16:34,586
They punished her,...
but they never hated her.

868
01:16:36,109 --> 01:16:41,342
And now she's a bride and back on top.
Until the next mistake.

869
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:46,542
What on earth have I done with my life?

870
01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:51,506
I had many gifts, you know.

871
01:16:51,589 --> 01:16:54,979
As a boy, I was tipped for success.

872
01:16:57,869 --> 01:16:59,746
You have served me well.

873
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:08,303
(sighs) What is that?

874
01:17:14,349 --> 01:17:16,180
(thunder)

875
01:17:16,269 --> 01:17:17,588
(door opens)

876
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:19,182
(door closes)

877
01:17:22,629 --> 01:17:24,540
(she giggles)

878
01:17:27,629 --> 01:17:32,544
(Leopold) Dear Albert, why haven't you
responded to my last two letters?

879
01:17:32,629 --> 01:17:35,587
I must be kept informed
of your progess.

880
01:17:35,669 --> 01:17:37,944
I need help. England's help.

881
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:40,827
And you must and will secure it for me.

882
01:17:40,909 --> 01:17:43,981
Never forget
that you are first a Coburg.

883
01:17:44,069 --> 01:17:45,787
Your Uncle Leopold.

884
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:59,900
- What is it?
- Just a question for Lord M.

885
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:04,702
- Could I help?
- lt'll keep.

886
01:18:18,469 --> 01:18:21,541
Why are these windows so dirty?
I can hardly see out.

887
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:23,506
Same as the fires, I'm afraid.

888
01:18:23,589 --> 01:18:27,628
The departments can't agree to wash
inside and out at the same time.

889
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:30,621
- Why don't we do something about it?
- I quite agree.

890
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:35,829
Because it's how things are done here.
And it's worked well for many years.

891
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:38,628
Meanwhile, we live
in a filthy, freezing house.

892
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:41,621
We live as guests of the Queen.

893
01:18:41,709 --> 01:18:45,748
Thank you, Baroness, for reminding me
that I am a guest here.

894
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:56,785
Let him go.

895
01:18:58,669 --> 01:19:01,229
How is Albert settling in?

896
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:03,300
Why? What have you heard?

897
01:19:08,269 --> 01:19:11,579
He says he wants to reorganise
the way the palaces are run.

898
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:14,229
Well then, for Heaven's sake, let him!

899
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:16,698
He says
that Lord Melbourne controls me,

900
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:19,144
and he says that Lehzen controls me.

901
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:21,459
It seems everyone controls me
except him.

902
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:26,179
A man who has no work
becomes ridiculous.

903
01:19:26,269 --> 01:19:31,059
And a poor man with a rich wife must
work twice as hard as anyone else.

904
01:19:31,149 --> 01:19:35,825
- Besides, you have chosen well.
- My Uncle William chose well.

905
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:39,982
- You did not take on half his duties
- You don't know that.

906
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:42,583
You don't know what I did.

907
01:19:55,109 --> 01:19:58,101
- What is this for?
- Your Royal Highness.

908
01:19:58,189 --> 01:20:02,341
The Red Room dinner service, sir.
For the officers guarding the King.

909
01:20:03,309 --> 01:20:07,985
- What king?
- King George lll, sir.

910
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,946
And how often do we provide

911
01:20:10,029 --> 01:20:13,385
this dinner for a king
who has been dead for 20 years?

912
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:15,901
Every night, sir.

913
01:20:20,269 --> 01:20:23,818
I cannot believe I'm being
subjected to this interrogation.

914
01:20:23,909 --> 01:20:27,458
You're not being subjected
to anything, Sir John.

915
01:20:27,549 --> 01:20:30,905
You have been in charge of the
Duchess's finances for many years.

916
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:34,948
Indeed, you have made public
statements testifying to their health.

917
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:38,618
- Yes, I have.
- I am so grateful.

918
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:42,099
All I am asking is that you
will be so good as to tell us

919
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:45,579
exactly where the money has gone?

920
01:20:52,909 --> 01:20:54,900
Are you sure?

921
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:09,100
(she laughs)

922
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:14,745
- (applause)
- Congratulations, ma'am.

923
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:16,979
Mein liebes Schatzi! I'm so happy.

924
01:21:19,469 --> 01:21:22,779
- Meine Liebling!
- Heavens, Mama, don't crush me.

925
01:21:23,749 --> 01:21:27,344
You'll let me know at once
if there's anything you need.

926
01:21:32,669 --> 01:21:34,660
You're not going already?

927
01:21:35,549 --> 01:21:38,586
I cannot leave too soon for my daughter.

928
01:21:38,669 --> 01:21:42,981
- Anyway, I have a lot on my mind.
- Something I could help with?

929
01:21:47,589 --> 01:21:49,500
Congratulations.

930
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:54,546
Your Highness.

931
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:57,780
There's your opening,
if you'll take my advice.

932
01:21:57,869 --> 01:22:00,064
Lord Melbourne, forgive me, but...

933
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:04,188
you seem to have confused me
with a member of your club.

934
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:08,421
I am not your drinking companion,
nor your whist partner.

935
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:11,467
I am the husband of your sovereign.

936
01:22:11,549 --> 01:22:14,586
And as such,
I will make my own decisions,

937
01:22:14,669 --> 01:22:18,867
and I neither seek
nor invite your advice.

938
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:20,940
Good evening.

939
01:22:24,989 --> 01:22:27,264
- So...
- (Victoria laughs)

940
01:22:27,349 --> 01:22:30,625
- Are you discussing names?
- We're discussing the help.

941
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:34,258
He writes that he'd prefer
not to talk politics in his letters,

942
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:37,147
but only to discuss news of the family.

943
01:22:37,229 --> 01:22:39,459
I have planned this marriage
for 20 years!

944
01:22:39,549 --> 01:22:42,621
And now I'm supposed to accept
that I have failed?!

945
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:46,827
On the contrary, Your Majesty,
we must accept it.

946
01:22:46,909 --> 01:22:48,900
The birds have flown.

947
01:23:19,309 --> 01:23:21,186
Your Majesty.

948
01:23:29,989 --> 01:23:31,980
(piano recital)

949
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:07,384
I've been boring
Sir Robert and the Duke

950
01:24:07,469 --> 01:24:09,858
with my ideas for encouraging the Arts.

951
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:12,702
Hmm. Does Sir Robert
care for such frivolity?

952
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:14,507
I have many interests, ma'am.

953
01:24:14,589 --> 01:24:17,183
And my government
would support the Prince's plans.

954
01:24:17,269 --> 01:24:20,022
Your government?
What government is this?

955
01:24:20,109 --> 01:24:24,899
If I should be fortunate enough
to form another government, ma'am.

956
01:24:24,989 --> 01:24:29,267
And when he does, there'll be
no repeat of the old problem.

957
01:24:29,349 --> 01:24:32,386
Some of your ladies have
already agreed to resign.

958
01:24:32,469 --> 01:24:36,178
And Sir Robert will ask for
no more change than that.

959
01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:41,300
Thank you, Sir Robert.

960
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:53,184
How dare you speak to me in that way
before them.

961
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:58,381
How dare you... talk across me,
as if I were a child.

962
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:02,178
- l... I did no such thing.
- Oh, no?

963
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,942
Well, you've sorted this,
you've sorted that.

964
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:06,667
You and Sir Robert.

965
01:25:06,749 --> 01:25:08,979
You and the Duke.
All without reference to me!

966
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:12,698
- Victoria, I thought you'd be pleased.
- I will tell you what you thought.

967
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:14,859
You thought that I was a woman!

968
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:18,988
To be petted
and passed over and ignored!

969
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:23,540
Would it were so simple then we might
avoid more scandals of your making.

970
01:25:23,629 --> 01:25:26,427
- Have you lost your mind?!
- Do you wonder at it?

971
01:25:26,509 --> 01:25:30,821
Less than three years on the throne
and you and your precious Melbourne

972
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:33,582
have pushed this monarchy
to the brink of an abyss!

973
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:35,819
I've told you before and I will again,

974
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:38,662
you are my husband here,
and that is all!

975
01:25:38,749 --> 01:25:44,107
- And that is quite enough, believe me!
- I will not have my role usurped!

976
01:25:44,189 --> 01:25:45,508
I wear the crown.

977
01:25:45,589 --> 01:25:49,184
Any mistakes will be my mistakes,
and no one else will make them.

978
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,658
No one! Not even you!

979
01:25:56,989 --> 01:26:00,186
I'm leaving before you excite
yourself and harm the child.

980
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:02,658
You will go when I dismiss you.

981
01:26:04,269 --> 01:26:07,705
I am your Queen
and I am telling you to stay.

982
01:26:09,549 --> 01:26:11,665
Goodnight, Victoria.

983
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:15,183
You may not go. You may not go!

984
01:26:15,269 --> 01:26:19,342
I order you to stay here in this room!
Albert!

985
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,700
(Sergeant Major)
Guard, royal salute!

986
01:26:27,789 --> 01:26:29,780
Present arms!

987
01:26:45,229 --> 01:26:47,743
There is no need
for you to accompany me.

988
01:26:47,829 --> 01:26:50,343
I said I would and so I will.

989
01:26:50,429 --> 01:26:52,420
(coachman) Walk on. Hup!

990
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:11,539
For pity's sake smile, woman.
Anyone would think we'd quarrelled.

991
01:27:11,629 --> 01:27:13,028
Don't talk to me.

992
01:27:15,549 --> 01:27:17,540
(gunshot echoes)

993
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:49,301
There's nothing more I can do here.
The Prince needs rest.

994
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:52,060
Your Majesty.

995
01:29:02,269 --> 01:29:04,180
(she sobs)

996
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:06,860
I'm so sorry!

997
01:29:09,389 --> 01:29:12,381
I thought I was going to lose you!

998
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:17,547
- He was not a very good shot.
- Why did you do it?

999
01:29:17,629 --> 01:29:20,621
You're so stupid! Why did you do it?

1000
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:25,298
I had two very good reasons.

1001
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:29,500
First, I am replaceable
and you are not.

1002
01:29:29,589 --> 01:29:33,343
- You are not replaceable to me.
- Shh.

1003
01:29:33,429 --> 01:29:39,425
Second,... you are the only wife
I've got or ever will have.

1004
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:45,388
You are my whole existence. And
I will love you until my last breath.

1005
01:29:58,909 --> 01:30:00,661
(birdsong)

1006
01:30:00,749 --> 01:30:02,740
We're told the man was mad.

1007
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:06,218
Is that reassuring? I can't decide.

1008
01:30:07,709 --> 01:30:09,700
May I be honest, ma'am?

1009
01:30:11,469 --> 01:30:14,541
- Even a politician can be sometimes.
- (she laughs)

1010
01:30:16,349 --> 01:30:21,139
My guidance...
hasn't always been faultless,...

1011
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:24,778
..and I'm sorry for it.

1012
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:30,265
- But I speak now as a true friend.
- I know.

1013
01:30:32,669 --> 01:30:37,663
The Prince is a good man.
A better man than any of us knew.

1014
01:30:39,429 --> 01:30:44,787
I know he does not think as well of me.
My vanity is not the issue here.

1015
01:30:45,549 --> 01:30:47,426
He is able.

1016
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:49,227
He is clever.

1017
01:30:49,989 --> 01:30:51,786
And he's faithful.

1018
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:55,586
Let him share your work.

1019
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:08,378
There is one task more
Your Majesty must face,...

1020
01:31:08,469 --> 01:31:11,267
if the Prince
is to feel truly welcome here.

1021
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:19,627
I needed her so much as a child.

1022
01:31:34,309 --> 01:31:37,585
I hope you don't mind,
I had your desk brought in.

1023
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:44,703
- Don't I have a say in this?
- No! (laughs)

1024
01:32:00,309 --> 01:32:01,867
(she laughs)

1025
01:32:03,349 --> 01:32:05,658
(baby gurgles)

1026
01:32:10,549 --> 01:32:14,064
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning.

1027
01:33:37,469 --> 01:33:39,027
(she laughs)

1028
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:43,227
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.
Her Majesty the Queen.

1029

# ("Only You" by Sinead O'Connor)
