- <i>(man)</i> OK, alright, hold up.

2
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:54,007
Someone has to say something
nice about my friend Herb tonight,

3
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,477
so I'm gonna give it a shot.

4
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:59,924
I have followed Herb Lee
my whole writing career.

5
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:04,365
I followed him through three publishing
houses, and when he started his own.

6
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:09,363
It's embarrassing to need your editor
so badly, so I'm gratified to announce

7
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:13,202
that he has now followed me
to Central Connecticut. Thank you.

8
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:15,643
I didn't follow you,
I had three heart attacks.

9
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:18,367
This was a pre-emptive strike
against decrepitude.

10
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:21,008
- <i>(laughter)</i>
- Well, whatever brought you here

11
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:23,727
to the beautiful
Marigold Retirement Community,

12
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:27,437
I just want to say I'm glad you're here,
right down the road from my place,

13
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:30,759
and as long as Pippa
keeps making that butterflied lamb,

14
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:33,157
I'll do anything.
I'll even caddy for you.

15
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:35,808
That's fine,
as long as I don't have to play golf.

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,846
Wait, one more thing.
I just want to say something else.

17
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:41,761
I have known Pippa Lee for 25 years...

18
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:45,840
<i>...and</i> I think
that I will never really know her.

19
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:49,204
She is a mystery. An enigma.

20
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:54,646
Giving, caring, beautiful, intelligent,

21
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,162
the very icon of an artist's wife.

22
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,126
- What are you talking about?
- No, you are.

23
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,280
And who precisely is this artist
that Pippa is married to?

24
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,359
- <i>(laughter)</i>
- Exactly!

25
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,087
Yes, that's my point!
That's what it's come down to.

26
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:11,160
The one true artist's wife
left in the modern world,

27
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,239
and she ended up with a publisher.

28
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:16,638
To Herb and Pippa
and their weird new condo.

29
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:20,084
Yeah, I just, er, got three new poems.

30
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:24,366
Wonderful. If you'd ever like to show
them to somebody who's non-judgemental,

31
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,757
- I'd be happy to take a look at them.
- Really?

32
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:29,840
I would like that.
That would mean so much to me.

33
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,920
I wish Sam wouldn't keep saying
Daddy moved to be near him.

34
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:36,796
He's a satirist. Anyway, nothing's
going to put a dent in Herb's ego.

35
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:38,879
It's you I'm worried about.

36
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,166
It's time for dessert.

37
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:45,843
But, Herb, what is the real reason
you moved here?

38
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,237
Scaling down, making life more simple.

39
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:51,320
I've liquidated everything
so that when I go,

40
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:54,878
Pippa and the kids can get everything
and not give it to the government.

41
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,277
<i>(Sam)</i> I thought you loved paying taxes.

42
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:00,519
I have to admit, I actually like
this house. It's so easy.

43
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,883
I'm glad you feel that way, sweetie.

44
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,925
Though I can't help wondering
how many people have died here.

45
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:11,286
Your problem is you're too adaptable.
You're the adaptable enigma.

46
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:19,760
<i>(Pippa) To be perfectly honest,</i>
<i>I've had enough of being an enigma.</i>

47
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,959
<i>I wanna be known.</i>

48

<i>at the beginning.</i>

- <i>(woman)</i> Shut up!

51
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,202

52
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>(yells)</i> Oh, fuck you!

53
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,878
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Good girl.

54
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:52,199
<i>My birth was marked</i>
<i>by several unusual occurrences.</i>

55
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:55,678
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>I was covered in fine blonde fur.</i>

56
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,759
<i>(baby cries)</i>

57
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:00,601
- Why is she furry?
- That's nothing to worry about.

58
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:03,760
When a baby's this late,
it has time to grow vestigial hair,

59
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:05,679
from the time that we were monkeys.

60
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:10,720
I had a monkey! I had a monkey!

61
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:13,527
You can expect to have
a beautiful baby girl.

62
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:16,566
The hair is just vestigial,
as I tried to tell your wife.

63
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm sorry if it offends you, Father, but
we believe that millions of years ago,

64
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:23,356
- humans were covered with fur.
- I know that.

65
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,678
So, is it a baby or a pet?

66
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:29,477
<i>Suky knew my condition</i>
<i>had nothing to do with evolution.</i>

67
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:33,720

- I'm OK.

71
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,245
Are you having a hard time
living here in Wrinkleberry?

72
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:55,118
It's strange having so much time on my
hands. This place is easy to maintain,

73
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,847
but there's gonna be charity work
I can find.

74
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:01,159
- You wanna move back to the city?
- We just sold our apartment.

75
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:04,524
- Well, we can get another one.
- Are you serious?

76
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,246
No.

77
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:11,719
I'm just having a hard time
thinking of this as the end of the line.

78
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:20,086
I think it's sort of romantic...
starting all over, just the two of us.

79
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,760
So little stuff.

80
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:24,840
Must you always look at the bright side?

81
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,084
Can I get you anything?

82
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:33,365
- Some carrot juice?
- No, I'm fine.

83
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:41,121
What was that cheese
we had for lunch yesterday?

84
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,406
It was vacherin. I was so excited
to find that at the market.

85
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,479
I love that cheese.

Sweetheart, everybody knows you're
a killer but you gotta be careful.

- I do. Dad, look...

There's no way
that I'm not gonna go back.

If you had seen what I saw,
you would feel the same.

154

He's left her, and he's...

He's living in his car.
I just don't know what to do.

He was always sort of half baked.

No, tell him 45

A little appreciation...

Would you like to go to the doctor's

We gotta change our number.

- I need an office.
- What is the point of having an office?

225
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:52,406
The point is I spent 40 years
building up this company

226
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,764
and they're crapping it up.
They're children there. Babies.

227
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:58,442
If I had an office,
I can be there from ten to one,

228
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:03,204
talk to Marianne, read my manuscripts,
and when I come home, boom, I'm retired.

229
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:05,483

<i>I was free.</i>

440
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:34,121
- Thank God.
- Chocolate?

441
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,039
I thought you'd left me.

442
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:41,126
I can't take it any more.
He's such a prick.

443
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:44,405
Aw.
Sam can have a mean sense of humour.

444
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:47,685
Look, maybe if you laughed along?

445
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:51,158
I have been laughing for four years
and now I'm crying.

446
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:55,799
- I think Sandra's having an affair.
- What makes you think so?

447
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:01,247
Well, she's talking about splitting
with Sam, and...

448
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:04,923
She's terrified of being on her own,
and it just adds up.

449
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,761
Maybe she wants you
to think she's having an affair,

450
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:11,921
so you'll tell me, and I'll tell Sam,
and he starts treating her better.

451
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:14,647
You really think
Sandra's that conniving?

452
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,284
It's what women are like,
a lot of them.

453
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:21,360
- Conniving?
- It's not conniving, it's human nature.

454
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:25,361
It's survival of the fittest.
Need I refresh your memory?

455
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:31,842
- Never mind.
- I don't like this book.

456
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:34,647
- <i>(slams book down)</i>
- I'm going to sleep.

457
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:42,647
<i>(sighs)</i>
I still think she's having an affair.

458
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:48,486
Oh, by the way,
I think I found you an office.

459
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:54,520
- This is perfect.
- Oh, I'm so happy.

460
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,839
It only took two days
to get the furniture.

461
00:33:57,928 --> 00:34:02,080
I just thought it would be great to
have a place away from Marigold Village.

462
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:06,320
What's this for?
In case I get paper cuts?

463
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,764
- Drop a phone on my foot?
- Old people bleed just like young ones.

464
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:14,160
Well, why don't we get an EKG for
the corner, an oxygen tent over there?

465
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:18,799
- OK, I'll leave you to it.
- Thank you for this.

466
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,277
What a sweet woman you are.

467
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:25,877
<i>(tyres screech / crash)</i>

468
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:35,565
- <i>(man)</i> He jumped right out at me.
- <i>(woman)</i> I'm sorry.

469
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:42,202
<i>(man)</i> I don't know what he was thinking.

470
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:51,236
- Is he yours?
- No, no.

471
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:57,402
<i>(dog whines)</i>

472
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,167
<i>(Chris)</i> Shit!

473
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,605
- Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Oh, hi!

474
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:21,156
- That's a beautiful purse.
- Oh, thank you.

475
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:24,923
Oh, God. You look so beautiful.

476
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:28,921
- What are you doing different?
- It's the <i>indolence. (chuckles)</i>

477
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:32,000
I wish I could be peaceful and good
like you.

478
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,999
Good?

479
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:39,117
- What is it?
- I just...

480
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,245
It's over between Sam and me.

481
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:48,483
<i>(sniffs)</i> And it's just all so
completely, completely messed up,

482
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:50,843
and I don't know what to do. I...

483
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:54,763
I'm never gonna have a normal life.

484
00:35:56,968 --> 00:36:00,756
You can be married to anybody,
if that's what you're worried about.

485
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:04,841
- Anybody?
- Marriage is an act of will.

486
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:08,637
I mean, I adore Herb,

487
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:12,277
but our marriage functions
because we will it to.

488
00:36:12,368 --> 00:36:16,805
If you leave love to hold everything
together, you can forget it.

489
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,925
Love comes and goes with the breeze,
minute by minute.

490
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,840
But you make it sound
all so unromantic.

491
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:26,078
Pick any man over 50 in this room.

492
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:28,363
Either one of us
could be married to him.

493
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:31,842
OK. What about that one?

494
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:38,480
He just needs his routines, that's all.
I bet if you anticipate his needs

495
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:41,480
before he knows he has them,
he'll be docile as a lamb.

496
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:45,322
<i>(laughs)</i> And that one?

497
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:49,598
He needs a lot of praise,

498
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:52,839
but if you stick your finger
up his ass while he's coming,

499
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:56,398
he won't give you any trouble at all.
I'm kidding. I was kidding.

500
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,118
<i>(Pippa) I wonder if maybe I'm having</i>
<i>a very quiet nervous breakdown.</i>

501
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,883
- Did you get the boots?
- Yes. I mean, they're on hold.

502
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:10,440
- But I got 'em. I did it.
- Good. Good for you. You deserve them.

503
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,844
Mrs Lee?

504
00:38:12,648 --> 00:38:16,084
- I want some cigarettes.
- What kind?

505
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,207
- The white ones.
- Marlboro Lights?

506
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:35,206
- Pippa.
- <i>(gasps)</i>

507
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:38,598
<i>(sobs)</i> Oh, my God.

<i>(pants)</i>

510
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:44,919
It's OK.

511
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:49,001
Would you like me to drive you home?

512
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:02,119
<i>(car door opens)</i>

513
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,086
Maybe you shouldn't tell anyone
about this.

514
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:08,444
- I'll try not to.
- You'll try not to?

515
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:13,401
It might slip out one day.

516
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:16,161
<i>(laughs)</i> What?

517
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:25,277
I think I just figured out
what's so odd about you.

518
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:31,397
You can't lie, can you?

519
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:41,488
OK. Well, thank you.

520
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:18,639
<i>(sobs)</i>

521
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,402
What's up?

522
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:25,442
Pippa, for Christ's sakes,
I'm not dead yet.

523
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:29,839
<i>(Pippa)</i> I'm sorry.

524
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:39,157
<i>(Pippa)</i>
<i>Aunt Trish's apartment was a haven</i>

So, chicklet... Boom, boom!

00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:10,483
- What's your favourite subject?
- I don't really have one.

00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:14,163
- Well, what do you like?
- Nothing in particular.

533
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:17,877
- You must be good at something.
- No.

534
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:21,483
- Well, I think you're special.
- Special how?

535
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:24,128
Special like I can't believe
you landed in my lap.

536
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,803
- <i>(knock at door)</i>
- Almost makes me believe in destiny.

- Hey.
- Hey. This is my friend, Shelly.

538
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:35,922
- Wow.
- Shelly, this is Pippa.

539
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:39,159
- You were right. She's perfect.
- Hm-hmm.

540
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:42,957
Let's get this show on the road.
Whoo-hoo!

541
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:45,437
<i>(Pippa)</i> So, what do I do?

542
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:48,520
When I was in the film business,
we never asked questions.

543
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:50,644
We just showed up
and let shit happen.

544
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:54,880
Look at the camera like it's someone you
know and don't like. That's the secret.

545
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:57,528
Yeah, like that. That's Kitty.

546
00:41:57,608 --> 00:42:00,680
- Who's Kitty?
- The girl in the novel she's writing.

547
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:06,161
- That's what the pictures are for.
- Kitty is every woman's wild side.

548
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:09,126
She's fearless.
Don't you wish you were fearless?

549
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:12,006
- I guess so.
- Yeah, if you were,

550
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:16,718
you wouldn't cry every time you hung up
the phone after talking to your mommy.

551
00:42:16,808 --> 00:42:21,165
- You'd forget the past.
- Is that what you do?

552
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:25,161
I'm the girl from Pluto.
I'm a scary thing.

- Can we get doughnuts?
- <i>(Kat)</i> Later!

OK, this is the scene where
Mrs Washington comes home

- and finds you in her playpen.
- Who's Mrs Washington?

556

decide to play with her kids' toys.

00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:44,682
OK. So, listen.
You have to be really upset,

559
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:46,918
so I need you
to think of something sad.

560

- I'm just not really feeling anything.
- No?

<i>(Kat)</i> OK. Let's go.

Come on, let's go. Come on, Shell.

563
00:42:59,448 --> 00:43:03,043
Is she gonna hurt you?
No, don't let her take the baby!

564

That's right, that's your baby.
Good. Yeah. That is perfect.

565
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:09,363
Yeah, now the spanking, alright?

566
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:12,042
- What?
- It's just... It's pretend.

567

- Is this good?
- <i>(Kat)</i> Go.

568
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:17,160
- Ow!
- <i>(Kat)</i> Christ!

569
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,443
- Sorry!
- No, I said pretend!

Sorry.

You alright?

00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:40,998
Yeah, that's right. OK.

Pippa, leash.
Pippa, leash, that's right.

Go on, little puppy dog. That's great.

579

<i>That's not quite true, though.</i>

00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:30,487
I'm sorry.
It took me ages to fall asleep.

587
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:34,123
OK, I'm off.

588
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:38,201
See you at lunch. Oh, is there anything
else you want from the market

589
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:40,677
- other than the apricot spread?
- No.

590
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:43,403
What?

591
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:46,798
Since we moved to the old folks' home,
you look younger and younger.

592
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:49,277
That's cos I'm not setting my hair.

593
00:44:49,368 --> 00:44:51,040
OK.

594

<i>(gasps)</i>

595
00:45:09,688 --> 00:45:15,479
Chris? I'm sorry. It's Pippa Lee.
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

596
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:18,640
I forgot I'd left my car
at the convenience store.

597
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:22,922
I'll just wait out here. OK.

598
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:33,438
<i>(Pippa)</i> Your mother told me
you're going through a hard time.

599
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:37,407
You could say that.
Fired from my job at the men's shelter,

600
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:41,163
I come home to find my wife
sitting on top of my best friend.

601
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:43,682
Wow. That's bad.

602
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:47,647
Yeah, well, there's probably
a good reason for it all.

603
00:45:48,968 --> 00:45:53,166
- What?
- I'm an asshole.

604
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:54,886
You are?

605
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,482
I don't know why,
I just always have been.

606
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:04,922
That tattoo you have
must have hurt terribly.

607
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:09,126
I tried to join a Jesuit seminary once
when I was 17.

608
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:12,757
- You were gonna be a priest?
- Yeah.

609
00:46:14,048 --> 00:46:16,437
But they rejected my application.

610
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:25,923
- Do you still have a vocation?
- Just the tattoo.

611
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:29,757
What made you lose your faith?

612
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:37,368
I stopped believing God was a mystery
you could nail down with one book,

613
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:40,838
but by that time, my parents
had written me off as a fuck-up,

614
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,998
I was married to a Jesus freak,

615
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:47,366
and I was just as pissed off at
the world as when I was a Christian,

616
00:46:47,448 --> 00:46:51,646
which brings us more or less
up to date, give or take a decade.

617
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:56,318
What are you thinking?

618
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:03,084
- I was thinking that you seem like...
- What?

619
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:07,605
Just that you seem so bright. It's a
pity you never settled on any real work.

620
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:10,327
It would make your life
so much easier.

621
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:15,283
- OK. Well, thank you.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

622
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:18,997
I suggest you go back to that little
life you've puffed up for yourself.

623
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:22,922
I'm sure you're very happy
underneath all that anxiety.

624
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:28,800
You're right, you know.
You <i>are</i> an asshole.

Who is she, anyway?

She is an heiress, collector,

She knows Andy.

- <i>(Gigi)</i> Hi, everybody.
- <i>(Pippa)</i> Hi.

00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:42,677
<i>(Gigi)</i>
This is Sam Shapiro, the novelist.

and forth in time. It's liquid.

646
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:51,967
Let the sequences accumulate.
They're too staccato.

647
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:54,164
I'm <i>looking</i> for that staccato feeling.

<i>(Pippa)</i> That's fantastic.

What's going on?

661
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:29,798
Pippa. Pippa Sarkissian.
Come here. Come.

662
00:50:31,848 --> 00:50:34,487
Sit. Talk to us.

663
00:50:36,488 --> 00:50:41,881
So, Pippa, what does a free spirit
like you have for breakfast usually?

664
00:50:41,968 --> 00:50:45,324
- Does she look like she eats breakfast?
- Do you?

665
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:49,282
- No.
- That's your first mistake of the day.

666
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:52,087
So, first thing in the morning,
you go to the studio?

667
00:50:52,168 --> 00:50:53,965
I don't have a studio.

668
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:56,323
You gotta be an artist
dressed like that.

669
00:50:56,408 --> 00:50:59,764
- <i>(Herb)</i> Well, what do you do?
- I work in a clothing store.

670
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,804
You have no ambition?

671
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:07,562
No one has ever walked through that
door before without having an ambition.

672
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,684
The butler is writing a short story.

673
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:12,805
- He told me so himself yesterday.
- I'm gonna get a drink.

674
00:51:12,888 --> 00:51:14,879
- You want a drink, Pippa?
- Uh-uh.

675
00:51:14,968 --> 00:51:19,200
- Get me another one of these.
- I will. I'll be back.

676
00:51:22,648 --> 00:51:26,004
This is the most amazing house
I've ever seen.

677
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:28,363
It's not a house, it's a mausoleum.

678
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:32,680
There isn't one comfortable
piece of furniture except this couch.

679
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:36,078
- It's like living in an aquarium.
- Then why do you live here?

680
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:40,923
My wife. I could never afford a place
like this, although I'm not poor.

681
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:46,486
So, Pippa, when are you going to start
doing something about your life?

682
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:48,160
What do you mean?

683
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:50,716
Doesn't it get dispiriting
being so aimless?

684
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:54,005
I mean, the times,
they are a-changing notwithstanding.

685
00:51:57,888 --> 00:51:59,367
What?

686
00:52:00,768 --> 00:52:03,646
You have such a sweetness about you.

687
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:08,400
No, I'm not sweet.

688
00:52:08,488 --> 00:52:12,447
Well, you can be experienced
and have a sweetness about you.

689
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:15,964
It's an innate thing with you, it seems.

690
00:52:18,808 --> 00:52:23,438
I haven't seen that quality in a person
in a long time.

691
00:52:23,528 --> 00:52:25,962
<i>(Gigi)</i> We're all going swimming!

692
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:29,287
Oh, God.

693
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:32,804
<i>(Pippa) I didn't realise it yet,</i>
<i>but I had set my sights on Herb,</i>

694
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:34,879
<i>and once that happened, watch out.</i>

695
00:52:34,968 --> 00:52:38,563
She's making me nostalgic
for his first wife,

696
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:41,037
and trust me, that's saying something.

697
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:45,679
You're interesting, Pippa.
I've been observing you.

698
00:52:45,768 --> 00:52:50,637
- You have?
- You're like an ingénue femme fatale.

699
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:56,121
- OK, and what are you like?
- Writers are vampires.

700
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:59,678
I'm waiting for the right girl to come
along and make me a human being.

701
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:04,240
You realise that if I leaned in
right now and kissed you,

702
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:07,479
I'd be the third guy tonight.
Am I right?

703
00:53:09,048 --> 00:53:11,403

Erm, see, it's a psychiatrist.

719
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:19,877
That's because he thinks I'm gonna need
medication, and a locksmith.

720
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:22,960
He suggested that we bolt

and Herb hide the key, and erm...

00:55:20,768 --> 00:55:22,759
No.

735
00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:31,079
That's my daughter, Grace. She hates me.

736
00:55:33,448 --> 00:55:35,245
I wonder...

737
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:39,679
- What?
- If I got it all wrong with her.

738
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:44,120
I just didn't want to suffocate her
the way my...

739
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:50,845
I think it happens like that in families
sometimes, though.

740
00:55:50,928 --> 00:55:54,716
You just keep swinging back and forth
from generation to generation,

741
00:55:54,808 --> 00:55:58,198
getting it wrong, the opposite way.

742
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,877
It was so simple with Ben.

743
00:56:06,808 --> 00:56:11,324
But you know, she, erm,
is a photographic journalist.

744
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:15,447
Travels all over the world, wherever
it's exploding, takes photographs.

745
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:17,200
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

746
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:19,438
We must have done something right.

747
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:24,198
Sounds like your daughter's like you.

748
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:29,917
- Why?
- You said you were always in a drama.

749
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:35,361
Well, I was reckless with my life,
that's true.

750
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,324
I never saw her again.

751
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:52,243
- Who?
- My mother.

752
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:55,718
After I ran away, she died.
She had a heart attack.

753
00:56:58,288 --> 00:57:00,483
<i>(Suky)</i> Oh, I can't wait to see.

754
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:04,679
<i>(Pippa) If I could have anything,</i>

755
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:07,680
<i>I would ask for one more afternoon</i>
<i>with my mother.</i>

756
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:10,043
Look at her eyes.

757
00:57:10,128 --> 00:57:12,278
<i>(Pippa) I would be kind.</i>

758
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:14,359
Beautiful.

759
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,883
I've been going to Dot's pottery class.

760
00:57:23,968 --> 00:57:28,007
- Oh, good.
- Why do you think it's good?

761
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:30,807
The doctor said
he thought you could use a hobby.

762
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,805
- Tell me what you like about me.
- Right now?

763
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:42,879
Yeah.

764
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,120
- You put up with me, for one thing.
- That's it?

765
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,403
Of course not.

766
00:57:51,808 --> 00:57:57,201
Herb, what happened to us? We used to
laugh so much. What happened?

767
00:57:57,288 --> 00:58:00,598
- Can't laugh all the time.
- Well, we have to laugh.

768
00:58:00,688 --> 00:58:02,804
- Or what?
- Or she died for nothing.

769
00:58:02,888 --> 00:58:05,846
- Not that again, OK?
- Why am I not allowed to mention her?

770
00:58:05,928 --> 00:58:09,841
I will not let this marriage turn into
a guilt fest. We have been through this.

771
00:58:09,928 --> 00:58:12,965
She was crazy. You get involved
with somebody like that,

772
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:16,563
it's like putting your hand
in a blender. Your fingers get bloody.

773
00:58:16,648 --> 00:58:19,401
I just can't take it, I can't take it.
I keep seeing her.

774
00:58:19,488 --> 00:58:21,877
I keep seeing her. I keep...

775
00:58:23,248 --> 00:58:27,036
<i>(sighs)</i> I keep seeing the past.
The past just keeps caving in.

776
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:32,167
I can't take it any more.
I can't take <i>it. (sobs)</i> I'm sorry.

777
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,921
Maybe you should be taking
antidepressants.

778
00:58:41,168 --> 00:58:43,523
<i>(slams table)</i>

779
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:46,081
What?

780
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:56,166
You alright? You want to talk?

781
00:58:56,248 --> 00:58:59,126
My mother used to do this.
She'd suddenly disappear,

782
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,723
and I'd find her on the bed in front of
the TV with toast on her belly.

783
00:59:02,808 --> 00:59:05,447
- That's how she died.
- Yes, I know.

784
00:59:06,848 --> 00:59:09,726
- I have to take your blood pressure.
- No, you don't.

785
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:28,683
<i>(Pippa) I slept for a week</i>
<i>after the party at Herb's beach house.</i>

786
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,521
<i>Maybe I was trying to avoid</i>

787
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:40,443

- <i>Pippa!</i>

792
01:00:30,288 --> 01:00:34,804
Hey. I-I was wondering,
do you want to go out to breakfast?

793
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:40,485
- <i>It's three o'clock in the afternoon.</i>
- I meant tomorrow.

794
01:00:42,728 --> 01:00:46,641
<i>(Pippa) He treated me like a pal</i>
<i>at first. He was avuncular.</i>

795
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:50,687
<i>He teased me about being a waster.</i>
<i>I called him an old fart.</i>

796
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:54,920
<i>We would get together every couple of</i>
<i>days and take a walk or eat something.</i>

797
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:58,921
<i>He gave me reading lists.</i>
<i>He wanted to educate me.</i>

798
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:03,445
- <i>(Pippa)</i> Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- <i>(Herb)</i> You're always late.

799
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:06,088
Well, maybe you're always early.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

800
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:11,599
<i>(Herb)</i> I bought something for you.
Now, you only have to wear this once.

801
01:01:11,688 --> 01:01:14,043
I'll be alone at the beach house
this weekend,

802
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:17,325
- and I want you to come for lunch.
- <i>(Pippa gasps)</i>

803
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:20,320
- You weren't supposed to buy this.
- I needed to.

804
01:01:20,408 --> 01:01:25,163
<i>(Pippa) I loved being with Herb.</i>
<i>He made me feel protected.</i>

805
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,079
<i>(Herb) I thought I was a writer.</i>

806
01:01:27,168 --> 01:01:31,207
I thought it was my calling,
but it just wasn't. I, er...

807
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:34,120
I-I couldn't flow.

808
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:38,679
I have a very critical nature,
and it kept me from being able to flow.

809
01:01:38,768 --> 01:01:44,001
Then I... was slightly lost for a while.
I had no idea what I was gonna do,

810
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:48,206
and I had a friend in the publishing
business, and he offered me a job.

811
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,518
- And here I am.
- Hmm.

812
01:01:55,648 --> 01:01:57,798
Tell me what you like about me.

813
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:04,200
Well, you're not a show-off about it,
but I think you're very intelligent,

814
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:08,486
and... you're beautiful,
but you're cool about it,

815
01:02:08,568 --> 01:02:11,526
and there's a sadness about you,

816
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:15,999
and I like that, in moderation.

817
01:02:17,328 --> 01:02:21,844
- I like your jacket.
- And that's it?

818
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:25,083
<i>(laughs)</i> No.

No, I...

820

I like your face and your voice...

821
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:37,158
<i>...and,</i> erm...

822
01:02:37,248 --> 01:02:40,240
- This is gonna sound strange.
- Say it.

823
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,959
It's like, erm...

824
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:48,320
Like I can feel what you're feeling.

825
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:53,004
You know, if you feel nervous
or happy or sad, I can feel it.

826
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:57,007
I-In my body, in my fingers.

827
01:02:58,288 --> 01:03:02,042
- What a remarkable thing.
- Oh.

828
01:03:02,128 --> 01:03:05,484
I'd like you not to feel as if you have
to censor yourself around me.

829
01:03:05,568 --> 01:03:09,766
Tell me something about yourself. Tell
me the most important thing about you.

I'm a fuck-up.

<i>(Pippa) I felt like I was being</i>
<i>rescued from a burning wreck.</i>

If I'm good for anything in the world,

833
01:03:28,688 --> 01:03:31,566
it's for letting you know
how wonderful you are.

834
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,083
You're my true wife, you know?

835
01:03:38,288 --> 01:03:42,406
No, you don't want me.
I only make people sad.

836
01:03:42,488 --> 01:03:44,558
I don't believe that.

837

for another week, I'll hang myself.

839
01:03:57,088 --> 01:04:00,364
For years, I've hoped she'd have
an affair so I can walk out on her,

<i>(young Pippa)</i> I don't understand.

She agrees to divorce

846

- Sam! What a pleasant surprise.

853
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:04,558
<i>(Gigi)</i>
I told Ursa to bring in the champagne.

854
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:07,242
- Perfect symmetry.
- What?

855
01:05:07,328 --> 01:05:12,118
- Come on.

858

<i>I wanted Gigi's life at that moment.</i>

859
01:05:30,368 --> 01:05:32,359
<i>It wasn't the money, exactly.</i>

860
01:05:32,448 --> 01:05:35,360
<i>It was just that the money</i>
<i>made everything seem alright.</i>

861
01:05:35,448 --> 01:05:39,680
<i>It was the opposite of chaos,</i>
<i>of everything I had known up until then.</i>

862
01:05:39,768 --> 01:05:41,759
<i>I wanted to be sheltered at last.</i>

863
01:05:44,848 --> 01:05:48,158
- Madam.
- Lunch is served.

864
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:49,317
Oh, my.

865

Herb.

<i>(Gigi)</i> This lunch is in honour

You know how we all eat chops
and hamburgers,

869
01:06:04,568 --> 01:06:07,685
and we don't think of the faces
of who gets killed?

- Anybody here a vegetarian?
- <i>(Gigi)</i> Here's the truth as I see it.

871
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:17,722
- A pig for a cow. A fair exchange.
- <i>(Sam)</i> And who's who?

872
01:06:18,568 --> 01:06:21,321
- Sorry.
- OK, let's have lunch. Who wants pig?

873
01:06:21,408 --> 01:06:23,842
- First, a toast.
- <i>(Sam)</i> Aw, jeez!

874
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:26,799
<i>(Gigi)</i> To transformation.

875
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:41,727
Put the gun down.

876
01:06:43,448 --> 01:06:45,439
Put it down.

877
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,164
Put it down, Gigi.

878
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:53,007
Isn't it funny how men
always marry women

879

01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:27,923
I'm so mean to you, all the time,
and I hate it.

1027
01:19:28,008 --> 01:19:30,442
- Aw.
- And I don't want to be.

1028
01:19:30,528 --> 01:19:34,919
I really, really, really <i>don't. (sobs)</i>

1029
01:19:38,568 --> 01:19:42,163
Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

1030
01:19:42,248 --> 01:19:44,716
There's so many things
you don't know about me.

1031
01:19:44,808 --> 01:19:46,799
No, not yet.

1032
01:19:51,448 --> 01:19:54,679
I want to be your friend,

1033
01:19:54,768 --> 01:19:57,077
because...

1034
01:19:57,168 --> 01:20:00,683
Because... we still have time.

1035
01:20:03,328 --> 01:20:07,526
- I'd be honoured to be your friend.
- No, not honoured.

1036
01:20:07,608 --> 01:20:13,399
- Just happy.
- OK, happy.

1037
01:20:13,488 --> 01:20:16,161
Mom.

1038
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:29,962
<i>(car approaches)</i>

1039
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,717
I saw your light on.
I wanted to see if you needed anything.

1040
01:20:42,808 --> 01:20:45,038
My mom told me what happened.

1041
01:20:45,128 --> 01:20:48,404
Oh. My son is at the hospital,

1042
01:20:48,488 --> 01:20:50,843
and I'm supposed to be resting,
but I can't.

1043
01:20:53,088 --> 01:20:57,479
I could drive you around a little bit.
Do they have your cell?

1044
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:02,365
- Don't you have work?
- I'm off till five.

1045
01:21:04,448 --> 01:21:06,484
I could write Grace a note.

1046
01:21:09,928 --> 01:21:11,520
OK.

1047
01:21:24,368 --> 01:21:26,120
<i>(Chris)</i> I'm leaving soon.

1048

<i>(Pippa)</i> And where will you go?

1049
01:21:30,248 --> 01:21:32,204
Back out west, I guess.

1050
01:21:39,488 --> 01:21:42,002
What do you pray for when you pray?

1051
01:21:43,248 --> 01:21:45,443
For my kids to be happy, I guess.

1052
01:21:46,848 --> 01:21:49,043
And to be good.

1053
01:21:49,768 --> 01:21:52,521
It sounds so childish,
saying it out loud.

1054
01:21:53,848 --> 01:21:58,876
- Do you want to pray for your husband?
- It's hopeless.

1055
01:22:01,368 --> 01:22:06,044
- His brain is dead.
- Not for his brain.

1056
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:08,119
For his soul.

1057
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:11,642
- I don't know how to do that.
- Me, neither.

1058
01:22:12,488 --> 01:22:14,285
Let's try.

that I've left you like this so long,

1068
01:25:17,848 --> 01:25:20,078

<i>I'm going to stay with Ben</i>
<i>and his girlfriend in town.</i>

1076
01:26:53,328 --> 01:26:55,523
I'm gonna find a place near them,

1077
01:26:55,608 --> 01:26:58,998
and I'm gonna wait
to become a grandmother.

1080
01:27:57,688 --> 01:27:59,679

<i>(both chatter)</i>

1082
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:11,763
- Hi, Momma.
- I'm going on a trip.

1083
01:28:11,848 --> 01:28:13,759
- A trip?
- Yes.

1084
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:18,126
And I was wondering if you could
call these movers right here,

1085
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:19,721
and take whatever you want,

1086
01:28:19,808 --> 01:28:23,278
and then tell them to give the rest
to goodwill. That would be great.

1087
01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:25,165
What about the memorial service?

1088
01:28:25,248 --> 01:28:28,320
Right, just call everybody on here
except for Sandra,

1089
01:28:28,408 --> 01:28:30,968
and just call me on my cell
and give me the date.

1090
01:28:31,048 --> 01:28:33,608
And you know what?
What the hell. Invite Sandra.

1091
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:36,202
Mom, are you actually leaving?

1092
01:28:36,288 --> 01:28:38,927
- I'll be back.
- When?

1093
01:28:39,008 --> 01:28:42,444
Your father was in love with a woman
I cooked for two days a week

1094
01:28:42,528 --> 01:28:48,239
over the past four years. I am not going
to organise his memorial service.

1095
01:28:51,248 --> 01:28:53,557
- Who is that guy?
- He's my friend.

1096
01:28:53,648 --> 01:28:58,927
- A friend? What's going on?
- I'm not driving off into the sunset.

1097
01:28:59,008 --> 01:29:02,717
- I'm just seeing what happens next.
- I can't believe this is happening.

1098
01:29:02,808 --> 01:29:07,643
She's given us half her life.
Don't you think she deserves a vacation?
