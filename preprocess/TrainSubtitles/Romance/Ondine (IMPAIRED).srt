No, but it means something.

Yeah. A song in a language

tonight ♫

♫ we swim 
without a word between us ♫

01:39:18,947 --> 01:39:24,418
♫ they wilt 
against the windowpane ♫

1496
01:39:24,419 --> 01:39:29,323
♫ the morning sees you off
 with nets to scatter ♫ 

1497
01:39:29,324 --> 01:39:35,263
♫ you will come in
with the tide again ♫
