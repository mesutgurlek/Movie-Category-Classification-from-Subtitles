1
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,714
You must remember, young thespians,
learning is never seasonal.

2
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:59,816
So, do allow the shimmering lights
of summer to refresh and illuminate

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,555
- your fertile young minds.
- What's she talking about?

4
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,655
The future greets you
with its magic mirror,

5
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:13,229
reflecting each golden moment,
each emboldened choice.

6
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,935
Dude, Miss Darbus
has snapped her cap.

7
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,273
Dude, you're actually listening?

8
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,312
Yes, Jason.

9
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,383
So, what was your favorite
summer memory, Miss Darbus?

10
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,578
(All groaning)

11
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:30,317
Summers have passed fleetingly
since I was your age,

12
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,724
but I remember each
with poignant clarity.

13
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,296
Summer. Summer.

14
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:39,795
Summer.

15
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,663
BOTH: Summer.

16
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:43,832
- Summer.
- Summer.

17
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,497
- Summer.
- Summer.

18
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,734
- ALL: Summer. Summer.
- Ashland Shakespeare Festival of...

19
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:51,439
- Summer. Summer. Summer.
...'88 leaps fondly to mind.

20
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:55,651
(School bell ringing)

21
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,125
(ALL SINGING) What time is it?
Summertime.

22
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:06,286
Hey
it's our vacation.

23
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:08,831
What time is it?
Party time.

24
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,490
That's right
Say it loud.

25
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,660
What time is it?
The time of our lives.

26
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,465
Anticipation.

27
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,768
What time is it?
Summertime.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,831
School's out
Scream and shout.

29
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,876
Finally summer's here.

30
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:22,946
Good to be chilling out

31
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:25,005
I'm off the clock
The pressure's off.

32
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:27,209
Now my girl's what it's all about.

33
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:28,945
Ready for some sunshine.

34
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,147
- For my heart to take a chance.
- Oh, yeah

35
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:33,122
I'm here to stay, not moving away.

36
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:35,489
Ready for a summer romance.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Everybody's ready, going crazy
Yeah, we're out.

38
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:43,526
Come on and let me hear you
say it now, right now.

39
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,536
What time is it?
Summertime.

40
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,697
Hey
it's our vacation.

41
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:50,332
What time is it?
Party time.

42
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:51,706
That's right
Say it loud.

43
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,336
What time is it?
The time of our lives.

44
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:55,903
Anticipation.

45
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,414
What time is it?
Summertime.

46
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,179
School's out
Scream and shout.

47
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,380
Goodbye to rules
No summer school

48
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,048
I'm free to shop till I drop.

49
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:06,217
It's an education vacation.

50
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,193
And the party never has to stop.

51
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,422
We've got things to do
We'll see you soon.

52
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,054
And we're really gonna miss you all.

53
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:13,429
Goodbye to you and you.

54
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,591
And you and you.

55
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,863
Bye-bye until next fall.

56
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:20,465
Everybody ready, going crazy
yeah, we're out.

57
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,909
Come on and let me hear you
say it now, right now.

58
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,106
What time is it?
Summertime.

59

Hey
it's our vacation.

60
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,574
What time is it?
Party time.

61
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:33,142
That's right
Say it loud.

62
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,587
What time is it?
The time of our lives.

63
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:37,386
Anticipation.

64
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,723
What time is it?
Summertime.

65
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:42,263
School's out
Scream and shout.

66
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:45,596
No more waking up at 6:00 A.M.

67
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,330
'Cause now our time is all our own.

68
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,969
Enough already, we're waiting
Come on, let's go.

69
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,809
Go out of control.

70
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,241
All right.

71
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,150
Everybody.

72
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,153
Yeah.

73
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:14,989
Come on.

74
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,035
School pride, let's show it
We're champions and we know it.

75
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:21,263
Wildcats, yeah, are the best, yeah.

76
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,033
Red, white and gold.

77
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,801
When it's time to win, we do it.

78
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,810
We're number one, we proved it.

79
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:29,108
Let's live it up, yeah, party down.

80
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:33,345
That's what this summer's all about.

81
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,509
What time is it?

82
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,383
Summertime is finally here
Yeah.

83
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:38,615
Let's celebrate.

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,682
We wanna hear you
loud and clear now.

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,886
School's out.

86
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:45,691
We can sleep as late as we want to.

87
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,925
It's our time.

88
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,934
Now we can do
whatever we wanna do.

89
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,196
What time is it?

90
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,000
It's summertime.

91
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:55,370
We'll be loving it.

92
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,171
Come on and say it again now.

93
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:59,438
What time is it?

94
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:02,344
It's party time
Party time.

95
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,874
Let's go and have the time of our lives.

96
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,580
Let's go.

97
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:11,112
Yeah

98
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,758
(school bell ringing)

99
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,462
Yeah!

100
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:24,433
No, but seriously, guys,
this summer I gotta make bank.

101
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,973
My parents keep talking about
how much college is gonna cost.

102
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,702
Yeah, my folks are gonna match
whatever I make,

103
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:29,902
but I gotta get hired first.

104
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:32,310
Me, too. I'm saving up for a car,

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,111
so I can take that little hottie
on a proper date.

106
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,418
Gabriella.

107
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:43,889
I understand you've moved
every summer for the past five years,

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,893
and I'd hate to think today is goodbye.

109
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:51,956
No worries. My mom promised
I'm here until graduation next year.

110
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:54,469
Bless Mom's little heart.

111
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:58,302
Sharpay, we got off to a rough start,
but you really came through.

112
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,898
I mean, you helped me
with the winter musical.

113
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,170
I did?

114
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,478
Those vocal exercises?

115
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,309
(Trilling)

116
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:06,439
(Ex claims)

117
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:08,579
See you.

118
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,311
Gabriella and I have
had, like, five job interviews,

119
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,322
but we keep getting beat out
by college kids.

120
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:16,757
Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back
in the babysitting business.

121
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,124
Hey, Martha. Hey, Taylor.

122
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,527
Hey, Kelsi, what are you planning
to do this summer?

123
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,599
Grow, write music. Grow.

124
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,401
Your summer activities consultant
has arrived.

125
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:37,004
Hopefully some of those activities
will include a job.

126
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:41,178
Hey, whatever happens, as long
as we're together, it's cool, right?

127
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,853
You promise?

128
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,088
Here's my promise.

129
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:02,698
- "T" as in Troy?
- Well, I... Yeah.

130
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:10,677
Hey, man, how's it going?
There you go, boss.

131
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,613
Hoops. Let's go.

132
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:18,214
Yeah, sure, sure.
We're not busy or anything. Let's go.

133
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:22,256
Troy: We could go to the movies,
download music.

134
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:24,730
Oh, I'm definitely teaching you
a twisted-flip on the skateboard.

135
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh, and I have first-aid training,
so I can patch myself up afterwards.

136
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,100
All right!

137
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:34,136
"Going to movies, listening to music.

138
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,608
"And, golly, Troy,
I have first-aid training."

139
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,769
(Mimicking giggling)

140
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,107
Oh, please.

141
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:42,449
Oh. Come here, Kelsi.
I have a summer job for you.

142
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,745
At our country club.

143
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,549
Our rehearsal pianist
is evidently moving.

144
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:47,782
Or hiding.

145
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,824
- Pardon?
- Sounds great.

146
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,727
Cheer up, Shar, it's summer.

147
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:55,286
We can do whatever we want to.
Everything changes.

148
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,799
Ryan, who's the absolute primo boy
at East High?

149
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:02,167
I'd say Troy Bolton has that category
pretty much locked up, don't you think?

150
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,399
And East High's primo girl?

151
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:10,939
- Just answer the question!
- Gosh, you?

152
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:18,548
Troy, Sharpay.
Sharpay, Troy. Sharpay...

153
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,021
Shar.

154
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,684
- It just makes sense.
- Evidently not to Troy.

155
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:27,527
But it's summer, Ry.
Everything changes.

156
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,544
(ALL SINGING) What time is it?
Summertime.

157
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,849
Hey
it's our vacation.

158
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,483
What time is it?
Party time.

159
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,856
That's right
Say it loud.

160
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,225
What time is it?
The time of our lives.

161
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:57,990
Anticipation.

162
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,430
What time is it?
Summertime.

163
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,001
School's out
Scream and shout.

164
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:16,706
Troy: Nice workout, fellas.

165
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:17,910
- I'm starving.
- Me, too.

166
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,213
I'll tell you what. I'm seeing moves
I didn't see last season.

167
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,754
- Keep it coming, guys!
- Yeah. What team?

168
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:22,948
ALL: Wildcats!

169
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:24,081
All right!

170
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,953
Yo, time for milk.

171
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,360
- So, guys, how's the job hunt coming?
- The big zero.

172
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:31,429
(Cell phone ringing)

173
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,058
- Uh-oh. Girlfriend alert.
- Talk to me.

174
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,035
This is Thomas Fulton,
General Manager

175
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,197
of Lava Springs Country Club
here in Albuquerque.

176
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,764
I understand you've been looking
for summer work.

177
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,038
Hey, Troy, does Gabriella
still remember your name,

178
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:46,309
or did she find somebody new
to karaoke with this summer?

179
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:49,441
That sounds fantastic, Mr. Fulton.
But how did you get my name?

180
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,782
Well, we've always had
a student summer work program

181
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:55,153
here at Lava Springs.
So, are you ready?

182
00:09:55,658 --> 00:10:00,687
Here's the thing. I know the most
amazing girl... I mean, student.

183
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,856
Straight A's, quintuple straight A's,

184
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:06,129
and it would be
so amazingly perfect if...

185
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:07,534
Man, he's really working someone.

186
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:10,801
It can't be Gabriella.
Whenever she calls, he just blushes.

187
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,034
Yeah, I never said that.

188
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:13,268
Yes!

189
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:19,007
- What's up, dog?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing!

190
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,551
Okay. I'll tell you what,
you guys stick together this summer,

191
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,383
you work on the game,
and we are talking back-to-back

192
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,854
- championships next fall.
- Yeah!

193
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,288
(All whooping)

194
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

195
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:32,688
Can we all redirect this energy
by carrying in the groceries?

196
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,128
- Yes, Mrs. Bolton.
- Yes, Mrs. Bolton.

197
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,067
MAN ON RADIO: Hey,
we're kicking off another hot summer

198
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,295
here in Albuquerque.

199
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,702
So, for those cool enough
to have a convertible,

200
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,536
crank up the sound,
breathe that fresh air,

201
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,907
and say hello to summer!

202
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,335
Miss Evans, Mr. Evans,
looking very sharp this summer.

203
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,838
Welcome back to Lava Springs.

204
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,602
Thank you, Charles.

205
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,241
Hi, boy!

206
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,673
Oh, can you find
some shade for my car?

207
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:24,582
- Even if we have to plant a tree.
- Fulton.

208
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,915
And may I say, welcome back.

209
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,854
It's good to be home.

210
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,256
Are the flyers ready?

211
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:40,096
This year we embossed the flyers
for the show.

212
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,533
Inspired.

213
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,208
I plan to limit member talent
auditions to 30 seconds each.

214
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:48,607
Amateur performers are very...

215
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:49,804
- Draining?
- Yes.

216
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,470
Understood.

217
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,605
And should I...

218
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:53,740
(Clearing throat)

219
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:58,617
We be so fortunate as to win
the Star Dazzle Award again.

220
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:00,414
But where would we put it?

221
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,652
We're planning on expanding
the trophy case.

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,853
The designs are in my office.

223
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:07,692
- Fulton, you are so efficient.
- Well...

224
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,259
The staffing matter we discussed?

225
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:14,437
Done. With discretion.

226
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,836
Fabulous.

227
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:21,036
- Oh, stop it. Yes. Yes.
- SHARPAY: Ryan!

228
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,780
- ALL: Sharpay!
- Girls.

229
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:29,012
Your chaise in its usual spot,
Miss Evans?

230
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,178
Thank you, Javier.

231
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:31,687
Emma, Jackie and Lea, east of me.

232
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,351
Oh, and you'll be a prince to angle our
chaises on the hour, as the sun moves.

233
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,691
Well, thanks to the kind words
from your mother last season,

234
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:39,230
I've been promoted.

235
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:42,300
But, no worries,
I'll make sure that the new lifeguard

236
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:45,337
is fully briefed
on just how you like things.

237
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:51,033
So, what's the theme of
the summer talent show, Sharpay?

238
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,970
- Redemption.
- Love it.

239
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:58,142
It was a very trying year, ladies.

240
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:01,085
My drama department
was invaded by outsiders,

241
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:05,181
singers coming from the chemistry lab
and locker room. Shocking, really.

242
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:09,661
Sis, we've got the pool, the entire club,
and the whole summer to enjoy it.

243
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,561
And the spa has been redone.

244
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,568
There's a guacamole facial and
a seaweed body scrub on the menu.

245
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,729
What could be more fabulous?

246
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:20,135
- More ice.
- Right away, Miss Evans.

247
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:31,141
(SINGING) It's out with the old
And in with the new.

248
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,280
Goodbye, clouds of gray
Hello, skies of blue.

249
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,792
A dip in the pool
A trip to the spa.

250
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,958
Endless days in my chaise
The whole world according to moi.

251
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,065
Excuse me.

252
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:47,995
Thank you.

253
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:52,501
Iced tea imported from England.

254
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:56,136
Lifeguards imported from Spain.

255
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:59,477
Towels imported from Turkey.

256
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:02,985
And Turkey imported from Maine.

257
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:06,989
We're gonna relax and renew.

258
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,992
You go do

259
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,689
I want fabulous
That is my simple request.

260
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:17,564
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best

261
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:21,104
I need something inspiring
to help me get along

262
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:25,370
I need a little fabulous
ls that so wrong?

263
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:32,506
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops.

264
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:36,179
Where is my pink Prada tote?

265
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:39,849
I need my Tiffany hair-band.

266
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:43,293
Then I can go for a float.

267
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:47,025
A summer like never before

268
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,761
I want more.

269
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:53,737
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request.

270
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:57,903
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best.

271
00:14:57,978 --> 00:15:01,436
She needs something inspiring
to help her get along.

272
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:05,245
She needs a little fabulous
ls that so wrong?

273
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,911
Fabulous pool.

274
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,079
Fabulous splash.

275
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:09,281
Read my lips.

276
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,290
Fabulous parties
Even fabulous trash.

277
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:13,416
Fabulous fashion.

278
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:14,585
No.

279
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,754
Fabulous bling.

280
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,922
Yeah.

281
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:19,899
She's got to have fabulous everything.

282
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:23,460
Nothing to discuss.

283
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:27,063
Everything's got to be perfect for...

284
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,267
Me!

285
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:31,904
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request.

286
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,747
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best.

287
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:39,310
She needs something inspiring
to help her get along.

288
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:43,585
She needs a little fabulous
ls that so wrong?

289
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,459
This won't do
That's a bore.

290
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,829
That's insulting
I need more

291
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:55,837
I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need

292
00:15:57,274 --> 00:16:01,301
I need fabulous

293
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,472
I want fabulous.

294
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,012
Fabulous hair, fabulous style.

295
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,180
Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile.

296
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,726
Oh, I like what I see
I like it a lot.

297
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,294
Is this absolutely fabulous?

298
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:22,128
Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.

299
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,199
Absolutely.

300
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,002
Not.

301
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:36,139
Yeah!

302
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,639
(Screams)

303
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,154
(Sharpay screaming)

304
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,658
Gabriella: I got you.
I got you. It's okay.

305
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:57,000
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the new lifeguard.

306
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,337
Wait, are you a member here?

307
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,999
(Ex claiming in disgust)

308
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:15,254
I told you to hire Troy Bolton,
not the entire East High student body!

309
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:20,260
You told me to hire Troy Bolton.
"Whatever it takes."

310
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,796
Well, why didn't you warn me
about the rest of them?

311
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:27,891
I did discuss the matter
with the Lava Springs board, of course.

312
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:31,767
The board. You mean, our...

313
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:32,931
Mother!

314
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,442
(Indian music playing)

315
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,114
Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats?
Mother, how could you?

316
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,947
Think of your future, kitten.

317
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,955
These are your school chums,
not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs staff.

318
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:50,150
These are not my chums!

319
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,625
They'll steal my talent show.

320
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,166
And what fresh talent
you'll have for your summer show.

321
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,297
Mother, did you hear what I just said?

322
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:02,128
(Exhales)

323
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:03,296
(Grunts angrily)

324
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,304
Ryan, talk to Mother.

325
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:09,002
- Hi, Mom.
- Ducky! How's my dashing boy?

326
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,607
(Sighs)

327
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:19,518
Tell pumpkin if she worries too much,
she'll get frown lines.

328
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,521
Namaste.

329
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,860
- I want them out!
- But your mother specifically said...

330
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:33,836
Oh, don't mention
that backstabbing yogini to me!

331
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:36,931
If you can't fire them,
make them wanna quit.

332
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:45,510
I'm hoping Chef Michael's
gonna teach me

333
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,779
the art of Austrian flake pastry.

334
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:50,948
And Sharpay's gonna be
where I work every day.

335
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,221
How much better can summer get?
Right? Right?

336
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:56,659
- A real dream come true.
- If you actually get to know her,

337
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:57,855
- I mean she's...
- Dude.

338
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:00,558
Hey, I didn't even know
Sharpay's parents owned this place.

339
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:01,725
Mr. Fulton just said, you know,

340
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:04,862
there's Wildcat fans at Lava Springs,
and jobs are available.

341
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,234
So, I said let's go for it.

342
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,901
Inspiring, Mr. Bolton. Truly inspiring.

343
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,978
However, what we're looking for
from all of you,

344
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:15,914
is not inspiration, but perspiration.

345
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:22,718
Confirming assignments.
Bolton, Danforth, waiters.

346
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,223
And, when needed, caddies.

347
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,154
What?

348
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:32,525
Miss McKessie,
I'm told that you're efficient.

349
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,501
- Well...
- Prove it.

350
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,529
You'll handle member activities.
Keep me in sight at all times.

351
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:43,545
Kelsi, piano.
Lunchtime and cocktail hour.

352
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:48,073
That means mood music,
not new music.

353
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,408
Capisce?

354
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,182
Martha, chopping, cutting,
preparing plates.

355
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,623
Do complete the summer
with the equal amount of digits

356
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:58,092
I assume you currently possess.

357
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:02,131
Oh, Zeke, you will assist Chef Michael
in the...

358
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:03,597
The promised land.

359
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,928
You hold on to that.

360
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,627
Mr. Fulton, Your Excellency, sir,

361
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:10,901
would it be okay if we draw straws
to see who has to wait on Sharpay?

362
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:14,206
Please, none of you
will be waiting on Sharpay.

363
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,610
Oh, yes. Snap.

364
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,773
- You will be serving Miss Evans.
- Who's that?

365
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:24,381
Always address our members as Mr.,
Mrs., or Miss. Let's practice.

366
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:26,150
- Do we have to?
- Shall we?

367
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:29,454
"Miss Evans,
would you care for lemonade?"

368
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,725
Actually, I'm not Miss Evans. I'm Jason.

369
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,797
- It smells so good and I am so hungry.
- No, wait. You don't...

370
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,928
- No, no, no.
- Gabriella: What's for lunch?

371
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,438
Miss Montez.

372
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,675
It would seem your lunch break
does not start for 3.5 minutes.

373
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,945
I do hope no members drowned
in your absence.

374
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:53,145
Henceforth, do clock in
and out on time.

375
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:58,247
Three infractions of any kind,
and your employment is terminated.

376
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,020
Capisce?

377
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,422
Chop, chop, chop.

378
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,032
- Okay, that man officially scares me.
- Yeah.

379
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,967
Suddenly, I'm beginning to miss
detention with Miss Darbus.

380
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,362
- How sick is that?
- Come on.

381
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:15,203
We got a hoop out back,
two free meals a day,

382
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,539
and we only have to wear
these stupid outfits on duty.

383
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:20,011
All for one, and one for all. All right?

384
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:23,676
- This is our summer. Now, what team?
- ALL: Wildcats!

385
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,309
- What team?
- Wildcats!

386
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:26,479
Come on.

387
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:30,457
(SINGING) How did we get from the top
of the world to the bottom of the heap?

388
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:34,325
I don't recall you mentioning
the boss is such a creep.

389
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,832
We still have the ingredients
to make this summer sweet.

390
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,629
Well, we got rags instead of riches.

391
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:42,728
And all these dirty dishes.

392
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,070
Just wish I had three wishes.

393
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:47,699
Okay, guys, break it up.

394
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,179
We've got to work, work
to work this out.

395
00:21:52,248 --> 00:21:55,809
We'll make things right
The sun will shine.

396
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:59,515
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt.

397
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,426
We can still save the summer
if we work this out.

398
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:07,924
Dude, what have you gotten us into?

399
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:11,092
Come on.
We can totally turn this thing around!

400
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,503
I'd rather face a seven footer
straight up in the post.

401
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:17,768
Yeah
That sure beats hanging here.

402
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,935
And burning someone's toast

403
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:23,606
I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress.

404
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:27,209
Maybe there's a better way
to fix this greasy mess.

405
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:31,346
We're a champion team
A well-oiled machine.

406
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:35,360
And we've faced tougher problems
than this

407
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:39,364
I know it's a grind
But I'm sure we can find.

408
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:43,061
A way to have fun
while we get this job done.

409
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:47,196
We've got to work, work
to work this out.

410
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:50,869
We'll make things right
The sun will shine.

411
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:54,641
We got to work, work
There'll be no doubt.

412
00:22:54,748 --> 00:23:01,244
If we all come together
We can work this out.

413
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:03,913
Let's work it!

414
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:06,125
(Tapping rhythmically)

415
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:28,680
Tell me what you want.

416
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,615
Tell me what you need.

417
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:31,744
A little bit of sugar.

418
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,912
A little bit of butter.

419
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:34,478
It's the perfect recipe.

420
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,421
Payday
it'll taste so sweet.

421
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:38,687
Payday
Good enough to eat.

422
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,921
Gonna make some motion pictures.

423
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,930
Hit the mall with all my sisters.

424
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:45,024
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers.

425
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,932
Kick it with the music mixers.

426
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,800
Buy a ride that suits my style.

427
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,669
Lounge around the pool awhile.

428
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,639
Make a date with my favorite girl.

429
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,768
We've got it made.

430
00:23:54,844 --> 00:24:00,111
Whoa, we've got to work, work
to work this out.

431
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:03,847
We'll make things right
The sun will shine.

432
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:07,617
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt.

433
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:13,391
We can still save the summer
if we work this out.

434
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:16,398
Work this
Got to work this.

435
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,833
We can work this out.

436
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,508
So, can we work this out?

437
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:25,899
Yeah, we can work it out.

438
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:27,239
FULTON: Send the waiters right in.

439
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,495
Miss me? Of course you did.

440
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:51,396
Hey, you ever been on a golf course?

441
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:54,906
We're employees, Troy. Not members.
And I don't play golf.

442
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,203
Who said anything about golf?

443
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:04,112
Are you sure it's okay for us
to be out here?

444
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,914
Yeah, unless the jackrabbits turn us in.

445
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:10,355
So, how's kitchen duty?

446
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:14,555
Oh, you know, the team that
washes dishes together, wins together.

447
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,923
My mom said summer jobs look good
on college applications.

448
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:23,435
All part of the frightening concept
called "our future."

449
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,096
Are you worried?

450
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,603
Hey, college costs a fortune.

451
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:32,069
My parents are saving pennies,
unlike the people at this place.

452
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:33,478
You're a cinch for a scholarship.

453
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:37,245
I'm only as good as whatever happens
next season. It's...

454
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,254
I always liked the idea of
being in charge of my future,

455
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,721
until it actually started happening.

456
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,384
So, let's just think about right now,

457
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,897
because I've never been in one place
for an entire summer,

458
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:51,593
and this means a lot to me,
especially being here with...

459
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:55,798
Such an outstanding peanut-butter
and-jelly-sandwich maker like me?

460
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:58,632
I want to remember this summer, Troy.

461
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:02,939
- Here, catch.
- Oh, I love this game.

462
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:05,342
- Ready?
- Go.

463
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,107
(Ex claims)

464
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:11,082
- Beautiful.
- Very nice! Oh. Your turn.

465
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,259
- You didn't catch a single one of them.
- You...

466
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:18,420
Troy: That was so bad.

467
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
(Gabriella giggling)

468
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:24,129
Fulton, when I was
on the fourth fairway today,

469
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:26,466
it seemed bone dry.

470
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:28,204
Oh, no way!

471
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:34,006
Could you tell maintenance
to give it a little extra splash?

472
00:26:48,828 --> 00:26:50,159
No way!

473
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,059
- May I have this dance?
- Why, of course you may.

474
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:57,797
Let's go then.

475
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,841
You are gonna get so wet!

476
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:08,139
Yeah!

477
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,415
Keep an eye on them tomorrow
and keep me posted.

478
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:16,649
Why are you smiling?

479
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:20,855
No worries, Ryan.
This is our turf, remember?

480
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:25,993
First a break-time infraction,
now frolicking on the golf course.

481
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:30,902
We are not off to an auspicious start,
are we, Miss Montez?

482
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,372
Actually, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea,
so she's...

483
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,410
How gallant, but irrelevant.

484
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,746
We won't allow this to happen again,
will we?

485
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:46,245
Good morning, everybody.

486
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:47,379
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

487
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:49,391
- Smells good. That smells good.
- Hey, Martha.

488
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,222
- Hey.
- Hey, Jason.

489
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:03,629
- Hey, morning.
- What's up?

490
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:08,368
(SINGING) Yeah
You are the music in me.

491
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:11,074
- Sounding good, Kels.
- Thanks.

492
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,743
Actually, I need to go get ready
for the ladies' luncheon.

493
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,048
Won't exactly be rocking out.

494
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:19,317
You know, I am so excited
about the club's talent show.

495
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:21,119
I mean, the employees
get to do a number,

496
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:22,988
and I have ideas for everyone.

497
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:24,221
You guys can sing the lead,

498
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:25,729
and maybe Zeke and Chad
can do backup,

499
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:26,958
and everyone can dance.

500
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,431
Big timeout on that one.

501
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,765
My singing career began and ended
with the East High Winter Musical.

502
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:34,328
I'm just here to make a check
and sneak in the pool after work.

503
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,271
That's... That's really it.

504
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:37,399
Oh.

505
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:39,735
What was that
you were playing a minute ago?

506
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,610
Oh, it's... It's nothing. It's just nothing.

507
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:42,807
What's this?

508
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,248
Well, I was thinking
if you'd do the show,

509
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:49,687
that I wanted to be ready,
and I wrote this for you guys.

510
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:50,778
Come on. Go.

511
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:54,924
(Vocalizing)

512
00:28:57,797 --> 00:28:59,265
(SINGING) Yeah.

513
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,834
You are the music in me.

514
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:08,105
You know the words
"Once upon a time"

515
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:12,475
Make you listen, there's a reason.

516
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:17,640
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find.

517
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:22,782
A little laughter, or happy ever after.

518
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:27,727
You're harmony to the melody.

519
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:31,560
That's echoing inside my head.

520
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:37,196
A single voice above the noise.

521
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:39,866
And like a common thread.

522
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:42,173
You're pulling me.

523
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:48,044
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.

524
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:51,644
Oh, you are the music in me.

525
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,555
Yeah, it's living in all of us.

526
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:57,525
And it's brought us here because.

527
00:29:57,594 --> 00:30:01,223
Because you are the music in me

528
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,764
(all vocalizing)

529
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,737
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:10,501
You are the music in me.

531
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:16,241
It's like I knew you before we met
Can't explain it.

532
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,578
There's no name for it

533
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:23,450
I sang you words I've never said.

534
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,080
- And it was easy.
- So easy.

535
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,922
Because you see the real me.

536
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:33,260
As I am, you understand.

537
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:38,268
And that's more than
I've ever known, oh.

538
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,807
To hear your voice above the noise.

539
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,776
And know I'm not alone.

540
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,473
Oh, you're singing to me.

541
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:53,884
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.

542
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:57,789
You are the music in me.

543
00:30:57,891 --> 00:31:00,724
It's living in all of us.

544
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:03,821
And it's brought us here because.

545
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:09,426
You are the music in me.

546
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:12,768
Together we're gonna sing.

547
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:18,307
We got the power to sing what we feel.

548
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:20,472
Connected and real.

549
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:24,416
Can't keep it all inside.

550
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,750
Oh, yeah.

551
00:31:27,923 --> 00:31:29,481
Oh, yeah.

552
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:32,253
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:35,592
You are the music in me.

554
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:38,123
Oh, yeah.

555
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:40,429
Oh, yeah.

556
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:45,205
You are the music in me.

557
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:49,677
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.

558
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,337
We belong.

559
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:54,144
You are the music in me.

560
00:31:54,718 --> 00:32:00,657
It's living in all of us
it's brought us here because.

561
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:03,784
You are the music in me.

562
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:09,159
Oh yeah
Oh yeah.

563
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:13,866
You are the music in me.

564
00:32:15,073 --> 00:32:16,370
Yeah

565
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:19,200
(all cheering)

566
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,906
- Oh, I love that song.
- Troy: Great job, Kels.

567
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:26,143
Oh, I've got the talent show sign-up
sheet right here. Are you in?

568
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:34,158
Maybe we can work this out,
but only if we're all in this together.

569
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:35,989
Yeah!

570
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,654
This is going to be fantastic.

571
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,494
I'm going to coordinate rehearsal
to coincide with all of our schedules.

572
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:44,058
Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square.
We may have trouble.

573
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:48,769
Ryan: Now, it's an amazing song,
but Kelsi didn't write it for us.

574
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,001
Hi, Mom.

575
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:52,068
- Seaweed scrub, darling?
- Maybe later.

576
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,842
Ryan, it might be wonderful
if Troy participates in our talent show.

577
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:58,214
What? If he sings with Gabriella

578
00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:01,049
then our whole show is going to be
the "Troy and Gabriella Show."

579
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:03,180
I'm not certain Gabriella
is ideally suited

580
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:06,749
to help Troy realize his full potential
at Lava Springs.

581
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,692
Mommy, what time
is Daddy gonna be here?

582
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:10,924
We tee off at noon. Join us?

583
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,893
Love to.

584
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,225
(Whimpering)

585
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:15,933
(All vocalizing)

586
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,965
(ENGLISH ACCENT) Up. And how shall
we get to the food today, sir?

587
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:21,541
- I don't know, perhaps skipping.
- Very well then.

588
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,043
Shall we?

589
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:26,639
Hipty scouty, hipty skipty,
hipty skipty, hipty skipty...

590
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,378
Danforth, Bolton,
you're caddying today.

591
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:32,283
$40 a bag. You've been requested.

592
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,878
- What?
- By who?

593
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:36,823
Dude, who cares?
For $40, I'd caddy for Godzilla.

594
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,620
Close, very close.

595
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,094
Thank you.

596
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:43,295
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

597
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:51,639
Hey, boys! So, Troy, I thought
it was time for you to meet my parents.

598
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:52,765
Oh.

599
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:54,935
Enchantee.

600
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,740
- Awesome.
- Hi.

601
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,106
Hello.

602
00:33:58,182 --> 00:33:59,979
So, where's your dad?

603
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:01,449
(Helicopter whirring)

604
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:08,849
(Ex claims)

605
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,266
SHARPAY: Hi, Daddy!

606
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:21,302
Where's the first tee
and what's the course record?

607
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:30,308
I'm just kidding. I built the course
myself and I hold the record,

608
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:32,647
but who's counting? Princess.

609
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:37,617
- Son, you've been working out.
- Yoga.

610
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:41,692
Bring that around, there you go.
Quite a season you boys had.

611
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:44,319
Oh, Troy played
for the golf team, too, Daddy.

612
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:47,628
Oh, versatile. How about you, son?

613
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,067
- Baseball. Track and field.
- Outstanding.

614
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,571
Might come in handy the way
I play golf. Fair warning.

615
00:34:57,244 --> 00:34:58,506
Fore!

616
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:05,512
- Brilliant, darling. Brilliant.
- Lovely.

617
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:10,551
Chad, you'll be caddying for Mother.
Troy, Daddy.

618
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,220
BOTH: Daddy.

619
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:15,861
Bravo!

620
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,091
Brilliant. Let's take a walk.

621
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,995
- Is that a new outfit?
- Yes, just this morning. And yours?

622
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:23,060
Mr. Evans: This old thing?
I got it last week.

623
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,263
Come on, Chad.

624
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,210
What do you think?

625
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,716
Well, it's 190 to the pin,
downhill lie, elevated green.

626
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:37,013
I'd go with a full five, sir.

627
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:40,914
Hi.

628
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:50,566
- Nice call.
- All right.

629
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:51,692
(Shrieks)

630
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:59,132
Princess, grab your pitching wedge.
This one's yours.

631
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,733
Thanks, Daddy.

632
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:06,481
Mr. Evans: Line it up.

633
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:13,147
Oops.

634
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:17,122
That's my girl.

635
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:19,789
That girl needs to take up knitting.

636
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:21,729
Or some sport
where she can only injure herself.

637
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,961
- I'm in the sand.
- Me, too.

638
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:26,127
(Ex claims)

639
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:32,403
Knees, hips, shoulders, hat.
Good. Drill it.

640
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:35,478
Backboard.

641
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,173
BOTH: Yes!

642
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,074
That's my boy.

643
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:41,347
(All grunting)

644
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:53,323
- Where...
- I have no idea.

645
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:58,795
Gabriella! Dinner tonight?
Sneak a swim?

646
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:01,434
Troy!

647
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,314
- Oh, lovely, darling.
- Nice.

648
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,513
Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot?

649
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:15,783
- Of course. Of course.
- No, I shouldn't.

650
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:17,119
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

651
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:18,557
- Yeah!
- Mr. Evans: Yes, sir.

652
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,561
- Are you sure it's okay, Mr. Evans?
- It sure is.

653
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:23,961
- Give it a ride.
- Thank you.

654
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:25,397
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Thank you, dear.

655
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:34,709
Mr. Evans: That's a beautiful swing.
Mrs. Evans: Really beautiful.

656
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,643
That is a beautiful swing.

657
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:40,579
- Chad: That was awesome.
- Thanks, man.

658
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:43,982
- Come on! What do you say we...
- What? I don't know.

659
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,586
Mr. Evans: Off we go.

660
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:52,756
I'm saving up for a car.
I'm saving up for a car.

661
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:08,610
(Mrs. Evans cheers)

662
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:11,679
Well, Tiger Woods would
have been proud to make that putt!

663
00:38:12,517 --> 00:38:15,884
What a shame that Troy
is only bussing dishes all summer,

664
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:18,421
given that he's a potential star
for your Alma mater, Daddy.

665
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:20,719
I've seen Troy play basketball.

666
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:23,694
I think the U of A Redhawks
will be very interested in him.

667
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:28,529
That's inspired, Daddy.
Troy is very concerned about college.

668
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

669
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:32,132
- How's Coach Bolton these days?
- Oh, fantastic.

670
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:33,727
Outstanding.

671
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,234
What?

672
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:41,442
Oh, next time
I see Country Club Princess,

673
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:43,948
I'm gonna launch her and her pink cart
straight into the lake.

674
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,278
I'll build the ramp, buddy.

675
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:48,479
Danforth, this is a kitchen,
not a day spa.

676
00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:51,318
You and Jason suit up for dinner duty
in the dining room.

677
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:54,826
Bolton, you have five minutes
to change and come with me.

678
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:57,625
In case you're not familiar
with this particular item,

679
00:38:57,732 --> 00:38:59,723
it goes around your neck,

680
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,969
like a dog collar.

681
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:05,137
Chop-chop.

682
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:08,168
(Guests laughing)

683
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:12,174
- And she stepped on the ball.
- I did not.

684
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,908
- Yes, you did.
- MAN: I can believe that.

685
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:19,283
Hey! Here's our superstar.
Troy Bolton, this is Peter.

686
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:20,753
- Peter. Good to meet you.
- How are you?

687
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:21,914
- This is Claire.
- Hello.

688
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,981
- And you know the family.
- Hello.

689
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:27,653
This kid's pretty handy on the fairways
as well as the hard court.

690
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:29,196
Bet you worked up yourself an appetite

691
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:30,993
lugging those bags
all over the place, huh?

692
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,158
Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

693
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:34,930
What do you say we get some food,
and we can talk about your future.

694
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,869
- My future?
- Yeah, sit down.

695
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,497
Peter: Have a seat.

696
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:41,543
Daddy's on the board of directors
at the University of Albuquerque.

697
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:46,047
So, Troy, I saw your
championship game. I mean, wow!

698
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:49,051
That last-second shot at the buzzer...
Outstanding.

699
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,485
Actually, my teammates here
stole the ball,

700
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,852
otherwise I wouldn't have
had a chance...

701
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:55,186
Oh, you're much too modest, Troy.

702
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,022
You were voted MVP
for the entire season.

703
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,826
(All ex claiming)

704
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,862
This shirt positively screams
for a Windsor knot.

705
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,236
- Thank you.
- Let me get that for you.

706
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,307
You know, we've got a heck of
a basketball program over at U of A,

707
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,403
and an excellent
scholarship program as well.

708
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,879
Scholarship?

709
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,810
Yeah. You know,
between the two of us here,

710
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,083
we... We pull a little weight over
at the school.

711
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:29,759
Well, time flies when you're having fun,

712
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:32,854
but Mr. Fulton will probably
want me clocking out.

713
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,427
Come on. Don't be silly.

714
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,263
You haven't had any dessert,
and we haven't talked about golf, yet.

715
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:40,669
Oh, basketball and golf are
just the beginning with Troy, Daddy.

716
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,367
Have you heard him sing?

717
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,205
Mr. Evans: Oh, triple threat.

718
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:47,542
Oh, how wonderful.
Troy can participate in the talent show.

719
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,845
Oh, come on, Troy.
Give them a sample. Kelsi!

720
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:54,353
Kelsi. No, actually my voice is...

721
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:57,117
Is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight,
you know, all the talking.

722
00:40:57,224 --> 00:41:00,786
But thank you very much for the food
and the golf and everything.

723
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,055
It was amazing.

724
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:07,123
But you will sing some other time,
though? With me. Promise?

725
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,207
- Promise.
- Perfect.

726
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:19,575
Dessert?

727
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:43,299
Sorry I'm late!
Give me two more minutes.

728
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:46,671
Nice tie. Your shoes
don't match though. Kidding.

729
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:57,818
Honey, two minutes is being late,
but an hour is approaching a felony.

730
00:41:57,922 --> 00:42:00,755
Just because Troy's a nice guy, doesn't
mean he's immune to boy disease.

731
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:01,848
Boy disease?

732
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,426
Yeah, forgetting things
he shouldn't forget.

733
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:04,927
Oh, so now you're a boy expert?

734
00:42:04,995 --> 00:42:07,931
My older sister has 10 rules
about boy behavior,

735
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,762
and nine of them involve boys
forgetting things

736
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,530
they should never forget,
like dinner dates.

737
00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:15,333
Well, it wasn't an official date
type of thing.

738
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:19,007
Rule number three,
all dates are official,

739
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,634
whether the boy knows it or not.

740
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,710
- You're not done.
- But I'm done for the day, sir.

741
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,844
And actually, I have a date.

742
00:42:28,955 --> 00:42:31,150
Mr. Bolton, you're under
the mistaken impression

743
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:34,283
I'm interested in what you have to say.
Just follow me.

744
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,453
- But I...
- No more speaking.

745
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,301
(Fulton shushing)

746
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,475
- Hey, where are we going?
- Please, Mr. Bolton.

747
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:51,909
- How long is this gonna take?
- Watch your step. Insurance issues.

748
00:42:52,012 --> 00:42:53,036
I'm supposed to have a date tonight.

749
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:56,047
But the evening is young
and so are you.

750
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:57,582
Well, where are we?

751
00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:00,715
Hold your applause until the very end.

752
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:02,647
(Ex claims)

753
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:06,851
What the heck? Mr. Fulton?

754
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:08,555
(Music playing)

755
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:21,904
(SINGING) A long time ago
In a land far away.

756
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:24,536
Lived the pineapple princess, Tiki.

757
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:27,548
She was sweet as a peach
In a pineapple way.

758
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:30,176
But so sad that she hardly speaky.

759
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:35,288
Still, if you listen well
You'll hear her secret wish.

760
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:37,292
Aloha, everybody, my name is Tiki.

761
00:43:37,394 --> 00:43:41,091
I long to free
A truly remarkable fish.

762
00:43:41,197 --> 00:43:43,256
My sweet prince.

763
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,926
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.

764
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:48,732
Makahiki malihini who.

765
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:53,539
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a
Ooh.

766
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:58,071
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

767
00:43:58,149 --> 00:43:59,810
Ryan, the fog!

768
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:04,115
Ryan: (SINGING) She dreams of a boy
Who is under a spell.

769
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:06,883
That has left him all wet and scaly

770
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:09,755
I sing from my heart
Of the power of love.

771
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:12,262
Just a girl with a ukulele.

772
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:15,923
- Come to me.
- Come to her.

773
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:18,435
- My sweet one, and be still.
- Be still

774
00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:23,430
I'll grasp your tail
Then stroke each tender gill.

775
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,635
My sweet prince.

776
00:44:25,744 --> 00:44:28,407
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.

777
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:31,177
Makahiki malihini who.

778
00:44:31,284 --> 00:44:35,846
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a
Ooh.

779
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:39,584
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.

780
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:43,117
Now this is where we lead
into the whole Kabuki thing.

781
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:46,595
The clouds turned gray
And the big sky cried.

782
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:48,760
And the ocean had a fit

783
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:50,804
Ryan! Where's my ocean?

784
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:53,635
Then the wind went whoosh
And thunder cracked.

785
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:59,111
And mighty Mount Fufu spit
Mighty Mount Fufu spit.

786
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:02,114
Tiki, Tiki
Want to speaky, speaky, speaky.

787
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:04,549
With the mighty spirit Fufu.

788
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:07,553
Tiki, Tiki
Want to speaky, speaky, speaky.

789
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:10,021
- The words I will not mince.
- Word!

790
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:14,325
Please make a man
Of my fresh fish prince.

791
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:16,693
This is real fish talk. No lie.

792
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,629
(Gargling)

793
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,373
And then the fish turns
into a gorgeous prince and sings...

794
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,539
(IN DEEP VOICE) I'm Prince Humu
Humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.

795
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:34,707
No. No way.

796
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:36,717
Makahiki malihini who.

797
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:37,878
With me.

798
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:41,480
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.

799
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:47,887
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.

800
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:49,056
Everybody!

801
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,828
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.

802
00:45:51,902 --> 00:45:54,564
Makahiki malihini who.

803
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:58,073
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.

804
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:03,177
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.

805
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,943
Waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.

806
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:11,682
Waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.

807
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:18,895
One minute.

808
00:46:35,381 --> 00:46:37,941
SHARPAY: We'll talk about this later.

809
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,416
So, you love it?

810
00:46:40,486 --> 00:46:42,977
Look, you ever tried just singing?

811
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:47,082
I mean, without all the lights and sets
and, like, backup people?

812
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:50,261
Well, it'd be much harder
to get applause that way.

813
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,094
I'm not talking about applause.

814
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:54,657
I'm talking about hanging out
with friends.

815
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:56,998
You know, doing nothing,
and singing for fun.

816
00:46:57,104 --> 00:47:00,938
(GASPS) Wait a minute.
Not doing anything.

817
00:47:02,176 --> 00:47:06,773
That might work.
A dark stage, a single spotlight.

818
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:10,409
We break out of darkness
into the circle of light.

819
00:47:10,485 --> 00:47:12,077
- Wait, "we"?
- No set, no frills.

820
00:47:12,153 --> 00:47:14,121
- Oh, man.
- Simple.

821
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:16,749
Dramatic. Just you and me.

822
00:47:17,826 --> 00:47:20,954
That is such a great idea, Troy.
We could do it at our club talent show.

823
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:22,519
Look, I'm here to work.

824
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,624
Sharpay, I already told you
being onstage really is your thing,

825
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:27,259
it's not mine.

826
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:30,534
It could be our thing.

827
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,201
(EX CLAIMS) Time out on that one,
okay? I've got an "our thing,"

828
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,938
it's with Gabriella, and...
And I'm very late for her, so I got to go.

829
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:40,278
- But the show could be so amazing...
- I love your shoes.

830
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:42,044
- You like them?
- I really do.

831
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:45,553
I bought them in New York.
I have them in nine colors.

832
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:50,989
Girls! Again from the top.

833
00:48:15,086 --> 00:48:18,056
Hey, lifeguard!

834
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:22,726
You're crazy, Wildcat!

835
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:27,160
And so late, but I brought food,
a few little candles.

836
00:48:27,232 --> 00:48:29,325
I'm good for a poolside picnic.
What do you say?

837
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:33,839
Zeke even made desserts.
But first, I dare you to jump in.

838
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:37,604
You know we're not supposed
to be in the pool. Club rules.

839
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,113
Cramp!

840
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:48,788
I need a lifeguard!
Rescue me! Rescue me!

841
00:48:50,223 --> 00:48:51,714
Here I come!

842
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:08,467
Thanks for coming in. Follow me.

843
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,999
(Coyote howling)

844
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,940
Oh, listen.

845
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,945
You know, right now, with you,

846
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:50,186
it's finally starting to feel like summer.

847
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,244
Yeah, it is.

848
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,449
The water bugs are back.

849
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,691
Look, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea,
she had nothing to do with it.

850
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:04,098
I generously overlooked
your previous break violation,

851
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,330
but then came the golf course jaunt,

852
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:10,204
and now this. Two strikes.

853
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,041
Don't get a third. Out of the pool.

854
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,951
Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes

855
00:50:23,022 --> 00:50:24,853
and then invited me to dinner
with some U of A alumni.

856
00:50:24,957 --> 00:50:26,015
Really?

857
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,820
And they were talking
about scholarships,

858
00:50:27,893 --> 00:50:30,794
while Jason and Chad
were, like, serving me.

859
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:33,329
And getting paid for it. It's called a job.

860
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,128
You were invited,
nothing wrong with that.

861
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,466
Yeah. I don't know. It felt weird.

862
00:50:37,537 --> 00:50:40,131
I love that you've got the team
working together,

863
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,902
but you're not gonna be
a Wildcat forever.

864
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:45,500
The team is now, and that's... It's good,

865
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:47,843
but everybody's got their own future.

866
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:50,348
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

867
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:54,521
Well, when you graduate,

868
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:57,353
lots of people are gonna be
chasing the same opportunities.

869
00:50:57,425 --> 00:51:00,189
There's nothing wrong with
keeping your eye on the prize.

870
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:02,354
In fact, if you don't, you get left behind.

871
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,092
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying,
I didn't get my friends jobs at the club

872
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,929
so they could sit and watch me
eat in the dining room.

873
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:09,935
You know, I'm just saying
never be ashamed of attention,

874
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:11,596
as long as you've earned it.

875
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:13,197
You know, a scholarship's special,

876
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:14,708
that's why there's only a few
to go around.

877
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,835
Yeah, yeah. I get it, Dad.

878
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:23,378
Okay. So, how was the food
at Lava Springs?

879
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:25,509
Insanely good.

880
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:29,425
- Take it out for a spin.
- No way.

881
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:32,962
Well, you didn't think I was going
to drive this heap, did you?

882
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:35,861
Yes! Yes!

883
00:51:36,232 --> 00:51:39,258
Okay, bring those knees up as high
as you can and circle those arms.

884
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:42,736
Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun.

885
00:51:42,805 --> 00:51:44,067
I really didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

886
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,698
Same here.

887
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:48,745
- So, maybe today we can have our...
- SHARPAY: Troy?

888
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:53,246
What time is your lunch break?

889
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:54,375
Troy!

890
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,087
- 1:30.
- 1:30, great.

891
00:51:58,155 --> 00:52:01,886
Free cheeseburgers are on me.
Everybody looks great. Awesome job.

892
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,121
Okay, now, some jumping Jacks.

893
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:07,163
Hey. What is she up to?

894
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:11,266
- Who knows?
- Believe me, she does.

895
00:52:15,774 --> 00:52:16,968
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Fulton,

896
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:19,942
but about the pool thing last night,
you can't blame Gabriella...

897
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,946
- I'm promoting you.
- You're what?

898
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,505
There's an opening
as an assistant to the golf pros.

899
00:52:24,617 --> 00:52:26,812
Salaried job, no clocking in.

900
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:30,355
- But, I...
- $500 a week, plus tips.

901
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,082
What? Per week?

902
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:38,493
Oh, my... That's off the hook!
I think it sounds very manageable.

903
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,000
Shall we?

904
00:52:45,138 --> 00:52:46,366
FULTON: Bolton!

905
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:53,345
- Wait. So you want me to teach golf?
- To kids. Oh, the joy.

906
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:57,310
- But, sir, I don't think I'm qualified.
- Worry not.

907
00:52:57,385 --> 00:53:00,286
Simply show the little angels
which end of the club to hold,

908
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:02,550
tee the ball up, then duck.

909
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:07,151
In addition, the board is extending
membership privileges to you.

910
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:10,959
You have complete use
of club facilities, but do so prudently,

911
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:14,366
meaning, fellow Wildcats? Not.

912
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:18,231
Congratulations.

913
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,398
(Ex claims)

914
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:22,375
You'll find an appropriate choice
of clothing here.

915
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:24,844
Do not mix checks with plaids,
blue with browns,

916
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:27,905
and avoid wearing white socks
at all cost.

917
00:53:28,017 --> 00:53:29,416
Leave your shoes outside the locker,

918
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:32,545
they will be buffed and polished
each evening.

919
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:36,219
Yes! Oh, man!

920
00:53:37,193 --> 00:53:38,660
Save it for the first tee.

921
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:43,358
And to get there,
this might come in handy.

922
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:48,166
That's the key to your golf cart.
Number 14.

923
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:52,733
The same number that's on your
basketball uniform, so I'm told.

924
00:53:52,843 --> 00:53:54,208
Questions?

925
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:56,075
How did this happen?

926
00:53:56,781 --> 00:54:01,514
It would seem that the Evans family
thinks you have untapped potential.

927
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:06,853
Young man,
the future is full of uncharted waters,

928
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:11,589
and this family has real clout,
so I suggest you take the ride.

929
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:17,094
Yeah.

930
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:21,963
Italian.

931
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:25,077
Awesome, junior golfers!
You guys look amazing!

932
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:29,540
Hey! Hey! Slow down, champ.
Slow down.

933
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:32,243
Save some for the other kids.
There you go.

934
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,411
Cool shorts, buddy.

935
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:38,617
All right. Hey. Hey, cutie.
Try holding the club that way,

936
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:40,955
you're going to hit it way farther.

937
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,088
All right. Nice backswing, man.
Nice backswing.

938
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:47,827
Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you.

939
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:50,802
You look good. Great job, everybody.
Good job, guys!

940
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:53,964
- Bolton. Bolton. Your 11:30 is here.
- Thanks, man.

941
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:55,632
Good luck, buddy.

942
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:00,308
Troy!

943
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:02,339
Oh, man.

944
00:55:03,985 --> 00:55:05,247
(Sharpay giggling)

945
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,947
- Cool balls.
- Thanks.

946
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:08,147
You're welcome.

947
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:10,417
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.

948
00:55:10,492 --> 00:55:11,618
Yeah.

949
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:12,850
(Ex claims)

950
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:15,459
If I live that long.

951
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:20,699
I'm so excited about the show.

952
00:55:20,803 --> 00:55:24,000
Oh, and don't worry.
We'll find something great to do.

953
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:29,043
Look, Sharpay, I already told you,
singing really isn't my thing.

954
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:31,943
And here's the best news,
all the Redhawk boosters will be there.

955
00:55:32,014 --> 00:55:34,006
- Really?
- Of course.

956
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:38,520
We'll lock up your scholarship
with a high "C" right from center stage.

957
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,518
We're all in this together, right?

958
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:44,219
Your parents have been really,
really nice, Sharpay,

959
00:55:44,327 --> 00:55:46,659
but singing with you
isn't a part of my job.

960
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:50,530
I know,
just something you promised to do.

961
00:55:50,634 --> 00:55:51,966
Remember?

962
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:56,840
You look fabulous in your new clothes,
by the way.

963
00:55:56,908 --> 00:56:01,038
- You like the shoes? They're Italian.
- Nice.

964
00:56:02,713 --> 00:56:04,044
(Clearing throat)

965
00:56:04,215 --> 00:56:06,479
Let me show you how this is done.
It's really easy.

966
00:56:06,551 --> 00:56:10,818
Just line up to your target.
Nice, easy backswing.

967
00:56:11,557 --> 00:56:13,184
- Hey, Gab.
- Hey!

968
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,826
That girl's got more moves than
an octopus in a wrestling match.

969
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:26,200
- Nah. He knows how to swim.
- Yeah. Troy can handle himself.

970
00:56:26,271 --> 00:56:28,399
I did overhear him asking her
for her opinion

971
00:56:28,508 --> 00:56:32,171
on his new Italian golf shoes.

972
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:33,507
He didn't ask me.

973
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,072
So, wake up, sister! She's basically
offering him a college education

974
00:56:37,183 --> 00:56:39,344
just to sing with her in the talent show.

975
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:43,685
- Troy would never do that.
- Taylor: You got eyes, use them.

976
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:47,420
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, I got to go. Hey, see you later?

977
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:49,018
- Okay.
- Okay.

978
00:56:49,096 --> 00:56:51,189
You're going to take it back
and through.

979
00:56:51,298 --> 00:56:55,598
- Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby.
- Fantastic. Thank you. See you.

980
00:57:06,481 --> 00:57:09,143
And she steps on the ball.

981
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,713
- Troy Bolton. This is...
- I've seen them all play at U of A.

982
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:15,949
Oh, all right.
Well, come scrimmage at our gym.

983
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,082
It'll be good for your game.

984
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,152
- Play with you guys?
- Yeah. Let's get down, bro.

985
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:23,959
- Awesome.
- All right.

986
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,728
- Let's all get some awesome lunch.
- Yeah.

987
00:57:26,802 --> 00:57:28,827
I knew it! Coral blue!

988
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:31,805
It's perfect for your skin tone.
And mine, too!

989
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:33,967
We are majorly skin-tone compatible,
Troy.

990
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:38,309
- I have no idea what that means.
- You don't need to. I'm here for you.

991
00:57:39,783 --> 00:57:41,080
- Who's hungry?
- Let's eat.

992
00:57:41,785 --> 00:57:44,515
I mean, how can you hit the ball
straight if your clubs don't trust you?

993
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:46,612
- That's the key. So, it's all in the grip.
- Okay.

994
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,784
You got to hold it just right.
That looks great.

995
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,987
Hey, I almost forgot.

996
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:53,494
I ordered Swiss on my burger.

997
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:55,862
So, go ahead and check it out, man.
Try it. See what you think.

998
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,834
Danforth, table three
needs more iced tea.

999
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:00,632
Now, rotate your hands over the top.

1000
00:58:00,705 --> 00:58:02,104
- Put your thumb on that side.
- Okay.

1001
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:04,641
There you go, man. You're good.
I'll see you on the course.

1002
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:06,301
- Yeah. Let's do it, man.
- Yeah.

1003
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:10,344
- Zeke! Troy wants Swiss.
- Coming right up.

1004
00:58:10,448 --> 00:58:11,541
You know, you were right.

1005
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,379
There's a guy out there
that looks just like Troy Bolton,

1006
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:16,010
but I have no idea who he really is.

1007
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:27,825
Oh, hey.
Kelsi's got some great new ideas

1008
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,630
- to spice up the talent show. It's got...
- I'm thrilled.

1009
00:58:29,703 --> 00:58:33,161
That new duet
that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it.

1010
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,707
- Actually, it's not available.
- Repeat.

1011
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,141
Well, it's something I wrote
for Troy and Gabriella,

1012
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:39,235
just in case they decide to...

1013
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:44,306
You're an employee,
not a fairy godmother. Let's have it.

1014
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:50,150
Transpose it into my key. Troy and I
will be doing it in the talent show.

1015
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:53,216
Oh, and brighten up the tempo.
We'll need to keep people awake.

1016
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:54,385
What about our song?

1017
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:57,396
- What about Humu Humu?
- Change in plans.

1018
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:00,228
What am I supposed to do
with my Tiki Warrior outfit?

1019
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:03,735
Save it for Halloween, go to a luau,
sell it online. I don't know!

1020
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,036
But in the meantime,
keep an eye on those Wildcats.

1021
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:08,838
If they're planning on
being in the show,

1022
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:11,378
which I doubt,
once they hear about Troy and me,

1023
00:59:11,513 --> 00:59:14,880
I don't want any surprises.
Oh, and don't worry,

1024
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:18,215
I'll find a song for you
somewhere in the show.

1025
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:20,516
- Or the next show.
- Really?

1026
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,359
Don't strain yourself, slick.

1027
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:31,897
Entertainers are so temperamental.
Transpose!

1028
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,894
(Groans)

1029
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,414
Look at you.

1030
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,383
- Go, team.
- Yeah. It's a gift from the guys.

1031
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,381
The "guys"?
Oh, you mean all those tall people?

1032
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:58,589
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, look. I got to go in a minute,

1033
00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:01,291
but I'll be back in about an hour.
I'll pick you up in my new truck

1034
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:03,800
and we'll go to a movie. I promise.

1035
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,633
"Promise" is a really big word, Troy.

1036
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:10,497
Yeah. I know.

1037
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:13,202
And we've got
the staff baseball game after work.

1038
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:15,041
Remember, you "promised"
that you'd play?

1039
01:00:15,147 --> 01:00:18,378
Right. Right. Baseball.
I will absolutely meet you there.

1040
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:21,783
- You forgot, didn't you?
- No. I just got the date mixed up.

1041
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:24,823
And I'm sorry
I couldn't make lunch today. I just...

1042
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,324
It's been wild, you know?

1043
01:00:27,393 --> 01:00:29,623
I can't believe
how things are working out here.

1044
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:35,157
So I see. Italian golf shoes,
new clothes, golf carts.

1045
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:39,296
That's crazy stuff.
Hard to keep track of it all, I bet.

1046
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,665
So, what's your point?

1047
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:46,077
It just doesn't seem like new stuff,
it seems like a new Troy.

1048
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:49,638
All right, let's see if Tiger Woods
still has a jump shot.

1049
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:52,584
- Hey, hey, Bolton! Come on!
- Hey!

1050
01:00:52,687 --> 01:00:54,245
Why don't you tell them
to come over here and mix it up?

1051
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:55,481
We'll show them some game.

1052
01:00:55,556 --> 01:00:57,683
You know,
I don't think that's how they roll.

1053
01:00:57,759 --> 01:00:58,987
That's not how they "roll"?

1054
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:02,996
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
I just think it's a closed practice. Sorry.

1055
01:01:03,064 --> 01:01:05,089
Wow. Well,
maybe you can get us a video?

1056
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,427
Bolton, come on!

1057
01:01:06,534 --> 01:01:08,833
But yesterday you said we were
going to play two-on-two after work,

1058
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:12,670
- before the baseball game.
- I know. I know, man. I'm sorry.

1059
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:18,104
Come on, Zeke, that was so yesterday.
You know, when we were all on a team!

1060
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,108
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

1061
01:01:20,282 --> 01:01:22,944
Hey, Bolton! That's my ball.

1062
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,022
- Here we go!
- How's it going, guys?

1063
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:32,755
Would you guys be mad at me
if I ask him to get me

1064
01:01:32,862 --> 01:01:35,296
one of those cool Redhawk jackets?

1065
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:39,724
Hey. Come on.

1066
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:48,574
I'm so excited about the game.
It's going to be so cool.

1067
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:51,706
Hey, Ryan. No rehearsals?

1068
01:01:51,782 --> 01:01:54,751
My sister is working up something new.

1069
01:01:54,819 --> 01:01:57,413
So, you coming to the baseball game?

1070
01:01:57,488 --> 01:02:00,117
I'm not staff. Wasn't invited.

1071
01:02:00,225 --> 01:02:03,319
Hey, everyone's invited.
Come on. Hop in.

1072
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,397
All right.

1073
01:02:07,732 --> 01:02:08,994
Hold on!

1074
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:10,992
(Taylor whooping)

1075
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,928
All right! Right here!

1076
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:21,144
Taylor: Beep, beep!

1077
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:25,409
Beep, beep!

1078
01:02:26,986 --> 01:02:29,113
What, did Fulton send you out here
to spy on us?

1079
01:02:29,188 --> 01:02:30,416
Nah, my sister did.

1080
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,423
She thinks you guys are going to
upstage her talent show.

1081
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:34,619
Oh, no worries.
We were going to do the show,

1082
01:02:34,695 --> 01:02:37,129
but then Troy bailed on us,
so, whatever.

1083
01:02:37,197 --> 01:02:40,257
What do you mean "whatever"?
It's our summer, remember?

1084
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:42,461
I thought we decided
doing the show would be fun.

1085
01:02:42,536 --> 01:02:44,003
- Well, I think so.
- Me, too.

1086
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:45,969
- Who are we kidding?
- I don't think so.

1087
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,506
We don't know
how to put together a show.

1088
01:02:47,608 --> 01:02:50,099
No, but he does.

1089
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:54,342
If we have a real director
putting it together, it could be great.

1090
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:58,152
Have the employees ever won
a Star Dazzle Award?

1091
01:02:58,386 --> 01:03:00,616
- Hey, now...
- I know what you can do, Ryan,

1092
01:03:00,688 --> 01:03:02,656
- so why not do it for us?
- All right, look,

1093
01:03:02,724 --> 01:03:07,821
if you want to play ball,
then grab a mitt, but I don't dance.

1094
01:03:07,896 --> 01:03:11,162
You don't think dancing
takes some game?

1095
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:17,464
- You got game?
- A little.

1096
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:25,344
(All ex claiming)

1097
01:03:28,018 --> 01:03:29,713
ALL: Yes!

1098
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:31,918
(All cheering)

1099
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,825
Hey, pitcher. Ball.

1100
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:41,086
Chad: All right! Let's hustle!
Come on! Wildcats!

1101
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:43,757
ALL: Get your head in the game!

1102
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:46,769
(SINGING) Hey! Oh! Play ball.

1103
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,440
Hey, hey!

1104
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:54,272
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing

1105
01:03:54,378 --> 01:03:56,243
I've got to just do my thing.

1106
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:59,077
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing.

1107
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,946
Yeah

1108
01:04:01,052 --> 01:04:05,114
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancing, same game.

1109
01:04:05,223 --> 01:04:10,024
It's easy
Step up to the plate, start swinging

1110
01:04:10,095 --> 01:04:11,858
I want to play ball now and that's all.

1111
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:16,230
This is what I do
it ain't no dance that you can show me.

1112
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:17,563
Hey, hey, hey.

1113
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,730
- Yeah.
- You'll never know.

1114
01:04:19,806 --> 01:04:22,104
- Oh, I know.
- If you never try.

1115
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:26,805
There's just one little thing
that stops me every time.

1116
01:04:26,913 --> 01:04:29,108
- Yeah.
- Come on!

1117
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:31,173
- I don't dance.
- I know you can.

1118
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,911
- Not a chance.
- No

1119
01:04:32,986 --> 01:04:36,979
- if I can do this, well, you can do that.
- But I don't dance.

1120
01:04:37,091 --> 01:04:39,286
- Hit it out of the park.
- I don't dance.

1121
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,624
- I say you can.
- There's not a chance.

1122
01:04:41,695 --> 01:04:43,492
- Oh.
- Slide home, you score.

1123
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:44,655
Swinging on the dance floor

1124
01:04:44,765 --> 01:04:47,131
I don't dance, no.

1125
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:49,635
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing

1126
01:04:49,703 --> 01:04:51,534
I've got to just do my thing.

1127
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,799
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing.

1128
01:04:53,874 --> 01:04:55,968
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1129
01:04:56,678 --> 01:05:00,614
Two stepping, now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance.

1130
01:05:00,682 --> 01:05:05,517
It's easy, take your best shot
Just hit it

1131
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,554
I've got what it takes playing my game.

1132
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:11,648
So, you better spin that pitch
you're gonna throw me.

1133
01:05:11,726 --> 01:05:13,490
- Yeah.
- I'll show you how I swing.

1134
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:15,826
- You'll never know.
- Oh, I know.

1135
01:05:15,898 --> 01:05:17,365
If you never try.

1136
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:19,491
There's just one little thing.

1137
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:24,335
- That stops me every time.
- Yeah, come on.

1138
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:26,671
- I don't dance.
- I know you can.

1139
01:05:26,742 --> 01:05:28,505
- Not a chance.
- No, no.

1140
01:05:28,577 --> 01:05:30,637
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.

1141
01:05:30,714 --> 01:05:33,706
- But I don't dance.
- Hit it out of the park.

1142
01:05:33,817 --> 01:05:35,842
- I don't dance.
- I say you can.

1143
01:05:35,919 --> 01:05:37,853
There's not a chance
Oh no.

1144
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:40,185
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor

1145
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:42,555
I don't dance no.

1146
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:44,718
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance.

1147
01:05:44,828 --> 01:05:47,229
Swing it out, spin around
do the dance

1148
01:05:47,331 --> 01:05:51,825
I wanna play ball not dance hall
I'm makin' a triple not a curtain call

1149
01:05:51,903 --> 01:05:53,700
I can prove it to you
till you know it's true.

1150
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:56,239
'Cause I can swing it
I can bring it to the diamond too.

1151
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,399
You're talkin' a lot
Show me what you got.

1152
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:02,377
Stop
Swing.

1153
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:05,042
Hey
Swing it like this.

1154
01:06:05,117 --> 01:06:08,348
Yeah oh.

1155
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,411
- Swing.
- Come on.

1156
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:14,859
- Jitterbug.
- Just like that oh.

1157
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:17,054
That's what I mean
That's how you swing.

1158
01:06:17,129 --> 01:06:19,359
You make a good pitch
but I don't believe.

1159
01:06:19,431 --> 01:06:21,695
- I say you can.
- I know I can't

1160
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:26,068
I don't dance.

1161
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:36,271
You can do it

1162
01:06:38,618 --> 01:06:41,611
I don't dance, no.

1163
01:06:41,722 --> 01:06:44,782
Nothin' to it
Atta boy, Atta boy, yeah.

1164
01:06:44,892 --> 01:06:46,985
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
What.

1165
01:06:47,094 --> 01:06:50,086
One, two, three, four
Everybody, swing, come on.

1166
01:06:50,164 --> 01:06:52,291
- I don't dance.
- I know you can.

1167
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:54,128
Not a chance
No, no.

1168
01:06:54,235 --> 01:06:56,226
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.

1169
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,965
But I don't dance.

1170
01:06:58,073 --> 01:06:59,404
Hit it out of the park.

1171
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,442
- I don't dance.
- I say you can.

1172
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,341
There's not a chance
No, no.

1173
01:07:03,445 --> 01:07:05,436
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.

1174
01:07:05,514 --> 01:07:07,141
But I don't dance.

1175
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:08,443
Hit it out of the park.

1176
01:07:08,517 --> 01:07:10,610
- I don't dance.
- I know you can.

1177
01:07:10,685 --> 01:07:12,585
Not a chance
No, no.

1178
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,645
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.

1179
01:07:14,757 --> 01:07:16,418
But I don't dance.

1180
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:17,584
Hit it out of the park.

1181
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,787
- I don't dance.
- I say you can.

1182
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:21,853
- There's not a chance.
- Oh.

1183
01:07:21,964 --> 01:07:24,262
Slide home, you score
Swinging on the dance floor

1184
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:28,963
I don't dance, no.

1185
01:07:30,873 --> 01:07:31,999
Safe!

1186
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,042
That's it!

1187
01:07:44,188 --> 01:07:45,519
It's okay!

1188
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:48,549
Hey, Evans.

1189
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,826
I'm not saying
I'm going to dance in the show,

1190
01:07:52,897 --> 01:07:56,560
but if I did,
what would you have me do?

1191
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:07,907
PLAYER: Hey! Get back, get back!

1192
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:10,447
Here we go, here we go!
Defense, hold him tight!

1193
01:08:21,627 --> 01:08:22,753
Oh, dang!

1194
01:08:23,128 --> 01:08:25,563
Mr. Evans: This kid's good.
I like what I'm seeing.

1195
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:28,965
Troy gives 110, 24l7,
that you can count on.

1196
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:30,395
Here we go!

1197
01:08:31,204 --> 01:08:33,229
- Game. Game.
- Good game!

1198
01:08:39,379 --> 01:08:40,607
Huh? Was I right?

1199
01:08:40,714 --> 01:08:41,806
Great.

1200
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:51,581
All right,
so you call that a "little" game?

1201
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:56,995
Little League. World Series.
Newport, Rhode Island.

1202
01:08:58,499 --> 01:08:59,625
Champions.

1203
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,102
- Good job!
- Nice hat.

1204
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,262
(Cell phone ringing)

1205
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:05,499
Gabriella: You're so awesome.
Ryan: Hey.

1206
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:06,665
What can I say?

1207
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,110
- Troy, you ready to run it back?
- Let's run it, man.

1208
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:11,509
- All right. Let's go, yo.
- Let's go.

1209
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:14,241
Let's go, yo, let's go. Let's run it back.

1210
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,309
(Player whoops)

1211
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:24,953
- Looking good.
- Wow, Wildcat!

1212
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:29,288
- Too much?
- Only in daylight.

1213
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,528
- Yeah.
- East High colors, very impressive.

1214
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:36,003
- Hey. Be true to your school, right?
- Absolutely.

1215
01:09:36,106 --> 01:09:38,040
Everyone's excited
about doing the show.

1216
01:09:38,142 --> 01:09:40,872
Hey, I know everyone thinks
that I'm Sharpay's poodle,

1217
01:09:40,978 --> 01:09:42,969
- but I really think that I could...
- Hey.

1218
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:46,983
If they were thinking that,
they're not thinking that today.

1219
01:09:47,518 --> 01:09:49,383
How do you do that swing-step
you did last night?

1220
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:50,885
That's easy.

1221
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:54,283
Hey.

1222
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,227
- Hey.
- Hey.

1223
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:02,626
So, I called last night.
I got hung up at the gym.

1224
01:10:04,803 --> 01:10:07,567
Hey, my dad says you're doing great
with those college guys.

1225
01:10:07,672 --> 01:10:09,640
Oh. Yeah. They're awesome.

1226
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,506
Playing with them is like being
in another world.

1227
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:14,740
Well, you missed out on a fun night.
It was a great game.

1228
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:19,908
But the dessert afterwards
had to be the best part.

1229
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:22,146
Her mom makes the best brownies

1230
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:25,520
- in the entire world.
- Yeah, I know. I've had them.

1231
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:31,093
Well, I'll see you guys later.

1232
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:48,774
Hey, LeBron,
how'd it go with the Redhawks?

1233
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:50,544
You know, they're very tall.

1234
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:52,609
We got Vince from maintenance
to play, so it worked out.

1235
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,382
- In case you were wondering.
- Maybe we could play later today.

1236
01:10:55,456 --> 01:10:57,014
I don't know. Check with Vince.

1237
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:59,389
Well, Mr. Evans set up the workout,
not me.

1238
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,054
Did you even ask to include us,
Captain?

1239
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:06,090
I didn't go looking for the Redhawks,
the Redhawks came to me. Okay?

1240
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:10,194
I didn't sign up for this golf job,
Fulton offered it. I said yes.

1241
01:11:10,272 --> 01:11:14,038
My decision. But I show up to work
same as you, so chill, man.

1242
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:15,474
You get a speck of dirt on your pants,

1243
01:11:15,577 --> 01:11:17,875
- and someone dry cleans you.
- And you wouldn't do the same thing...

1244
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:19,140
- if I was as good as you?
- I did not say that.

1245
01:11:19,248 --> 01:11:20,876
- You didn't have to!
- And neither did you!

1246
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:23,783
You know what? We didn't vote you
captain because of your jump shot.

1247
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:26,981
Okay, we did it because you're the guy
who usually knows what's up.

1248
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,615
- But I guess things change.
- You think you got me all figured out?

1249
01:11:29,726 --> 01:11:31,819
Well, I don't think so.
And I don't answer to you.

1250
01:11:31,928 --> 01:11:35,125
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!

1251
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,691
Look, we have been like brothers
since pre-school.

1252
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:41,636
If I don't know who you are these days,
then who does?

1253
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:47,371
Excuse me. You're all being paid
to work, not play Dr. Phil. Chop-chop.

1254
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,310
Table settings, nice. Oh. No, no.

1255
01:11:55,813 --> 01:12:00,546
No. No. No. Now, that? Fabulous.

1256
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:01,777
Troy!

1257
01:12:03,855 --> 01:12:06,688
Daddy will make certain the entire
scholarship committee is right here.

1258
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,156
Perfect view.

1259
01:12:08,226 --> 01:12:09,853
I've already spoken to your mother.

1260
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:12,452
They're going to be sitting at a table
right next to ours.

1261
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:14,192
It's going to be a fabulous evening.

1262
01:12:14,299 --> 01:12:16,130
- Come on.
- Great.

1263
01:12:17,002 --> 01:12:18,230
SHARPAY: Rehearsal, everyone!

1264
01:12:18,337 --> 01:12:19,895
- Taylor, I'm signing off on everything.
- Fabulous!

1265
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:21,333
Taylor: Thank you, Mrs. Evans.
Mrs. Evans: Good job.

1266
01:12:21,406 --> 01:12:25,172
Look, Sharpay. I know I promised
I'd do this, but just take it easy on me.

1267
01:12:25,244 --> 01:12:28,839
I'm kind of new
to the whole performing thing.

1268
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:30,849
Five, six, seven, eight!

1269
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:32,984
(Vocalizing)

1270
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:37,820
(SINGING) You are the music in.

1271
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:46,028
You are the music in
Are the music in.

1272
01:12:46,099 --> 01:12:48,660
You know the words
"Once upon a time"

1273
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:51,762
Makes you listen, there's a reason.

1274
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,436
And when you dream
there's a chance you'll find.

1275
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:59,377
A little laughter, or happy ever after.

1276
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:02,381
You're harmony to the melody.

1277
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:06,113
That's echoing inside my head.

1278
01:13:06,221 --> 01:13:07,848
A single voice.

1279
01:13:07,923 --> 01:13:09,413
Above the noise.

1280
01:13:09,524 --> 01:13:13,358
Like a common thread
Sing it to me.

1281
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:17,421
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong.

1282
01:13:17,532 --> 01:13:20,057
'Cause you are the music in me.

1283
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:22,535
It's living in all of us.

1284
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:27,042
It's here
Because you are the music in me.

1285
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,441
You are the music in.

1286
01:13:38,054 --> 01:13:41,957
You are the music in
Are the music in

1287
01:13:51,101 --> 01:13:52,500
(inaudible)

1288
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,438
Harmony to the melody.

1289
01:13:58,509 --> 01:14:02,104
Echoing inside my head.

1290
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:13,180
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong.

1291
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:16,022
'Cause you are the music in me.

1292
01:14:16,128 --> 01:14:18,426
It's living in all of us.

1293
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:22,331
It's here
Because you are the music in.

1294
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:26,301
Me, me, me, me, me.

1295
01:14:27,106 --> 01:14:29,301
You are the music in.

1296
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:39,714
You are the music in me.

1297
01:14:40,553 --> 01:14:42,987
Yeah, yeah.

1298
01:14:44,457 --> 01:14:47,620
Oh, yeah.

1299
01:14:54,869 --> 01:14:57,303
Great job! One second.

1300
01:14:57,505 --> 01:14:58,870
Great rehearsal!

1301
01:14:58,973 --> 01:15:00,565
Everybody break!

1302
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:07,405
You know, Troy,
I've always known you were special.

1303
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:10,747
And it's pretty obvious I'm special, too.

1304
01:15:10,852 --> 01:15:14,049
I think we were meant to sing together,
don't you?

1305
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:20,854
I need some air.

1306
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:26,067
Don't be long!
We're going to run it again!

1307
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:50,419
Show me what you got!

1308
01:15:52,129 --> 01:15:54,324
Come on, everybody! Here we go!

1309
01:16:04,909 --> 01:16:07,639
You're up! You're up! You're up first!

1310
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:10,941
Here we go! Give it to me!

1311
01:16:11,015 --> 01:16:13,074
Come on! Oh, yeah!

1312
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:17,277
You got it! Here we go!
Pass it to me!

1313
01:16:17,622 --> 01:16:20,114
Come on, let's dance!

1314
01:16:21,427 --> 01:16:22,951
You're up! You're up!

1315
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:28,360
Let's show them what we got!

1316
01:16:31,604 --> 01:16:33,333
Come on! All right!

1317
01:16:37,444 --> 01:16:40,470
Ryan: Oh, cut that! Get out of here!

1318
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:48,053
- You got it! Hey.
- Good job!

1319
01:16:50,223 --> 01:16:51,815
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1320
01:16:57,632 --> 01:17:01,295
I said keep an eye on them,
not turn them into the cast of Grease!

1321
01:17:01,369 --> 01:17:02,996
Pretty cool, huh?

1322
01:17:04,338 --> 01:17:09,002
Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle
Award to a bunch of dishwashers?

1323
01:17:10,344 --> 01:17:13,576
Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz.

1324
01:17:15,584 --> 01:17:19,520
When did you become one of them?

1325
01:17:21,323 --> 01:17:23,655
You know,
I'll take that as a compliment.

1326
01:17:23,859 --> 01:17:27,420
But you and Troy
have a good show, sis.

1327
01:17:27,563 --> 01:17:29,828
Oh, we plan to.

1328
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:42,669
Give me a beat.

1329
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:53,948
The Midsummer's Night Talent Show
means something to me,

1330
01:17:54,058 --> 01:17:55,184
- and to my family.
- Well...

1331
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,523
Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce.

1332
01:17:57,595 --> 01:18:01,793
I'm... Your brother is one of
"those Wildcats," I'm told.

1333
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:04,733
Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us.

1334
01:18:04,803 --> 01:18:07,363
Employee involvement in the show
is a tradition here.

1335
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:11,307
Traditions change. My parents have
important guests coming.

1336
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:14,708
We'll need every employee working
the party, and not on stage.

1337
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:17,907
Pardon moi, but
we're not just talking about employees,

1338
01:18:17,983 --> 01:18:23,581
we're talking about your classmates.
You might want to think this one out.

1339
01:18:23,656 --> 01:18:25,453
All right.

1340
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:28,926
Done. Now do it.

1341
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:37,733
- Hi, Taylor.
- Hi.

1342
01:18:41,808 --> 01:18:46,302
Distribute these in the staff area,
but not until the end of shift.

1343
01:18:46,413 --> 01:18:50,782
- What? Wait! Mr. Fulton...
- No discussion, Miss McKessie.

1344
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:55,220
This is a business.
Welcome to the world of adults

1345
01:18:55,322 --> 01:18:59,350
who wish to keep their jobs because
they have mortgages they wish to pay,

1346
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,691
tuition bills, car payments,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1347
01:19:02,797 --> 01:19:05,664
So, sometimes, we have
to perform tasks, however unpleasant,

1348
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:08,361
that are necessary
for that all-too-important paycheck

1349
01:19:08,469 --> 01:19:11,063
to land in our all-too-empty pockets!

1350
01:19:13,809 --> 01:19:18,644
- May I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Fulton?
- Chamomile would be lovely.

1351
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:28,986
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!

1352
01:19:29,058 --> 01:19:30,355
May I have your attention, please?

1353
01:19:30,426 --> 01:19:33,021
You guys,
I need to make an announcement.

1354
01:19:33,096 --> 01:19:36,725
All junior staffers will be required
to work on show night.

1355
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,198
- What?
- Yeah, it says,

1356
01:19:38,268 --> 01:19:41,863
"No staff participation in the show
will be allowed. No exceptions."

1357
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:43,064
KELSI: No show?

1358
01:19:43,173 --> 01:19:44,663
Taylor: There's a show.
We're just not in it.

1359
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:45,935
That's great.

1360
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:49,069
I'm sorry, you guys. There's nothing
we can do about it. It's Fulton's orders.

1361
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,341
There's no way this is Fulton's idea.

1362
01:19:51,415 --> 01:19:55,852
Unless Fulton suddenly has blonde
hair and wears designer flip-flops.

1363
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,285
Excuse me.

1364
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:10,133
- Totally!
- Sharpay!

1365
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:17,965
Forget about the rest of us,
how about the fact

1366
01:20:18,076 --> 01:20:20,544
that your brother has worked
extremely hard on this show?

1367
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:25,482
Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show.
He'll do his celebrity impersonations.

1368
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:28,145
And don't lecture me about Ryan,

1369
01:20:28,254 --> 01:20:30,279
given the way you've been interfering
with Troy's future.

1370
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,448
What?

1371
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:34,817
You've gotten him written up by Fulton
for sneaking on the golf course,

1372
01:20:34,927 --> 01:20:39,660
swimming after hours.
I had to step in just to save Troy's job.

1373
01:20:39,766 --> 01:20:42,395
I'm not interested in what you think
you're doing for Troy.

1374
01:20:42,469 --> 01:20:45,734
That's between you and him.
But you're messing with my friends,

1375
01:20:45,806 --> 01:20:48,934
my summer,
and that's not okay with me.

1376
01:20:49,009 --> 01:20:52,274
You don't like the fact that I won.

1377
01:20:52,346 --> 01:20:56,146
What's the prize? Troy?
The Star Dazzle Award?

1378
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,015
You have to go through all of this
just to get either one?

1379
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,314
No, thanks, Sharpay.

1380
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:03,152
You're very good at a game
that I don't want to play,

1381
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,089
so I'm done here.

1382
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,089
But you better step away
from the mirror

1383
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:11,428
long enough to check the damage
that will always be right behind you.

1384
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,865
Girls!

1385
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,271
Hey.
What do you mean you're done here?

1386
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,110
I mean, you can't quit.

1387
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:33,053
Us working together sounded good,
but plans change and people change.

1388
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:35,454
The club talent show is a big deal
for Sharpay,

1389
01:21:35,525 --> 01:21:38,619
and evidently for your future,
so it's cool.

1390
01:21:38,695 --> 01:21:39,787
Just make it happen.

1391
01:21:39,863 --> 01:21:43,299
- Wear your new Italian shoes.
- Hey, I'm still me.

1392
01:21:43,366 --> 01:21:45,459
Blowing off your friends,
missing dates?

1393
01:21:45,535 --> 01:21:47,366
- If that's you, it's good to know.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1394
01:21:47,471 --> 01:21:50,065
I was only doing that because
I'm working on the scholarship thing.

1395
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:51,471
You know that.

1396
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:53,407
But if along the way
you act like someone you're not,

1397
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:55,069
pretty soon that's who you become.

1398
01:21:55,179 --> 01:21:59,377
I meant what I said about movies
and summer and just being together.

1399
01:21:59,484 --> 01:22:01,816
I'm sure you did, at the time.

1400
01:22:03,654 --> 01:22:08,922
But I also meant what I said,
that I want to remember this summer.

1401
01:22:09,027 --> 01:22:11,018
But not like this, Troy.

1402
01:22:13,332 --> 01:22:18,326
(SINGING) I gotta say
what's on my mind.

1403
01:22:18,403 --> 01:22:23,670
Something about us
doesn't seem right these days.

1404
01:22:23,742 --> 01:22:28,203
Life keeps getting in the way.

1405
01:22:28,281 --> 01:22:29,407
Whenever we try.

1406
01:22:29,516 --> 01:22:34,180
Somehow the plan
is always rearranged.

1407
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:39,783
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me.

1408
01:22:39,893 --> 01:22:41,884
You'll be okay

1409
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:46,729
I've got to move on and be who I am

1410
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:52,471
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand.

1411
01:22:52,573 --> 01:22:57,806
We might find a place
in this world someday.

1412
01:22:57,912 --> 01:23:04,842
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way.

1413
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:14,626
Don't wanna leave it all behind.

1414
01:23:14,696 --> 01:23:16,755
But I get my hopes up.

1415
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:20,495
And I watch them fall every time.

1416
01:23:20,603 --> 01:23:24,539
Another color turns to gray.

1417
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:30,943
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away

1418
01:23:31,013 --> 01:23:36,509
I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me.

1419
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:38,679
You'll be okay

1420
01:23:38,789 --> 01:23:43,488
I've got to move on and be who I am

1421
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:49,192
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand.

1422
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:54,499
We might find our place
in this world someday.

1423
01:23:54,572 --> 01:24:00,977
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way.

1424
01:24:01,713 --> 01:24:03,476
What about us?

1425
01:24:03,548 --> 01:24:06,915
What about everything
we've been through?

1426
01:24:07,018 --> 01:24:09,316
What about trust?

1427
01:24:09,387 --> 01:24:12,380
You know I never wanted to hurt you.

1428
01:24:12,491 --> 01:24:14,721
What about me?

1429
01:24:14,827 --> 01:24:17,193
What am I supposed to do?

1430
01:24:17,263 --> 01:24:23,031
- I gotta leave, but I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.

1431
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:27,270
Oh, so

1432
01:24:27,373 --> 01:24:31,276
I've got to move on and be who I am.

1433
01:24:31,378 --> 01:24:32,504
Why do you have to go?

1434
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:36,709
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1435
01:24:36,783 --> 01:24:37,909
I'm trying to understand.

1436
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:43,081
We might find a place
in this world someday.

1437
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:47,126
- But at least for now.
- I want you to stay

1438
01:24:47,228 --> 01:24:49,025
I gotta go my own way

1439
01:24:49,096 --> 01:24:52,930
I've got to move on and be who I am.

1440
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:54,126
What about us?

1441
01:24:54,235 --> 01:24:58,137
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1442
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,433
I'm trying to understand.

1443
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:04,774
We might find our place
in this world someday.

1444
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:11,410
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

1445
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:17,823
I gotta go my own way

1446
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:23,425
I gotta go my own way.

1447
01:25:40,484 --> 01:25:42,179
You're usually taking these
right off the grill.

1448
01:25:42,286 --> 01:25:43,583
Maybe I've been eating too much
at the club.

1449
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:45,815
You've barely been out of this room
the last three or four days.

1450
01:25:45,923 --> 01:25:49,359
- Let's call the guys, get a game going.
- They wouldn't come even if I called.

1451
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:52,691
I find that hard to believe.

1452
01:25:52,796 --> 01:25:57,860
Dad, do I seem different
to you this summer?

1453
01:25:57,969 --> 01:25:59,834
You dress a lot better, that's for sure.

1454
01:25:59,938 --> 01:26:04,637
Oh, man, I'm serious.
Maybe my friends are right,

1455
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:07,269
maybe I'm turning into a jerk
with new shoes.

1456
01:26:07,345 --> 01:26:10,109
New shoes, not a new kid.
Where's this coming from?

1457
01:26:10,181 --> 01:26:13,014
I've been so focused on my future.

1458
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:16,714
I mean, Gabriella quit.
Chad won't talk to me.

1459
01:26:16,822 --> 01:26:18,414
I don't see the Wildcats
running around here.

1460
01:26:18,524 --> 01:26:20,082
Is this about going after
what you want?

1461
01:26:20,192 --> 01:26:23,423
Yeah, Dad.
The scholarship's important. I get it.

1462
01:26:23,529 --> 01:26:25,690
Hey, hey.

1463
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:28,734
Look, it's only a big deal
if it makes sense to you.

1464
01:26:28,834 --> 01:26:31,359
I don't even know who I am anymore.

1465
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:37,600
You know what?

1466
01:26:37,711 --> 01:26:41,704
I've known this kid for a long, long time.

1467
01:26:41,782 --> 01:26:46,776
And I got a lot of faith in him.
He looks a lot like you.

1468
01:26:48,088 --> 01:26:53,356
I'm absolutely sure he's going
to figure out the right thing to do.

1469
01:26:56,631 --> 01:26:58,963
It's so good. I cannot wait.

1470
01:27:04,272 --> 01:27:05,432
BO Y: Yeah,
I'm eating so much breakfast,

1471
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,374
I won't be able to eat my dinner
at night.

1472
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,637
KELSI: Oh, yeah.
It's okay, Ryan's gonna help.

1473
01:27:10,746 --> 01:27:13,544
- I don't know.
- We'll get it eventually.

1474
01:27:13,782 --> 01:27:14,874
Excuse me.

1475
01:27:45,683 --> 01:27:49,016
(SINGING)
Everybody's always talking at me.

1476
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:52,111
Everybody's trying to get in my head

1477
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:55,856
I wanna listen to my own heart talking

1478
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,861
I need to count on myself instead.

1479
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:02,293
- Did you ever.
- Lose yourself to get what you want?

1480
01:28:02,367 --> 01:28:05,700
- Did you ever.
- Get on a ride then wanna get off?

1481
01:28:05,804 --> 01:28:06,862
Did you ever.

1482
01:28:06,972 --> 01:28:09,372
Push away the ones
you should've held close?

1483
01:28:09,474 --> 01:28:13,342
Did you ever let go?
Did you ever not know?

1484
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:16,847
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am

1485
01:28:16,949 --> 01:28:20,316
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan.

1486
01:28:20,386 --> 01:28:23,787
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can.

1487
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:26,984
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.

1488
01:28:27,059 --> 01:28:28,185
Bet on me

1489
01:28:28,294 --> 01:28:30,990
I wanna make it right, that is the way.

1490
01:28:31,063 --> 01:28:34,465
To turn my life around
Today is the day.

1491
01:28:34,535 --> 01:28:37,868
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?

1492
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:41,566
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.

1493
01:28:41,675 --> 01:28:45,076
How will I know
if there's a path worth taking?

1494
01:28:45,178 --> 01:28:48,579
Should I question every move I make?

1495
01:28:48,682 --> 01:28:52,084
With all I've lost, my heart is breaking

1496
01:28:52,186 --> 01:28:55,053
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.

1497
01:28:55,156 --> 01:28:56,248
Did you ever.

1498
01:28:56,357 --> 01:28:58,518
Doubt your dream will ever come true?

1499
01:28:58,593 --> 01:28:59,685
Did you ever.

1500
01:28:59,761 --> 01:29:02,093
Blame the world but never blame you?

1501
01:29:02,196 --> 01:29:05,427
- I will never.
- Try to live a lie again

1502
01:29:05,533 --> 01:29:09,436
I don't wanna win this game
if I can't play it my way

1503
01:29:09,538 --> 01:29:13,201
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am

1504
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:16,711
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan.

1505
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:19,873
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can.

1506
01:29:19,949 --> 01:29:23,510
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

1507
01:29:23,586 --> 01:29:27,045
I wanna make it right, that is the way.

1508
01:29:27,123 --> 01:29:30,524
To turn my life around
Today is the day.

1509
01:29:30,594 --> 01:29:34,030
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?

1510
01:29:34,097 --> 01:29:37,464
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.

1511
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:41,059
Oh, hold up.

1512
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:44,867
Gimme room to think
Bring it on down.

1513
01:29:47,645 --> 01:29:51,581
Gotta work on my swing
Gotta do my own thing.

1514
01:29:52,883 --> 01:29:54,214
Hold up.

1515
01:29:59,323 --> 01:30:03,351
It's no good at all to see yourself.

1516
01:30:03,462 --> 01:30:06,363
And not recognize your face.

1517
01:30:06,465 --> 01:30:11,664
Out on my own
it's such a scary place.

1518
01:30:13,271 --> 01:30:18,504
The answers are all inside of me.

1519
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:25,483
All I got to do is believe

1520
01:30:26,653 --> 01:30:30,111
I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop
till I get my shot.

1521
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:33,454
That's who I am, that is my plan
We'll end up on top.

1522
01:30:33,526 --> 01:30:36,393
You can bet on it, bet on it
bet on it, bet on.

1523
01:30:36,496 --> 01:30:40,900
You can bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
Bet on me

1524
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:44,129
I wanna make it right, that is the way.

1525
01:30:44,204 --> 01:30:47,696
To turn my life around
Today is the day.

1526
01:30:47,808 --> 01:30:51,175
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?

1527
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:55,376
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
You can bet on me.

1528
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:02,948
This way.

1529
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:10,728
What do you mean
you're not doing the show?

1530
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:13,097
- Exactly that.
- We're singing a duet, Troy!

1531
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:14,931
A duet means two people.

1532
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:16,937
Well, mostly me in this case,
but whatever! Duet!

1533
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:19,735
I'm an employee.
Employees aren't allowed in the show.

1534
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:22,333
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You're an honorary member.

1535
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:23,605
Not anymore.

1536
01:31:23,713 --> 01:31:25,840
- I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back.
- What?

1537
01:31:25,915 --> 01:31:29,351
Sharpay, I don't like the way
you've been treating my friends.

1538
01:31:29,419 --> 01:31:31,250
And I don't like the way
I've been treating them either,

1539
01:31:31,354 --> 01:31:33,379
so I'm doing something about it.

1540
01:31:33,457 --> 01:31:38,121
An entire table of University boosters
are coming to see you, thanks to me.

1541
01:31:38,228 --> 01:31:40,253
So, I'll be their waiter.
They'll be thrilled.

1542
01:31:40,363 --> 01:31:42,422
Troy, Troy. This could change your life!

1543
01:31:42,532 --> 01:31:45,467
I'm more interested in
about what my friends think of me,

1544
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:47,128
and what I think of myself.

1545
01:31:47,238 --> 01:31:50,230
Oh, we could all hold hands
around the campfire some other time!

1546
01:31:50,308 --> 01:31:51,605
Right now we've got a show to do.

1547
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:56,078
No. You've got a show to do.
I got a kitchen to clean.

1548
01:32:00,752 --> 01:32:02,083
It's okay.

1549
01:32:06,325 --> 01:32:08,225
Kelsi, find Ryan.

1550
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:12,993
Taylor: Welcome this evening.
You'll be seated at table 21.

1551
01:32:13,098 --> 01:32:16,795
Kelly, will you escort them, please?
Excellent.

1552
01:32:16,902 --> 01:32:17,960
Ladies, you look gorgeous

1553
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:21,005
- this evening. Beautiful.
- FULTON: And now, returning with

1554
01:32:21,106 --> 01:32:25,441
a abridged version
of last year's tap-dancing epic,

1555
01:32:25,512 --> 01:32:29,107
Tina and her Tippety-Tappity Toes!

1556
01:32:40,294 --> 01:32:42,421
There you are! Thank goodness
you've come to your senses.

1557
01:32:42,496 --> 01:32:44,327
Plug in the volcano.
Humu Humu is back on.

1558
01:32:44,431 --> 01:32:48,026
Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis.
I'm not doing the show.

1559
01:32:48,135 --> 01:32:51,366
What? Oh, put some fresh batteries
in your Tiki Warrior costume

1560
01:32:51,472 --> 01:32:53,997
- and let's get going!
- Took your advice. Sold it online.

1561
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:59,046
You've always wanted the spotlight.
Now you've got it. Break a leg.

1562
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:07,486
The curtain's up. Showtime!

1563
01:33:19,735 --> 01:33:22,898
Kelsi told us what went down
between you and Sharpay.

1564
01:33:23,005 --> 01:33:26,736
I'm more interested in what went down
between me and you, man.

1565
01:33:26,843 --> 01:33:29,869
- I was a jerk.
- Yeah.

1566
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,471
But, hey, brothers fight.

1567
01:33:32,549 --> 01:33:35,245
And they're still brothers.

1568
01:33:35,352 --> 01:33:36,376
(All cheering)

1569
01:33:37,888 --> 01:33:39,048
All right!

1570
01:33:39,122 --> 01:33:43,422
Guys, I messed up your show
and I'm sorry.

1571
01:33:43,527 --> 01:33:47,691
Yeah, because show business
is our entire lives, right?

1572
01:33:47,764 --> 01:33:50,563
Hey, I hope you haven't permanently
filled my spot in the two-on-two game.

1573
01:33:50,635 --> 01:33:53,798
And, Ryan, I know how hard
you must've worked on this show.

1574
01:33:53,905 --> 01:33:56,135
Making these Wildcats look good
couldn't have been easy.

1575
01:33:56,241 --> 01:33:59,540
- Hey.
- So, I apologize.

1576
01:33:59,611 --> 01:34:02,273
Hey, the truth is,
we've all had a lot of fun.

1577
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:03,438
At least, I have.

1578
01:34:03,548 --> 01:34:07,713
Hey, you gotta see
this dude play baseball.

1579
01:34:07,786 --> 01:34:09,811
I'm looking forward to it.

1580
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:13,314
- All right!
- Yeah!

1581
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:16,417
Troy, listen, all these people out there,

1582
01:34:16,495 --> 01:34:19,658
I don't really want
to see my sister crash and burn.

1583
01:34:19,765 --> 01:34:23,963
At least, I think I don't.
I think you should sing with her.

1584
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:32,340
My life is over. I've been a good girl.

1585
01:34:32,445 --> 01:34:35,744
I've never lied, except when necessary.

1586
01:34:35,815 --> 01:34:38,283
I always bought my parents
expensive gifts,

1587
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:42,288
using their credit card, of course.
But I don't deserve this humiliation!

1588
01:34:42,356 --> 01:34:46,759
You need to get out there.
Mrs. Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet

1589
01:34:46,827 --> 01:34:50,024
are stinking up the premises.

1590
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:52,656
Well, the only thing that
would make it any lovelier would be

1591
01:34:52,767 --> 01:34:57,431
that if I won that Star Dazzle Award!
Sharpay, I'm going to find you.

1592
01:34:57,505 --> 01:35:01,966
That award, I tell you, it's mine!
Mine! Mine!

1593
01:35:02,044 --> 01:35:06,981
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the...
Oh, forget it.

1594
01:35:09,284 --> 01:35:12,549
How's your show going?

1595
01:35:12,654 --> 01:35:14,383
How's it going?

1596
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:15,717
My show makes the captain
of the Titanic

1597
01:35:15,824 --> 01:35:18,225
look like he won the lottery.

1598
01:35:18,328 --> 01:35:21,855
- I'll sing with you, Sharpay.
- What?

1599
01:35:21,965 --> 01:35:25,196
I promised. And I keep my promises.

1600
01:35:25,301 --> 01:35:29,704
But what was the first thing you said
to me when I started working here?

1601
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,640
- Bring me more iced tea?
- Think harder. We're...

1602
01:35:37,348 --> 01:35:41,409
- All in this together.
- Exactly.

1603
01:35:41,518 --> 01:35:44,419
Well, we are.

1604
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:47,251
So, let's get out there
and knock them dead, Troy Bolton!

1605
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:50,850
I do the show
if the Wildcats do the show.

1606
01:35:50,928 --> 01:35:52,328
(Glass breaking)

1607
01:35:52,397 --> 01:35:53,830
(Audience gasping)

1608
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,368
And I'd think fast.

1609
01:35:57,435 --> 01:36:00,268
I just sort of wish
you were doing this for me.

1610
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:04,531
You're a good guy, Troy.

1611
01:36:06,778 --> 01:36:11,716
And actually, right now, I think
I like you better than I like myself.

1612
01:36:11,784 --> 01:36:13,581
Did I just say that?

1613
01:36:18,624 --> 01:36:21,024
SHARPAY: Girls! Places!

1614
01:36:40,814 --> 01:36:45,548
- Okay. Everyone. Ryan, the show's on.
- Where's the music? Where's Troy?

1615
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:47,451
Talked to Sharpay, everything's cool.

1616
01:36:47,555 --> 01:36:51,719
Hey, speaking of my sister,
she wants you to learn a new song.

1617
01:36:51,793 --> 01:36:54,956
Everyday. I can't learn a new song!

1618
01:36:55,063 --> 01:36:57,964
- Kelsi will help you with it.
- What?

1619
01:36:58,066 --> 01:37:00,466
- It's showtime!
- Yeah!

1620
01:37:00,568 --> 01:37:02,126
Chad: What team?
ALL: Wildcats!

1621
01:37:02,236 --> 01:37:03,761
- What team?
- Wildcats!

1622
01:37:03,839 --> 01:37:05,636
- What team?
- Wildcats!

1623
01:37:16,452 --> 01:37:19,649
(SINGING) Once in a lifetime.

1624
01:37:19,721 --> 01:37:23,283
And now it's time for our five-time.

1625
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,624
Star Dazzle Award winner,
Miss Sharpay Evans,

1626
01:37:26,696 --> 01:37:31,998
singing this year with
our assistant golf pro, Mr. Troy Bolton.

1627
01:37:34,237 --> 01:37:36,330
Where is Troy?

1628
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:40,366
- Hey. Why did you switch songs?
- Switch songs? What?

1629
01:37:40,478 --> 01:37:43,743
- Yeah, Ryan said...
- FULTON: Bolton!

1630
01:37:43,848 --> 01:37:48,046
- But I didn't learn a new song.
- Exactly.

1631
01:37:53,424 --> 01:37:54,652
Girls!

1632
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:08,537
(SINGING) Once in a lifetime.

1633
01:38:08,607 --> 01:38:12,704
Means there's no second chance.

1634
01:38:12,778 --> 01:38:17,010
So I believe that you and me.

1635
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:21,383
Should grab it while we can.

1636
01:38:21,454 --> 01:38:25,185
Gabriella: Make it last forever.

1637
01:38:25,258 --> 01:38:29,592
And never give it back.

1638
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:35,896
It's our turn
and I'm loving where we're at.

1639
01:38:37,938 --> 01:38:44,366
BOTH: Because this moment's really
all we have.

1640
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:49,944
Every day of our lives.

1641
01:38:50,051 --> 01:38:54,078
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.

1642
01:38:54,222 --> 01:38:56,053
Gonna run.

1643
01:38:56,124 --> 01:39:02,393
While we're young
And keep the faith.

1644
01:39:02,497 --> 01:39:04,465
Every day.

1645
01:39:04,566 --> 01:39:06,728
From right now.

1646
01:39:06,802 --> 01:39:10,761
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud.

1647
01:39:10,839 --> 01:39:12,830
Take my hand.

1648
01:39:12,942 --> 01:39:16,844
Together we will celebrate.

1649
01:39:16,946 --> 01:39:18,106
Celebrate.

1650
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:21,946
Oh, every day

1651
01:39:23,153 --> 01:39:25,087
(wildcats cheering)

1652
01:39:28,091 --> 01:39:32,152
They say that you should follow.

1653
01:39:32,262 --> 01:39:35,789
And chase down what you dream.

1654
01:39:35,865 --> 01:39:40,530
But if you get lost and lose yourself.

1655
01:39:40,638 --> 01:39:43,163
What does it really mean?

1656
01:39:44,675 --> 01:39:47,337
No matter where we're going.

1657
01:39:47,445 --> 01:39:52,473
Oh, yeah, it starts from where we are.

1658
01:39:53,217 --> 01:39:54,684
There's more to life.

1659
01:39:54,785 --> 01:40:00,816
When we listen to our hearts.

1660
01:40:00,892 --> 01:40:07,730
And because of you
I've got the strength to start.

1661
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:09,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1662
01:40:09,534 --> 01:40:13,470
Every day of our lives.

1663
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:17,635
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.

1664
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:19,405
Gonna run.

1665
01:40:19,512 --> 01:40:24,745
While we're young
And keep the faith.

1666
01:40:25,151 --> 01:40:28,052
Oh, every day.

1667
01:40:28,154 --> 01:40:30,179
From right now.

1668
01:40:30,256 --> 01:40:34,387
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud.

1669
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,486
Take my hand.

1670
01:40:36,563 --> 01:40:40,522
Together we will celebrate.

1671
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,498
Oh, every day.

1672
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:47,506
We're taking it back
We're doing it here together.

1673
01:40:47,574 --> 01:40:51,705
It's better like that
And stronger now than ever.

1674
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,680
We're not gonna lose.

1675
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:59,653
'Cause we get to choose
That's how it's gonna be.

1676
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:03,417
Every day of our lives.

1677
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:07,758
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.

1678
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:09,821
Gonna run.

1679
01:41:09,932 --> 01:41:16,167
While we're young
And keep the faith.

1680
01:41:16,272 --> 01:41:20,333
Keep the faith.

1681
01:41:20,443 --> 01:41:24,436
Every day of our lives.

1682
01:41:24,513 --> 01:41:28,678
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.

1683
01:41:28,785 --> 01:41:30,776
Gonna run.

1684
01:41:30,854 --> 01:41:35,917
While we're young
And keep the faith.

1685
01:41:35,992 --> 01:41:37,152
Oh, yeah.

1686
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,125
- Every day.
- Every day.

1687
01:41:39,196 --> 01:41:41,255
From right now.

1688
01:41:41,331 --> 01:41:45,428
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud.

1689
01:41:45,503 --> 01:41:47,528
- Take my hand.
- Take my hand.

1690
01:41:47,638 --> 01:41:52,371
Together we will celebrate.

1691
01:41:53,778 --> 01:41:57,179
- Every day.
- Oh, every day.

1692
01:41:57,281 --> 01:42:01,548
Oh, oh, every day.

1693
01:42:01,653 --> 01:42:05,714
Oh, every day.

1694
01:42:07,159 --> 01:42:09,491
Every day.

1695
01:42:09,561 --> 01:42:13,327
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I'm singing every day.

1696
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:15,299
Every day.

1697
01:42:15,367 --> 01:42:17,232
Every day.

1698
01:42:17,336 --> 01:42:20,670
Every day.

1699
01:42:22,008 --> 01:42:23,908
Every day.

1700
01:42:25,345 --> 01:42:27,245
Every day.

1701
01:42:28,081 --> 01:42:31,414
Every day.

1702
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:34,248
Yeah.

1703
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:48,665
Just fabulous! Fabulous!

1704
01:42:48,736 --> 01:42:51,705
Well. If you'll all
please take your seats.

1705
01:42:51,772 --> 01:42:55,231
I have one last task
to perform this evening.

1706
01:42:55,343 --> 01:43:02,044
The Star Dazzle for this year goes to,
of course, our one and only...

1707
01:43:02,117 --> 01:43:05,450
My brother, Ryan Evans!

1708
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:07,078
(All cheering)

1709
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:15,887
That's our boy!

1710
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,567
Fix the hat.

1711
01:43:28,312 --> 01:43:30,280
Gabriella: (SIN GIN G) Yeah.

1712
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:34,248
You are the music in me.

1713
01:43:35,986 --> 01:43:39,319
You know the words
"Once upon a time"

1714
01:43:39,623 --> 01:43:41,716
Make you listen

1715
01:43:41,925 --> 01:43:45,487
there's a reason.

1716
01:43:45,597 --> 01:43:48,998
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find.

1717
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:54,094
A little laughter, or happy ever after.

1718
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:59,109
Gabriella AND Troy:
You're harmony to the melody.

1719
01:43:59,177 --> 01:44:02,908
That's echoing inside my head.

1720
01:44:03,249 --> 01:44:04,773
A single voice above the noise.

1721
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:09,617
- Here's to the future.
- No. Here's to right now.

1722
01:44:09,688 --> 01:44:11,986
And like a common thread.

1723
01:44:12,157 --> 01:44:14,125
You're pulling me.

1724
01:44:14,193 --> 01:44:19,358
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.

1725
01:44:19,498 --> 01:44:22,866
Oh, you are the music in me.

1726
01:44:23,103 --> 01:44:25,970
Yeah, it's living in all of us.

1727
01:44:26,139 --> 01:44:29,131
And it's brought us here because.

1728
01:44:29,209 --> 01:44:32,838
- Because you are the music in me.
- Because you are the music in me.

1729
01:44:36,716 --> 01:44:38,981
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1730
01:44:39,053 --> 01:44:41,886
You are the music in me.

1731
01:44:42,323 --> 01:44:47,226
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.

1732
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:51,856
You are the music in me.

1733
01:44:51,933 --> 01:44:54,367
It's living in all of us.

1734
01:44:54,435 --> 01:44:57,530
And it's brought us here because.

1735
01:44:57,706 --> 01:45:01,107
You are the music in me.

1736
01:45:07,115 --> 01:45:10,209
You are the music in me.

1737
01:45:10,586 --> 01:45:12,247
Chad: (SINGING) One, two, three, four.

1738
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:39,476
The summer that we wanted.

1739
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,073
Yeah, we've finally got it.

1740
01:45:41,151 --> 01:45:43,984
Now's the time we get to share.

1741
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:45,817
Each day we'll be together.

1742
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:47,447
Now until forever.

1743
01:45:47,558 --> 01:45:50,653
So everybody everywhere.

1744
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:53,754
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together.

1745
01:45:53,832 --> 01:45:56,995
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another.

1746
01:45:57,102 --> 01:46:00,071
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other.

1747
01:46:00,138 --> 01:46:02,834
Everything's just right.

1748
01:46:02,941 --> 01:46:05,603
Everybody, all for one.

1749
01:46:05,678 --> 01:46:09,136
Our real summer has just begun.

1750
01:46:09,515 --> 01:46:12,848
Let's rock and roll, and just let go.

1751
01:46:12,952 --> 01:46:15,011
Feel the rhythm of the drums.

1752
01:46:15,521 --> 01:46:18,422
We're gonna have fun in the sun.

1753
01:46:18,491 --> 01:46:22,450
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.

1754
01:46:22,528 --> 01:46:27,023
Everybody one for all
And all for one.

1755
01:46:27,134 --> 01:46:31,093
- All for one.
- All for one, one.

1756
01:46:32,372 --> 01:46:33,839
Summertime together.

1757
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,430
Now we're even closer.

1758
01:46:35,509 --> 01:46:38,205
That's the way it's meant to be.

1759
01:46:38,311 --> 01:46:40,176
Oh, we're just getting started.

1760
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,873
Come and join the party.

1761
01:46:41,983 --> 01:46:45,043
You deserve it same as me.

1762
01:46:45,153 --> 01:46:48,213
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together.

1763
01:46:48,322 --> 01:46:51,450
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another.

1764

We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other.

1765
01:46:54,562 --> 01:46:57,224
Everything's just right.

1766
01:46:57,331 --> 01:47:00,062
Everybody, all for one.

1767
01:47:00,169 --> 01:47:03,866
Our real summer has just begun.

1768
01:47:03,972 --> 01:47:07,806
Let's rock and roll, and just let go.

1769

Feel the rhythm of the drums.

01:47:09,812 --> 01:47:12,872
We're gonna have fun in the sun.

01:47:12,981 --> 01:47:16,850
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.

Everybody one for all
And all for one.

01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,250
Everybody up.

1774
01:47:25,361 --> 01:47:26,851
Everybody rock it.

1775
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,261
Take it from the top.

1776
01:47:28,364 --> 01:47:29,888
And never ever stop it.

1777
01:47:29,999 --> 01:47:31,591
It's not about the future.

1778
01:47:31,701 --> 01:47:33,100
It's not about the past.

1779
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:36,696
It's making every single day
Last and last and last.

1780
01:47:36,774 --> 01:47:39,572
Fun and sun
What could be better?

1781
01:47:42,847 --> 01:47:46,613
Let's have fun
Everyone together now.

1782
01:47:46,717 --> 01:47:49,277
Everybody, everybody now.

1783
01:47:49,386 --> 01:47:53,414
This is where our summer
really begins.

1784
01:47:55,627 --> 01:48:01,793
The very last time
it's ever gonna be like this.

1785
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:05,267
It's a party you don't wanna miss.

1786
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:08,465
Guys, show them
we can make some moves, hey.

1787
01:48:08,574 --> 01:48:11,737
Girls, show them
we know how to groove, oh.

1788
01:48:11,811 --> 01:48:13,039
- Here.
- And now.

1789
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:14,943
- Let's turn the party.
- Out.

1790
01:48:15,047 --> 01:48:17,413
Everybody jump in.

1791
01:48:17,483 --> 01:48:20,179
Everybody, all for one.

1792
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:23,153
Our real summer has just begun.

Let's rock and roll, and just let go.

Feel the rhythm of the drums.

1795
01:48:30,030 --> 01:48:32,999
We're gonna have fun in the sun.

1796
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:36,968
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.

1797
01:48:37,037 --> 01:48:39,699
Everybody one for all.

1798
01:48:39,807 --> 01:48:43,106
Everybody, all for one.

1799
01:48:46,381 --> 01:48:49,782
Let's rock and roll, and just let go.

1800
01:48:49,851 --> 01:48:52,217
Feel the rhythm of the drums.

1801
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,380
We're gonna have fun in the sun.

1802
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:59,221
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.

1803
01:48:59,327 --> 01:49:02,525
Come on, everyone, let's dance.

1804
01:49:02,631 --> 01:49:05,828
We can't let the moment pass.

1805
01:49:05,901 --> 01:49:09,860
Let's make the party last.

1806
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:11,831
All for one.

1807
01:49:11,907 --> 01:49:14,239
All for one

1808
01:49:14,343 --> 01:49:15,970
(all cheering)

1809
01:49:28,592 --> 01:49:29,718
Yeah!

1810
01:49:40,872 --> 01:49:43,272
Coral blue!
It's totally like your skin tone.

1811
01:49:45,042 --> 01:49:47,772
And mine, too! We are majorly
skin-tone compatible, Troy.

1812
01:49:47,879 --> 01:49:49,506
My daughter.

1813
01:49:58,624 --> 01:50:00,592
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!

1814
01:50:04,096 --> 01:50:05,120
(Stammering)

1815
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:15,572
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.

1816
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:17,967
Oops.

1817
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:19,543
If we live that long.

1818
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:24,408
For you.

1819
01:50:24,717 --> 01:50:25,775
MAN: Cut!

1820
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:29,313
Troy!

1821
01:50:33,327 --> 01:50:35,158
(Stepping on gas pedal)

1822
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:50,975
- Put it in forward.
- It is!
