DFU, EGYPT
A REALLY LONG TIME AGO

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,916
RIGHT BEFORE LUNCH

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,912
<i>(woman)</i> Ema Hesire,
I know you're in there.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,636
The wedding has been all arranged.

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,948
Oh, please, gods.
Please get me out of this.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,358
You turned down the jeweller,
the grain merchant.

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,710
You turned down
the Pharaoh's food taster.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,992
There's only one man left who'll have you.
You are going to marry Hazzi-ra.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,554
So what does he do?

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,910
He's a fuel merchant.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,508
- Mother.
- All right, so he sells camel dung.

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,949
- Forget it.
- You forget it!

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,755
Mother, I don't want to settle down.
I want to do things, invent things.

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,839
I want to try things that nobody's
ever tried before. I want to fly.

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,032
And I want to smoke
and tell your father to go to hell.

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,280
Oh, Emmy, Emmy!

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,188
If I thought we women
could in any way change anything,

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,276
don't you think I'd encourage you?

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,198
No, no, no, no.
These are the times we live in.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,470
Mother, there's got to be a better way.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,751
Please, gods. Please help me find it.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,078
The Nile is overflowing.
There is a wheat shortage.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,156
The Pharaoh has haemorrhoids.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,431
The gods have bigger things
to worry about than you.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,434
Whoa!

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,916
Emmy! Oh!

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,479
Emmy? Emmy?

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,589
Oh, Emmy.

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,199
Oh.

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,112
Watch yourself, ma'am.

154
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,956
I got it!

155
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,036
Maybe.

156
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,872
- Young man, I'm sorry!
- No, that's... Oh! No problem.

157
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,793
Aah! Oh!

158
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,754
- If I can make it up to you in any way...
- Yeah! I could use a job!

159
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,917
- What do you do?
- Anything.

160
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,157
- When can you start?
- Uh... As soon as I finish this.

161
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,396
Yoo-hoo, young man! What's your name?

162
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,512
- My name? Uh, Jonathan Switcher.
- You're hired!

163
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,632
Thank you. My lucky day.

164
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,438
Every time I walk through these doors,
I feel like I'm home.

165
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,516
I practically grew up here.

166
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,830
Greta Garbo used to get
her make-up right over there.

167
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,111
Of course, you probably
don't know who Greta Garbo is.

168
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,073
Sure I do. <i>Ninotchka, Grand Hotel.</i>

169
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,395
I don't sleep much at night.

170
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,957
Neither do I. At least, not in the two weeks
since I've been in charge here.

171
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,959
I don't know how we're going
to make this store great again!

172
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,595
Looks fine to me. What time do we open?

173
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,436
We are open.

174
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,871
Oh.

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,878
Well, I... I'm sure
things'll pick up by lunch.

176
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,195
Yes. Uh... BJ, it's all going
according to plan.

177
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,470
I mean, it's like a ghost ship around here.

178
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,990
They're gonna be beggin'
to sell this place within a month.

179
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,554
No. No, Timkin is no threat.

180
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,868
Well... BJ. Beej. She's here.

181
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,359
Mr Richards, do you know
what this young man just did?

182
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,112
- Uh... Shoplifting?
- He saved my life.

183
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,800
Those incompetents you hired
nearly got me killed.

184
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,195
If I were paranoid,
I'd swear this was sabotage.

185
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,357
Claire, it's not as if I was
turning away Harvard graduates.

186
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,597
If you know someone
you feel is qualified to work here...

187
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,429
Yes! Jonathan Switcher!
Let's show him our gratitude.

188
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,159
- Well, five dollars should do it.
- No, no. I want you to give him a job.

189
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,236
Take good care of him.

190
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,676
Well, uh... Switcher?

191
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,513
What kind of work experience
have you had?

192
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,553
Oh, I've had just about
every job there is. Briefly.

193
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,388
I'd like to do something creative.
Maybe with, say, mannequins.

194
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,877
Please. Uh, listen. I pride myself
on being able to size up a job applicant

195
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,231
and see just what kind
of executive potential he has.

196
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,072
I have just the job for you.

197
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,517
<i>(Roxie) So you got a new job.</i>
<i>That's terrific. What is it?</i>

198
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,518
Let's just say that thousands
of dollars of merchandise

199
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,756
go through my hands every day.

200
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,839
- I'm takin' you for a celebration dinner.
- Those panties, up to Lingerie.

201
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,793
- Panties. Right. I'm into it.
- Did you say "panties"?

202
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,480
- Panties?
- I can't talk now. Pick you up at eight.

203
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,556
- <i>See you then.</i>
- Bye.

204
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,231
I've seen him pick you up.
That little... pissant!

205
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,239
You can't tell me
that he's satisfying you sexually.

206
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,035
- That's none of your business.
- I would like to make it my business.

207
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,755
I would love to sink my teeth
into your... little bottom.

208
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,836
What? What, what?

209
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,830
Did Armand say something bad?
Forgive me!

210
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,918
English and me, it's new.
My tongue, it slides.

211
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,271
Look, our relationship
is strictly business. You got that?

212
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,157
Yes. Of course. I have some reports
to get out by noon o'clock.

213
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,596
Agh!

214
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,793
- See anything you like?
- Just lookin' for panties.

215
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,233
You found them. However, you missed
the lingerie department by four floors.

216
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,510
- Well, get going.
- Right.

217
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,238
Asshole.

218
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,316
What was that?

219
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,795
Oh, nice hall.

220
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,596
I must be losin' my mind.

221
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,158
I guess all artists fall in love with their
creations, but you just seem so... special.

222
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,550
Oh! Well, roll over Bill Shakespeare!

223
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,989
That is the sweetest sentiment
I ever heard.

224
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,874
- Uh, no, no. I was rehearsing a play.
- I always find it best not to explain.

225
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,390
It adds a certain mystique
to one's reputation.

226
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,429
No, no. No. I'm...
I'm a regular kind of guy, OK?

227
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,998
Don't disappoint me.
When you finish your conversation,

228
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,997
please bring her to window three.

229
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,510
Sure. You got it. I'm Jonathan Switcher.

230
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,677
Hollywood. Hollywood Montrose.

231
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,791
Whoo! Doesn't it just sing?

232
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,309
Oh, it sings, yeah.

233
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,591
I'm a window-dresser here.
We're going to have fun, fun, fun!

234
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,790
I am so glad you're working here!

235
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,955
- You are?
- Why, of course I am, honey.

236
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,629
I never thought they'd hire
anyone stranger than me.

237
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,996
<i>(hums)</i>

238
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,436
- <i>(dog growls)</i>
- Oh!

239
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,228
Halt!

240
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,432
- Identify yourself.
- Jonathan Switcher. New stock boy.

241
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,755
Yeah. Mr Richards told me all about you.

242
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,758
I am Captain Felix Maxwell,
night security commander.

243
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,477
It is my responsibility to secure the
perimeter here at... Prince and Company.

244
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,070
I didn't know there was
danger of invasion.

245
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,432
There's no danger of nothing
as long as me and Rambo are on patrol.

246
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,835
- Rambo?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,193
I call him that
because he likes to draw... first blood.

248
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,073
Just what is your assignment
here tonight, boy?

249
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,833
- I'm helping Hollywood with the window.
- Oh, the little Mary has an assistant, huh?

250
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,633
- Where do you people come from?
- Ohio.

251
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,990
- Ohio?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,156
You mean they got 'em in Ohio?

253
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,076
So, you like your new assignment?

254
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,749
Could have been worse. Could have
put me on with a bigoted jerk.

255
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,998
Hold it there, boy!
Did you have anybody particular in mind?

256
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,597
Do you think he meant
anybody in particular, Rambo?

257
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,672
Oh, don't let Felix get to you.
He just has a bad case of <i>Miami V)ice.</i>

258
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,998
Listen, I gotta go, OK? I promised my
girlfriend I was gonna take her out, OK?

259
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,749
- <i>(screams)</i>
- What? What happened? What did I say?

260
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,879
Albert left me, the bitch.
He said my thighs are too fat.

261
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,831
- Do my thighs look too fat to you?
- No.

262
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,236
- You didn't look!
- I don't know about men's thighs.

263
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,511
- They look fine to me. They really do.
- Thank you.

264
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,910
Albert called me Cellulite City.

265
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,079
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I should have my hips lifted.

266
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,510
- If you wanna lose weight, just... diet.
- Oh, diets are no use.

267
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,837
It's those jelly doughnuts.
They call to me in the night.

268
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,670
"Hollywood! Come and get me,
Hollywood!" I can't stay away from them.

269
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,952
- Like you and women's dressing rooms.
- No, no. That was a misunderstanding.

270
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,310
Have any of your friends
been vacuumed out?

271
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,398
I heard those doctors
in Beverly Hills just open you up

272
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,830
- and suck those fat cells outta there!
- It... it sounds nice.

273
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,358
I wonder if there's any way you could do
it yourself with a vacuum cleaner. Oh!

274
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,550
<i>(sobs)</i>

275
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,876
Albert's been off work for an hour.
There's no telling what he's...

276
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,151
Hollywood, Hollywood.
Hey, hey. Take it easy, OK?

277
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,192
Just go home and get yourself
some rest. You'll be fine.

278
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,676
An artiste does not
leave his work unfinished.

279
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,030
No, it looks fine to me.

280
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,515
In that case, I'm a dream that once was.

281
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,913
Look out, Albert,
because Hollywood is on your case!

282
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,996
- Yeah! Go get 'im.
- Oh!

283
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,356
Good grief.

284
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,430
What's the matter?
Don't you like your new scarf?

285
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,516
Not especially.

286
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,632
- What a funny way to say hello.
- What the hell's going on?

287
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,192
My name is Ema Hesire,
but you can call me Emmy.

288
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,475
This is a joke, right? Some sort
of Prince and Company initiation?

289
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,195
- Who hired you? Hollywood?
- Nobody, Jonathan. You know who I am.

290
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,311
No, no. This can't be happening.

291
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,269
The sign! The electricity.
My brain synapses were destroyed.

292
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,712
I felt so sorry for you last night.
You looked so lost and lonely.

293
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,836
Last night you saw me?
Oh, no. You can't be her.

294
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,589
While making me,
didn't you feel inspiration,

295
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,518
like your hands were moved
by a force not of this world?

296
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,108
You made this body
so that I could come to life!

297
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,869
Tell me, am I
in the twilight zone or just nuts?

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,915
- I'm so glad I picked you.
- I'd create someone who doesn't like me?

299
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,918
Tell me your life story.
It seems to have slipped my mind.

300
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,192
It's a long story.
I was born in 2514 BC, in Edfu, Egypt.

301
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,108
- I'll be 4,501 next April.
- I'll bake a cake.

302
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,391
I couldn't do anything. Know
who my parents wanted me to marry?

303
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,476
- Who?
- A camel-dung dealer.

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,116
That would have been my guess.
It's stress.

305
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,629
I'm having a hallucination
caused by stress.

306
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,149
Does this feel like a hallucination?

307
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,236
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

308
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,194
Food additives. It's food additives.

309
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,470
Jonathan! Come on!

310
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,395
<i>(TV)) Except for early morning clouds,</i>
<i>the weather for the Philadelphia area...</i>

311
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,476
Damn him.

312
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,636
Oh! Oh!

313
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,874
- What I could have done with these toys!
- You like to work with your hands?

314
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,028
Oh, yes. I love to build and invent things.
Back in Edfu I even made a pair of wings.

315
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,310
- And I'm sure you flew.
- That's right!

316
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,235
Well, almost.

317
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,510
You still don't believe I'm real, do you?

318
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,796
Uh... I'm open for discussion.

319
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,319
<i>(nails ricochet)</i>

320
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,476
Why don't we stick to good old-fashioned
hand tools for the time being, OK?

321
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,676
- You've got good hands.
- Thank you.

322
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,713
I like the way they felt
when you were putting me together.

323
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,236
Tonight we'll do something different,

324
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,794
something this store
has never seen before.

325
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,151
- I wish you weren't so worried.
- Easy for you. You're a mannequin.

326
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,989
You'll always have work. Me? I'm gonna
wind up in the nuthouse after this.

327
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,918
Maybe insanity's covered
in the employee health plan.

328
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,759
That's the dress
I should wear in the window.

329
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,034
- Hey, don't do that.
- You weren't shy when you created me.

330
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,116
You weren't so real.

331
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,868
Good God. Who are you?

332
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,590
<i>(TV)) Oh, good morning, boys and girls.</i>
<i>I don't see Ziggy.</i>

333
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,870
<i>Oh, she's a big smiley elephant.</i>

334
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,953
Hey, hey! Roxie, you look foxy!
Can I ride you?

335
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,436
- I'll be walking to work, thank you.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

336
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,233
- Don't be silly. Don't be silly.
- Roxie! Wait!

337
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,238
I thought our plans were
for eight last night. My mistake.

338
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,873
I gotta talk to you.

339
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,753
- We have nothing to talk about.
- Take a hike, wussy pants.

340
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,714
Roxie, I think I'm going crazy.
I saw things I know couldn't happen.

341
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,956
Where were you?
Did you sleep in the street?

342
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,958
- Prince and Company.
- Prince and Company. Your big job!

343
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,150
You know the mannequin that I made?

344
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,272
She's there, and she came to life
and she knew who I was, OK?

345
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,198
You could have told me
you just decided to stand me up.

346
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,357
Instead, you come here
lying with this ridiculous story!

347
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,436
I'm not lying, I'm insane.

348
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,548
Armand, let's just get out of here.

349
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,273
Mom? When I was growing up,
did I ever do anything really strange?

350
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,558
Yeah, I know I was always different.
Let me ask you this.

351
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,389
Is there any history of insanity
in the family? I mean, Gran...

352
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,318
Grandma and Grandpa
weren't half-brother and sister?

353
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,036
No, I'm fine, Ma.
Well, you know, you're alone a lot.

354
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,754
You know, you start inventing things. Ow!

355
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,030
Women, you know, a beautiful woman.

356
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,516
Enough about me. How are you?
You ever have hallucinations?

357
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,114
Roxie, this is America. You do not
set the pace by redecorating.

358
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,312
- You demolish.
- Of course. I'll remember that.

359
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,592
We'll build the best Illustra yet
on that site. And when I move up,

360
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,077
someone will have
to take my place here, huh? Huh?

361
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,992
- I'll be keeping my eye on you, Roxie.
- BJ, BJ, BJ! You won't believe it.

362
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,351
Prince and Company has
the most incredible window.

363
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,118
I'm talking fab. People were
lined up outside to get a peek!

364
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,708
I passed through
on my way from a tanning session.

365
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,479
It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

366
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,198
- Really?
- Well, uh...

367
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,359
You know, it...
it really wasn't that great. It was...

368
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,190
Um, it was interesting...
in a jejune way at best.

369
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,714
I didn't care for it myself.

370
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,596
You know...

371
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,509
You should have seen it.
It was beyond brilliant.

372
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,757
There were 20 mannequins, with
tennis rackets coming out of...

373
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,555
Beej, he's just a twerpy stock boy.
That window was a fluke.

374
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,992
Well, when I move up, somebody will
have to take my place here, Richards.

375
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,715
But if you let that stock boy screw things
up, it sure as hell won't be you.

376
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,470
I have worked on this deal too long to
have it ruined by some snot-nosed punk.

377
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,795
I can handle him. I...

378
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,070
I meant you, Richards!

379
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,988
Of course you did, sir. But,
you know, the board meeting is today.

380
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,475
I guarantee the sale will go through.

381
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,639
And Illustra, under your inspired
leadership, will reach new heights.

382
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,036
Richards! Where in the hell
did you learn to kiss ass like that?

383
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,711
- Did you take a class?
- Oh, no, sir, no. That's a God-given gift.

384
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,555
<i>Beej? BJ, are you there?</i>

385
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,511
Mrs Timkin, what possessed Switcher
to create such a window display?

386
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,110
Did you see the crowds gaping on
the sidewalk? It's an embarrassment.

387
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,756
Never you fear. Your Hollywood is here!

388
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,077
Rumour Control has it the board
wants to fire your little behind.

389
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,431
Just let me at those so-and-sos.
I will straighten them out.

390
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,120
- How can they fire you?
- These are business people.

391
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,390
They won't appreciate
an emotional appeal.

392
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,548
You're right. I was hoping to avoid this,
but this is an hour of desperation.

393
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,910
This is not the way
to approach this, OK...

394
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,235
You don't think so?

395
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,514
Don't tell anyone you saw me dressed
like this. I have a reputation to uphold.

396
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,995
Buddy, I appreciate this demonstration...

397
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,910
Oh, that's it! A demonstration!
I will create a media event.

398
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,270
Call the newspapers.
The headline will read,

399
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,994
"If Jonathan is fired, Hollywood flies."

400
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,192
Excuse me while I step out
onto the window ledge.

401
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,390
No. Hollywood!

402
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,397
- Hollywood!
- Whoo! Ooh!

403
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,476
- Come on. Get off!
- Ooh!

404
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,630
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

405
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,751
- I get carried away sometimes.
- Not you!

406
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,235
Oh, that Richards!
He gives men a bad name.

407
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,796
- He said he would fix everything for me.
- Mm-hm.

408
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,996
What arrogance! That worm of a stock
boy has affronted the dignity of this store.

409
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,996
I'll have it taken down and make sure that
lunatic never works in this town again.

410
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,190
Shall we move on to the sale to Illustra?

411
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,950
Just a minute, Mr Richards.
I believe we're onto something here.

412
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,152
Maybe people will come to see
our bold new window displays,

413
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,555
and if they come to look,
they'll stay to buy.

414
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,319
With all due respect,
it's a little late for that,

415
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,556
and we do have
the firm offer from Illustra.

416
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,189
For one-tenth the value of the store.

417
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,312
Besides, I can't bear
the thought of selling this place,

418
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,476
especially to that awful BJ Wert.

419
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,514
We know how much
the store means to you, ma'am, but...

420
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,200
Well, ten per cent
is better than bankruptcy.

421
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,876
I think Mrs Timkin is right.

422
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,275
I move we postpone the sale
for six weeks.

423
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,835
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?

424
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,471
All opposed?

425
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,591
This meeting is adjourned.

426
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,430
- Harris, would you bring Mr Switcher in?
- What? No, wait. I think...

427
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,277
Jonathan, good news.
We've not only decided to keep you on,

428
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,233
but I'm promoting you
to visual merchandiser.

429
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,110
You're kidding! That's great! What is it?

430
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,872
Just keep doing what you did last night,
and you'll be fine.

431
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,072
Uh, Mrs Timkin...
I'm not sure I can do it again.

432
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,509
Last night may have been
a one-time inspiration.

433
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,108
Oh, Jonathan, don't doubt yourself.

434
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,119
Go with it. Feel it. You're doing
the job you were meant to do.

435
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,910
Well, you must lead a charmed life. It was
all I could do to save your skin in here.

436
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,155
No thanks are necessary, Switcher.

437
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,476
Oh!

438
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,677
Good evening, Mr Richards, sir.

439
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,272
Felix, that new stock boy,
Switcher, has been promoted.

440
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,517
He'll be doing windows at night.
Keep an eye on him for me.

441
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,919
You suspect pilferage, sir?
I'd be happy to strip-search him.

442
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,076
You people that work at night scare me.

443
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,556
I just want you to let me know
what he's up to, how he works.

444
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,831
Yes, sir. His MO.
Would you like that in a written report?

445

Oh, you write?

446
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,434
No. Rambo does.

447
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,150
- Just watch him.
- Yes, sir.

448
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,676
Come on, Rambo.

449
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,951
We have got ourselves... a mission.

<i>(sniffs)</i>

451
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,910
Jesus Christ, Rambo!

452
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,475
Hi, it's me. Jonathan. Remember?

453
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,557
Well, I guess
it was just temporary insanity.

454
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,073
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- Emmy! You're back! I thought...

455
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,670
You remind me of my old boyfriend Chris.
He had no confidence.

456
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,712
- Chris? Who's Chris?
- Oh, just a sailor.

457
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,071
I told him that the world was round
and I never saw him again.

458
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,070
Christopher Columbus?
You knew Christopher Columbus?

459
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,193
Uh-huh.

460
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,516
So, you didn't come directly from Edfu?

461
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,071
Oh, no. Along the way
I tried out different times and places.

462
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,509
None of them ever really seemed right.

463
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,473
Oh. You didn't happen
to run into Michelangelo?

464
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,149
Michelangelo. Michelangelo. Oh, yes!

465
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,957
Oh, he wasn't very interested in me.
He was involved with a guy named David.

466
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,036
- Come on!
- Were you there?

467
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,274
Mrs Timkin loved what you did last night,
but... they think I did it.

468
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,789
They want me to do more windows.
You gotta help me.

469
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,592
Of course.

470
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,631

- Stay there!

Yeah. Boy, they did a good job

00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,035
Yes, sir! I don't see what
this has to do with little Rambo.

595
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,594
Isn't it obvious
Switcher is behind all of this?

596
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,110
- That skunk!
- I mean, a man who is an eternal failure

597
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,834
is putting together
the best window displays in town.

598
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,996
The bum!

599
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,076
You say you hear voices. No one's there.

600
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,272
- Just him and his dummies.
- Is someone helping him?

601
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,153
Is he a ventriloquist?
Some kind of mad genius?

602
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,071
Good questions all, sir.

603
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,433
- Find out the answers!
- Yes, sir!

604
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,552
- What about little Rambo?
- Screw your dog!

605
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,157
<i>(whimpers)</i>

606
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,198
Let's go, people. Clear out.
Clear out, lady!

607
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,511
Come on, Rambo. Tonight we nail
that little fart blossom.

608
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,949
<i>On behalf of Captain Clark and the crew,</i>

609
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,275
<i>thank you for flying with Eastern.</i>

610
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,075
<i>We hope you enjoy</i>
<i>your fun- filled stay in the Caribbean.</i>

611
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,873
<i>(Emmy)</i> Oh, we deserve this vacation.

612
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,116
The sun feels pretty strong.

613
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,356
I could use some suntan lotion,

614
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,112
if someone were willing to rub it on.

615
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,158
Well, it's a dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

616
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,756
We are alone.

617
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,752
OK.

618
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,715
So, listen. We find him, get a picture
of whoever this woman is, and get out.

619
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,435
If we can't hire Jonathan,
maybe at least we can buy her out.

620
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,598
I don't know about you,
but I've always wanted to make love

621
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,599
in the ladies' shoe department.
The smell of fine leather!

622
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,112
Aah!

623
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,515
Can I show you something in your size?

624
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,518
What? You mean you took me serious?

625
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,031
Oh, you're gonna pay for that!

626
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,356
<i>(giggling)</i>

627
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,349
Mayday! Mayday, Rambo.

628
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,828
OK, boy! Oh, baby!
Now, show 'em what you're made of.

629
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,712
- Go get 'em!
- <i>(whimpers)</i>

630
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,070
Rambo! This way!

631
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,634
This means a court martial!

632
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,955
- You hear that? That must be them.
- I wish it was us.

633
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,799
Come on. We've got them.

634
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,438
- Give up?
- Never.

635
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,356
Oh!

636
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,755
Ooh, Switcher.

637
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,870
You are one sick puppy.

638
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,673
So this is the young lady
he dumped you for?

639
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,750
Nice.

640
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,430
Oh, beauteous.

641
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,313
I really should've listened
when he asked me for help.

642
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,189
Ooh! Tell me,
when you were making love to him,

643
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,600
did he ever scream "Don't stop, Woody"?

644
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,196
- Ooh! Aah!
- <i>(crash)</i>

645
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,038
Oh, my camera.

646
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,073
No, this is how I...
get my inspiration, I create.

647
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,998
I can tell by looking at you
you're not the artistic type.

648
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,557
You know, Mr Richards
told me to keep an eye on you.

649
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,755
But I think I'm gonna
handle things my own way.

650
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,115
You wanna move your sweetheart?

651
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,155
That one was for Rambo.

652
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,676
Aah! Switcher!

653
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,674
This is for my mama!

654
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,316
Oh, Switcher.

655
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,511
Ow!

656
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,309
Oh! Switcher, I'm gonna knock you
into the middle of next week!

657
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,035
- How'd you do that?
- I was behind him. He didn't see me.

658
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,275
Teach him to mess with
a man and his mannequin.

659
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,078
Hm. Huh. Hm-hm. Whoo!

660
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,315
Wow!

661
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,436
Hey! Where'd you go?

662
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,476
Emmy!

663
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,996
Emmy!

664
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,755
Emmy!

665
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,998
This is your last chance.
We take him or we die tryin'!

666
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,716
I did it! I flew! I really flew!

667
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,715
- Are you all right?
- Terrific! Incredible! I feel great!

668
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,796
Did you see how high I was?

669
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,796
- I just had a thought.
- Hm?

670
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,912
You think we should name
our first kid Pinocchio?

671
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,353
Jonathan, are you really sure
this is right for you?

672
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,436
I'm positive.

673
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,432
What about you?
You've waited a long time.

674
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,469
How do you know you're not missing
something better 5,000 years from now?

675
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,910
There could never be anything
better than being here with you.

676
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,749
This is one guy
who's never gonna leave your side.

677
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,916
The window!

678
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,156
Come on, come on.

679
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,150
- It's almost sunrise. We can't finish.
- Don't worry about a thing.

680
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,635
We'll never dress the mannequins in time.

681
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,716
That's right.

682
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,836
Absolutely scintillating. Beyond genius.

683
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,916
It sucks.

684
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,996
Fool.

685
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,356
<i>(snoring)</i>

686
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,998
Well, I don't believe it's lunch yet.
Let's not dally.

687
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,276
Felix!

688
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,277
- What happened?
- Well, why don't you tell me?

689
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,478
- Where's Rambo?
<i>- (whimpers)</i>

690
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,079
It's that Switcher. I caught him doing
awful things to a half-naked dummy.

691
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,395
Is this your idea of a security guard?

692
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,274
- Claire, I assure you, I had nothing...
- You hired him, you fire him.

693
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,595
Well, what if he's telling the truth?

694
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,310
How can you think that?

695
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,716
The man is a lunatic,
but I've never known him to lie.

696
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,068
He's right.

697
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,192
Mr Richards, this store has
never been more successful

698
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,276
and it's all due to Jonathan Switcher.

699
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,756
He can put a rubber glove on his head
and run naked through the store,

700
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,270
- yelling "Hi, I'm a squid!"
- Hi. Morning, Mrs T.

701
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,356
Oh, hello, Jonathan.

702
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,392
This morning's window
is your most brilliant yet.

703
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,308
- Thank you. What happened here?
- God only knows.

704
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,797
Felix, did you try and take Omaha beach
all by yourself again?

705
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,832
- I was doing what Mr Richards told me.
- I never said...

706
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,359
Oh, is that right?

707
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,870
Well, Richards, when you take Felix
to get his last paycheck,

708
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,797
get your own as well.

709
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,878
Uh, Mrs Timkin,
you may be our grande dame,

710
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,551
but I've had serious doubts about
a woman your age running this store.

711
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,514
- I'll appeal to the board.
- I can't see you appealing to anybody.

712
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,349
Don't mess with this old chick, mister.
Just pack it up!

713
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,436
Jonathan, let's go.

714
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,558
Get that dog outta the tree, huh?

715
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,913
Hey! You can't do this!
We'll file a grievance with the union!

716
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,600
We're not in a union, you idiot.

717
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,909
Oh, hi there, Jonathan.
I didn't know you were in there.

718
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,713
- Excuse me.
- Oh, that's lovely.

719
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,795
Mm-hm.

720
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,639
<i>(Wert)</i> What the hell
are you people doing, huh?

721
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,549
Have you seen the latest figures,
children, huh? Huh? Have you?

722
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:47,117
89 per cent! Sales are down 89 per cent!

723
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,999
Prince and Company
is going through the roof!

724
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,510
All right.
Now, I want this to stop, children.

725
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,234
And if it doesn't, so help me, God,

726
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,316
you are all dead meat!

727
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,269
Jonathan, it is my honour to inform you
that, starting Monday morning,

728
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,756
you will be the youngest vice president
ever at Prince and Company.

729
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,269
- Congratulations.
- <i>(all)</i> Hear, hear.

730
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,428
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you."

731
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,109
- Thank you. Thank you!
- Long live Prince and... Company.

732
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,991
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,036
Son of a gun.

734
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,355
So, Richards was telling the truth.

735
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,310
I've been in this business 20 years.

736
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,433
Hell, half the guys in this store
probably wear lace underwear.

737
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,516
But this!

738
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,828
We're talking a Sunday drive
into some serious dementia.

739
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,916
Well.

740
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,157
- It's our move now.
- BJ, I would do anything for Illustra,

741
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,239
but these pictures,
they could kind of ruin his life.

742
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,075
Roxie, I'd never ruin anyone's life.

743
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,072
Well, I would,
but only if it were absolutely necessary.

744
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,670
Now, Roxie, you're not developing
a conscience on me, are you?

745
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,756
No. I don't think so.

746
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,070
Good. Anyway, I don't wanna ruin his life.

747
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,679
I just wanna hire him, and, uh...

748
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,310
now I know how.

749
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,236
Hey, Gordon.

750
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,718
- Oh, Mrs Thomas. Hi.
- Please, Jonathan. It's all yours.

751
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,753
- Thanks. Men's room's broken.
- Of course, dear. Whatever you say.

752
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,075
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

753
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,873
You won't believe what Mrs Timkin
and the board just told me.

754
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,595
- Vice president.
- Oh! Jonathan, that's wonderful!

755
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,632
Tina! Lupe!
He's talking to the dummy again.

756
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,510
Nobody deserves it more. I knew
something like this would happen.

757
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,873
Creative freedom, practically my own
boss. Maybe some World Series tickets.

758
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,509
I'm sorry. I'm going on and on.
You know I couldn't do this without you.

759
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,200
I won't take the job
unless we can be together.

760
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,757
Jonathan, you can't worry
about what will happen to us.

761
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,356
What does that mean?

762
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,596
Girls, please, let's not be catty.

763
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,792
I will not tolerate eavesdropping
unless I'm a part of it.

764
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,797
I assume my Jonathan is in there.

765
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,196
You can't go in. He's got company,
if you know what I mean.

766
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,073
And who do you think introduced them?

767
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,277
- She'll never say your hips are too fat.
- Oh, Hollywood! Jeez! Listen...

768
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,912
You know I would never bother you
when you're getting a piece of wood.

769
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,838
But this is <i>muy importante.</i>
Your Hollywood needs help.

770
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,918
- Oh, what's up?
- I need your creative muse.

771
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,393
I've always thought of myself as hot stuff.
The very, very best at what I do.

772
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,751
But seeing you... Let's just say it. I am dirt.

773
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,396
Mould me. Shape me. I'm a fast learner.

774
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,191
Oh, please, Jonathan. Do not let them
turn me out into that dark night, alone.

775
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,198
Hollywood, we can talk
about designs and stuff,

776
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,390
but when I work, I gotta work alone.

777
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,635
Of course. I understand perfectly.

778
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,758
You're an artiste, and that's
the way you work. I can respect that.

779
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,392
Jesus. Hollywood, listen. Don't worry.

780
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,274
You can work as long as you want here.
I'm a vice president now.

781
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,431
- Who's crying?
- It's either our new vice president,

782
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,357
the fairy, or the dummy.

783
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,596
<i>(wailing)</i>

784
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,352
Emmy, please. You gotta help me.

785
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,632
I can't come alive in front of Hollywood.
Besides, you can do it on your own.

786
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,115
But we're a team.
We do everything together.

787
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:18,951
You can't hold yourself back because of
me. Now come on. Hollywood's waiting.

788
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,355
You'll do a masterpiece tonight.

789
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,675
Emmy...

790
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,636
I'll be waiting in the window.

791
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,594
Jonathan, how about a picture.
Mom will think I've switched.

792
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,997
- Hollywood, you're a genius.
- I am? Well, yes!

793
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,157
- OK, we need to make a list.
- Fire away.

794
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,876
- Uh, 30 feet of black nylon cord.
- Ow! Sounds like my kinda list!

795
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,956
Easy, sugar. Uh... OK.

796
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,916
You personally vouch for this guy?

797
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,995
He's worked at Prince and Company
for 15 years. I think he'll be just fine.

798
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,236
I mean, he's an imbecile, but...

799
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,436
Oh, this is him.

800
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,599
Felix, come in. This is Mr BJ Wert.

801
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,154
Well, Mr Wert, sir!

802
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,435
It's fine.

803
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,075
Felix, there are hundreds of mannequins
at Prince and Company.

804
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,639
Could you identify the one Jonathan
Switcher has a... romantic interest in?

805
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,673
Oh, absolutely, sir. I never forget
a name or a face, Mr Nertz.

806
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,831
Good. Well, Felix, we need your help.

807
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,829
And if you succeed, you will have
a cushy new job, right here at Illustra.

808
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,988
We want to get Switcher's mannequin out
of the store and bring her here, secretly.

809
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,119
Oh! A covert operation.

810
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,516
I would be happy and proud
to lead this mission, sir.

811
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,835
Good!

812
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,673
It's the most beautiful
window I've ever seen.

813
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,314
- It's all you, you know.
- Not this time.

814
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,750
Every time. You're part of me now.
I've got you in here.

815
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,750
Come on. You ready to go?

816
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,633
- Are you really sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

817
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,275
You've been cooped up in the store
too long. Who cares what people think?

818
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,916
Just put your arms around me
and hold on tight.

819
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,712
With pleasure.

820
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,195
Jonathan!

821
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,436
Look, Jonathan, I...

822
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,677
- I know about your problem.
- What problem?

823
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,951
You're riding around town
with a mannequin on your motorcycle.

824
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,036
What is wrong with this picture?

825
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,314
Oh, right. You two haven't met.
Roxie, this is Emmy. Emmy, Roxie.

826
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,200
Nice to meet...
Oh, my God. What am I saying?

827
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,279
Jonathan, I wanna give you one
last chance. Now, come to Illustra!

828
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,278
What is in this for you, Roxie?
An office with a view?

829
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,235
I don't need Illustra. Or you.
I got friends here, people who care.

830
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,912
And someone who makes me
feel good about myself.

831
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,395
Bye, Roxie.

832
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,078
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- You'll be sorry!

833
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,077
You're making a big mistake!

834
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,270
Roxie.

835
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,960
He's out of his mind! BJ was right.

836
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,719
When I get that dummy,
I'm gonna tear her hair out!

837
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,839
Roxie, Roxie, Roxie.
You know what you need to do right now?

838
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,918
You need to put him and
this nasty affair out of your mind.

839
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,510
Now, how is the best way
to do that? Huh? Huh?

840
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,598
By having a night of distasteable sex

841
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,314
with someone you care
absolutely nothing about.

842
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,671
And proudly,
I would like to be that person.

843
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,791
Fine. Let's just go to your place.

844
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,151
- Really?
- Drive fast before I have second thoughts.

845
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,195
Armand is the wind.

846
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,315
Hey, Mr Richards. You better
put some camouflage on, sir.

847
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,671
I am not going to put shoe polish
on my face, thank you.

848
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,789
Now could we please
get into the store, Felix?

849
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,396
Yes, sir.

850
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,749
- Oh! Look at him with the dummy.
- Who are you to criticise?

851
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,436
It's him! It's her! Ooh, that little prevert!
He's stealing her before we can!

852
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:00,519
Let's not do anything rash. We'll follow
and find the right moment to grab her.

853
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,552
Don't worry. I'm an expert at surveillance.

854
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,557
Hang on!

855
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,755
- Where'd he go?
- That way. That way.

856
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,557
That is it!
No more of this surveillance crap.

857
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,756
Captain Felix Maxwell
takes this from no mannequin.

858
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,756
Ah! Get us out of here
before he gets out of the car!

859
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,313
- Hang on!
- I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

860
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,271
You're finished, Switcher!

861
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,638
You may as well
hang up your jockey strap!

862
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,717
No! No, Mr Richards! No!

863
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,588
- One-way street, you maniac!
- I know!

864
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,871
This is for you, Rambo!

865
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,916
- We got him!
- I want to get out.

866
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,349
- Geronimo!
- I want to get out.

867
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,316
Oh!

868
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,676
I don't understand it. This never
happened to Armand before, never!

869
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,709
It must be you. You're so cold.

870
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,831
You're so... so unfeeling.

871
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,316
Where can I get a mannequin too?

872
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,675
<i>(door slams)</i>

873
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,518
<i>(sobs)</i>

874
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,636
<i>(giggling)</i>

875
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,116
<i>(sighs)</i>

876
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,156
Jonathan.

877
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,276
What are you thinking about?

878
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,795
- The window.
- Mm.

879
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,673
It turned out pretty well, didn't it?

880
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,756
It was breathtaking.

881
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,556
Emmy.

882
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,313
Ema Hesire, you inspire me.

883
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,716
I feel like I could do anything.

884
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,196
Windows are only the start.

885
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,955
I think we could design an entire city.

886
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,678
No one takes the time to build things
that have character, dignity.

887
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,516
People need that.

888
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,196
We could give it to them.

889
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,475
I love you, Emmy.

890
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,396
I love you too, Jonathan.

891
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,756
I'd better get into the window.

892
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,435
That peckerhead doubled back on me.
I saw his motorcycle out front.

893
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,676
That dummy of his has got to be here.

894
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,469
Oh!

895
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,639
- This is the one! This is the one!
- You positive?

896
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,751
Abso-tively.

897
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,838
Wait a minute.
This one kinda looks like her too.

898
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,472
I've put my future
in the hands of a vegetable.

899
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,151
Just get the mannequin.
Get... get the mannequin.

900
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,958
- <i>(Felix)</i> It's over there.
- <i>(Richards)</i> No, this is the door.

901
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,548
This is not the door. Oh, this <i>is</i> the door.

902
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,638
Oh, wait. Mr Richards, did you ever
notice how they all sorta look alike?

903
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,716
Would you just look at that one?

904
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,796
Maybe this is her.

905
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,597
It's really interesting.

906
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,633
- It's clever, all right.
- This is art.

907
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,433
- It's like theatre.
- I get it. I get it.

908
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,550
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

909
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,788
Good morning, starshine.
I sleep alone too,

910
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,673
- but I don't advertise it.
- Could you get my clothes?

911
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,360
Were you here all night?
You musta slept through it.

912
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,436
- What?
- <i>(hums "Dragnet" theme)</i>

913
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,075
All the girl mannequins disappeared
from the windows last night.

914
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,589
Yes, my dear, your favourite,
she is gone too.

915
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,755
Emmy.

916
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,310
Jonathan. Jonathan!

917
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,794
I'm sorry, baby. But us special people
are destined for heartache sometime.

918
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,037
You know what works best for me?
Crying shamelessly. Oh!

919
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,072
Don't do anything drastic. Oh me, oh my!

920
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,593
OK, now. Wait. Wait a minute.

921
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,676
Yes, I shall cover you.

922
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,876
Whoo!

923
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,634
Yes. This is... Whoa!

924
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,830
Yes, indeed, oh, yes, girl!

925
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,395
Mm-hm. Jonathan! Jonathan! Wait!

926
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,748
- Roxie? Roxie Shield?
- Can I help you?

927
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,916
- Roxie Shield.
- She's in the boardroom.

928
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,476
- Thank you!
- You can't go in there! Security!

929
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,358
Jonathan! Well, we were
hoping you might drop in.

930
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,392
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Where is she, Roxie?

931
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:25,198
She's perfectly safe. Jonathan, let's
talk about your future here at Illustra.

932
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,790
I think it'll be wonderful
to have the whole team back together.

933
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,832
- What'd you do with her?
- Relax. It's just a mannequin.

934
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,111
How does 55,000 a year sound to you?

935
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,152
- You...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! All right! 60,000.

936
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,748
Beej, I don't think
this man is of Illustra fibre.

937
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,836
- Where is she?
- You won't see her again.

938
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,793
- Where are you going?
- We also have a profit-sharing...

939
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,152
Switcher, we have extremely
incriminating photos of you and that...

940
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,195
Well, get up, Richards! Get him!

941
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,472
Hey!

942
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,433
Sorry. Gotta run.

943
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,878

Come on, Terminator.

946

Duty calls.

Roxie!

949
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,910
- Call the police!
- The SWAT team.

950
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,476
- Oh! Hey!
- Go away.

951
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,275
- Felix!
- Oh, Switcher.

952
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,197
Terminator, lunchtime.

953
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,832
Get him!

954
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,796

01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,753
Hey, Switcher!

958
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,194
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

959
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,113
Watch it!
Put me down! Put me down, you idiots!

960
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,673
Switcher! I'm gonna get you, Switcher!

961
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,590
You're finished, Switcher.

962
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,709
Yoo-hoo! Boys!

963
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,831
Way to go, buddy!

964
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,873
Two things I love to do. That's fight
and kiss boys. Come on, honey!

965
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,112
Come and get me, Sister Maryella!
What's the matter, honey?

966
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,800
What's the matter? Come on! Whoo-hoo!

being a man is all about, honey. Oh, yeah!

Oh, shit.

Go!

974
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,754
Just shoot him!

975
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,790
- Jonathan. You saved me.
- Oh, it's nothing, really.

976
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,876
- I'm alive.
- What?

977
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,600
He can see me and I'm still alive!

978
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,392
You are!

979
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,715
Thank you! Thank you.

980
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,797
- You're gonna have to love me forever.
- Oh, I always have, I always will.

01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,672
Get out of the way, doofus! Damn it!

Please don't touch me! Ugh!

Roxie.

989
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,793
- Jesus, it's the heat!
- Hollywood.

990

Now, this is Emmy.

991
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,316
Mama, put the coins on my eyes,
cos I sure don't believe what I am seeing.

992
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,471
There he is. Arrest that man.

993
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,430
- Who's she?
- She's who I came for.

994
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,551
She's the dummy!

995
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,796
<i>(Wert)</i> I said, arrest that man!

996
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,356
- Keep your hands off him.

997
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,754
Oh, shut up.

998
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,189
BJ, you really screwed up.

999
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,791
- Claire, what are you talkin' about?
- When I fired this idiot the other day,

1000
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,151
I replaced him with a fancy
camera surveillance system.

1001
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,352
I have Richards
and this moron on videotape.

1002
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,597
I was sure you were behind this.
You... you greedy snake!

1003
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,438
Claire!

1004
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,030
I want those two arrested
for breaking and entering and grand theft.

1005
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,392
- And I'll get you later for conspiracy.
- And you can add kidnapping to that, too.

1006
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,556
- Kidnapping? Who?
- Me.

1007
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,717
- Who are you?
- She's the dummy!

1008
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,270
This poor man is having a breakdown!

1009
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,198
- Get him outta here!
- No, no, she's the dummy!

1010
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,992
- No! No!
- I... Please.

1011
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,588
- She's the dummy!
- Please don't use force.

1012
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,676
Mama! I want my mama!

1013
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,238
Mrs Timkin, those video cameras.
Did they pick up everything last night?

1014
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,555
I only saw what I needed to see!

1015
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,870
- Just where did you come from?
- Uh, Roxie, you would never understand.

1016
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,789
Mm-hm.

1017
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:33,228
Uh, Claire, there must be some
arrangement we can make, huh?

1018
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,669
Cram it, clown.

1019
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,791
- Come on.
- Oh, no, boys. Please!

You know, I see executive potential here.

You'll never work in this town again.
