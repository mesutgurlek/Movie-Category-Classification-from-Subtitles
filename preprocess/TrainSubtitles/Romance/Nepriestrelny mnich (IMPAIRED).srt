and placing me
instantly in her good graces.

331
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,467
Deeply in her good graces.

332
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,011
It's foolproof.

333
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,016
Except for one fool, which would be you.

334
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:31,646
If she realizes what you did,
your entire plan will backfire.

(GRUNTS)

336
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,737
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

337
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,865
You're sleeping in my bed?

338
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,409
It is quite comfortable, thank you.

339
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,453
You're absolutely crazy.

340
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,082
You eat my food. You sleep in my bed.

341
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,042
That's great.

342
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:56,879
You can at least tell me
why those guys were chasing you.

343
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,258
All right.

344
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:05,554
Let me put it in language
you will understand.

345
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,764
Okay.

346
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,061
Why do hot dogs come in packages of 10,

347
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:15,815
while hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight?

(EXCLAIMS)

349
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,070
What the hell is that?

350
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,989
You can't answer my question
with another question,

351
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,741
especially one as stupid as that.

352
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,327
When you attain a state of enlightenment

353
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,080
that allows you to answer my question,

354
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,457
I will answer yours.

355
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,252
Good night.

356
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,045
What?

357
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,203
<i>NINA: Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

358
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,538
As the newly-appointed executive director

359
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,332
of the Human Rights Organization,

360
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,335
I would like to welcome you all here today.

361
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,087
Please, pardon our appearance.

362
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,216
As you can see,
we're still under construction.

363
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,677
But we wanted you,
our most generous supporters,

364
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,347
to have a preview of our new exhibit.

365
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,935
You see, out of the rubble that was Europe
at the end of World War II,

366
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,814
men and women of good will,
people like yourselves,

367
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:25,277
decided to build an organization dedicated
to the prevention of human rights abuses

368
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,196
all around the Earth.

369
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,865
And today I am here to tell you

370
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,242
we failed.

371
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:37,206
Thanks to all of you
and many others like you,

372
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,667
we are able to continue this fight.

373
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,877
This fight against hate,

374
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,923
violence, oppression, and cruelty
in all its forms.

375
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,097
– Excuse me?
– Yes?

376
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:58,143
Do you ever worry that some of the people
that come here may be inspired?

377
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,855
I hope each and every person
who comes here will be inspired.

378
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,232
I mean, inspired to do it again.

379
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,900
Oh.

380
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,903
Well, granted. There are an awful lot
of sick people in this world.

381
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,532
But, thankfully, most of them
don't attend our functions.

382
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,409
I have an idea.

383
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,038
How about instead of showing atrocity,

384
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:23,085
you do an exhibit that shows
man's humanity towards man?

385
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:27,256
You don't help anyone
by shielding them from reality.

386
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,261
Tell me.

387
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,597
Deep down inside,

388
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,266
in the very bottom of your soul,

389
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,435
who would you choose to be?

390
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,855
The one about to be shot

391
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,986
or the one about to do the shooting?

392
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,950
I really must go. It's been a pleasure.

393
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,766
Thank you.

394
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,225
Thank you.

395
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,894
What's going on?

396
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,104
The event was quite successful.

397
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,398
That's not what I'm talking about.

398
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,150
Have you found it?

399
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,069
Yes. Now,

400
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,364
unfortunately, we also lost it.

401
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,619
I am surrounded by weakness and failure.

402
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,996
No. That was before.

403
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,165
Now I'm here.

404
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,505
You are surrounded
by respect, admiration,

405
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:52,925
and love.

406
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:00,224
We'll find the scroll.
It's only a matter of time.

407
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,517
Time

408
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,271
is the one thing I'm running out of.

409
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:10,192
For 60 years,
I have been chasing the scroll.

410
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,362
It holds the power to rejuvenate me,

411
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,698
to make me young again,

412
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,952
and to finally cleanse the world
of all inferior races,

413
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,455
as it should have been cleansed
all those years ago.

414
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,545
That's the power

415
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,048
you let slip through your fingers, Nina.

416
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,385
I have men combing the city
as we speak, Opa.

417
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,722
Here you go. All right. Who's next?

418
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,890
– WOMAN: Plain with mustard, please.
– Okay.

419
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,394
All right. Coming right up, ma'am.

420
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,855
Hey! Watch it.

421
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,568
Excuse me, sir!

422
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,905
I believe you dropped this.

423
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,704
– Thank you. Thank you.
– You're welcome.

424
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,831
What the hell was that?

425
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,666
Sleight of hand.

426
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,586
I thought I was through with you.

427
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,963
Now you show up again
and you're picking my pocket?

428
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,924
The pocket was yours,
but not what I picked.

429
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:18,469
Don't you have anything better to do
than follow me around

430
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,679
and screw up my attempts
to make a little extra cash?

431
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:22,765
– Here you go.
– Thanks, man.

432
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,311
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

433
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,687
Whoa, whoa.

434
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:31,440
What? You got something
against hot dogs now?

435
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,317
'Cause if I remember correctly,

436
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,695
last night you were using them
to try to teach me ultimate enlightenment.

437
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,867
I was translating universal truth
into words you would understand,

438
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,786
but this.

439
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:48,123
To keep the body pure
one must not kill any living creature.

440
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,460
I didn't kill it. I'm gonna eat it.

441
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:56,465
And by the way, I got the answer
to your little question from last night.

442
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,634
– Yeah?
– Yeah. Check this out.

443
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,470
The reason hot dogs
come in packages of 10

444
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,889
and hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight

445
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,392
is that you always need more buns
for your hot dogs.

446
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:07,726
So no matter how much you get,

447
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,479
how much you win,
or how much you achieve,

448
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,982
you can never ever let yourself feel
like it's enough.

449
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,529
No, but good try.

450
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,659
You know, for a guy I barely know,
you're really starting to annoy me.

451
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,287
Knowing others means you are wise,

452
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,208
but knowing yourself
means you are enlightened.

453
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,670
Enough with all this
fortune-cookie philosophy, okay?

This is America.

457
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:46,014
We don't have enlightenment here.
We have Big Macs, strip clubs,

458
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,268
shopping malls, Las Vegas and HBO!

459
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,519
You got it?

460
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,273

Hey.

You don't quite look
like the bad girl you did last night.

00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,709
My necklace.

465
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,880
– Excuse me?
– Last night I lost my necklace.

466
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,384
Something tells me you may have an idea
of how I can get it back.

467
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:29,308
Well, I guess I could keep
my eyes and my ears open.

468
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:32,519
– What's in it for me?
– It belonged to my mom.

469
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,230
It's important to me.

470
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:38,066
I guess I'd owe you one.

471
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,736
Who is your friend?

472
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,489
Him?

473

He's my personal bodyguard.
Watches my back.

He's an incredibly deadly Shaolin monk.

Twenty reasons to die.

Shaolin monks
shave their heads every day.

477
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,301
You're no Shaolin monk.

last night was the first time

stand up to Funktastic.
