00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,542
- Come sta?
- Bene. Bene.

1151
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,842
Peter?

1152
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,541
Peewee,
what a surprise!

1153
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,675
What are you
doing here?

1154
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,582
- In Venice?
- Yes.

1155
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,813
In Venice, yes.

1156
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,321
Nextron's buying out
Ferugia Chocolate...

1157
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,913
that deal that me and your
dad were working on...

1158
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,993
so they sent the kid in
to close the deal.

1159
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,390
Did you get that bottle
of cognac I sent?

1160
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,689
Uh, yes, I, uh...

1161
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,991
thought it a tad
inappropriate.

1162
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:32,158
I'm sor... I didn't, uh...

1163
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,361
I'm just trying to be
the gallant loser here.

1164
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,494
Peter...

1165
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,197
Why don't we celebrate
this great coincidence?

1166
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,205
We're in Venice.

1167
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,798
I'll take
you guys to dinner.

1168
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,139
I'm on my honeymoon.

1169
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,338
My... My honeymoon.

1170
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,847
- [Laughs]
- See? Yeah.

1171
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,212
I can be so thick
sometimes.

1172
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,649
Grazie.
I'm sorry.

1173
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,810
I got a lot of work
to do anyways...

1174
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,911
so I'm going
to disappear.

1175
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,512
You guys have fun.

1176
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,387
Oh, Peter, wait.

1177
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,787
Uh, I don't
mean to be rude.

1178
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,227
[Laughs]

1179
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,663
You couldn't be rude
if you tried.

1180
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,324
How's the honeymoon?

1181
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,367
It's good? It's a dream?

1182
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,403
It's great.

1183
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,438
Oh, yeah. Great.

1184
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,666
Where's Tom?

1185
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,672
Oh, he's, uh...

1186
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,265
at the, uh...

1187
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,344
the church with...

1188
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,538
Uh, with, uh...

1189
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,673
with... He's...
He's a huge history buff.

1190
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,909
Yeah.

1191
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,383
Wow.

1192
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,886
Well, see? It's good that
you guys share that passion.

1193
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,685
Oh, yeah... yeah.

1194
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,157
Well... Ha ha.

1195
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,557
Bye.

1196
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,892
[Laughs Nervously]

1197
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,933
Fredo...

1198
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,165
I need to know where
that little signora is...

1199
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,763
at all times.

1200
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,173
[Fredo]
Very bold, Mr. Prentiss.

1201
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,471
Grazie.

1202
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,609
[Tom]
Dodgers won.!

1203
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,311
Dodgers won.!

1204
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,151
The Dodgers won, honey.

1205
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,782
See...

1206
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,383
I knew you were going
to make me pay...

1207
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,553
for watching the game.

1208
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,392
No.

1209
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,898
No, it's not that.

1210
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,093
We need to talk.

1211
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,130
About what?

1212
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,674
Have you always
told me the truth?

1213
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,674
Yeah.

1214
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,369
Except the time
I told you...

1215
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,775
I liked your
brother Willie.

1216
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,245
- This is serious.
- I am serious.

1217
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,610
I really don't like him.

1218
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,684
Marriage is built
on honesty and trust.

1219
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,343
- I totally agree.
- Okay.

1220
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,182
Then did you ever
do something...

1221
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,516
that you wanted
to tell me about...

1222
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,955
but you couldn't because
you felt bad about it?

1223
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,356
And the more time went on...

1224
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,428
the harder it got
for you to tell me?

1225
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,123
And then it turned into
this big, fat lie...

1226
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,630
so you kept not
telling me about it...

1227
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,291
Did you
talk to Kyle?

1228
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,767
No. Why?

1229
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,928
No reason.

1230
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,801
Does Kyle know something
that I should know?

1231
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:51,805
No.

1232
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:52,840
You covered your nose.

1233
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:53,840
I had an itch.

1234
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,138
You were hiding
flared nostrils.

1235
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,337
What do you have to tell?

1236
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,180
Okay.

1237
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,980
It's just...

1238
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,783
when Bags died...

1239
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,357
he didn't
exactly die...

1240
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,324
the way that
I described it.

1241
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:16,194
Him chasing those squawking
pigeons off the balcony?

1242
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,823
Yeah, that.

1243
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,300
What happened?

1244
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,301
Well...

1245
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,532
Okay. I'm reading
my magazine...

1246
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,868
and I'm really...
I'm focusing...

1247
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,169
and I'm really into it...

1248
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,800
and along comes
Bags, you know?

1249
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,276
He comes trucking over...

1250
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:35,043
and he starts
tugging on my ankle.

1251
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,675
And I was like, "Bags.!"

1252
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,219
I'm... I'm...
I was like...

1253
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,222
I think I even said,
"I'm trying to focus."

1254
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,350
Like, don't...
And he looked up at me...

1255
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,223
and he was giving me
the look like...

1256
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,489
"Hey, are you gonna
play with me or not?"

1257
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,497
And I was like...

1258
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,328
"I reallyjust want
to read though, Bags. "

1259
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,163
And... I'm... and...

1260
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,032
he started pulling
on my ankle again.

1261
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,538
So, I grabbed the ball...

1262
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,005
and I was like,
"Go get it, buddy. "

1263
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,905
And I threw the ball
over my shoulder...

1264
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:01,942
and it went out
the window...

1265
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,274
and Bags dove,
and he died.

1266
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,110
You killed Bags?

1267
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,683
It was an accident.

1268
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,685
And you lied about it
all this time?

1269
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,119
Actually, it was
more of an omission.

1270
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,520
No, it was
more like a lie!

1271
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,684
Where are you going?

1272
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,785
I have to figure out
what to do with this.

1273
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,227
What does that mean?

1274
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,854
I can deal with you
being cheap...

1275
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,364
and I can deal with you
being a shitty driver.

1276
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,130
I cannot not deal
with you being a liar!

1277
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,727
Whoa. Wait a second.

1278
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,274
This whole thing started...

1279
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,468
with you wanting
to talk about something.

1280
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,410
Well, I don't want to
talk about it right now.

1281
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,275
So you're feeling guilty
about something too.

1282
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,580
Yes, there is something
I "omitted"

1283
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,415
that I don't want to
talk about right now.

1284
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,319
You want a marriage based
on trust and honesty?

1285
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:49,550
Well, here's your chance.

1286
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,887
Come on!

1287
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,052
Yeah, yeah, you got it.!
I can see it.!

1288
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,060
Bring it!

1289
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,597
I slept with
Peter Prentiss.

1290
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:02,671
What?

1291
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,864
I slept with Peter...

1292
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:06,203
I heard you.!

1293
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,571
I'm sorry.

1294
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,769
I need to hear everything.

1295
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,776
No, you don't.

1296
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,141
Yes, I do.
That's what I do.

1297
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,477
That's what I do.
I need to know everything.

1298
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,380
Where you were,
what he did...

1299
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,576
how small
his wiener was.

1300
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,653
Everything.!

1301
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,448
I was helping on an
appraisal in Seattle.

1302
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:20,647
I don't want
to hear it!

1303
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,858
You slept with that...

1304
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,190
It was a long time ago.

1305
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,194
When?

1306
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,229
- Before we...
- Got married?

1307
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,424
- Yes!
- Got engaged?

1308
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,693
- Of course!
- Got together?

1309
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,702
Yes. No. No.

1310
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,465
It was right
after we met.

1311
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,472
My parents were
pressuring me to.

1312
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,439
Aha...

1313
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,010
Imagine my surprise.

1314
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,746
I was confused.

1315
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,748
I'm in Seattle.

1316
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:48,976
He asked me out
to dinner.

1317
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,677
The champagne
is flowing...

1318

Please try not
to break into song.

1319

My feelings for you...

1320
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,819
were very, very strong...

1321
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,328
and I needed to know
that they were real.

1322
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,419
I wasn't brought up...

1323
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:05,022
to manage feelings
like that very well.

1324
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,066
Yeah...

1325
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:10,662
you had a real
tough upbringing.

1326
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,241
I need some air.

1327
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,901
Yeah? Me too!

You broke it!

Peter's staying
at the hotel.

Where's Tom?

We don't feel the need...

to be with each other
all the time.

Okay.

1342
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,205
I just find it odd that...

1343
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:57,177
you're spending so much
time apart on your honeymoon.

1344

Why are you
still here, Peter?

1350

I'm not going
to leave you here like this.

Listen. I have a car,
all right?

1352
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,782
I'm having a quick drink
at a friend's house. Just...

1353
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,357
take a ride with me.

1354
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,619
You know,
catch your breath.

1355
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,093
I'll take you
back to Tom.

1356
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,331
Champagne?

1357
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,338
Sure.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
I love this song!

1362
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,756
No, wait.

1363
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:17,757
I really
should go.

I can't.
No, listen...

trace his family
back to Machiavelli.

[Sarah] Oh, wow.
That's a big house.

Nextron's thinking
of buying it.

Tell me, pretty one.

What brings
you to Venice?

1378
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,575
I'm on my honeymoon.

1379
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,579
Your honeymoon?

1380
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:14,580
Yeah.

1381
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,344
But she's so young
to be married.

1382
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,716
Why does everyone
keep on saying that?

1383
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,550
Where's your husband?

1384
