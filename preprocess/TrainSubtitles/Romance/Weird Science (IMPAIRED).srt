1
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:32,141
This is so beautiful.

2
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:34,203
You know it, Gary.

3
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,041
Look at her.

4
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:49,328
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

5
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:51,330
Shower with them.

6
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,333
Then we hit
the city, baby,

7
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,834
dead on,

8
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,767
for a little drinks,

9
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,363
a little nightlife,
dancing--

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,668
Dancing.

11
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:06,179
We throw a huge party,
I mean <i>huge</i> party--

12
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,782
Everybody's invited,
women everywhere.

13
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:11,649
All these girls,
they're all there.

14
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,050
Naked bodies everywhere.

15
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,247
Gary.

16
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:16,812
They'll know my name.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,255
What?

18
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,589
Nobody likes us.
Nobody.

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,096
Why are you messing
with the fantasy?

20
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,758
We know about
the reality.

21
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,267
Don't ruin
the fantasy, okay?

22
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:30,769
And then,

23
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,771
we're a hit, man.

24
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,773
We're popular.
We're revered.

25
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,832
Man, we're studs.

26
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:42,341
When the smoke clears,
right...

27
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,114
those two dames

28
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:48,120
fall amazingly,
completely,

29
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:52,352
and totally in love
with us, Wyatt.

30
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,417
Check it out.

31
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,394
Yo!

32
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,694
Check us out!

00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:50,775
Cincinnati.

72
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:57,040
They're meeting the guy
my sister wants to marry.

Chloe? Who the hell
would marry Chloe?

He's studying
to be a vet.

How come your parents
suddenly trust you?

Chet's coming home
from college
for the weekend.

79
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,003
He's in charge.

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,731
Chet? Shit!

81
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:21,501
You should have
told me this

82
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,510
before I agreed
to sleep over.

83
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,513
How do you
put up with him?

84
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:32,018
If I don't,
he beats the shit
out of me.

85
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:36,215
It's a habit
he picked up
in military school.

86
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,723
He's very
protective of me.

87
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,090
Nice relationship.

104
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,527

105
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,168
<i>the brain</i>
<i>you stole, Fritz</i>--

106
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:33,178
<i>The brain of a dead man</i>

107
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:37,512
<i>waiting to live again</i>

108
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,018
It's not a bad idea.

109
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,178
What?

110
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:43,518
<i>In 1 5 minutes,</i>
<i>the storm</i>...

111
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,581
Making a girl.

112
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,086
Actually making a girl...

113
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,499
just like Frankenstein,

114
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,058

<i>Sorry, Doctor</i>.

118
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,442
You're serious.

119
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,842
Yes.

120
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,482
Look me in the eyes.

121
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,518
Do I look serious?

122
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:13,984
<i>You're crazy</i>!

123
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,521
<i>Crazy am I?</i>

124
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:16,987
<i>We'll see</i>

00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:19,491
<i>whether I'm crazy or not</i>.

126
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,824
Gary Wallace,
that's absolutely gross.

127
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,888
I'm not digging up
dead girls.

128
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:32,671
I'm not talking about
digging up a dead girl.

129
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm talking about
your computer, idiot.

130
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,201
You can simulate stuff
on your computer.

131
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,180
Why can't we
simulate a girl?

132
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,183
I guess I could,
but why?

133
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:48,186
It's two-dimensional
on the screen.

134
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,848
It's not
flesh and blood.

135
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,859
But we can
ask it questions.

136
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:57,795
We'll put it in
real-life sexual situations

137
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,196
and see how it reacts.

138
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:04,032
Well, what about
your girl in Canada?

139
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,799
She lives in Canada.

140
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,806
She has no morals.

141
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:10,809
I don't like that
in a girl.

142
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,708
Anyway, get to work.

143
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:19,641
Very nice.

144
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:27,920
Hold it, Wyatt.
I know female stats.

145
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,394
Anything bigger
than a handful,

146
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,897
you're risking
a sprained tongue.

147
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,456
Yeah.
Yeah.

148
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,497
Perfect.

149
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,505
Okay. Now what?

150
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,872
Should we give her
a brain?

151
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,140
Yeah. We'll play chess
with her.

152
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,239
Chess? Just give her
a brain.

153
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,558
That's all we can do
with my stuff.

154
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:05,621
Did you get
a free toaster
with this, too?

155
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:09,634
The problem is,
this is a lame idea.

156
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,136
Your computer
is a wimp.

157
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,140
We need
a lot more power.

158
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,199
What do you suggest?

159
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,632
We're in.

160
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,636
We're in trouble, Gary.

161
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,138
This is highly illegal.

162
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,198
We got to
fill this thing
with data.

163
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,211
We'll make her
as real as possible.

164
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,577
I want her

00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,615
<i>Forget</i>
<i>that other one</i>.

332
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:40,584
You got
this fine jewel
sitting by you.

333
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:43,383
Ain't that the truth,
baby?

334
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,446
That's the plain truth!

335
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:50,958
Party's over.

336
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,964
Party's over,
says the girl.

337
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,091
Here's money for you--

338
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,102
$50 for you,
$50 for you.

339
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,039
I'll bet $5 that boy
won't make it
through the club.

340
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,542
d Woo, baby d

341
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,545
d Woo, baby d

342
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:09,103
d You know I love you d

343
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,044
I really shouldn't
be driving.

344
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,055
Listen,
I appreciate it.

345
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:20,557
I don't feel
like driving.

346
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,560
Okay, forget it.

347
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,061
I'll drive.

348
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,063
Give me the keys!

349
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:28,565
Will he
be all right?

350
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:32,468
I warned him about
that blind dog bourbon.

351
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:34,972
He don't have
a license.

352
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,601
I don't even have
a learner's permit.

353
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:41,510
Hey, let's scout
another party, man.

354
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,572
What will you
tell Chet about me?

355
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,083
Nothing.

356
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,584
Nothing?

357
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,144
That's not very
realistic, Wyatt.

358
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:54,158
I'm just trying
to concentrate
on the road.

359
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,659
Concentrate harder.

360
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,288
You're running
a red light.

361
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,888
Oh, shit!

362
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:11,437
I hate that stuff!.
I never listen to it!

363
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,705
I hate this car!

364
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,713
Are you okay?

365
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:19,217
My nuts
are halfway up my ass.

366
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:22,014
Other than that,
I'm perfect.

367
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:25,523
Think of what
you'll do about Chet.

368
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,991
He's one serious idiot.

369
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,089
You're stewed, butt-wad!

370
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,263
Who, me?

371
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,266
Know what time it is?

372
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,632
Uh, 2:00?

373
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,194
Time to pay the fiddler.

374
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,813
I was kind of
counting on you

375
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:51,372
to be human about this.

376
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,822
Here's the
bottom line, Wyatt.

377
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,758
I'm telling Mom and Dad
everything.

378
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:06,025
And I'm even considering
making up some shit.

379
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,769
All right, Chet.
Name your price.

380
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:14,271
$1 7 5 and zero cents,
cash--

381
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,773
New bills,
crisp and clean,

382
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:19,333
in my wallet by 7 A.M.

383
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,279
Thank you.

384
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:25,783
Hey, what are
big brothers for?

385
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,012
See you upstairs.

386
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,345
How to be jilted.

387
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,292
Pllllttt.

388
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,793
Shh.

389
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,295
Shh.

390
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,797
The boozehounds return.

391
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,300
What a joke!

392
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,858
Hi, girls.

393
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,615
<i>Feeling kind of Queasy?</i>

394
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:04,247
How about a nice
greasy pork sandwich

395
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:07,315
served in
a dirty ashtray?

396
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,771
He pukes, you die.

397
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,002
He's not laughing
at you, Chet.

398
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,135
<i>Yes, I am</i>.

399
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,807
Did you tell Chet
about the woman
we made tonight?

400
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:32,248
He's drunk.

401
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:33,511
No shit.

402
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,917
No shit, Chet.

403
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:39,515
You donkey dicks
couldn't get laid
in a morgue.

404
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,525
You're absolutely right.

405
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:43,527
You're absolutely
right, Chet.

406
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,028
Hey, Gary.

407
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,655
What?

408
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:57,467
Ha ha ha ha!

409
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,511
He's an asshole.

410
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,409
Look at his haircut.

411
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,109
Anybody with
a haircut like that

412
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,118
<i>is an asshole</i>.

413
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,327
Psst. Lisa.

414
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,501
Where are you?

415
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,001
I'm right behind you.

416
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:39,847
Surprise!

417
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,959
I won't hurt you.

418
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:52,963
Your lips feel like
rigor mortis has set in.

419
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,965
Relax a little bit.

420
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:58,469
I wasn't expecting you
to kiss me.

421
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:00,903
I mean, I was just--

422
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,565
I was...uh...

423
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:09,979
<i>d Oh d</i>

424
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:15,676
That was better.

425
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,518
Want to try it again?

426
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,524
If you don't mind.

427
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:23,755
I mean,
yes, please, ma'am.

428
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,592
<i>d Oh oh oh oh d</i>

429
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:33,901
<i>d Oh d</i>

430
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,599
Mmph!

431
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,338
You sure
you're only 1 5?

432
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,941
I'll be 1 6 in June.

433
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,554
You made me.

434
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,613
You control me.

435
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:00,496
What are you
thinking about, huh?

436
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,226
Um...

437
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,058
women's gymnastics.

438
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,505
Well, I don't know.

439
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,507
I'll do my best.

440
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:12,065
Good.

441
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,605
Oh.

442
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:52,274
Wyatt, Wyatt,

443
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,046
Wyatt, where are you?

444
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,053
I'm right here, Gary.

445
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,554
What happened?

446
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,487
I don't know.

447
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,994
I think
it was a dream.

448
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,756
What?

449
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,764
Everything--
Last night, Lisa.

450
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:09,494
It had to be a dream.

451
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:11,832
<i>We were both in it</i>.

452
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:15,771
Two people can't have
the same dream.

453
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,674
It had to be a dream.

454
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,575
<i>In your dream,</i>

455
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:25,548
did I get up
in the middle
of the night

456
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:28,177
<i>and yak</i>
<i>in your sink?</i>

457
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:30,187
<i>Didn't throw up. No</i>.

458
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:33,691
Maybe it was a dream,
you know--

459
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,693
A very weird, bizarre,

460
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:42,633
<i>vivid, erotic, wet,</i>
<i>detailed dream</i>.

461
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,795
Maybe we have malaria.

462
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:47,270
Shit.

463
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:57,472
Gary! Wyatt!

464
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,039
<i>Breakfast</i>!

465
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,651
I don't
have the bucks

466
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:08,056
to pay Chet off
about this.

467
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:11,027
You can't fear Chet
the rest of your life.

468
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,621
Why not?
Please...

469
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:16,030
I don't know, Wyatt.

470
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:20,663
I mean, it's seriously
affecting your sex life.

471
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,674
<i>1 0 seconds into</i>
<i>my gymnastics routine,</i>

472
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:25,676
<i>you passed out</i>.

473
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,177
You slept.

474
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,769
I did my toes.

475
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:31,680
By the way,
you're very cute.

476
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,241
We'll try it again
sometime.

477
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:39,781
Good morning,
turd brain.

478
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:41,348
Hi, Chet.

479
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,755
You spit in this?

480
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:50,825
Not that
I'm aware of, no.

481
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:53,769
Hey, that looks
pretty good.

482
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:02,269
Now make yourself one,
dick weed.

483
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:11,221
I like your panties.

484
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,722
[Burp]

485
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,884
It's a joke, Chet.

486
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,723
That's not a joke!

487
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,730
That is a severe
behavioral disorder.

488
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,561
Those are women's
underpants!

489
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,729
Next you'll be wearing
a bra on your head.

490
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:29,740
The old man's
going to have a stroke.

491
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:32,242
All right, Chet.
How much?

492
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,743
How much?

493
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:37,304
This goes way beyond
payment, pal.

494
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,316
Come on, Chet.
Please?

495
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,309
Well...

496
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:47,257
your VCR

She's with...you guys?

828
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:42,865
Come on, Lisa.
Why not?

829
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:45,868
Because I belong
to Gary and Wyatt.

830
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:50,873
Did they make you
in the garage
with power tools?

831
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:53,000

832

Gary and Wyatt

839
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:10,527
will force everyone
to redefine their terms.

840
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:13,722
And you're completely
loyal to them?

841
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:18,097
I do whatever they say.

842
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:30,436
Hi.

843
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:37,053
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?

844
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:40,613
No problem.
We'll be in here.

845
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,123
Okay, fine.

846
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:56,572
They're stoked
for us.

847
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,074
Should we go for it?

848
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:01,043
What about Lisa?

849
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,079
She said we should party.

850
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:05,877
Let's score points
with these two.

851
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:08,816
We'll deal with
the mechanics later.

852
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,114
Sounds good.

853
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:12,587
Let's not hurt
Lisa's feelings.

854
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,487
She wants
a bone job from me.

855
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:17,391
Ready to party?
Let's break!

856
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:32,708
Those guys are weird,
but they're kinda cute.

857
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:34,209
Hi.

858
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,213
Where did you two
disappear to?

859
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:41,012
We were in
the bathroom.
We were
in the kitchen.

860
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:43,019
Eating.
Doing our hair.

861
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:46,022
Have you met
Gary and Wyatt?

862
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,523
Yes.
No.

863
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:48,990
Sort of.

864
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:54,363
If you get the chance,
shower with them.

865
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:55,864
I did.

866
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:58,401
It's a mind scrambler!

867
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:01,302
Oh, hurts so good.

868
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:08,835
She took a shower
with them.

869
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:11,847
I have a wonderful
idea, Henry.

870
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:15,749
After dinner,
let's stop by
and visit Wyatt.

871
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:18,253
He's alone
at home tonight.

872
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:21,257
Doesn't he have
anything to read?

873
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:23,259
I don't know, dear,

874
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:27,263
but nothing's
more important
to a teenage boy

875
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,196
than his grandparents.

876
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:31,097
We'll drop by.

877
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:40,667
Ha ha ha!
Yeah! Woo!

878
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:50,715
I'd like to apologize
for the Icee today at the mall.

879
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:53,723
It was very immature.
I'm sorry.

880
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:56,885
It was just,

What's the deal

884
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,428
Can we borrow her?

885
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:07,936
We can't do that, guys.

886
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,939
Common decency
prohibits us.

887
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:12,271
We can't.
It's not cool.

888
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:15,277
Well, she said
it was cool.

889
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:18,781
We can't take advantage
of her loyalties.

890
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:21,044
That's really
selfish.

891
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:23,052
Just forget it, guys.

892
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,680

01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:41,176
Would you kiss me?

1156
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:45,016
What about Ian?

1157
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:50,682
We all make mistakes.

1158
01:10:53,696 --> 01:10:54,822
Okay.

1159
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:56,194
Okay.

1160
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,695
Where do you want it?

1161
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:06,135
Can I ask you
a question?

1162
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,641
Yeah.

1163
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,702
How do you feel
about Lisa?

1164
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,442
I love her.

1165
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:15,677
That's what I figured.

1166
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:19,087
But, uh...

1167
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:22,591
it's definitely
a different
kind of love.

1168
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:26,094
You know,
it's more sisterly,

1169
01:11:26,162 --> 01:11:29,620
like big sisters,
like, kind of.

1170
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,599
But she's
so beautiful.

1171
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:38,403
Yeah, she's
really beautiful.

1172
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:43,002
And her body is...
it's gorgeous.

1173
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,446
It's a nice figure.

1174
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,107
So...

1175
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:54,147
I mean,
what would I be
compared to her?

1176
01:11:54,223 --> 01:12:00,628
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...

1177
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:05,066
before I knew
what I wanted.

1178

<i>I know that if</i>
<i>I could do it again,</i>

1179

I'd make her
just like you.

1180
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:15,637
Honest.

1181
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:25,586
Dead honest.

1182
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:29,648
I'm like... I'm really honest
when I say that.

1183
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,022
I'm so very honest.

That little bastard.

1188

If my room's okay,
I won't kill him.

1189
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:39,417
I'll just hurt him
real bad.

Ow.

I don't know.

1196

You're dead meat,

1197

Uh...

1198
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:30,503
Chet, Chet,
that's her nose.

1199
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:33,776
She has nothing
to do with it.

1200
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,578
Okay. You die.

1201
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:39,985
She walks out of here
with a severe limp.

1202
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:49,654
I'll be back.

1203
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:57,102
That's Wyatt's
older brother, Chet.

1204
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:59,004
He's an asshole.

1205

Oh, hi, Chet.

1206
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:07,048
What the hell's
going on around here?

1207
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:09,550
Chet, it was
an accident.

1208
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:11,051
An accident?

1209
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,954
Do you realize
it's snowing in my room,

1210
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:16,423

1211

Start talking.

1215
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:30,231
Gary and I
made a woman
with the computer.

1216
01:15:30,306 --> 01:15:34,174
She went crazy and
messed up the house.

Chet,just let me
find Lisa.

She'll clear
everything up.

You can have
my college money

and my social security,
Chet.

Huh?

You've synched everybody
to the same bullshit story.

a Pershing missile, Chip.
