491
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:34,398
Did Barbara call you?

492
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:35,574
No.

493
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,029
PETER: Howard.

494
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:42,233
- Howard!
- No!

495
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,382
PETER: Oh, Howard.

496
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:46,270
HOWARD: Leave me alone,
you smut peddler!

497
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,382
You professional gossip!

498
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,015
PETER: Will you get real?

499
00:25:49,054 --> 00:25:50,777
HOWARD: Shh!

500
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,188
- Look at me.
- Why?

501
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:55,125
Sure, I look great,
but my ratings.

502
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,744
Everyone wants to talk to
Diane Sawyer or Joan Lunden.

503
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:01,564
My network's killing me.
They want me blond.

504
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:02,678
With your coloring?

505
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:05,817
All those reporters,
after today, they're gone.

506
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:08,472
They've got their story.
But I care.

507
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,452
I am doing a full week.

508
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,363
A week? You can't.

509
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,315
I have to. It's too good.

510
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,879
No. I have classes to teach.
I'm getting married.

511
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:19,805
- I'll be there.
- No.

512
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,878
- I'll kill you.
- But it's classic.

513
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,806
Sex, a small town,
and a movie star.

514
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:25,399
Why can't you see that?

515
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:28,220
"Howard Brackett: In and out."

516
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:33,011
My God.
You are pure television.

517
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:34,679
Stop it.

518
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:36,599
Good night.

519
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,209
[Laughter]

520
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:46,326
WALTER: Guys, remember...

521
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,992
- I got that.
- Thanks.

522
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,958
WALTER: Don't say nothing about
the Oscars or Cameron Drake.

523
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,083
MAN: I think he's coming.

524
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,283
MAN: Shh. Shh.

525
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:09,779
He's here!

526
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:11,131
MEN: Yeah!

527
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:17,210
HOWARD: Yeah, baby!

528
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,701
Whoa! Are we gonna have
a bachelor party?

529
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:20,822
MEN: Yes!

530
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:22,804
- We gonna get down and dirty?
- Yes!

531
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,853
HOWARD: Disgustingly drunk?

532
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:25,974
MEN: Yeah!

533
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:28,218
WALTER: We've been working
on this for weeks.

534
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,872
We got all your favorite stuff,
everything you love!

535
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,022
HOWARD: Hit me!

536
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:33,851
WALTER: Here, Howard.

537
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,089
HOWARD: What are we
talking about, triple X?

538
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,297
Little Oral Annie? Traci Lords?

539
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,741
Lay some adult video on me.

540
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:41,661
ALDO: We got it... uncut.

541
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,101
WALTER: "Funny Girl"!

542
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:44,727
MEN: Yeah!

543
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,773
[Wild laughter]

544
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,243
"Funny Girl"?

545
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,423
ALDO: Yeah.

546
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,666
I don't believe this.
Barbra Streisand?

547
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:54,393
MAN: You had that
film festival last year.

548
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,885
- We watched all her movies.
- It was fun.

549
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,317
HOWARD: Guys.
Guys, I'm truly offended.

550
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,739
Don't you see
this is precisely the reason...

551
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,888
why Cameron Drake
and half the civilized world...

552
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,748
think that I'm... you know.

553
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:07,862
MEN: No!

554
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:08,982
Oh, no!

555
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,331
ALDO: You're a guy's guy!

556
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,511
MAN: No, no.

557
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,273
HOWARD: I don't know
how this started...

558
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,157
but this is my goddamn
bachelor party...

559
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,394
and I am not going
to goddamn watch...

560
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,245
pardon my split infinitive...
"Funny Girl"!

561
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,831
- Me, neither. I hate that.
- Thank you.

562
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,593
- You got "A Star is Born"?
- Oh, sure.

563
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,742
HOWARD: "A Star is Born"?

564
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:28,277
MAN: She looks bad in it.

565
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,871
- "Yentl."
- "Yentl!"

566
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,503
MAN: I'd watch it again.

567
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,884
SECOND MAN: I love "Yentl"!

568
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,827
Yeah! "Papa, can you hear me?"

569
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,277
THIRD MAN:
Produced and directed.

570
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,197
HOWARD: Dudes, hombres, guys!

571
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,077
Guys, I'm sorry.
I am truly offended.

572
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,143
I thought I knew you guys.
I thought you were studs.

573
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:49,305
I guess I thought wrong.

574
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,552
I'm out of here.

575
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,735
WALTER: Howard.

576
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,847
ALDO: Maybe he's right.
"Yentl" sucks.

577
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,948
MEN: Ooh. Uh-oh.

578
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,317
What did you say?

579
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,935
ALDO: It sucks. It's boring.

580
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,139
Say that again.

581
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,916
She was too old for "Yentl"!

582
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,989
[Everyone shouting]

583
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,348
[Applause on TV]

584
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,099
JAY LENO: I guess you heard...
Michael Jackson getting married.

585
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:46,036
He's made the perfect choice...
Howard Brackett.

586
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,256
Yes, Howard Brackett.

587
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:48,887
[Laughter and applause]

588
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:52,093
Peter Malloy with day two...

589
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,948
of "Howard Brackett:
Will there be a wedding?"

590
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,371
I'm with Aldo Hooper,
Howard's barber.

591
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:58,967
Stylist... razor cuts,
color, full blow dry.

592
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,183
That's very nice.

593
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:02,807
What do you think?
Will there be a wedding?

594
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:06,391
Howard is booked for Saturday.
A full styling. I say yes.

595
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:09,820
Emmett Wilson, who has just
delivered Howard's mail...

596
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,702
his intimate correspondence,
letters to a legend.

597
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,141
Anything we should know?

598
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:16,541
I can't reveal that.
I'm a postal employee.

599
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:17,981
Don't make him mad.

600
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,737
Of course he's getting married.

601
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:21,629
He's a man of his word.

602
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:22,775
Is this national?

603
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:23,894
You bet.

604
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:28,244
Please, use your full zip codes.

605
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,141
Greenleaf High,
cradle of crisis.

606
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,378
Howard's seniors...
youth in the crossfire.

607
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,513
Tell us in your own innocent
young words, is he gay?

608
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,576
JACK: Oh, no. He told us.
It was all this huge mistake.

609
00:30:39,614 --> 00:30:43,357
MEREDITH: It happened 'cause he
likes poetry and uses a napkin.

610
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,634
VICKY: Unlike some people.

611
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,749
MIKE: What?

612
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,637
PETER: Teens in turmoil.
And your message to America?

613
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,557
BO YS: Greenleaf rules! Yeah!

614
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,957
PETER: Kids on the edge.
A community in chaos.

615
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,397
Indiana cries out.

616
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,252
Howard, can you hear?

617
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:06,299
HALLIWELL: Howard,
uh, you got a minute?

618
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,586
Howard, uh...

619
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,549
your... your life,
I mean, since...

620
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,623
since the Oscars,
I can only imagine.

621
00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:20,477
HOWARD: It's over now.
It's fine. It's just fine.

622
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,397
It's all ancient history.

623
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,113
We do have graduation
coming up Monday...

624
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,103
and you kind of put us right...
right in the spotlight.

625
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:31,703
I'm so sorry, Tom.

626
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:35,320
I'd be less than honest
if I didn't tell you...

627
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:41,108
that I've gotten some calls
from parents...

628
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,136
wondering if, in fact,
you were a ho... ho...

629
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:47,832
h-ho... h-ho...

630
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,147
Home room teacher?

631
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:51,004
Homo-hom-homosexual.

632
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,909
Tom, do I look like
a homosexual?

633
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:57,015
Would you walk for me?

634
00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:59,482
Excuse me.

635
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,495
Uh, Howard?

636
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,127
Yes.

637
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,654
Do you enjoy teaching?

638
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:08,442
No, I don't enjoy it.

639
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:10,039
You don't?

640
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:12,598
No, I love it. It's my life.

641
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:15,801
HALLIWELL: Then you'd miss it?

642
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,529
Are you threatening me?

643
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:22,679
No, no.

644
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,922
I'm... l'm your friend.

645
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,479
Friends don't threaten.

646
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,492
No, they don't.

647
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,443
Friends warn.

648
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:33,820
And you, uh...

649
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:37,051
you are getting married,
aren't you?

650
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,290
But are you saying...

651
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:43,101
that if I weren't getting
married, I'd be fired?

652

00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:36,297
and I'm sorry.

983
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:37,993
You're sorry?

984
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,677
You're sorry?

985
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:43,239
After I... I...

986
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:46,062
wait for you for...

987
00:49:46,095 --> 00:49:47,404
No!

988
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:50,439
No!
Not just three years...

989
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,235
my entire life!

990
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:55,173
After I plan my future
around our wedding?

991
00:49:55,216 --> 00:49:59,787
After I base my entire concept
of self-esteem...

992
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:02,670
on the fact
that you're willing to marry me?

993
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:04,296
And you're sorry?

994
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,993
HOWARD: I'm sorry.

995
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:10,214
Thank God my parents are dead!

996
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:11,749
This would've killed them!

997
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,077
Are you...

998
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,734
Are you really gay?

999
00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:25,452
Mm-hmm.

1000
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:26,861
Mm-hmm.

1001
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:32,201
Was... there... oh...

1002
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:37,157
any other time
you might've told me this?!

1003
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:44,204
I'm wearing a wedding dress
which you picked out!

1004
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,494
I highlighted my hair because
you said I needed shimmer!

1005
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:51,909
I loved you and believed you...

1006
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:55,268
and pretended not to notice
the Streisand thing.

1007
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:57,580
I thought you were
just creative.

1008
00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:59,209
I thought you were
just smarter than me...

1009
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:02,760
and more sensitive
and more interesting.

1010
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:06,095
I thought you were the most
wonderful man who ever lived.

1011
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:09,542
I thought you could
change my life...

1012
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,551
and show me the whole world...

1013
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:17,228
and teach me about art
and life and magic.

1014
00:51:17,263 --> 00:51:19,206
I thought you could...

1015
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:22,596
make me feel
like a beautiful woman...

1016
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,955
instead of the girl
nobody wanted.

1017
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,276
Oh, no.

1018
00:51:27,311 --> 00:51:29,166
Emily.

1019
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:30,540
But... but...

1020
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:32,617
Emily. Emily.

1021
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:37,318
Does anybody here know...

1022
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,229
how many times I've had
to watch "Funny Lady"?

1023
00:51:43,503 --> 00:51:46,503
It was a sequel.
She was under contract.

1024
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:50,340
Fuck Barbra Streisand!

1025
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:51,812
And you!

1026
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:54,798
[Gasping]

1027
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:04,076
HOWARD: Emily!

1028
00:52:08,048 --> 00:52:10,087
Emily. Emily.

1029
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,590
PETER: Howard, you did it!

1030
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:38,927
I'm so proud of you.
Congratulations.

1031
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:40,715
Congratulations?

1032
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:42,311
I just destroyed Emily's life!

1033
00:52:42,352 --> 00:52:43,497
I killed her!

1034
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,739
You saved her life.

1035
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:47,269
HOWARD: Ohh.

1036
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:49,678
I don't believe it. I...

1037
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:55,758
I just came out at my wedding!

1038
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,318
In front of everybody!

1039
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,069
My family, my friends,
my mom, my dad...

1040
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:02,348
Look at my hand.

1041
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:03,877
PETER: It was fantastic!

1042
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:05,261
HOWARD: It was a nightmare!

1043
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:07,205
I... I... I... I...

1044
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:09,419
I just demolished
my mother's dream wedding!

1045
00:53:09,455 --> 00:53:12,422
I'm... I'm... I'm a monster!
I'm... I'm a lunatic.

1046
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:15,333
PETER: You're a hero,
and I've got great footage!

1047
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,553
I got the whole thing!

1048
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:18,380
HOWARD: Is this about footage?

1049
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:20,008
I'll give you your headline.

1050
00:53:20,783 --> 00:53:25,834
Howard Brackett is a big homo,
queer, Mary, sissy man.

1051
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:28,620
He just came out
at his big church wedding!

1052
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:30,826
Martha Stewart is furious!

1053
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:32,108
There. Is that what you want?

1054
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:33,452
That was great stuff.

1055
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:37,896
Aah!

1056
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:39,976
[Gasps]

1057
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:50,504
CAMERON: No. Tell him I really
appreciate the offer...

1058
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:53,194
but I just don't think
I'm right for it.

1059
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,719
This is Peter Malloy
for Inside Entertainment.

1060
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:58,476
I'm at Greenleaf's
First Methodist Church...

1061
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:01,860
where Howard Brackett has
boldly declared, "I don't."

1062
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:04,685
SONYA: Cam! Come look at this!

1063
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:07,086
PETER: Brackett, outted by
Cameron Drake at the Oscars...

1064
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,421
today, to the amazement
of family and friends...

1065
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,619
outted himself
at his own wedding.

1066
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:14,443
You can imagine the fireworks.

1067
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:17,381
He's been besieged by the media,
his job may be in jeopardy...

1068
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:18,797
and as for his fiancée...

1069
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:20,489
fellow English teacher
Emily Montgomery...

1070
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,121
well, who knows?

1071
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,719
CAMERON: Miss Montgomery?

1072
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,200
PETER: The real question is,
where is Cameron Drake?

1073
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:31,207
This is Peter Malloy
for Inside Entertainment.

1074
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,741
CAMERON: We got to leave.

1075
00:54:33,616 --> 00:54:36,005
- Cam?
- We got to go.

1076
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,148
Go where?

1077
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,428
CAMERON: Greenleaf...
because of what I said.

1078
00:54:40,463 --> 00:54:42,852
I got to see what's going on
and do something.

1079
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:45,034
But I promised Isaac
I'd do his show.

1080
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:46,827
The new collection
is this afternoon.

1081
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:49,809
I have to shower and vomit.

1082
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:56,814
MIKE: Man! At his wedding.

1083
00:54:56,849 --> 00:54:58,093
VICKY: Poor Miss Montgomery.

1084
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:03,407
JACK: I guess Mr. Brackett's
really like Cameron said.

1085
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:06,310
MIKE: Uh, duh.
And you hung out with him.

1086
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,720
He drove you
to that college interview.

1087
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:11,568
Didn't you, like,
stay over somewhere?

1088
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,968
But nothing happened.

1089
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:17,197
I don't even know the guy...
not anymore.

1090
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,722
MEREDITH: Excuse me.
You don't know the guy?

1091
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:21,005
He got you into college.

1092
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,408
Just last week,
he was your total hero.

1093
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:24,936
That was last week.

1094
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:30,445
Guys, we had a gay teacher
all year.

1095
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:34,442
We have to face that...
and move on with our lives.

1096
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:36,423
VICKY:
What are you talking about?

1097
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:39,400
MOTHER:
Kids, how was the wedding?

1098
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,470
ALL: Fine!

1099
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:09,354
BERNIECE: I can understand
about Howard being gay...

1100
00:56:09,393 --> 00:56:11,117
but I will never understand...

1101
00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:14,469
as long as I live,
as God is my witness...

1102
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:17,132
how could he not want a wedding?

1103
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:21,097
Oh, sweetie,
it's not your fault.

1104
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:22,894
You have two boys.

1105
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:26,028
You fed them, raised them,
and loved them the same.

1106
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:27,854
And one of them is gay.

1107
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:30,158
- And the other one is...
- Walter.

1108
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:34,187
Howard was just being honest...

1109
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:37,073
clearing the air
before he made a real mess.

1110
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:38,283
What's wrong with that?

1111
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:41,322
What are we so afraid of?

1112
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:46,118
What do we think will happen
if we all just spill the beans?

1113
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:48,616
Oh... I don't know.

1114
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:51,024
All right... l'll start.

1115
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:57,738
My Rice Krispie treats
that I made for the reception...

1116
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:01,543
they're not my recipe.

1117
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,584
It's Harriet Carter's.

1118
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:08,365
After she died from
that massive embolism...

1119
00:57:08,401 --> 00:57:10,124
a lie was born.

1120
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:14,570
These are a dead woman's treats.

1121
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:16,169
Oh.

1122
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,966
Oh, my.

1123
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:23,216
All right.

1124
00:57:23,249 --> 00:57:25,900
I'll say it right out loud.

1125
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:31,182
I hated "The Bridges
of Madison County."

1126
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:36,014
My husband has three testicles.

1127
00:57:38,194 --> 00:57:39,470
Bob?

1128
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:42,543
It's disgusting.

1129
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,904

1134
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:11,851
Howard?

1135
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,738
So?

1136
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:44,971
So.

1137
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:51,340
Are you still gay?

1138
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,380
Yep.

1139
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,480
Are you going to have
an operation?

1140
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:02,895
Excuse me?

1141
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,930
Will you be going
into show business?

1142
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:07,627

have a little respect here?

graduation and everything.

Mr. Brackett
is no longer an employee here.

the kids, for the youngsters.

MIKE: They canned him?

1404

CAMERON: Is this about
the Oscars and the gay thing?

1405

ED: No.

No. No, no, no.

CAMERON: Then what is it?

1408
01:13:32,805 --> 01:13:34,561
HALLIWELL: We... we felt...

1409
01:13:34,596 --> 01:13:38,939
The... the community, uh,
felt that it was...

1410
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:41,795
it was a question of...
of, uh...

1411
01:13:41,828 --> 01:13:42,941
influence.

1412

CAMERON:
I'm sorry. I'm a little slow.

1413
01:13:47,428 --> 01:13:51,006
I was a C student,
and now I'm an actor, so...

1414
01:13:51,045 --> 01:13:52,059
Influence?

1415
01:13:52,101 --> 01:13:54,915
HALLIWELL: I mean,
it's all right to be...

1416
01:13:54,948 --> 01:13:58,243
uh, this way or that way
at home...

1417
01:13:58,276 --> 01:14:00,861
in... in your...
in your private area...

1418
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,479
arena... arena...

1419
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,368
but, uh, Mr. Bracket,
after all, is... was...

1420
01:14:07,408 --> 01:14:08,902
uh, a teacher.

1421
01:14:09,968 --> 01:14:11,244
CAMERON: Oh, I see.

1422
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,254
So you're thinking
about the students?

1423
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:17,092
Yes, that's... that's what...
that's what this is all about.

1424
01:14:17,135 --> 01:14:20,484
Oh, OK, so... All right, so, um...
Stay with me here.

1425
01:14:20,528 --> 01:14:23,910
So what you're saying is
since Mr. Brackett's gay...

1426
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:28,621
that he's going to send out
some kind of voodoo vibes...

1427
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:33,740
or gay microwaves
and make everybody else gay?

1428
01:14:33,776 --> 01:14:37,092
HALLIWELL:
In a crude manner of speaking.

1429
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:39,852
CAMERON: Well, seniors,
you've all had Mr. Brackett.

1430
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:41,546
Is that the way it works?

1431
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:44,998
HALLIWELL: Kids, you don't have
to answer that question.

1432
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,276
AVA: It's an inappropriate
forum to discuss this.

1433
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:49,548
HALLIWELL: This is still
a graduation ceremony.

HOWARD: Jack.

1441
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:19,978
I had Mr. Brackett
for senior English.

1442
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,674
He taught me Shakespeare.

He was my track coach...

and he also helped me
get into college.

I just realized that what
Mr. Halliwell said is right.

with Mr. Brackett or Jack...

01:24:30,142 --> 01:24:33,852
I'm not that chained up little
person still in love with you.

1629
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:35,773
And so you felt
like dropping in...

1630
01:24:35,806 --> 01:24:37,693
and just expect me to be free...

1631
01:24:37,726 --> 01:24:39,799
but now I'm saving
all my lovin'...

1632
01:24:39,838 --> 01:24:41,463
for someone who's lovin' me.

1633
01:24:41,502 --> 01:24:43,258
Go on, now, go.

1634
01:24:43,294 --> 01:24:45,236
Walk out the door.

1635
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:47,133
Just turn around now.

1636
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,435
You're not welcome anymore.

1637
01:24:50,014 --> 01:24:52,916
Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with good-bye?

1638
01:24:52,959 --> 01:24:54,715
Did you think I'd crumble?

1639
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,790
Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

1640
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,554
No, not I.

1641
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,412
I will survive.

1642
01:25:00,447 --> 01:25:04,408
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll stay alive.

1643
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:08,221
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give.

1644
01:25:08,254 --> 01:25:09,847
I'll survive.

1645
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,734
I will survive.

1646
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:15,484
Hey.

1647
01:25:15,518 --> 01:25:17,405
Go, now, go.

1648
01:25:17,438 --> 01:25:19,260
Walk out the door.

1649
01:25:19,295 --> 01:25:21,204
Just turn around now...

1650
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,930
'cause you're not welcome
anymore.

1651
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:26,781
Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with good-bye?

1652
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:28,669
Did you think I'd crumble?

1653
01:25:28,702 --> 01:25:30,611
Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

1654
01:25:30,655 --> 01:25:32,443
Oh, no, not I.

1655
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:34,366
I will survive.

1656
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,360
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll stay alive.

1657
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:42,140
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give.

1658
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:43,865
I'll survive.

1659
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,724
I will survive.

1660
01:25:45,759 --> 01:25:47,930
I will survive.

1661
01:25:47,966 --> 01:25:49,657
I will survive.

1662
01:25:49,694 --> 01:25:50,774
Hey.

1663
01:25:50,815 --> 01:25:52,637
I... I will survive.

1664
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,493
I'll be there.

1665
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:57,276
I... I will survive.

1666
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,390
Yeah, yeah.

1667
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,951
I... l... l...
I... l... l...

1668
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,135
Oh, yeah...

1669
01:26:02,174 --> 01:26:04,116
I... I will survive.

1670
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:05,910
Ooh.

1671
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,892
I... I will survive.

1672
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:09,625
I'm dancin' all night.

1673
01:26:09,663 --> 01:26:11,605
I... I will survive.

1674
01:26:13,022 --> 01:26:17,179
I... l... l... l...
I... l... l... l...

1675
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:20,956
I... l've got
all my love to give.

1676
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,648
I... I will survive.

1677
01:26:22,686 --> 01:26:24,791
I've got all my life to live.

1678
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,423
I... I will survive.

1679
01:26:26,462 --> 01:26:28,350
My lovin' is not in vain.

1680
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:32,376
I... l... l... l...
I... l... l... l...

1681
01:26:32,414 --> 01:26:34,170
I... I will survive...

1682
01:26:34,206 --> 01:26:36,181
I will survive.

1683
01:26:36,222 --> 01:26:37,880
I... I will survive...

1684
01:26:37,918 --> 01:26:40,006
I will survive.

1685
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:42,022
I... I will survive.
