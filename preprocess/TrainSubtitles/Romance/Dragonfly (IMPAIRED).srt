00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:26,270
All right.

304
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,301
Crucifix made of Jell-O?

305
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:34,607
Man, you're good.
He's good.

306
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,444
He hasn't stopped drawing
them since he got out
of the l.C.U. yesterday.

307
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:43,087
So what is it?

308
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,521
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

309
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,582
Just woke up
thinking about it.

310
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:50,457
I happened to be
in the l.C.U.
yesterday, Jeffrey.

311
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,191
I know.
I saw you in there.

312
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:55,529
You saw me in there?

313
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:58,798
Yeah. You came in
through the back of the room
standing over my bed.

314
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:05,165
You saw me
come over to your bed?

315
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:08,873
Pretty sure it was you.
But the tie was different.

316
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,074
Jeffrey!

317
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,674
Could I ask--

318
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:17,051
We're not encouraged
to discuss these things.

319
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:20,990
There was a nun on the ward
interviewing kids who'd had
near-death experiences.

320
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,653
Sister Madeline
from Chaplain Services.

321
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:27,256
Stirred up all kinds of
trouble for the hospital
when some of it appeared...

322
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,959
on a TV tabloid show.

323
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,763
She never even
talked to me...

324
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:33,737
and I've got the best
near-death experiences
of anyone.

325
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:39,367
I'm allowed a coffee break
if there's a doctor with him.

326
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,641
In spite of hospital policy,
I think they need to talk
about it.

327
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:48,077
You're scheduled for
a CAT scan, Jeffrey.
Don't go without me.

328
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,931
So what are we talking
about here, Jeffrey?

329
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:04,264
What we shouldn't.

330
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:07,066
In the l.C.U. yesterday,
when I approached your bed...

331
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,539
it seemed to me
you were pretty--

332
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:12,907
- I was flat-lined.
- Exactly.

333
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:16,880
So how could you
look up and see me?
Couldn't.

334
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:19,975
- But you said--
- I looked down.

335
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,986
You looked down?

336
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,455
From the ceiling.
That's where I was
when I saw you.

337
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,396
Okay.

338
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,523
Don't believe me?

339
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,362
Should l?

340
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:39,897
Ever see that little
bald spot on top of your head?

341
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,642
Bend down here.

342
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,837
Come on.
Bend down here.

343
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:51,677
Yeah, that was you.
[ Giggling ]

344
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:58,450
Jeffrey,
do you know my name?

345
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:02,254
You look like a--
a William to me.

346
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,318
I'm a Joe.

347
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,330
Does it ring a bell?

348
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,168
Emily's Joe?

349
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,139
Joe Darrow.

350
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,369
I saw her yesterday too.

351
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:23,414
What do you mean,
Jeffrey, you saw her?

352
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:26,110
She was there.

353
00:28:27,486 --> 00:28:29,716
Where?

354
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,722
All around me.

355
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:36,888
Inside the rainbow.

356
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:40,489
The mist.
I was falling...

357
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:42,533
falling through it...

358
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:46,469
until she caught me...

359
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:48,472
then brought me
back up.

360
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:51,902
She kind of flew me.

361
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,775
She flew me out...

362
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:59,075
so I could come back...

363
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:02,949
and tell somebody something.

364
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:05,319
Tell what, Jeffrey?

365
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,050
To who?

366
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:12,922
Joe.

367
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:16,163
Tell me what, Jeffrey?

368
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,170
Tell Joe what?

369
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,938
It was loud in the rainbow...

370
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,943
Iike thunder in there.

371
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:30,243
- Tell me what, Jeffrey?
- I don't know.

372
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,749
You were calling my name.

373
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,548
Joe.

374
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,418
Joe!

375
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,424
Joe, can't you hear me?

376
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:43,017
Joe!
All right, Jeffrey.

377
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:46,553
Joe! Joe!
Jeffrey, slow down.

378
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,861
Whoa, whoa.

379
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:51,926
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.

380
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:53,937
Just breathe.

381
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:56,132
Just breathe
a little bit, okay?

382
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,309
What happened?

383
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,572
I'm fine.
We were--

384
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:04,444
He wanted to know
what happened yesterday.

385
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:07,314
His heart stopped again.
I know.

386
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:10,320
- I was there, actually.
- He wanted to know
what happened...

387
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:12,322
while it was stopped.

388
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,858
Oh. Telling one of
his tall tales again.

389
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,860
Trying to get on TV.

390
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:20,295
I'm gonna give him a dust mop
next time so he can sweep
the ceiling while he's up there.

391
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,663
My daddy don't believe me.

392
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:25,736
He do the "bald spot"
on you?

393
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:31,372
[ Laughing ]

394
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:33,377
It don't work
on everybody.

395
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:37,506
Just us bald guys, huh?
Phew! Yeah, he got me
with that one too.

396
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:43,883
You had me going there,
Jeffrey.
It was the truth.

397
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:45,980
You don't believe me?

398
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:49,151
[ Woman Over P.A., lndistinct ]

399
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:54,423
What if I do remember what
she wants to tell you...

400
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,161
then would you believe me?

401
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,203
Do you remember it?

402
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:02,069
If you come back, I might.

403
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,074
[ Father ]
What who wants to tell him?

404
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:07,543
[ Jeffrey ]
His wife. She wants me
to tell him something.

405
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:11,207
Probably to take
out the trash, huh?
[ Chuckles ]

406
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:55,958
[ Woman Chuckling ]
[ Man ]
What?

407
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,359
[ Joe ]
He even had me believing
he saw my bald spot...

408
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,399
from the ceiling,
till I saw a mirror
behind my head.

409
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:04,026
[ Man ]
We can thank Mom for those
genes, right, Dad?

410
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:07,629
I hate to burst your bubble,
Joe, but I can see
your bald spot from here.

411
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:10,675
I think bald is sexy.

412
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:12,676
Really?
Yes.

413
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:14,678
I've got a parrot
that might turn you on.

414
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,715
Are you still
living with that
messy thing? Joe!

415
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:20,876
We're working on
our relationship.
Is it a talking parrot?

416
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:23,386
A listening parrot.

417
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:27,016
A bird after my own heart.
That's what I do
for a living: listen.

418
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:29,026
Really?

419
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:33,463
Gwyn's a grief counselor, Joe.
That's why I thought it might
be a good idea for you to meet.

420
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,702
Is that right?

421
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,104
I've heard a lot of clients talk
about the near-death experiences
of their loved ones--

422
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,506
how they'd wake up talking
about being in a dark tunnel...

423
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:47,511
moving toward the light.

424
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:49,570
And what's
your thought on it?

425
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:53,414
I'm just your parrot,
Joe. Just listening.

426
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:56,977
[ Man ] I can tell you
as an eye surgeon,
it's all very simple.

427
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:59,615
The tunnel is
literal tunnel vision.

428
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:02,421
And the white light
is the gradual bleaching out
of the optic screen.

429
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,860
As it grows bigger,
it would seem like
you're moving toward it.

430
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,659
How do you explain
their ability to recall
what everyone said...

431
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:10,166
around their deathbed after
they were declared dead--

432
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:12,362
to describe what
the doctors were wearing...

433
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,803
down to the patterns
on their ties?

434
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:17,171
[ Man ]
It's the way
we measure death.

435
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:21,372
Obviously the brain
is still functioning
on some subliminal level...

436
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:25,177
soaking up all the last bits
of what's left to hear and see.

437
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,378
That's what you get
for having dinner
with a family of doctors--

438
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,387
no discussion about
floating around
on the ceiling;

439
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,650
no tunnel;
no bright lights.

440
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:35,158
Next thing, they're gonna
tell us there's no tooth fairy.

441
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,958
Funny thing is,
I thought I heard him
calling out for me.

442
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:44,297
This kid.

443
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:47,236
I heard his voice
calling 'Joe. "

444
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:52,502
And when I introduced myself
to him, he asked me
if I was Emily's Joe.

445
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,909
Said that Emily
was trying to reach me.

446
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:02,611
Do you believe
she's trying to
reach you, Joe?

447
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:07,450
No, Counselor, I don't.

448
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:14,588
I can give you
an hour for free.

449
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:21,795
Bye, Joe. You want me to
package up dessert for you?

450
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,807
Sorry.
Use your phone?

451
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,576
Excuse me.

452
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,323
I am kind of busy
at the moment, yeah.

453
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,389
Well, isn't there anyone else
who can cover for me tonight?

454
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:48,432
All right. I understand.
I'll be right over.

455
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:54,297
I'm sorry.
I'd really like to stay.
No, you wouldn't.

456
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,306
It's too threatening.

457
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:59,810
It's about unresolved issues
you're not ready

Of course I haven't.
- And why haven't you?
