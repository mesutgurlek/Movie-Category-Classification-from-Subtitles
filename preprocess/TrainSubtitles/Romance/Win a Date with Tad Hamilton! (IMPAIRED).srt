1
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:29,423
[radio] And now for all you romantics
out there, this one is for you.

2
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,292
Hello, Betty.

3
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:42,973
Shouldn't you be at the hospital,
looking after a certain other soldier?

4
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:46,274
Is there any way you can find it
in your heart to forgive me?

5
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,181
I wonder if these two get together.

6
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:57,821
I'll forgive you on one condition.

7
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:02,294
- What's that?
- Dance with me.

8
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:30,746
Explain one thing to me.

9
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:38,325
What kind of desperate and pathetic
emotional cripple

10
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,923
would actually buy that as an ending?

11
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,535
Rosie, do you think that in real life

12
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,046
Tad Hamilton is the man
he seems to be on the screen?

13
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:58,813
Absolutely. I mean,
you just can't fake that kind of thing.

14
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,115
What do you think Tad Hamilton
is doing right now?

15
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,486
I'll bet he's in church.

16
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:14,856
[Tad] Watch this.

17
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,098
[Tad] Yeah! Whoo!

18
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,345
- Told you that was him, right?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,313
Tad Hamilton.

20
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,010
[Driven Levy]
You don't make it easy on us, Tad.

21
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,382
[Tad] What do you mean?

22
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:35,444
This is the shot the paparazzi got.

23
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:41,352
Congratulations. You're actually
drinking, driving, smoking,

24
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,726
leering and groping at the same time.

25
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:48,825
Which, on the one hand, is just about
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

26
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:49,960
Richard.

27
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:55,201
But, on the other hand, it can be argued
this might be bad for the image.

28
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,436
You play characters who have heart.

29
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,343
This is a person
who will have a heart attack.

30
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:04,679
I can't believe you guys are blaming
my unemployment on this photograph.

31
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:09,017
You are not unemployed.
Dockworkers are unemployed.

32
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,490
You are simply between
million-dollar paydays.

33
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:18,327
As are we, since we both get
a percentage of your payday.

34
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,523
But this isn't about us.

35
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:26,629
Whatever happened to that part in the
Jimmy Ing movie? I'm perfect for that.

36
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:29,607
Well, he's taking a breath.

37
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,577
- He's what?
- He's taking a breath.

38
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,706
He's pausing before deciding.

39
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:38,216
He's hemming and hawing
and taking a breath.

40
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:41,378
And this is only going
to make him breathe more.

41
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:45,220
- What do we do?
- Asphyxiate the son of a bitch.

42
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,818
- We generate a little positive PR.
- What are you, an interpreter?

43
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:53,559
I'm saying we just need
to do something, Tad,

44
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,296
to remind Jimmy Ing and America
that you are the boy next door.

45
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,429
I am the boy next door,

46
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:03,704
if you happen to live
in a very dysfunctional neighborhood.

47
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:49,119
[Pete] Congratulations. You've eaten
your body weight in Pringles.

48
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,180
What's your favorite Pringle?

49
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,817
Sour cream and onion or original?

50
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:58,193
Well, the sour cream and onion
has a very strong taste.

51
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:01,825
So if you're eating a small amount,
half a can, you want that strength.

52
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:06,065
But if you're eating more, you want
the original. It's a cleaner flavor.

53
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:11,133
Wait until you discover barbecue flavor.
You'll finally become a woman.

54
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:14,339
How's Modern Grocer
treating you over there, Pete?

55
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,905
This is the swimsuit issue.

56
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,922
- oh, my God.
- What is it?

57
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,586
- Win a date with Tad Hamilton.
- What?

58
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,925
It's to benefit Save the Children.

59
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:34,262
- That is so like him.
- Saving children. I know.

60
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,767
Ohhh!

61
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:41,232
- Should I enter?
- Why not?

62
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:44,037
Sure. Heaven is just a mouse click away.

63
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,810
A mouse click and 1 00-buck donation.

64
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,213
We can raise 1 00 bucks.

65
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:58,617
- With your permission, Petey.
- I'm sorry?

66
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,629
- Paper or plastic?
- Paper, please.

67
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:08,497
Would you help Rosalee win a date with
Tad Hamilton and help Save the Children?

68
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,502
I certainly would.

69
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,936
- Aren't these great?
- The best.

70
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:21,537
Along with a $1 25 check

71
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:26,210
in recognition of yet another Piggly
Wiggly Store Manager of the Month Award.

72
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:29,153
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Mr. Ruddy.

73
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:31,690
So, Pete, when do we
lose you to Richmond?

74
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,283
Because you're running
out of wall space here.

75
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:39,198
Well, I got my acceptance letter
to Virginia State.

76
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,428
- That's good.
- And I got my student loan.

77
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:46,598
So, there's just one more thing.

78
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:49,904
- What?
- There's someone here that I...

79
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,269
I need to have a discussion with

80
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:58,010
about the going
to Richmond with me issue.

81
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,515
Jars are full.

82
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:07,458
I love everybody in this store so much.

83
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:10,690
Sorry for interrupting. Sorry.

84
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,711
It was nice to meet you.

85
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,842
It was nice to meet you, too.

86
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,251
- Good night.
- Good night.

87
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,483
- Are you taking off?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,153
Muchas gracias.

89
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,697
Hasta el próximo miércoles.

90
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,233
I am the Albanian one, Mr. Hamilton.

91
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:53,431
I'm sorry.
Could you tell the other one...

92
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:57,033
"Muchas gracias" and
"hasta el próximo miércoles."

93
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,101
- Will do.
- Thank you.

94
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,383
oK, what do I need to beat you?

95
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:22,089
Double 1 4, or it's all over.

96
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:24,652
That's not going to be a problem.

97
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:30,928
Don't miss. Don't miss, don't miss,
don't miss, don't miss, don't miss.

98
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,802
Um, are you actually doing that? Yeah.

99
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,114
And now Pete will get
the bartendress's attention.

100
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:53,386
- She's waiting for you.
- And we're waiting for our round, Pete.

101
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:56,485
Fine.

102
00:11:58,564 --> 00:11:59,929
Angelica.

103
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:10,772
Yes, Pete?
What is the object of your desire?

104
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,275
We need another round.

105
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:20,748
one day, Pete, one day,

106
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,551
I know that the answer to that question
will be "You, Angelica."

107
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,151
"You are the object of my desire."

108
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:33,760
oK. But for now
we'll just go with the beers.

109
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,411
oh, Pete.

110
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:47,402
Enough. Thank you, ladies.

111
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,971
You don't like her
the teeniest, tiniest bit?

112
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,040
What? Rosie...

113
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,882
No, she's not my type, oK?

114
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,650
[Rosie] You are so particular.

115
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,714
Who the heck are they?

116
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,388
If that fire alarm went off again...

117
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,091
[Pete] Why would they send
a news crew for that?

118
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,928
Wait a second.

119
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,199
Right here, please.

120
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:27,009
In first class you get a DVD player
and may view the film of your choice.

121
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:30,021
I'd like to touch intimately
whoever thought of that.

122
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,718
[announcer] We would like to begin
boarding our first-class passengers.

123
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:36,421
- That's you.
- I know.

124
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,623
Guys. Just take it easy, oK?

125
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:42,259
Just give me a hug and tell me
to have a good time, please?

126
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,768
oK.

127
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,837
Just be careful, oK?

128
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:54,912
- What do you mean?
- I mean that this guy is Tad Hamilton.

129
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:59,748
In his life, he's probably
slept with like 1 5, 20 women.

130
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,854
No way. That's not even
physically possible.

131
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:07,086
Besides, like he's going
to be interested in me.

132
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,757
If he claims he doesn't like watching
sports, he's trying to sleep with you.

133
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,163
Got it.

134
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,464
If he claims to love animals,
he's trying to sleep with you.

135
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:20,335
- ok.
- Guys are guys. Rich or poor.

136
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:23,466
Famous or grocers.

137
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,603
- Right.
- Just do me one favor, ok?

138
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:31,180
- Guard your carnal treasure.
- ok.

139
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,378
- Just guard your carnal treasure.
- Thanks, Pete.

140
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,648
- Remember everything.
- I will.

141
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:39,156
- Remember how he smells.
- I will.

142
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,194
But not just vaguely.
I want good, solid similes.

143
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:47,790
For example: he smells like a forest
on the first day of spring.

144
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:51,462
oK, Cathy.
You're going to miss your flight.

145
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,165
- I will bring you similes.
- Thank you.

146
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:58,142
I almost forgot. I got you something.

147
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,975
It's regular flavor.

148
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:05,849
In case you don't like
the prime rib in first class.

149
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:08,951
Thank you, Pete.

150
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,382
Right this way.

151
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:21,358
- Just guard your carnal treasure.
- I heard you.

152
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:59,605
- That's me.
- Welcome to Los Angeles.

153
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,801
Oh!

154
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,500
- Can I have these?
- No.

155
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:12,874
Do you want to think about it?

156
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,970
Gee, what...

157
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:17,880
Tell me why you're making me
have dinner with an okie.

158
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,317
Because she's wholesome
as the amber waves of grain.

159
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:24,185
And she's not an okie.
She's from West Virginia.

160
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,148
So sorry.

161
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,354
You never wear them.
Can I just have them?

162
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:35,098
- So what's her name anyway?
- Rosalee Futch.

163
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,328
Sounds insanely hot.

164
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,065
It's very nice to meet you, Tad.

165
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:44,136
It's so nice to meet you, Tad.

166
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:47,975
It's great to meet you.

167
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,038
Please, just follow the rules.

168
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,051
"Smile for the cameras.
No brown liquor or cigarettes."

169
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,110
- Fine.
- Very good.

170
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,678
What about Jimmy Ing?
Have we heard anything?

171
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,588
No. Still breathing.

172
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:02,491
I passed Ashton Kutcher in my car
and he seemed happy.

173
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:06,827
He's happy for other reasons. I'm sorry.
We have not heard from Jimmy Ing.

174
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:09,595
Hey, guys, how's this in the shoulders?

175
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:11,815
Seriously.
Because I got some yoga stuff.

176
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:19,578
Your films will stand the test of time.

177
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:26,689
Your films will stand the test of time.

178
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,830
Hi. I'm Tad.

179
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:47,270
Your standing films will time
and test themselves.

180
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:52,611
Thank you. You're pretty.

181
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,913
It's Roseanne, right?
I'm sorry, what is it?

182
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:01,416
Ricky?

183
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:03,860
- It's Rosalee.
- Rosalee.

184
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,727
Rosalee. Nice to meet you.

185
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:12,667
- So, you ready? ok, let's...

186
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,234
Yikes-a-bee.

187
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:23,946
So, how was your flight?

188
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:26,678
Your films will stand the test of time.

189
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,119
Thank you.

190
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,758
- So, you ready?
- For what?

191
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:35,817
Right this way.

192
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,376
Rosalee Futch.

193
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:09,617
[Tad] lt'll take a few minutes for the spots
in your eyes to go away, but they will.

194
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:12,687
- oK.
- We're right here.

195
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:17,059
Is it always like that?

196
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:23,031
Well, pretty much.

197
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:26,401
- Shake-a-doo.
- Shake a what?

198
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,907
It just means "Wow."

199
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:35,676
Shake-a-doo.
Shake-a-doo, I like that.

200
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,746
So...

201
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:41,955
- You excited?
- Are you kidding?

202
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:45,622
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Yeah, I figured.

203
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:53,635
- You oK?
- Yeah.

204
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:56,436
I'm just not used to sitting
sideways like this.

205
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:02,105
We don't have sideways seating
in West Virginia.

206
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:05,480
And I think the cigarette smoke
is kind of...

207
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:08,577
You can come sit back here if you like.

208
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:11,146
I can't really move right now.

209
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:16,151
Boy, I don't feel well. I've always been
kind of motion sickness-y.

210
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:18,788
once, this carnival
came to Fraziers Bottom,

211
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:21,424
and they had that ride
where it spins around

212
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,439
and you have to stand against the side
and the center falls out.

213
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:30,134
- And I...
- Damn it.

214
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,635
- Pardon me.

215
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,179
Ahh!

216
00:21:38,984 --> 00:21:42,317
This is just so far from the way
I imagined the evening going.

217
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,454
It's perfectly all right.
Right, Mickey?

218
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,893
- Perfectly all right.
- [Tad] Shall we?

219
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:54,228
[Mickey] Have a nice dinner.
I'll just be out here scrubbing.

220
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,995
[Tad] Hey, Steve.

221
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:59,162
- Good to see you, Mr. Hamilton.
- Good to see you, Larry.

222
00:21:59,238 --> 00:22:02,537
- Hey, man, how are you?
- What's up?

223
00:22:15,754 --> 00:22:17,654
Hey.

224
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:19,714
This way.

225
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:27,057
Doesn't it hurt,
smiling like that all the time?

226
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,359
You get used to it.

227
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,428
- Should I do it?
- Yeah.

228
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,167
You might not be able
to hold it long, but go for it.

229
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:38,233
Sure I will.

230
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,215
See that?
It sort of gets you right there.

231
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:50,722
- That's horrible.
- I told you.

232
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:55,618
- You sure do have a lot of stuff.
- Yeah, sorry.

233
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:58,663
I'm never out of touch
with the people who torment me.

234
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:00,961
Who are they?

235
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:04,434
Agents, managers, people like that.

236
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:08,030
This man, Jimmy Ing, who's
making this movie I'm exactly right for

237
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:11,008
but, for whatever reason,
he's taking a breath.

238
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:14,341
- A what?
- He's thinking it over.

239
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:18,713
It's just all very competitive,
this business, that's all.

240
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,878
Everybody seems to be
chasing the same thing.

241
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:26,288
The same parts in the same movies,
the same awards, the same big money.

242
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:31,285
Well, I'm sure you have too much common
sense to get caught up in all that.

243
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:36,995
I mean, it's just a recipe
for an unsatisfying life.

244
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:43,472
obviously you have
your priorities straight, so...

245
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,706
- So, Rosalee, what do you do?
- I work in a Piggly Wiggly.

246
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:52,444
- I'm sorry?
- A supermarket.

247
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,509
- I bag and check.
- Cool.

248
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:56,645
Yeah. It's a real dream come true.

249
00:23:58,157 --> 00:24:01,126
But it's fun.
My two best friends work there.

250
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,932
So, what do you do, Tad?

251
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:12,166
Oops.

252
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:19,439
What I mean is, what do you do
when you're not doing what you do?

253
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,479
Not a lot, you know.

254
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:26,610
There's not a lot of time
left for hobbies, really.

255
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:31,281
And I don't really like watching sports,
so I read.

256
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:35,851
Play with my dog,
my cat, my bird, you know.

257
00:24:36,862 --> 00:24:40,298
I... I love animals, you know?

258
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,367
What do you think
they're doing right now?

259
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,707
I bet they're in her hotel room,
straining for breath.

260
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,907
His manhood yearning to be free.

261
00:24:56,982 --> 00:25:00,850
Her hands running over
the ripples in his abdomen.

262
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:04,446
Her perfect bosom crying out in ecstasy.

263
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:10,689
Great.

264
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:12,754
All righty.

265
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:30,243
- I had one of those.
- A retainer?

266
00:25:30,315 --> 00:25:34,081
Yeah, on the lowers
and a night brace for the uppers.

267
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:36,144
I had really bad teeth as a kid.

268
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:38,815
Yeah, I'm sure
you were a real ugly duckling.

269
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:43,885
I was like anybody else.
A little gawky, unsure who I was.

270
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,226
Combination skin.

271
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:50,563
- Well, you came together nicely.
- Thank you.

272
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,629
So did you.

273
00:25:58,544 --> 00:26:01,638
- Bon appétit!
- Umm-hmm!

274
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:21,789
[Rosie] Thanks, Mickey.

275
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,031
oh, wow. This is beautiful.

276
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:34,377
These people sure leave
a lot of lights on.

277
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:36,437
It's beautiful.

278
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:39,874
It is.

279
00:26:42,054 --> 00:26:46,115
And you, if I may say so,
are also very beautiful.

280
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:53,423
How would you like to come back
to my house for a little bit?

281
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:06,805
Sure. For a little bit.

282
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:37,735
- Shake-a-doo?
- No, shake-a-doo.

283
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,800
Good.

284
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,611
[Tad] Miss Ramirez.

285
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:49,677
Sonja.

286
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:52,047
Anybody in the casa?

287
00:27:58,297 --> 00:27:59,730
I think we're all alone.

288
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:01,988
oh!

289
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:08,663
Do you want to come in a little further?

290
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,477
Um, you know what, Tad, thank you, but
I think I should get back to the hotel.

291
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:17,879
Wow.

292
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:20,448
oK.

293
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:24,545
I don't want the concierge
to worry, you know.

294
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:31,320
Good for you. Good for you.
I'll take you home.

295
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,887
You don't have to do that.
You're already here.

296
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:36,264
No, it would be my pleasure.

297
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:39,668
oK, thanks.
That's really nice.

298
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:45,839
Rosalee, it's been
wonderful to meet you.

299
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:48,903
I wish you only good things in life.

300
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:52,382
And to me, wonderfulness, too.

301
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:56,444
And to you,
only the self same good wishes.

302
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:00,657
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, of course.

303
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:04,321
- Thanks for the best night of my life.
- No, thank you.

304
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,058
May I give you a kiss goodbye?

305
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:15,099
I think you might maybe may.

306
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:34,050
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

307
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:39,386
Good night, Rosalee.

308
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:45,092
Sweet dreams.

309
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,146
God!

310
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:22,799
The limo door swung open.

311
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:26,739
My foot hit the ground

312
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:30,213
and I turned to take
one last look at Tad.

313
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:33,843
At those eyes, at that smile.

314
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,514
And then, regretfully,
I headed back for the hotel.

315
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,456
- Please tell me we're done now.
- We're done.

316
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:47,362
Wow. I cannot remember a time
before you started telling that story.

317
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:51,163
Peter, I was asked to provide
a detailed description of the evening.

318
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,262
And you did.
Actually, Rosie, you did a great job.

319
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,637
I felt like I was there.

320
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,733
Sort of against my will, but I did.

321
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,210
oK, guys, with your permission,

322
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,511
I think we should all now
return to our normal lives.

323
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,011
oK.

324
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:12,420
Actually...

325
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:18,690
Rosie, I kind of had something
that I wanted to ask you.

326
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,403
Rosie.

327
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:31,465
Whatever.

328
00:31:32,377 --> 00:31:36,609
It's something that
I think you're going to like.

329
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:39,275
I hope you're going to like.

330
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:43,788
Something I really hope
you're going to like.

331
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:47,689
It's been a long time coming,
so it might be kind of a surprise.

332
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,592
or not, or maybe not. I don't know.

333
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:52,755
I'm like...

334
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:57,961
Look, oK,
what I'm trying to say is that

335
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,097
I...

336
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:05,299
Hey.

337
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:15,184
Let me ask you, what would be
the absolute worst thing

338
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:18,188
that could happen to me right now?

339
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,527
- Hi.
- Hi.

340
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:38,802
I'm Tad.

341
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:41,004
This is my Cathy friend.

342
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:47,274
- And my Pete friend.
- I'm Tad.

343
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:49,843
It's quite pleased and pleasant to...

344
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,683
I've heard a lot about you both.

345
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:56,090
- Have you?
- Yeah.

346
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,927
- So what are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

347
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,128
- No way. You're just... That's just...
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

348
00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:07,694
- You can't... Here?
- It's true.

349
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:12,539
You mean your normal business itinerary
does not include Fraziers Bottom?

350
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:14,340
No.

351
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:17,681
oK, Cathy.

352
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:20,650
- Am I too late to take you to lunch?
- No.

353
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,819
- Great. Shall we?
- Yeah.

354
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,358
- If that's oK, Pete.
- Well, actually...

355
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,689
- If that's oK.
- It's oK.

356
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:32,696
If you're going back
to the airport I'll ride with you.

357
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:35,790
By the route 73 cloverleaf,
I'll have given myself to you

358
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,495
in ways you have only
read about in the drugstore.

359
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:44,534
- It was great to meet you.
- You, too.

360
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:50,342
Was there something
that you wanted to tell me?

361
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,407
It was nothing.

362
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:55,476
oK.

363
00:34:10,602 --> 00:34:12,593
- Wow. Nice car.
- Thanks.

364
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:16,664
I asked the manager for a rental convertible
and he gave me his wife's car.

365
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,240
Really?

366
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:22,644
And that was the last time
we ever saw her.

367
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:27,642
Cathy, he's not her type.

368
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,157
No. Rich, famous, handsome,
ass like cement.

369
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:35,715
You are absolutely right.

370
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:44,668
- [cook] Move these cheeseburgers.
- [waitress] Here you go, sweetpea.

371
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:47,728
oh, my gosh.

372
00:34:47,806 --> 00:34:50,104
- Here you go, Rosie.
- Thanks.

373
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,166
Thank you.

374
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,475
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

375
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,717
I still can't believe you're here.

376
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,815
It was something I had to do.

377
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:12,329
Sure. Fly clear across the country to
have lunch at the Fraziers Bottom Diner.

378
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:15,161
I couldn't let that night
be the last time I saw you.

379
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:17,667
Can I just stop you
and remind you of one thing?

380
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:20,398
- What's that?
- I'm nobody.

381
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:23,168
Rosalee, nobody is nobody.

382
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:27,334
- Fine.
- I'm following my gut.

383
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:32,940
Sometimes you have to do that,
even if what you're doing seems crazy.

384
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:38,786
Because in the gap between
what prudence says we should do

385
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:45,854
and what our heart tells us we must do,
well, Rosie, therein lies our humanity.

386
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:51,024
That's from The Road to El Dorado.

387
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:57,608
You really are a big fan, aren't you?

388
00:35:57,676 --> 00:36:01,009
Is that how you get women?
You steal lines from your own movies?

389
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,445
Not anymore. Wow.

390
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:06,484
I hope not. That would
shoot a hole in your credibility.

391
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:12,387
Rosie, the truth is
that when we went on our date

392
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:14,857
you said something
that resonated with me.

393
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:18,555
You said you were sure
I had my priorities straight.

394
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,466
But here's the thing.
I don't. I really don't.

395
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:28,233
My entire life has been about
becoming successful, famous,

396
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:31,469
becoming this thing that I am.

397
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:34,068
And you were right,
it really is unsatisfying.

398
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:38,809
I need a positive influence, somebody
with solid and substantial qualities,

399
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:40,976
somebody who seems to understand life

400
00:36:41,052 --> 00:36:43,680
and how to live it
in a good and happy way, like you.

401
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:46,213
I just want to be around you.

402
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,021
I want some of that goodness
to rub off on me.

403
00:36:52,197 --> 00:36:54,859
Do you mean goodness
in a romantic way?

404
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:58,164
No, a platonic goodness.
And I mean that very seriously.

405
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:00,227
No funny business here.

406
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,372
- Did I say something wrong?
- No. No, no, no. No.

407
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:12,041
So, are you going to be
in Fraziers Bottom for a while, then?

408
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:17,555
I think I have to. If I'm going to reset
my priorities, I got to get out of LA.

409
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:19,613
I got to get out of that fishbowl.

410
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,323
So, what do you say?

411
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,561
I say, yikes-a-bee.

412
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:38,066
What does that mean?

413
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:41,306
It's just something my dad and I say
when life surprises you

414
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,370
and there's nowhere to go but forward.

415
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,442
- Is that like "yes"?
- Yes.

416
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,817
Yes.

417
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:58,085
Thanks for lunch.

418
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:02,826
- I'll see you at seven, then.
- See you at seven.

419
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:05,062
- oK.
- oK.

420
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:29,254
Stop. Seriously.

421
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:32,057
You go, girl. You get your man.

422
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:01,363
It's room eight.

423
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,697
Just go down
to the door marked eight.

424
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:05,964
- All right.
- It's just past seven.

425
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:09,269
If you hit nine, you've gone too far.

426
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:11,866
- Got you. No phone calls, please.
- All right.

427
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:14,777
- Thank you.
- Have a great night.

428
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:17,145
- You, too.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

429
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:20,583
- Very good.
- I'm on at 1 1:00.

430
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,643
oK.

431
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,546
Huh.

432
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:13,194
He wants your goodness
to rub off on him.

433
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:16,605
- I know, right?
- I see.

434
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:20,873
And you actually believe this?

435
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:23,176
- Why wouldn't I?
- Wow, Rosie.

436
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:27,446
There's innocent, there's childlike,
and then there's just asking for it.

437
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,749
He wants your goodness
to rub off on him?

438
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:32,722
He wants your ass
to rub off on him is more like it.

439
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,850
- oh, my God.
- Yeah. Whatever.

440
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:38,795
- You can't go out with him tonight.
- What do you mean I can't?

441
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:43,028
I mean that I need you
to stay for the late shift.

442
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:46,127
Janine's sick.
Yeah, she's got a cough.

443
00:40:46,204 --> 00:40:51,335
- She does not.
- No, not yet, but she will.

444
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,311
She's definitely coming down
with something.

445
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:55,812
No, she's not.

446
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,910
Janine, cough for me. Cough for me.

447
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,578
- See? God, it's all in your lungs.
- What is?

448
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,646
- Nothing. You're fine.
- No, you're not.

449
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:08,158
Do not tell my employees
when they are fine.

450
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:10,251
She's fine.

451
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:13,230
Even if she weren't,
you'd have to find somebody else

452
00:41:13,298 --> 00:41:15,892
because I am going out
with Tad Hamilton.

453
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:23,671
- Stop that.
- I did feel something in my lungs.

454
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:28,179
You're not getting off tonight, Janine.
Bob, not now.

455
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:33,583
- [receptionist] Everywhere Inn.
- Yeah.

456
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:37,110
Do you guys have any other rooms?
or how about suites?

457
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:40,955
Well, yeah, we got sweets.
We got some lollies here by the register

458
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:44,357
if you want to come on by
and get yourself a lolly.

459
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:48,490
No, I mean maybe something
a little bigger or newer?

460
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:51,900
- Bigger and newer?
- Yes, I understand what you mean.

461
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,438
And no, we don't have suites like that.

462
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:58,465
oK, I guess that's cool.
That's cool, I guess.

463
00:41:59,611 --> 00:42:01,875
- Can you hold on a second?
- Yes, sir.

464
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:08,282
- Hello.
- Hi, big guy. Where are you?

465
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:11,151
I'm at a motel in Fraziers Bottom,
West Virginia.

466
00:42:11,223 --> 00:42:14,522
oK. Words I never heard anyone utter.

467
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:16,891
- She's special, Richard.
- Who?

468
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:20,728
- The girl from the charity thing.
- The Win-A-Date girl?

469
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,997
You flew to a place actually called
Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia,

470
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,403
and are staying in a motel
in order to nail the Win-A-Date girl?

471
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:30,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

472
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:33,338
I don't want to nail her.
Please don't put it in those terms.

473
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:35,880
Oh, forgive me, Lord Byron.

474
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:38,472
I want to be around her, you know?

475
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,644
She has a goodness.
There's a lot that I can learn from her.

476
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,915
I'm trying to feed my soul, oK?

477
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:47,720
- I'm trying to find a way to be happy.
- You want to be happy now?

478
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:49,920
- This is big for me, Richard.
- oh, God.

479
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:53,089
- This is a turning point for me.
- You think that today.

480
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:56,999
But by the end of the week,
when you've nailed her,

481
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:00,129
you're going to feel differently.

482
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,605
And what do you suppose happens then?

483
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:06,075
- I don't...
- I will tell you what happens then.

484
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:10,740
You pulverize her heart,
and then the press finds out

485
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:14,775
and all the good that was done
by the promotion gets washed away.

486
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:17,617
And Jimmy Ing continues breathing.

487
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:21,181
People like you can't have
relationships with girls from Montana.

488
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:23,090
- West Virginia.
- Whatever.

489
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:25,061
- Why not?
- You're too different.

490
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,121
Your values are different.

491
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,431
- For example, she has them.
- No, this can work.

492
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:34,267
It can't and when it ends,
it's very bad for business.

493
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:37,069
There are more important things
than business.

494
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,944
I don't even know who I'm talking
to now. Hello? Is this Tad?

495
00:43:42,013 --> 00:43:44,413
- What have you done with Tad?
- I got to go, oK?

496
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:49,921
No, you do not got to go. You're going
through some kind of a phase.

497
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:54,049
An extreme version of your normal
in-between-jobs insanity.

498
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:57,425
And it has a hold of you.
You need to come back to LA,

499
00:43:57,496 --> 00:44:00,260
have a Bushmills and a Percocet,
go out with an actress

500
00:44:00,332 --> 00:44:04,063
looking to advance her career and
end this self-destructive behavior.

501
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:07,970
- I'll talk to you soon.
- No, Tad. Bad Tad.

502
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,530
- Bye, Richard.
- Don't hang up on me.

503
00:44:14,513 --> 00:44:16,378
owww!

504
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,244
- Hello?
- Yes, Mr. Hamilton. I am here, sir.

505
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:23,913
You wouldn't happen to have
a masseuse on staff?

506
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:28,016
No, but I am a very fast learner,

507
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:31,790
and I could, you know... Hello?

508
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,251
Coming.

509
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:43,233
You must be Tad.

510
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:45,826
Must be. You are Tad.
I know what you look like.

511
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:48,805
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Futch.
- Henry, for God's sake.

512
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:51,103
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

513
00:45:51,176 --> 00:45:55,670
- Rosie'll be down in a minute.
- oK, great.

514
00:45:55,747 --> 00:45:58,477
May I offer you a chocolate martini?

515
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:03,788
- Wow, look at that.
- I hear they're very big out your way.

516
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:06,085
Yeah? Yeah, I guess they are.

517
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,623
I'm driving, so...

518
00:46:09,694 --> 00:46:11,958
Attaboy.

519
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:16,323
[Mr. Futch] Have a seat.

520
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:27,570
So, it looks like
Emperor's New Clothes

521
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:30,171
will top $1 00 mill in domestic Bo.

522
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:33,573
Yeah.

523
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:37,520
And Quantum Studios, I think
they're looking to vertically integrate,

524
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,251
either by buying a web or a weblet.

525
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:43,458
Could be.

526
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:45,519
Yes. Yeah.

527
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:55,305
- Hey.
- Hi.

528
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:59,400
- I see you've met Dad.
- Yeah. We've been talking shop.

529
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:01,502
So what do you want to do tonight?

530
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:05,242
- Do you guys have a movie theater?
- The Warner.

531
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:08,684
It's part of
the Loews family of theaters.

532
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:12,280
- Have you seen King Arthur of Britain?
- I've been wanting to.

533
00:47:12,357 --> 00:47:14,348
You two enjoy yourselves.

534
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:17,623
Have her back by dawn.
And no cocaine.

535
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:19,288
No, sir.

536
00:47:24,602 --> 00:47:27,093
- How was I?
- You were great, Daddy.

537
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,032
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.

538
00:47:33,044 --> 00:47:36,343
- I'm telling you, that's him.
- oh, yeah.

539
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:38,848
- Mom, I swear it's him.
- You think so?

540
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:40,908
Yes, it's Tad Hamilton.

541
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:42,976
You look so sad there.

542
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,182
[Tad] Give me a break.
I'd just lost my wife and my goat.

543
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:54,055
[TV] Next week, on a very special
Paramedic Rescue...

544
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:06,236
And what were your respective ages?

545
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:11,977
- I was 1 2 and she was 30.
- Did your mother know?

546
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,517
[man] Yeah.

547
00:48:14,919 --> 00:48:16,944
Hasta el próximo miércoles.

548
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:19,785
Ahora disponsible en viernes
in super mercado.

549
00:48:22,227 --> 00:48:27,995
[Tad] So, what do people do at this point
in the evening in Fraziers Bottom?

550
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:30,728
- Well, they go to the diner.
- We could do that.

551
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:34,431
We haven't eaten anything
in almost, what, 1 5 minutes.

552
00:48:34,506 --> 00:48:38,704
- or they go home.
- It is a school night.

553
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:43,510
of course, if it were a date,
we might go to the Watergap overlook.

554
00:48:44,649 --> 00:48:47,641
And what do people do there?

555
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:50,580
They park.

556
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:54,089
And then?

557
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,959
And then they marvel at what
a feat of engineering the gap is.

558
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:00,725
But this isn't a date.
We can't do that.

559
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:02,289
- No.
- No.

560
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:05,063
I don't want to do anything
to harm the friendship.

561
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:09,007
Me neither.

562
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:11,498
over two trillion tons of water

563
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:15,702
pass through the gap every hour.

564
00:49:18,616 --> 00:49:21,608
That's enough water
to float a battleship.

565
00:49:22,854 --> 00:49:24,947
or put out every fire in West Virginia.

566
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:26,786
- No kidding.
- Uh-oh.

567
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,894
Excuse me.

568
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:40,627
Huh.

569
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:54,849
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Futch. It's Pete.

570
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,547
Hiya, Pete. Rosie's not here.

571
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,648
She's out with Tad Hamilton.

572
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:03,694
Really? I hadn't...
oK, cool. Good for her, then.

573
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:06,127
He seems like a very nice guy.

574
00:50:06,197 --> 00:50:10,827
He does. A lovely, lovely guy.

575
00:50:10,902 --> 00:50:13,200
So, like, where did they go?

576
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:16,172
- The movies.
- The movies. oK.

577
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:20,871
It looks like the seven o'clock
would get out at 8.45, 8.50...

578
00:50:22,547 --> 00:50:28,315
or so someone happened
to just mention to me in passing.

579
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:31,321
So I guess that would
put them out and about

580
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:36,053
and onto their next activity.

581
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:40,063
I guess it would, Pete.
I'll leave Rosie a note that you called.

582
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:42,656
Yeah, I just had
a little inventory question.

583
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:46,898
A little dairy-case query.

584
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:49,565
But we can clear that up tomorrow.

585
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,768
oK, Pete. Goodbye.

586
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:55,002
All right.

587
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:00,010
Rosie...

588
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,518
Could I see
your driver's license and regis...

589
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:15,088
- Yikes-a-bee.
- Hello, officer.

590
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:18,158
- Rosalee?
- Hi, Tom.

591
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:21,137
Hi. Wow.

592
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:24,902
- oh, boy.
- oK, then.

593
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:27,103
We heard you were in town,
Mr. Hamilton.

594
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:30,272
- Did you?
- Pretty fond of our Rosalee there, huh?

595
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,782
Yes. Yes, I am, officer.

596
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,286
- Tom?
- Right, right, listen.

597
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:39,289
We got a call saying
that there was someone parked here

598
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:43,589
and you know
it's illegal after sunset, so...

599
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,891
- You got a call at this hour?
- Yeah.

600
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:47,556
From who, a raccoon?

601
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:56,600
Never mind.

602
00:51:56,674 --> 00:52:00,337
[Rosie] I am going to kill Pete, bring him
back to life and then kill him again.

603
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:02,675
[Tad] Calm down. Calm down.

604
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:06,148
- Why aren't you upset?
- Because it doesn't matter.

605
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:09,610
oK?

606
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:16,821
What happened here tonight
was a force of nature.

607
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:25,829
Two people set out to be friends,
but nature would have none of it.

608
00:52:25,903 --> 00:52:28,565
Nature wanted them to be more.

609
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:32,439
And nature is going
to want that tomorrow.

610
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,726
What did I tell you?

611
00:52:56,801 --> 00:53:01,864
What did I tell you about your
carnal treasure?

612
00:53:01,939 --> 00:53:04,032
- You said to guard it.
- I said, guard it.

613
00:53:04,108 --> 00:53:07,874
And what did you do?
You practically chucked it at him.

614
00:53:07,945 --> 00:53:11,574
You're acting like it was a sleazy night.
It wasn't. It was classy.

615
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:15,517
It's not like he took you to the movies
and then felt you up in his car.

616
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:18,350
The evening evolved, Pete.

617
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:20,721
My God, did he actually say that?

618
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:23,317
It started as two friends
going to the movies...

619
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:26,022
- And it evolved into dry humping.
- He fought it.

620
00:53:26,097 --> 00:53:29,760
He didn't want to do anything
that might wreck the friendship.

621
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:36,268
Wow. Did he actually...
I can't believe he used that line.

622
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,935
- And I can't believe you bought it.
- It's not a line.

623
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:43,947
oK, fellas, a show of hands.
Who here has used some form

624
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:47,451
of the "don't want to harm
the friendship" line?

625
00:53:51,756 --> 00:53:55,453
- Father Newell?
- Well, prior to my enfrockment.

626
00:53:56,861 --> 00:54:00,627
Rosie, what are Tad's pectorals
like to the touch?

627
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:02,689
Are they warm yet firm like...

628
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:05,998
- Cath, that's really not helping now.
- Sorry, got caught up.

629
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,561
Thanks. Listen, Rosie, just...

630
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:14,003
Listen to me, bottom line.

631
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:18,071
Tad Hamilton is an actor, ok?

632
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:23,384
How do you know
that he's not acting with you?

633
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:27,685
- He's not acting.
- No.

634
00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:30,284
He is. He's playing a role.

635
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:33,853
The role of Hollywood bad boy
trying to find virtue.

636
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:37,924
oK, after you guys have...

637
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:43,096
After you guys have been
together a couple of times

638
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:47,738
he's out of here, ok?

639
00:54:48,646 --> 00:54:52,082
You will never see him again.

640
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:56,619
Hey, Rosie, guess what?
I bought a house.

641
00:54:56,687 --> 00:55:00,987
I bought a house.
Can you believe it? Can you believe it?

642
00:55:01,058 --> 00:55:05,461
It's actually a farm with a house
and a silo for my wheat.

643
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,966
- Really? You bought a house.
- I bought a house.

644
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:11,797
We're putting down roots, baby.

645
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,998
- What do you think of that?
- It's good.

646
00:55:15,072 --> 00:55:17,131
Come see it. Maybe after work?

647
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,438
- I'd love to.
- Yeah, I'd love to.

648
00:55:23,548 --> 00:55:25,539
Great.

649
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:49,964
[Rosie] He's going to stay in the motel
while he fixes up the farm.

650
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:53,807
- He's a farmer all of a sudden?
- [Rosie] I think he'll be a good farmer.

651
00:55:53,878 --> 00:55:55,937
[Pete] He's from Malibu, California.

652
00:55:56,013 --> 00:55:58,777
The only thing they grow there
are breasts.

653
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,841
[Rosie] Could you smile a little bit?

654
00:56:00,918 --> 00:56:03,443
- This means nothing.
- You are unbelievable.

655
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:07,855
What? Rosie, people like this
buy houses all the time.

656
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:10,393
- It's called a tax shelter.
- Peter.

657
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:13,453
I can guarantee you
that by the end of today

658
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:16,295
Tad's farm and his house

659
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:21,067
and his fricking wheat
will be right back on the market.

660
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:23,663
Why? What are you going to do?

661
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:27,404
Nothing. You know,
just be a good neighbor.

662
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:35,416
Howdy.

663
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:39,183
- Tad, this place is unbelievable.
- Thanks, little lady.

664
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,993
This barn sits on what they call
"the south 40."

665
00:56:46,063 --> 00:56:50,500
Yeah. I'm not sure exactly
how many acres that is, but

666
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:52,160
I'm going to guess that's a lot.

667
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:56,801
I'm going to guess 40.

668
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:59,843
oh, yeah. Could be.

669
00:56:59,911 --> 00:57:03,278
Tad, being a new farm owner and all,

670
00:57:03,347 --> 00:57:07,374
I know you'll probably get some people
to run this place for you, but...

671
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:10,784
hell, I'd be happy to show you
a couple of everyday farm chores.

672
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:14,120
Really? Pete, that would be great.
Thank you.

673
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:17,183
Tad, that's not a problem.

674
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,923
What you're going to do here
is grab on to one of the...

675
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:26,626
essentially one of the nipples,

676
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:29,935
and just pull it firmly but gently
towards the pail.

677
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:32,942
You're going to freak out a...

678
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:38,774
[Tad] Mmm, look at all that creamy milk.
That a girl, Arleen. That a girl.

679
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:42,876
- You are making old Tad thirsty.
- [Pete] Where'd you learn to do that?

680
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:46,151
Pete, you remember my remake
of The Grapes of Wrath?

681
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:56,127
[Pete] oK, so, the trick is
to take a full swing

682
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,636
so as to split the log in one swift...

683
00:58:02,206 --> 00:58:04,504
stroke.

684
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:07,369
oK.

685
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:11,176
Yeah. Let's do this.

686
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:14,549
So, you work out?

687
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:17,279
- No.
- [Pete] Yeah, me neither.

688
00:58:17,355 --> 00:58:19,346
I know, it's like... Me neither.

689
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:24,690
oK. It's just basically
one swift stroke.

690
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:31,166
oK. And sometimes, basically,
you get a bad piece of wood. Basically.

691
00:58:32,103 --> 00:58:34,469
And sometimes you don't.

692
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:38,030
[Pete] That's good. Beginner's luck.
First time's the charm.

693
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:45,080
And the luck continues.
That's great for you, man.

694
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:48,448
Did you ever see a movie I did called
A Man Named Jackson?

695
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:51,955
If it came out, Tad,

696
00:58:52,023 --> 00:58:54,583
then I saw it.

697
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,093
I think the ax is actually broken.

698
00:58:59,163 --> 00:59:01,154
You got it. Good.

699
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,482
[Tad] Get someone else to cry,
because I don't cry.

700
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:14,577
[girl laughing]

701
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:15,951
I don't do that.

702
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:24,395
Which is why I try to stay away
from melodramas.

703
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:29,233
oh, my God. I finally did it.

704
00:59:29,302 --> 00:59:31,998
People, are you watching this? Rosie.

705
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,074
- Pete.
- Hey, Tad.

706
01:00:19,152 --> 01:00:21,416
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

707
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:24,715
Yeah, sure.

708
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:30,092
- Forgive the intrusion, but...
- No, no. Please, fire away.

709
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:32,825
oK. Here it is.

710
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:42,304
You win, oK?
Fair and square.

711
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:46,073
- You win.
- Thank you.

712
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:49,706
You did have an advantage
or two going in, but...

713
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:54,916
Excuse me, we're in the middle
of something here.

714
01:00:54,987 --> 01:00:57,387
Yeah, no problem.

715
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,061
I want Rosie to be happy.

716
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,964
So, I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

717
01:01:09,235 --> 01:01:12,602
Do you know how long she keeps her hair
in straight or in curly mode?

718
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,367
What?

719
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,238
or why her favorite necklace
has a starfish clasp?

720
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,368
No.

721
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:22,278
Do you even know
that she has six different smiles?

722
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:24,407
- She has six smiles?
- Yeah.

723
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:26,883
one when something
flat out makes her laugh.

724
01:01:26,953 --> 01:01:29,285
one when she's laughing
out of politeness.

725
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:31,482
But there's one when she makes plans.

726
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:33,957
one when she makes fun of herself.

727
01:01:34,026 --> 01:01:37,621
one when she's uncomfortable.
And one when...

728
01:01:39,832 --> 01:01:43,029
one when she's talking
about her friends.

729
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:48,432
- I don't know those things yet, Pete.
- No, you don't, Tad.

730
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:50,737
I'm telling you, she is more of...

731
01:01:52,478 --> 01:01:56,278
a treasure than you can possibly know.

732
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:59,318
She's not just some
wholesome small-town girl,

733
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:01,945
some good-for-you breath of fresh air.

734
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:05,252
Tad, she is a wonderful person
with a huge heart.

735
01:02:05,324 --> 01:02:06,313
Yeah.

736
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:10,192
And the kind of beauty that a guy
only sees once, you know? once.

737
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:19,004
Listen, Tad, if there is even a chance
that you could break her heart,

738
01:02:20,373 --> 01:02:23,001
please, just, for her sake...

739
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:27,306
walk away, man.

740
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:31,613
I could never break Rosalee's heart. oK?

741
01:02:31,684 --> 01:02:34,050
Good. Because if you do, I swear to God,

742
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,089
I will tear you to pieces
with my bare hands.

743
01:02:37,156 --> 01:02:40,319
or vicious rhetoric.

744
01:02:46,098 --> 01:02:48,225
You're a good guy, Pete.

745
01:02:48,968 --> 01:02:53,462
But it's apparently not good enough.

746
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:08,415
- Do you mind if I...
- Yeah, no. My bad.

747
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:10,978
Finish up in here. I'm sorry.

748
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,791
You're a good kisser.

749
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:27,998
But I guess it doesn't come
as a shock to you to hear that.

750
01:03:28,074 --> 01:03:30,872
You're a really good kisser.

751
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:34,175
- Even compared to Hollywood girls?
- Mm-hmm.

752
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:38,640
That's just ridiculous.

753
01:03:46,392 --> 01:03:48,189
Oh, Tad Hamilton.

754
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,388
Your favorite people are here.

755
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:52,055
- You got to be kidding me.
- Who is it?

756
01:03:52,131 --> 01:03:54,827
- Guess who?
- It's my agent and my manager.

757
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,927
Taddy? Tadala.

758
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:01,963
- This is a nightmare.
- Housekeeping.

759
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,601
Let us in.

760
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:07,475
- Hey, Tad.
- I'd like to apologize for...

761
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:09,538
Open zee zleibenshlocken.

762
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:12,881
Come on.
You're not going to be Punk'd.

763
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:18,356
- Fellas.
- Tad Edward Hamilton.

764
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,429
- Howdy, little lady.
- Hi.

765
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,827
My manager, Richard Levy
and my agent, Richard Levy.

766
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:33,997
You're both named Richard Levy?

767
01:04:34,073 --> 01:04:36,064
Who isn't?

768
01:04:39,078 --> 01:04:41,137
You.

769
01:04:41,214 --> 01:04:44,445
- You must be Rosalee.
- Yes.

770
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:46,644
- Did we come at a bad time?
- I hope so.

771
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:48,949
Actually, yes.

772
01:04:49,022 --> 01:04:53,118
Well, Tad.
Jimmy Ing stopped breathing.

773
01:04:54,327 --> 01:04:56,420
- What?
- You got the part, pal.

774
01:04:56,496 --> 01:05:00,432
Seems he saw something that
reminded him that he had to have you.

775
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,869
- It was the body of your work.
- I knew it.

776
01:05:04,937 --> 01:05:08,429
Your credits.
The reality of you and who you are.

777
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:10,738
He called me and said,
"Who am I kidding?

778
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,801
"Tad Hamilton has to play this part."

779
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:15,211
There's nobody else.

780
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:20,745
Fellas, I have never felt better
than I do at this moment.

781
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,913
Except for that weekend in Cabo.

782
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:27,016
[Tad] That is exactly
what I am talking about.

783
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:30,925
Easy, I've got a bad back.

784
01:05:30,997 --> 01:05:33,864
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

785
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:39,168
I told you a little good career news
would put your head back on straight.

786
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:45,070
- So then you're leaving?
- Yes.

787
01:05:45,144 --> 01:05:47,476
Fittings Monday and rehearsals Tuesday.

788
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:51,506
You're back on the beam, pally.

789
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:53,984
Boy, things happen fast.

790
01:06:01,894 --> 01:06:03,885
oh, my God.

791
01:06:03,963 --> 01:06:06,932
- You're right.
- No, it's fine.

792
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:09,433
- I'm going to turn it down.
- What?

793
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:10,764
- What?
- You are?

794
01:06:10,837 --> 01:06:13,101
I came here vowing
to change my priorities

795
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:17,233
and at the first opportunity
I'm abandoning that.

796
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:20,575
You're not going to turn down the part.
We both know that.

797
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:27,419
- Give us a minute, will you, fellas?
- We'll be in the lobby.

798
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:33,018
I wonder if they have
a masseuse on staff.

799
01:06:45,071 --> 01:06:47,904
- I want you to go with me.
- What?

800
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:52,509
- What?
- She absolutely cannot go with him.

801
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:54,739
I won't take the part
unless you come me.

802
01:06:54,814 --> 01:06:56,805
Although we could work something out.

803
01:06:56,883 --> 01:06:59,750
- Really?
- Yes, really.

804
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:04,017
Rosie, have you been listening
to anything I've been telling you?

805
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:07,890
I love you.

806
01:07:10,029 --> 01:07:12,554
How many times in your life
have you said that?

807
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:20,703
- Not counting the movies?
- Not counting.

808
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:25,901
I've said it a few times.

809
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:29,638
But...

810
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:33,408
But I never knew what it meant.

811
01:07:38,424 --> 01:07:40,415
I can't go with you, Tad.

812
01:07:41,994 --> 01:07:44,224
Because you don't love me.

813
01:07:45,932 --> 01:07:48,332
You maybe want to love me,

814
01:07:48,401 --> 01:07:51,962
but I think what you love right now
is the idea of me.

815
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:55,968
You can't love someone
for what they stand for or seem to be.

816
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:58,169
You have to love them for their details,

817
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:00,940
for the things that are
true of them and only them.

818
01:08:01,013 --> 01:08:03,982
- I do love you for your details, Rosie.
- You don't.

819
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:08,043
You couldn't possibly.
You don't even know what they are.

820
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:21,456
- You have six smiles.
- What?

821
01:08:22,935 --> 01:08:26,200
You have six smiles.
Did you know that?

822
01:08:27,373 --> 01:08:30,672
one when something
really makes you laugh.

823
01:08:30,743 --> 01:08:35,373
And one when you're just
laughing out of politeness.

824
01:08:36,315 --> 01:08:38,340
one when you're making plans

825
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:41,818
and one when
you're making fun of yourself.

826
01:08:41,888 --> 01:08:45,483
one when you're uncomfortable
and one when...

827
01:08:47,994 --> 01:08:51,157
one when you're talking
about your friends.

828
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,393
- How many is that?
- Like 50.

829
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:59,069
I told you. I told you.

830
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:04,665
That is so much better
than any speech from any of your movies.

831
01:09:04,744 --> 01:09:07,076
I had a better writer.

832
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,640
So...

833
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:15,243
Will you go?

834
01:09:25,598 --> 01:09:27,589
Yes.

835
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:33,068
He's going back to Cali,
to Cali, to Cali.

836
01:09:36,242 --> 01:09:40,110
- [Tad] What are you thinking?
- Nothing. I'm done thinking.

837
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:43,012
If I'm making a huge mistake,
I don't want to know.

838
01:09:43,082 --> 01:09:45,380
You're not making a mistake.

839
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:58,430
You know, as a bartender

840
01:09:58,497 --> 01:10:03,799
you do learn to kind of recognize
those customers who need to talk.

841
01:10:04,737 --> 01:10:06,932
Angelica, I'm fine.

842
01:10:07,006 --> 01:10:10,498
But could I have, like, six more of these?

843
01:10:10,576 --> 01:10:14,979
No, Pete. You really need to talk.

844
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,907
oK.

845
01:10:20,753 --> 01:10:24,416
I think that our friend Rosie...

846
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:28,550
might be falling in love
with Tad Hamilton.

847
01:10:28,628 --> 01:10:32,291
Yeah, didn't have to be a bartender
to see that one coming.

848
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:35,926
Right, but the problem with that is...

849
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:41,733
that I'm in love with Rosie.

850
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:48,643
You know, I always thought
that maybe you were.

851
01:10:56,989 --> 01:10:58,980
So how much do you love her?

852
01:11:00,893 --> 01:11:05,728
Is it love, is it big love
or is it great love?

853
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:08,426
What do you mean?

854
01:11:08,501 --> 01:11:10,696
Love you get over in two months.

855
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,761
Big love, two years.

856
01:11:13,973 --> 01:11:15,304
And great love...

857
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:21,275
- Yeah?
- Great love changes your life.

858
01:11:29,088 --> 01:11:31,079
oh, my God.

859
01:11:31,857 --> 01:11:33,848
It's great love.

860
01:11:39,365 --> 01:11:41,390
Isn't that great?

861
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:44,396
You got to win her back.

862
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:51,806
Angelica, trust me,
I have tried everything.

863
01:11:51,877 --> 01:11:54,812
What did she say
when you told her that you love her?

864
01:11:58,384 --> 01:12:03,720
Well, actually,
maybe not everything, but...

865
01:12:03,789 --> 01:12:06,815
What did she say when you kissed her?

866
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:10,521
oK, maybe it's more like
two things I haven't tried.

867
01:12:10,596 --> 01:12:13,463
Well, what have you tried?

868
01:12:13,532 --> 01:12:19,095
I have very unsubtly
implied how I feel about her.

869
01:12:20,106 --> 01:12:22,631
- oK, get up.
- What?

870
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,040
- Get your ass off the barstool.
- Angelica.

871
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:30,174
Hey, if you feel it and you don't do
everything in your power to reach for it

872
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:32,877
you are basically
slapping life in the face.

873
01:12:32,952 --> 01:12:39,084
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't stand a chance here, oK?

874
01:12:40,226 --> 01:12:44,128
As my father told me when I said
I'd never get that job in a bar:

875
01:12:44,196 --> 01:12:49,065
"Honey, your odds go up
when you file an application."

876
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:52,798
Sure, but I'm up against...

877
01:12:54,206 --> 01:12:56,606
Tad Hamilton.

878
01:12:59,478 --> 01:13:01,469
You are Tad Hamilton.

879
01:13:03,048 --> 01:13:05,209
- What?
- Don't you see?

880
01:13:05,284 --> 01:13:08,447
Everybody's Tad Hamilton
to somebody, Pete.

881
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:11,615
Rosalee's Tad Hamilton to you.

882
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:14,888
And you're Tad Hamilton to me.

883
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:20,927
Angelica, thank you.

884
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,059
So start acting like it.

885
01:13:23,135 --> 01:13:25,330
oK.

886
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:28,670
Yeah, oK.

887
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:32,609
You are a really good bartender.

888
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:47,989
- Hi.
- Hey.

889
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,051
Come in, come in.

890
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,791
I have something to talk to you about.

891
01:13:56,869 --> 01:13:58,860
- Me, too.
- Really? You go first.

892
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:00,769
- No, you go first.
- No.

893
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,105
- Seriously, you go first.
- oK.

894
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:06,235
Tad got a part in this huge movie

895
01:14:06,312 --> 01:14:09,577
and he asked me to go with him
to California for the shoot.

896
01:14:09,648 --> 01:14:13,140
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
Isn't that great?

897
01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:16,819
I probably should've gone first.

898
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:20,689
Why? What were you going to say?

899
01:14:22,461 --> 01:14:25,453
It's nothing. It was nothing.

900
01:14:25,531 --> 01:14:29,297
Just, you know, travel safely, oK?

901
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:31,859
And just really enjoy the shoot.

902
01:14:36,475 --> 01:14:39,205
Actually, no, I remember
what I was going to say.

903
01:14:50,856 --> 01:14:52,847
I love you, Rosie.

904
01:14:54,193 --> 01:14:56,684
I always have.

905
01:14:56,762 --> 01:15:00,459
If I've been a jerk this last week,
it's because I have been fighting.

906
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,495
I have been fighting for you.

907
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:08,835
I don't want to lose you
to Tad Hamilton or anyone else.

908
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,670
You're the one.

909
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:26,115
So, any reaction to any of this?

910
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:29,922
Because now would be an excellent time.

911
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:37,391
Now? You kiss me now?

912
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:43,937
You say this to me now,
after 22 years of being my friend?

913
01:15:46,111 --> 01:15:49,877
Yes, to all questions.

914
01:15:53,419 --> 01:15:55,410
I'm...

915
01:15:58,257 --> 01:16:00,248
I have to pack.

916
01:16:03,295 --> 01:16:05,695
You're telling me that you can't answer

917
01:16:05,764 --> 01:16:08,927
the most important question
I'll ever ask in my entire life

918
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:11,367
because you have to pack?

919
01:16:11,437 --> 01:16:14,838
Not only do I have to pack, but I have
a load of whites in the dryer,

920
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:18,070
and my dad called my relatives
from San Clemente

921
01:16:18,143 --> 01:16:20,475
and they're expecting me, so...

922
01:16:20,546 --> 01:16:22,537
it's all in the works.

923
01:16:22,614 --> 01:16:24,605
But this is...

924
01:16:26,385 --> 01:16:30,412
Rosie, what's in your heart?

925
01:16:39,732 --> 01:16:41,723
I'm sorry.

926
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:52,600
I'm sorry, too.

927
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:12,288
- You oK, Pete?
- Yes, sir.

928
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:15,925
Listen, Pete, obviously
we've all been a little seduced

929
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:18,367
by Tad Hamilton's presence.

930
01:17:20,205 --> 01:17:23,470
No one more so than me.

931
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:28,172
But that doesn't mean I don't know
who cares about my daughter the most

932
01:17:28,247 --> 01:17:32,240
and who she would be with
if the world were fair.

933
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:40,483
- Well, it's not.
- No. No, it's not.

934
01:17:41,927 --> 01:17:47,365
When I was your age I was completely
in love with Eleanor Hershey.

935
01:17:50,636 --> 01:17:54,197
of the chocolate Hersheys?

936
01:17:54,273 --> 01:17:57,504
The Hershey chocolates?

937
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,938
She was a great girl,
completely unpretentious.

938
01:18:01,013 --> 01:18:03,948
I actually met her
filling her Cadillac up with gas.

939
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:08,550
Anyway, there was this French guy.
He was really rich.

940
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:12,317
He owned, like, France.

941
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:14,689
I didn't stand a chance.

942
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,888
It happens that way sometimes.
It shouldn't, but it does.

943
01:18:17,963 --> 01:18:22,127
Sometimes Goliath
kicks the shit out of David.

944
01:18:23,135 --> 01:18:26,195
It's just nobody bothers
to tell that story.

945
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,331
Well, thanks, Mr. Futch.

946
01:18:31,743 --> 01:18:34,143
I feel much better now.

947
01:18:37,883 --> 01:18:41,910
- Goodbye, Mr. Futch.
- Take it easy, Pete.

948
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,594
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

949
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:03,330
No.

950
01:19:03,404 --> 01:19:06,464
Ever feel more confused or alone?

951
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,532
No.

952
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,771
Have a nice flight.

953
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:38,355
[Mr. Futch] So, we'll see you
after principal photography.

954
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,185
Yes, Daddy.

955
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,718
You guys don't mind not flying with us?
We need our privacy.

956
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,787
- That's fine.
- Yeah.

957
01:19:30,865 --> 01:19:33,800
We look forward
to our shit-ass commercial flight.

958
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:36,393
I always wanted
a layover in Cincinnati.

959
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,031
- We will be absolutely fine.
- Another one in Chicago.

960
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,098
So we'll be in LA by April?

961
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,878
We'll be fine.

962
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:50,112
- It's time.
- oK.

963
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:53,244
- Safe trip, Tad.
- Bye, honey.

964
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,258
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Hamilton.
- Bye.

965
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,660
- Miss?
- Thank you.

966
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:10,803
Stop it. Stop it.
What's the matter with you?

967
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:14,239
Come on.
Commercial isn't so bad.

968
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,641
There's got to be room for one more.

969
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:19,111
Will you pull yourself together?

970
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,171
Thank you.

971
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,080
Would you like a Vicodin?

972
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:08,022
[Tad] Jimmy, being
in your movie is a privilege.

973
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:12,692
In fact, it's more than a privilege.
It's a real privilege.

974
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,366
Can I... Do you mind if I call you back
in a few minutes?

975
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:21,238
oK, thank you, sir.

976
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,720
- You oK?
- Mm-hmm.

977
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:39,987
I'm just a little nervous
for some reason.

978
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:44,058
I have a little nervous feeling
in my... self.

979
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,924
- But that's only natural, right?
- Yeah.

980
01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:50,835
This is a pretty huge thing I'm doing.

981
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:53,339
Kind of a great leap of faith.

982
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,400
But I have that faith in you.

983
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:00,672
So I'm fine. It's going to be great.

984
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:04,775
- Good.
- Can't you tell by my smile?

985
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,314
Which one is it?

986
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:15,160
- What?
- What number smile is it?

987
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:17,254
It's...

988
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:20,391
Wait, it was one.

989
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,700
No, one was when something
really made me laugh.

990
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:32,074
- Right?
- one and a half.

991
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,527
Rosie...

992
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:56,934
I didn't know about your six smiles.
Pete told me about them.

993
01:22:57,004 --> 01:22:59,734
He made me swear
I wasn't going to break your heart,

994
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:01,798
or he would tear me to pieces,

995
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:06,245
either with his bare hands
or his rhetoric.

996
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:10,710
I stole the speech from Pete
to get you to come here with me.

997
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,549
I lied. And I'm sorry.

998
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:18,285
And I know you're going to be
very upset. I just...

999
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:24,391
- Pete told you about the six smiles?
- Yeah.

1000
01:23:24,465 --> 01:23:28,492
And made you swear
that you wouldn't break my heart?

1001
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:33,438
or he'd tear you to pieces, with either
his bare hands or his rhetoric?

1002
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,066
Yeah.

1003
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:40,841
That is just so...

1004
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,510
adorable.

1005
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,817
What?

1006
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,596
Do you think it's possible

1007
01:23:55,663 --> 01:24:00,327
to love someone your whole life
and never really realize it

1008
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:04,770
until something happens
that makes you see?

1009
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,971
- What's that from?
- No, it's not from anything.

1010
01:24:09,043 --> 01:24:11,603
I'm just saying it to you.

1011
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:17,714
Wow.

1012
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:30,186
Man, what a week.

1013
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:36,427
Fell in love for the first time,
got my heart broken for the first time,

1014
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:39,405
was honorable for the first time.

1015
01:24:39,473 --> 01:24:43,204
Got bit in the ass for being
honorable for the first time.

1016
01:24:43,277 --> 01:24:45,609
Bought a farm.

1017
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,376
I'm sorry about the broken-heart part.

1018
01:24:59,026 --> 01:25:02,018
Do you think
you could take me home now?

1019
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:06,297
Yeah.

1020
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,704
Thank you.

1021
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,481
- Cathy.
- Rosie?

1022
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:28,681
- Where's Pete?
- He's not here. What are you doing?

1023
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,224
What do you mean?
He's always here. He's Pete.

1024
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,783
No. He didn't come in today.

1025
01:25:35,863 --> 01:25:38,661
Can I borrow your car?

1026
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:41,099
Yes.

1027
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,827
Thank you.

1028
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:58,575
Pete. Pete.

1029
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,653
Not Pete.

1030
01:26:12,466 --> 01:26:14,457
Wow.

1031
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,775
I'm just here because Pete
asked me to box up some stuff.

1032
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,146
- Why? Where's he going?
- Richmond.

1033
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:39,655
And he isn't going.

1034
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:41,718
He's gone.

1035
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,127
He's gone to Richmond?

1036
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,190
Why?

1037
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:52,331
I cannot believe I am taking
my work home with me.

1038
01:26:56,310 --> 01:27:01,771
When great love is rejected, Rosalee,
something inside a man dies.

1039
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,808
So all he can do is run away,

1040
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:08,844
where he can meet the girl
he'll love second most.

1041
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,060
- Unless...
- Unless what?

1042
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:18,155
Unless you can get to him
before he closes the book on you.

1043
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:23,934
But once it's closed, it's closed.

1044
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:27,031
It's finished. It's gone, dead.

1045
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:30,339
It's crushed. It's beaten. It's buried.

1046
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,641
It is lost for all of time in a sea...

1047
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:36,149
- Angelica.
- oK, yeah.

1048
01:27:37,184 --> 01:27:39,175
I owe you.

1049
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:43,913
Go.

1050
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:15,753
[announcer] If you've been dumped,
give us a call on late-night talk.

1051
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:18,018
Let's go to line one.
Scott, you're on...

1052
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:32,564
What? Pass me.

1053
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:37,433
Pete. Pete.

1054
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:54,025
- Are you oK?
- Yeah. No...

1055
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:56,086
No, I meant to do that.

1056
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:31,164
You have five smiles, Pete.

1057
01:29:33,934 --> 01:29:37,563
one when you think someone's an idiot.

1058
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:40,630
one when you think
someone's really an idiot.

1059
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:47,075
one when you're getting all dressed up.

1060
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:49,309
one when you're singing Barry White.

1061
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:53,209
And one...

1062
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:56,947
when you're looking at me.

1063
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:19,504
[radio] For all you lovers out there,
this one's for you.

1064
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:34,552
I can't believe
I'm going to say this, but...

1065
01:30:37,464 --> 01:30:39,455
would you like to dance?
