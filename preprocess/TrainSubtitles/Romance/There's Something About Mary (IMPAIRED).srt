stop whinin'*

* They've had enough
of that *

3
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,376
*His friends would say,
stop pinin'*

4
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,255
* There's other girls
to look at *

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,841
* They've tried to set him up
with Tiffany *

00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,767

* Mary *

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,274
* There's just somethin'
about Mary *

11
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,612
* Well, his friends say *

12
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,241
* Look,
life's no fairy tale *

13
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,993
* That he should
have some fun *

14
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,788

long enough *

15
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,916
* Well, they may know
about domestic *

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,836
* And imported ale *

17

* But they don't know
a thing about love *

18
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,637
* Well, his friends
would say he's dreamin' *

19

* And livin' in the past *

20

fallen in love *

21

be reasonable *

* That they don't know *

26
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,495
* Mary *

27

I fell in love.

I fell in love.

00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,228
Hey, Renise.

31
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,439
Hey.

32
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,400
So, uh, what's up?

33
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,109
Ah-uh.

34
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,194
Cool.

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,077
So I was wondering...
I don't know, uh...

36
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,121
if... if maybe you
wanted to, and... or not.

37
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,707
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

38
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,001
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom...

39
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,336
and... or, uh...

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,339
if you felt like that,
maybe you'd want to go...

41
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,924
with me.

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,300
Or, I mean, whatever.

43
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,219
If... if you didn't.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,057
Did you take that bio test?
'Cause that was like...

45
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,267
Look, I heard this rumor...

46
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,893
that this guy I like
was gonna ask me...

47
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,730
so I'm gonna wait and
see what happens there.

48
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,316
That sounds great.
Yeah.

49
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,152
Ok.

50
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,033
So, is that like
a yes or a no or...

51
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,827
I thought I made it
perfectly clear.

52
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,913
If everything else
falls apart...

53
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,956
maybe.

54
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,753
I'm gonna hold you
to that.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,134
Hey, guys.

56
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,177
Hey, Mary!

57
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,558
Oh, I wonder who
she's going with.

58
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,021
Ted: Her name was Mary.

59
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,897
She moved to our little
Rhode Island town...

60
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,983
from Minnesota
2 years earlier.

61
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,112
Ha. What a fox.

62
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,406
I heard she's going with
some guy named Woogie.

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,617
Ah.

64
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,952
Who?

65
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,537
Big guy. Goes
to Barrington High.

66
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,624
Woogie from
Bore-rington High?

67
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,042
Sounds like a loser.

68
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:15,504
Loser? Woogie's only
like All-State football...

69
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,506
and basketball,
and fucking valedictorian.

70
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,175
I heard he got a scholarship
to Princeton...

71
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,678
but he's going to
Europe first to model.

72
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,599
Yeah? I was thinking
of doing that.

73
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,892
Sorry.

74
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,519
Have you... have you...

75
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,437
have you seen
my baseball?

76
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,773
Uh, no. Sorry, man.
Haven't seen it.

77

Have you... Have you
seen my baseball?

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,195
Sorry.

Hey, check it out.

Hey, buddy.
Come here.

my baseball?

Yeah, yeah.

over there?

That... that...

87
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,803
She has it, except she
doesn't call it a baseball.

88
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,847
She's got another name
for it.

89
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,187
Nice muffs.

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,981
Have you seen
my... wiener?

91

What?

92

Have you seen
my wiener?

93

What the... What the hell
did you just say, buddy?

Huh?
Wiener?

95
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,741
Hey, get your hand
off my car!

96
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,033
What the hell did you
just say to me?

97

my baseball?

No, I haven't seen
your baseball.

What are you doing
leaving the yard?

118

You know you're not supposed
to leave by yourself.

You know him?

He's my brother.

Thanks, Ted.

that she knew my name.

Some of my best friends
didn't know my name.

132
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,637
I think thatJoe Montana...

133
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,807
is, like, the most
underrated quarterback.

134
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,268
I mean, he should have been
a first-round draft pick.

135
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,103
Look what he did
at Notre Dame.

It's so ridiculous.

No, that's ok.
I'll do it.

145

he can hold me.

Are you kidding?

00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,572
Whoa!

166
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,200
Ted: Uhh!

167
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,369
Whoa!

168
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,455
That was fun.

169
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,830
He's only 230, huh?

170
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,832
Yeah.

171
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,626
I'm in the yard now.
I'll hide.

172
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,335
Ok, go hide.

173
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,379
He's got
a lot of energy.

174
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,049
Yeah. He's great. I have
a lot of fun with him.

175
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,050
Well...

176
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,635
Thanks for
walking us back.

177
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,678
Yeah, no problem.

178
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,347
I'm, uh,
I'm just gonna...

179
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,766
So, are you... Are you
going to the prom?

180
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,018
Huh?

181
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,937
Uh, oh. Uh...

182
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,813
l... I don't...
I think proms are...

183
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,273
'Cause I thought
maybe we, um...

184
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,691
- Dumb.
- We could go together.

185
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,611
Oh, you're gonna go with,
like, a bunch of people?

186
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,113
It's like... yeah. You want,
like, a designated driver.

187
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,366
[Laughing] No, no.
I mean, you and me.

188
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,410
Like, we could go together.
The two of us.

189
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,997
You... you and me?

190
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,082
Yeah.

191
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,548
Well, is that
a yes or a no?

192
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,591
Sure. Ha.
All right.

193
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,676
Good.

194
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,552
Cool...

195
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,638
I'm gonna take
Warren back inside.

196
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,015
I'll... I'll see you
at school.

197
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,351
Cool. I'll catch you
back at school.

198
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,228
Ted: From that moment on...

199
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,648
the guys at school looked
at me in a whole new light.

200
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,901
You're a fuckin' liar.

201
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,695
Do you expect us
to believe...

202
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,780
that you're going
to the prom with Mary?

203
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,241
What's so crazy
about that?

204
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,283
Oh, yeah, dirt bud...

205
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,869
and I'm going
with Cyndi Lauper.

206
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,496
What happened
to Woogie?

207
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,664
She said she
broke up with him...

208
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,500
that he was getting
weird on her.

209
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,628
I got 20 bucks that says
you're full of shit.

210
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,796
Why not make it 100?

211
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,838
Rock on.

212
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,881
I'm in.

213
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,132
Me, too.

214
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,511
*So when you find
somebody who gives *

215
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,263
* Think of me
and celebrate *

216
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,601
*I made such
a big mistake *

217
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,729
* When I was Mary's prayer *

218
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,231
*So if I say *

219
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,735
*Save me, save me *

220
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,029
*Be the light in my eyes *

221
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,115
I've already paid him
enough money already.

222
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,617
I'm not paying until
thejob gets done.

223
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
He can kiss my ass.

224
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,454
What the hell
do you want?

225
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,752
Uhh!

226
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,296
I'm Ted Stroehmann. I'm here
to take Mary to the prom.

227
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,966
Prom? Mary went to
the prom 20 minutes ago...

228
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,343
with her boyfriend
Woogie.

229
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,011
Woogie?

230
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,303
Woogie!

231
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,390
Oh.

232
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,516
I see.

233
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,478
Charlie,
you are so mean.

234
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,022
This is Mary's
stepfather Charlie.

235
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,357
I'm Sheila her mother.

236
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,818
Ted, don't pay any attention
to anything he says.

237
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,819
He's a laugh a minute.

238
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,030
Ho. Very funny.

239
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,323
Well, I'm just having
a little fun with the guy.

240
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,491
It's prom night.

241
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,993
Woogie's got
a sense of humor.

242
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,456
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.

243
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh, listen, once he
gets into that MTV...

244
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,127
he'll be there
for quite a while.

245
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,296
Oh, here she comes.

246
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,005
Oh, here she comes.

247
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,424
Oh, honey,
you look beautiful.

248
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,847
Aw, shit, look at that.

249
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,599
You better
be careful, boy.

250
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,075
Hi, Ted.

251
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,118
Hi, Mary.

252
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,704
You look really... pretty.

253
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,248
Thanks.
I like your colors.

254
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,501
Oh, thanks. The guy said
it was tan and taupe.

255
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,171
Poor Ted, he's been
getting it both barrels...

256
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,006
from the wisenheimer here.

257
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,550
Dad, you haven't been
bustin' Ted's chops...

258
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,718
have ya?

259
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,429
I was just fucking with him.
Right, Ted? [Laughs]

260
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,641
Hey, Warren, did you
say hi to Ted?

261
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,560
About 10 times.

262
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,894
Ok.

263
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,772
Hey, Warren. I think
I found your baseball.

264
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,232
You've seen my baseball?

265
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,276
Well, if it's
a big white one.

266
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,863
With, uh...

267
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,740
little red stitching.

268
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,741
Yup. It is.

269
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,910
Hmm. Then I think
I saw it...

270
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,245
right behind your ear.

271
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,538
Aah!

272
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,416
Charlie: Warren! Warren!
Hold it, hold it!

273
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,793
Get up, Warren!
Hey, Warren!

274
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,794
Warren!

275
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,005
Be careful, Mary!
Be careful!

276
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,756
Get up, man!

277
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,592
Let go of him!
Get down from there!

278
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,927
What are you doing?

279
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,927
Ted! Ted!

280
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,095
Warren, put him down!

281
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,847
Ted: Whoa! Ohh!

282
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,932
What the hell
are you doing?

283
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,267
Mary, Mary.

284
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,852
This is my house here.!

285
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,103
Warren,
are you ok, buddy?

286
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,522
It's ok, Warren.
It's ok.

287
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,607
Here you go.

288
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,025
What the hell's
the matter with you?

289
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,569
I was just trying to
give him the baseball.

290
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,071
Baseball?
What baseball?

291
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,822
I had a baseball.

292
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,032
What baseball?

293
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,283
There was...
It's right...

294
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,951
There was a baseball here.

295
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,787
I swear, I brought him
a baseball...

296
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,205
and I was just trying
to give him a present!

297
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,957
Are you yelling at me
in my own house?

298
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,083
No.

299
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,669
Don't make me open a can
of whup-ass on you.

300
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,962
Ted, I should
have told you.

301
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,839
He has a thing
about his ears.

302
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,550
You're all right,
Warren?

303
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,427
Oh, honey,
your strap's broken.

304
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,346
Ohh.

305
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,638
All right.

306
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,183
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna
go upstairs real quick.

307
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,519
I just need 2 minutes.
I got to fix my dress.

308
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,561
I'll help you, honey.

309
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,480
Hey, I, uh...

310
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,441
Can I use your bathroom?
I'm sorry. I got to...

311
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,526
He broke the table.

312
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,735
You son of a bitch.

313
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,571
Warren:
I didn't do it.

314
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,155
It's ok, Warren.
It's ok.

315
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,156
Ted:
I swear...

316
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,824
The bathroom
is that way.

317
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,454
Maybe I'll open up
a can of whup-ass on him.

So, anyway, uh...

497
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,426
school ended
a couple days later...

498
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,929
and her father
got transferred...

499
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,847
to Florida in July.

500
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,016
So I worked all summer...

501

and...

502

Well, I never saw Mary
again.

out of my head or something...

510

'cause I was driving down
the highway last week...

00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,331
Ah. Neighborhood Watch.
Is that what we're calling it?

657
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:35,909
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.

658
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,238
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half a mile radius.

659
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:41,341
Meaning?

660
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:44,183
Meaning these are the people
you live amongst.

661
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:45,983
You got a right to know
if they're creeps.

662
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,523
For instance, you know the guy

663
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:52,153
in the green house down the street?
Cheating on his wife.

664
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:54,564
And I am not surprised.

665
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:56,792
I am not surprised at all.

666
00:30:57,234 --> 00:31:00,499
Because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.

667
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:03,699
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.

668
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:04,798
OK.

669
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:08,340
Listen, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls,

670
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:11,176
and hook up with Warren,
so... try to get some sleep.

671
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:12,946
OK.

672
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,540
- Bye, doll.
- Bye.

673
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:46,674
Hey, Herb. How's it going?

674
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:47,840
Apple for you today.

675
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:48,940
Thanks, Mary.

676
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,419
Have a good day. See you later.

677
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,709
Lookin' good, honey.

678
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:22,753
Hi, Mary.

679
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,413
Hey, Mrs Bailey. How you doing?

680
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,980
Looks like we got ajock on our hands.

681
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,332
Hey, you want the sports page?

682
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,867
Sure. Thank you.

683
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:39,095
Take care now.

684
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,296
Bye, you guys. See ya.

685
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,852
Yeah. Can I have two, Mary?

686
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,263
Yeah, you can have two halves,
just like everybody else.

687
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:09,227
Mmm.

688
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:10,268
Yeah, it's good.

689
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,464
Will you marry me, Mary?

690
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:15,369
Oh, I would love to, Jimmy,

691
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,908
but, um, I'm already engaged to Freddie.

692
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,575
Who's Freddie? Me?

693
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:21,873
Yeah, that's you.

694
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,347
Will you marry me?

695
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,545
What about Dolores?

696
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,352
You gonna marry us both?

697
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,013
I'm gonna kiss you.

698
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,080
I think you're making out
pretty well there.

699
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,216
OK.

700
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:36,158
Thanks, Mary.

701
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,161
You're welcome, Zack.

702
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,723
- No onions.
- No onions.

703
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:41,030
No onions.

704
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,123
No onions. How you doing?

705
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:47,519
Listen to this one:

706
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:50,188
"Seeking sensitive
WASP doctor...

707
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:51,857
"to share
candlelit dinners...

708
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:54,026
"long walks
in Coconut Grove...

709
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:55,026
marriage."

710
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:56,528
Is she looking
for a corpse?

711
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:58,197
You have to be specific
when you write those.

712
00:33:58,322 --> 00:34:00,532
You have to say
"Seeking deaf mute...

713
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,534
"with," you know...

714
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,662
"3-pound cock
and trust fund."

715
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,708
I want a guy
who can play 36 holes...

716
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,210
and still have enough energy...

717
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:13,045
to take me and Warren
to a ball game...

718
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,379
and eat hot dogs.

719
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:16,381
I'm talking
sausage hot dogs, beer.

720
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:19,218
Not light beer, but beer.
That's my ad. Print it up.

721
00:34:19,302 --> 00:34:20,720
Mmm.

722
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:24,056
Fatty who likes beer
and golf.

723
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:25,056
Jeez, Mary...

724
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,225
where you gonna find
a gem like that?

725
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:28,602
[Laughter]

726
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:30,688
Ok, well,
here's the catch...

727
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,732
He has to be
self-employed.

728
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:35,067
Like a drug dealer?

729
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,570
No, I was thinking
along the lines, maybe...

730
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:40,239
of somebody like...

731
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:41,823
an architect
or something.

732
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:43,491
But I want somebody with
freedom in theirjob...

733
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:45,286
you know?

734
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,079
Somebody who can do it
anywhere...

735
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:49,623
and just leave
at a drop of a hat.

736
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:51,584
And where would you and
your beer-bellied architect...

737
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,085
be going to?

738
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,085
Mmm.

739
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:55,921
Super Bowl?

740
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:57,381
That's good.

741
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:58,424
I don't know.

742
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:00,759
Maybe a few months
in Nepal.

743
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:01,760
Mm-hmm.

744
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:03,095
And you'd probably dump
the poor guy...

745
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,346
halfway to Katmandu.

746
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,390
What's that supposed
to mean?

747
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:08,517
It means you change
your mind too much.

748
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:09,602
No, I don't.

749
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:10,769
Oh, come off it,
Mary.

750
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:13,606
Remember that gorgeous
corn-fed white-boy honey...

751
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:16,108
that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage.

752
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:17,859
What was his name?
Pack man.

753
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:22,447
Ok. We had fun
for a while.

754
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:24,116
Mary, cut the crap.

755
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:25,951
What really happened
with Brett?

756
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,287
Yeah.
Brett seemed so sweet.

757
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:32,124
You know what Tucker
said Brett told him?

758
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,627
He said that if Warren
wasn't in my life...

759
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:37,296
that he would have
popped the question...

760
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:38,463
a long time ago.

761
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:40,340
- Oh.
- What a schmuck.

762
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,801
To hell with Brett, you know?

763
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,900
I've got a vibrator.

764
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,598
Shh!

765
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:18,229
<i>Those are the plays of the month.</i>

766
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,787
<i>Thank you for joining us.</i>

767
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,264
<i>Look forward to seeing you next Sunday</i>

768
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,892
<i>on the Sports Machine.</i>

769
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:24,834
<i>Have a good week, everybody.</i>

770
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,842
Oh, ho-ho, yeah.

771
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,374
Ho ho.

772
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,081
Here comes the money shot.

773
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,957
Aah!

774
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,992
First chink in the armor, Ted.

775
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,261
Ohh.

776
00:37:58,137 --> 00:37:59,104
Shit.

777
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:02,898
Ohh, yeah.

778
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:14,919
Pop, you wanna get me a whisky sour
when you get a sec?

779
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:16,279
Whisky sour coming up.

780
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,255
Got some excellent news
for you, my friend.

781
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:19,723
Oh, yeah? Excellent?

782
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,225
I think your life's about to change.

783
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:22,225
Really?

784
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:23,886
So... so you found her?

785
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:24,987
Oh, yeah.

786
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:28,698
And you were right, man.
She really is something else.

787
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,825
My God.

788
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:31,360
Really?

789
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:33,429
So... so she hasn't

790
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,371
she hasn't changed at all, huh?

791
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:37,773
Well, that I couldn't say.

792
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,037
Let me ask you something.

793
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:44,312
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?

794
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,578
Big-boned? No, no. Not at all. No.

795
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:50,984
I guess she packed on
a few pounds over the years.

796
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:54,322
Oh, yeah. So she's a little...
she's a little chubby?

797
00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:56,725
Oh, I'd say about a deuce,
deuce and a half. Not bad.

798
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:59,856
Oh, my. A deuce and a half.

799
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,766
You shit out a bunch of kids,
and you're bound to put on a few pounds.

800
00:39:04,837 --> 00:39:06,464
Oh, so she's, um

801
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:08,362
she's married?

802
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:11,069
No, no. She's never been.
That's the good news.

803
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,167
Huh?

804
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:16,246
Four kids, three different guys,
but no rock.

805
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:18,773
Hyperactive little fuckers, too.

806
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:21,251
Tough to keep up with
in a wheelchair, I bet.

807
00:39:21,353 --> 00:39:25,312
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?

808
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,791
I thought that was part of your kick.

809
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,794
Excuse me, I ordered a whisky sour.

810
00:39:29,862 --> 00:39:31,193
Whatever.

811
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,959
Are you sure it's the same Mary?

812
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,831
Oh, yeah. It's Mary all right.
The brother Warren?

813
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:40,497
Hey, don't look so shocked, Ted.
It's been a long time.

814
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:44,304
I bet you've changed a lot
the last 13 years.

815
00:39:44,376 --> 00:39:46,640
What, do you think
your shit don't stink?

816
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:49,340
No, I don't think...
I... I mean, yes, it doe...

817
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:52,316
OK, I got all
the information you need.

980
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,864
We got this one kid...
Mongo.

981
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:12,032
He's got a forehead...

982
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:13,116
like a drive-in
movie theater...

983
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,159
but he's
a good ship...

984
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:15,369
so we don't bust
his chops too much.

985
00:47:15,494 --> 00:47:18,288
So one day, Mongo
gets out of his cage...

986
00:47:18,414 --> 00:47:19,706
What, they keep him
in a cage?

987
00:47:19,832 --> 00:47:21,542
Well, it's... it's
just an enclosure...

988
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:22,959
No, but they
keep him confined.

989
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:23,960
Right, yeah.

990
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:25,420
That's bullshit!

991
00:47:25,546 --> 00:47:26,713
Well,
that's what I said!

992
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:27,756
So I went out...

993
00:47:27,882 --> 00:47:29,550
and I got him, um,
I got him a leash.

994
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:30,550
A leash!

995
00:47:30,676 --> 00:47:31,551
Yeah,
one of those ones...

996
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:32,761
you can hook onto
the clothesline...

997
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:34,722
and he can run
back and forth.

998
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:36,640
And, uh, there's
plenty of room...

999
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:40,060
for him to... to dig
and, uh, play.

1000
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:42,104
That kid has really, uh...

1001
00:47:42,188 --> 00:47:44,273
he's really blossomed,
you know?

1002
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:47,651
Now I can, uh,
take him to movies.

1003

her up down there!

His name is Pat.

1056

I met him
at the driving range.

the greatest love story
of our time.

1072

The point is...

1073
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,022
is that love isn't about...

1140
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:22,273
He's got him wrapped up
like a baby.

1141
00:55:22,398 --> 00:55:23,982
He was...

1142
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:24,983
he was a little chilly.

1143
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,859
[Whimpers]

1144
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:29,799
Well, here we are.

1145
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:30,856
- The museum?
- Yeah.

1146
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:33,801
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- First, I have a surprise.

1147
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:37,466
- Surprise?
- It's the architecture exhibit.

1148
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,566
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.

1149
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:43,511
- I got to eat something or I get the shakes.
- Come on. We'll eat in 20 minutes.

1150
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,913
My friend Tucker is upstairs and I want you
to meet him. He's an architect, too.

1151
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:47,951
- Come on.
- Architect?

1152
00:55:48,018 --> 00:55:49,042
Yeah.

1153
00:55:49,653 --> 00:55:50,677
Tucker.

1154
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:53,550
This is amazing.
It just blows me away.

1155
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:58,217
What do you think this falls under?
Is this Art Deco, or is it Art Nouveau?

1156
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,762
Uh...

1157
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:01,763
Deco.

1158
00:56:01,832 --> 00:56:03,595
- Deco, yeah.
- Yeah.

1159
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:05,501
It's beautiful.

1160
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:07,465
Is this... OK.

1161
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:09,801
Is this a vestibule, or is it a portico?

1162
00:56:09,873 --> 00:56:11,397
What is the difference
between the two?

1163
00:56:11,475 --> 00:56:13,534
Uh, when you're looking
at architecture,

1164
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,044
try to visualize the buildings

1165
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:18,081
as a whole, you know?

1166
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:22,845
Uh, try to see them
in their natural state, in their

1167
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,711
totalitarian... ism,

1168
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:27,251
so to speak.

1169
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:29,257
Stone crab time.

1170
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,128
- Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.

1171
00:56:34,598 --> 00:56:36,532
Mary!

1172
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,624
How are you?

1173
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:38,792
Good.

1174
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:39,836
I'm glad we saw you.

1175
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:40,927
Uhh!

1176
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:43,402
Oh, come on, like you mean it.

1177
00:56:43,473 --> 00:56:46,670
Tucker, this is my friend, Pat Healy.

1178
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:48,574
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

1179
00:56:48,645 --> 00:56:49,577
Same here.

1180
00:56:49,646 --> 00:56:51,238
Pat is an architect as well.

1181
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:52,339
Oh, really?

1182
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:53,981
Where are your offices?

1183
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:56,178
Mainly, I work out of Boston.

1184
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:57,345
Boston, huh?

1185
00:56:58,255 --> 00:56:59,688
Did you get your degree up there?

1186
00:56:59,756 --> 00:57:00,814
You bet.

1187
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:04,583
Really? Where did you study?

1188
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:05,685
Harvard.

1189
00:57:06,163 --> 00:57:09,462
Then you must've studied under Kim Green.

1190
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:10,761
Well, among others.

1191
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:11,858
Huh.

1192
00:57:12,135 --> 00:57:13,898
You know, Pat, um

1193
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:15,868
does projects all over the world.

1194
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:18,237
Really? Where would I
have seen your work?

1195
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:20,833
Well, have you been to, uh

1196
00:57:21,345 --> 00:57:23,040
well, let me see.

1197
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:24,770
Santiago, Chile?

1198
00:57:26,183 --> 00:57:27,115
Twice last year.

1199
00:57:27,184 --> 00:57:29,345
Which building's yours?

1200
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:33,117
Are you familiar
with the soccer stadium?

1201
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,318
Did you build
the Estadio Olimpico?

1202
00:57:36,593 --> 00:57:38,618
No, just down the street

1203
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:41,596
the Celinto Catayente Towers.

1204
00:57:42,366 --> 00:57:45,301
It's quite a fine example, in fact.

1205
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:47,303
I recommend that next time
you're up that way

1206
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:51,865
that you drop in and take
a ganders at it yourself.

1207
00:58:35,882 --> 00:58:38,646
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.

1208
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:39,878
Yeah, no problem.

1209
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:41,682
I've been driving for, like,
15 hours straight,

1210
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:43,814
so I could use the company.

1211
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:44,857
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1212
00:58:44,924 --> 00:58:46,482
I've been standing in the same spot

1213
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,652
for five and a half hours.

1214
00:58:48,728 --> 00:58:51,526
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?

1215
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:52,622
Really?

1216
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,290
That must make it really tough.

1217
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:58,166
So, uh, what's going on with you?
You a salesman, or...

1218
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:00,703
Uh, no, no,

1219
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:03,432
I'm... I'm... I'm nothing.

1220
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,368
I am.

1221
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,179
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.

1222
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,170
I'm going to start my own company.

1223
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,271
Really?

1224
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:12,472
You want in?

1225
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,210
Uh...

1226
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:17,510
I... nah.

1227
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:20,651
I'm not... I don't really
have any money or...

1228
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,750
You heard of this thing
the 8-minute abs?

1229
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:26,091
Yeah, sure, 8-minute abs.
Yeah, the exercise video.

1230
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,299
This is going to blow that right out
of the water. Listen to this.

1231
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,669
7-minute abs.

1232
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:38,131
Right.

1233
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:41,270
Yes. OK, all right,
I see where you're going.

1234
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:47,073
You walk into a video store. There's
8-minute abs and 7-minute abs beside it.

1235
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,175
Which one are you going to pick?

1236
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,516
I'm... I would go for the seven.

1237
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,249
Bingo, man, bingo.

1238
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,585
7-minute abs.

1239
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:57,922
And we guarantee just as good a workout
as the 8-minute folk.

1240
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:00,520
You guarantee it? That's...
How do you do that?

1241
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,192
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes,

1242
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,862
we're going to send you
the extra minute free.

1243
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,998
You see? That's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.

1244
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:12,540
That's from A to B.

1245
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,077
That's right.
That's... that's good. That's good.

1246
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:16,737
Unless, of course,

1247
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:20,214
somebody comes up with 6-minute abs.
Then you're in trouble, huh?

1248
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:28,882
No!

1249
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,557
No, no, not six.

1250
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,087
I said seven.

1251
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,526
Nobody's coming up with six.

1252
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:35,064
Who works out in six minutes?

1253
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,531
You won't even get your heart going,

1254
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,363
not even a mouse on a wheel.

1255
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,062
That... good point.

1256
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,162
Seven's the key number here.
Think about it.

1257
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,968
- 7-Elevens.
- Yeah.

1258
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,099
Seven dwarves.

1259
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:47,109
Seven, man, that's the number.

1260
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:49,873
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch,

1261
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,346
eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.

1262
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:55,852
You know that old children's
tale from the sea.

1263
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:58,387
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese

1264
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:01,720
when it's clearly Brie time, baby.

1265
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,955
Step into my office.

1266
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,259
Why?

1267
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,592
'Cause you're fucking fired.

1268
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,861
Yeah. I got to pee.
I'm just going to pull over.

1269
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:13,562
Your car seats are making me itchy, man.

1270
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:16,629
What are these made out of? Cactus?

1271
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:24,377
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.

1272
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:32,749
Ohh!

1273
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:35,022
Hey, wait your turn.

1274
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,582
Hey, I didn't...

1275
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,553
Whoa.

1276
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,557
Freeze!

1277
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,560
Wait a minute.

1278
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:45,700
This is a raid!

1279
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,634
No. No, no, no, I was peeing.

1280
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,036
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.

1281
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:51,096
I was peeing, too!

1282
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:54,007
Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.
Let's go. Let's move it out.

1283
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,066
Let's go.

1284
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,047
Come on.

1285
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,210
Shit! Jimmy Shay, is that you?

1286
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:19,726
Oh, my God.

1287
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,095
Ted?

1288
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,842
<i>If you'll just let me</i>
<i>talk to you for one second</i>

1289
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:28,969
<i>outside of the truck</i>

1290
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,945
<i>Look, I still have to pee, all right?</i>

1291
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,948
<i>Get in the truck! Let's go. Let's go.</i>

1292
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:33,948
<i>Can I have a cup?</i>

1293
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:36,008
See, hon? I told you he was gay.

1294
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,077
<i>We'll be right back with more cops</i>

1295
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,680
<i>live from the heartland.</i>

1296
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,152
A veces pienso que aqu

1297
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,322
Todo es seguridad

1298
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,931
Por la seca castidad

1299
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,100
Lo de antes fue algo

1300
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,372
Ahora es mejor

1301
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,436
Oh, yeah, ahora es mejor...

1302
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:10,015
- Your grandmother is really something.
- Magda? No, Magda's not my grandmother.

1303
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:14,045
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago,

1304
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,753
and I don't think she likes being alone.
So, you know, she just hangs out.

1305
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:21,395
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.

1306
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:26,060
Sometimes I wish I could be like Magda
and not go home.

1307
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:31,573
I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some traveling.

1308
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:34,701
I don't know why anybody
would want to bounce around,

1309
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:37,406
you know, if they have
their own condo in Nepal.

1310
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,345
I'd be there in a second.

1311
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,474
I'd sell it.

1312
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:41,851
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1313
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:46,048
Start fresh in a new place,
give up the architect game.

1314
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:50,422
Slow things down a bit,
read more books, see more movies.

1315
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,222
Are you a movie buff?

1316
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:56,192
I try to be, but it's tough going out there
with all the crap they make today.

1317
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,598
I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.

1318
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,898
You know, classics
like <i>The Karate Kid</i>

1319
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,303
or <i>Harold and Maude.</i>

1320
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,775
<i>Harold and Maude</i>
is my all-time favorite movie.

1321
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,779
Don't bust my chops.
I know it's corny, but...

1322
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,474
Pat, I'm not kidding.

1323
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,449
I think that <i>Harold and Maude</i>
is one of the greatest

1324
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,008
love stories of our time.

1325
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,021
Here I thought I was the only one.

1326
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,987
You're too good to be true.
