1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,700
For my daughter MingXia

2
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,800
London, 2:30 PM

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,300
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,600
Hi, dear. I have bad news.
Your dad's prognosis isn't good.

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,300
You have to come.
-Did he ask you to call?

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Not in so many words.

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,300
We saw each other for 15 minutes last summer.
You were there, we had nothing to say as usual.

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,700
Sebastien, with his flat, bank account,
insurance, the university...

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,800
Your sister's in Australia.
I'm all alone, it's too much for me.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,500
I'll see if Gaelle can come.

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
Hi, love.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,000
He's worse?
-I have to be there.

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,500
I'll come.

14
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,800
THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS

15
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
The body of Christ.

16
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,800
The body of Christ.

17
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
The communion's for me.

18
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
The body of Christ.

19
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,300
How's Mr Desmarais?
-I don't know. I'm not Mr Desmarais.

20
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Sorry,
the computer system is a mess.

21
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,400
Constance Lazure.
- My wife Louise.

22
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,400
Must be hard having him here.

23
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,300
I threw him out 15 years ago.

24
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,700
So whether he's here
or humping co-eds in his condo...

25
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Gimme a break. You know it's been
years since I "humped" a co-ed.

26
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,000
And Raphaelle Metellus?
-She was Dominique and Pierre's student.

27
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,700
You were her private tutor? "Kneel down,
 open wide so that I don't feel your teeth."

28
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,100
I'd best continue my rounds. Have a good day!
-You too, Sister.

29
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,000
I called Sebastien to let him know.

30
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,500
You did?
-Aren't you glad?

31
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,000
Lovely, we can play his video games.
-He's still young.

32
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Ok, but couldn't he have read
one book in his life?

33
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,400
Any book? Is that asking too much?

34
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,100
He may not read, but he earns
more in a month than you earn in a year.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Thanks a lot.
-That's ok, we had room.

36
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,000
It's flying to Belfast Monday...
-I'll probably have to stay longer.

37
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,900
My darling!

38
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,200
You must be exhausted.
What time is it for you? 2 a.m.?

39
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,900
Gaelle, how are you, dear?
-Fine, thank you.

40
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,600
Hello, sir.
-Young man.

41
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,500
Do you remember Gaelle?
-Gaelle is unforgettable.

42
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,300
How are you?

43
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,900
No private rooms?
-I'm lucky I'm not in the hall.

44
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
I tried, all I got was voice mail.

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,800
<i>Dad's very sick.
Please get in touch.</i>

46
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,900
What I see isn't encouraging.

47
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
But to be sure I need a PET scan.

48
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,300
See if they can do it.
They can send it by satellite.

49
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
It stands for
Positron Emission Tomography.

50
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,600
Sherbrooke has one, but
there's a 6-12 month waiting list.

51
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,200
Isn't he going to Burlington today?
They have one, -

52
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,200
but it's expensive. $2000 U.S.
You'll have to pay cash or by credit card.

53
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,100
Money's no problem.
-You're lucky.

54
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,700
You never listened to my body.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,600
But I'm not laying a guilt.
-Look, I have to get dressed.

56
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,100
An ambulance is taking me to Burlington in 10 minutes.
-No more excuses!

57
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,700
For my radiation therapy.
-No!

58
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,800
The machines here are too old.
-Stop avoiding me.

59
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,700
This is my son, Sebastien,
he's going with me.

60
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,600
She's a woman I used to know, long ago.

61
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,700
I couldn't face coming alone.

62
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,300
You've never been here?
-Never.

63
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,700
But you see each other regularly.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,300
Always on neutral ground.
Usually in restaurants.

65
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Did he come to your place?
-Occasionally.

66
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
But you never came here.

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,500
No. I knew that this was where he
brought his mistresses.

68
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,100
If we're lucky, we'll find some little panties.

69
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm glad Sebastien's going with him today.

70
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
It's important they talk, those two.

71
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,300
[Playing "America, The Beautiful"]

72
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,300
You know the saying, "Christmas in the scanner,
Easter 6 feet under."

73
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,100
I have the scan.

74
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,100
It doesen't look good.
Not good at all.

75
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,600
We can't be certain,
but the margin of error is almost nil.

76
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
<i>Is he in a lot of pain?</i>

77
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,200
Why don't you bring him here?
At least he wouldn't suffer.

78
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,900
<i>We'll make sure of it.</i>

79
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm sorry, buddy.

80
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Baltimore's not far.
7 hours by car, an hour by plane.

81
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,700
I won't go into EXILE.
-Wouldn't you like your own room-

82
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,200
with a bathroom, CDs?
-What CDs?

83
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,700
So you can listen to music.
They have that in civilized countries. AC too.

84
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,700
Know what that costs?
-Nothing. I'll take care of it.

85
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,700
I won't know a soul.
-We'll all go tomorrow.

86
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,700
No we won't. I'm not going to the States,
I don't feel like being murderd by raging idots!

87
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,500
I voted for Medicare, I'll accept the consequences.
-Only idiots refuse to change.

88
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,100
I want to be with my friends.
-Your friends? Where are they?

89
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
Dominique's away, but Pierre...

90
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,700
Meanwhile you've got no one.
Apart from that lunatic this morning.

91
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,800
Which lunatic?
-It's irrelevant.

92
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,500
The tears, rolling eyes: My Remy!

93
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,400
Who's he talking about?
-Marlene Dupire.

94
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,300
You didn't sleep with Marlene Dupire?
She's a certified nut, everyone knows!

95
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You wrecked your family for her kind?
-I wrecked nothing!

96
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,900
You ruined Mom's life,
my adolescence, Sylvaine's...

97
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
Blaming me for her failure?

98
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,100
She loves the sea, she sails the world,
delivering yachts. Beats a 3rd-rate university.

99
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,400
You may be a millionaire,
but you know nothing!

100
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I know I won't end up like you!
She's the reason I'm here.

101
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,900
She raised me, not you!

102
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,500
Don't you have a plane
to catch to Hong Kong?

103
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,200
I don't need you, not for one second!
Go to hell!

104
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,300
Fuck you!
-Go to hell!

105
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,500
We're going back to London.
-You can't.

106
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,300
We offer him the best hospital in the world,
he refuses.

107
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,900
You heard him. He'll never change.

108
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,300
You plan to have kids?
-Definitely.

109
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
Until you're a parent
you'll never understand.

110
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,300
He changed your diapers.

111
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
He called your teachers every month
all through school.

112
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,700
He so wanted you to do well.

113
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,500
When you had meningitis at age 3,

114
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,300
he rocked you in his arms
for 48 hours non-stop,

115
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,700
without sleep,
to keep death at bay.

116
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
You can't remember that.

117
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,700
What should I do?

118
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Find his friends.
Find him a comfortable room.

119
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
That shouldn't be hard.

120
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,500
The Ministry forbids changing hospitals.
Anyway, they'd park him in the hall in Emergency.

121
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
The floor below is empty?
-2 years, now.

122
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Could he move there?
-Ice cream with your pie?

123
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,500
You can always ask at Administration.
Good luck!

124
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,100
I'll leave you now.

125
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,800
You know, you're lucky to have such a caring son.
-You think so?

126
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,700
How many children  come here?

127
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,800
Look around! See many children at their parent's 
bedside? I'm here every day, so I know.

128
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,400
I never see mine.

129
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,600
Did you have a father?
Was he ever hospitalized?

130
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,500
In the end.
-Did you visit him often?

131
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,600
He lived in Chicoutimi, I was teaching 
in Montreal, and it was winter.. so...

132
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,000
You came from England?

133
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
London, Chicoutimi, for you...
same thing? Cancer has made you a bit confused?

134
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,900
When it's over, press End.
That stops it.

135
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
It's hard, but if you concentrate,
you'll manage.

136
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,700
<i>Hi, Dad!
See, the Pacific Ocean.</i>

137
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,600
<i>We're sailing from Sydney
to New Caledonia,</i>

138
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,300
<i>on to Easter Island
and finally Valparaiso.</i>

139
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,800
<i>I'm sending you lots of sea air.
They say it's good for your health.</i>

140
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,600
<i>I have to go. Satellite connections
cost a fortune.</i>

141
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,000
<i>I'm sending you lots and lots of kisses.
Bye for now!</i>

142
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Security badge?
-Ms Pelletier? Lloyd's of London.

143
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,700
Didn't they give you one?
-No.

144
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Last door on the right.
But next time you need a badge.

145
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,100
Hello.
Pauline Joncas-Pelletier.

146
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,100
Please have a seat.

147
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,600
Well now, my assistant has informed me that you 
represent Lloyd's of London?

148
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,500
Nope, not at all, I said that just to get in.

149
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,800
My father's here on the 3rd floor.
I'd like to move him to the empty floor.

150
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,000
Set up something more comfortable.

151
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
That's wonderful!

152
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,500
[Snobby] Indead that complies perfectly with our awareness
programs involving family members.

153
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,400
But unfortunately our allocation
of infrastructure is determined

154
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,900
by the Ministry's ambulatory thrust.

155
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,000
It's absolutely impossible to target our
responses in terms of individual beneficiaries.

156
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm sure our personel...
-I prepared this file.

157
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,300
You must understand, our resource allocation
aims at prioritizing responses

158
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,400
according to diagnostic parameters
defined by the Region 02 consultations.

159
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Eh, seriously.
Even still, we're not quite in Third World.

160
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,300
Think it over.

161
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,400
[Snobby] Even if we close our eyes, we'd require
union integration and cooperation.

162
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,500
And that is a problematic!
-I'll handle them.

163
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,200
This file will be updated weekly.
I'll come back tomorrow. Thank you!

164
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,200
There's a room on the empty floor.
It'll take 5 minutes. I just want to show you.

165
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
I'll be back in 5.

166
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Sorry, take the next one.

167
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,100
I want to set up a room on this floor.
We could...

168
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,900
Look, nothing happens
without the union.

169
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,500
Nothing starts or ends without the union. Clear?
-Why do you think I came to you...

170
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,800
You'd have to paint it,
scrub the floor...

171
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Just a sec, man. Maybe you don' realize...

172
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,900
You're talking overtime, you realize.
And my guys don't... -Paid in cash.

173
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,400
Cash?
-Cash. One painter.

174
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,400
Two.

175
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,700
Six hours.

176
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,500
Eight.

177
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
What's the rate?

178
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,700
$40.
-$35.

179
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,900
I want a bed, curtains, chairs...
-Look, man, that's not us who does that.

180
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,500
You hire a crew, supervise the work.
And charge me reasonable admistration fees.

181
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:19,821
Reasonable?
-Under 19%

182
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Here's $2500 for starters.
We'll settle up every 2 days.

183
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,500
Where's my laptop?

184
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,400
What?
-My computer.

185
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,800
On the floor.
-It's not there.

186
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,800
It must be.
-Nothing there.

187
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,400
The floor, not the locker.
I'm not crazy. -It's not there.

188
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,500
Someone must have taken it.

189
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,300
Who?
-I don't know.

190
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,800
It seems like you don't get it. I've had 
50 emails since yesterday. How'll I recover them?

191
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,700
My entire deal with Norway.
I didn't have a backup. I was in the middle of doing it..

192
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Do you even know what I do?
-No. I would know if you had ever explained it.

193
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,900
Why bother? You never listen!

194
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,300
<i>There were, what, 3000 dead.
Historically, that's insignificant.</i>

195
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
<i>As a U.S. example,</i>

196
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,000
<i>50,000 died
at the Battle of Gettysburg.</i>

197
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,600
<i>What is significant,
as my old prof said,</i>

198
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,200
<i>is they struck at
the heart of the Empire.</i>

199
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,100
<i>In previous conflicts- Korea,
Vietnam, the Gulf War</i>

200
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,900
<i>the Empire managed to keep the barbarians
outside its gates, its borders</i>

201
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,400
<i>In that sense, people may look back on 9/11,
and I stress may,</i>

202
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,800
<i>as the beginning
of the great barbarian invasions.</i>

203
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
<i>Alain Lussier, thank you.</i>
<i>-My pleasure.</i>

204
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,300
Excuse me, my computer was just stolen.
-Oh yeah? Fill out this form.

205
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,200
What for?
-It's for the police.

206
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,100
Look, I've had all these
since Monday.

207
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,700
The police ever investigate?
-No, only when there's physical violence.

208
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,800
Last week a woman was raped in the
old laundry room, so then they came.

209
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,700
Otherwise they'd be here 24/7.

210
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,900
It's easy to rob patients.
Their eyes are closed half the time.

211
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
And the union protects the employees.

212
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,500
There's not much we can do.

213
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,500
Ronald?

214
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
What can I do for you, pal?
-I lost or misplaced my computer.

215
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Maybe in my dad's room. So, on the off-chance
someone should find a laptop somewhere...

216
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,200
We'll ask around,
but I can't guarantee anything.

217
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,600
In case.
-Right, in case. We'll check.

218
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,400
Thanks, I appreciate it.

219
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,400
Hello? Speaking.

220
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,500
Of course I remember you, Sebastien.

221
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,900
How are you?

222
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,700
Yes, it's been a long time.

223
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
He's very sick.

224
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,100
And he's all alone,
except for my mother.

225
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,300
I knew he was in hospital,
but I didn't realize...

226
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,100
I almost never come to Montreal, so...

227
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
Where is he now, is he still in hospital?

228
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,200
Pierre, I need you... now.

229
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,000
School's starting, we haven't found
a daycare, the kids are sick...

230
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,200
That's life. Always the same.

231
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,500
I'll try to get a flight.

232
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,400
You say that because times
are so terrible.

233
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,500
Not especially terrible. Not at all.

234
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,600
Contrary to belief,
the 20th centaury wasn't that bloody.

235
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,200
It's agreed that wars caused 100 million deaths.
A round figure generally loved by historians.

236
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Add 10 million
for the Russian gulags.

237
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,500
The Chinese camps, we'll never know,
but say 20 million.

238
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,500
So 130, 135 million dead.
Not all that impressive.

239
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,600
In the 16th centuary,
the Spanish and the Portuguese managed,

240
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,600
without gas chambers or bombs, to slaughter
150 million Indians in Latin America.

241
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,700
That's a lot of work, Nurse.
150 million, with axes!


242
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,800
Even if they had Church support,
it was an achievement

243
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,700
So much so that the Dutch, English,
French and later Americans

244
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,200
followed their lead
and butchered another 50 million.

245
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,700
200 million dead in all!

246
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,000
The greatest massacre in history
took place right here. Right around us.

247
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
And not the tiniest
Holocaust museum.

248
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,700
The history of mankind
is a history of horrors!

249
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,700
They had a trial program with heroin 
a little while ago.

250
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,300
See if it still exists.

251
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
Heroin's 800% more effective
than morphine.

252
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,500
At the end it makes a huge difference.
-Ok, thanks.

253
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,000
Get some rest.
-I will, good night.

254
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,300
Are you pals with the Premier,
or a hockey star?

255
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,500
His son takes care of him.
-Oh, I know, and "Dumbo" won't thank him.

256
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,300
My son is an ambitious
and puritanical capitalist.

257
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,800
Whereas I was always a sensual socialist.
-Sensual isn't half of it, Sister.

258
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,300
Lewd!- Debauched! -Bestial!
-Lascivious! -Perverse!

259
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,700
How are you, you lusty sinner?
-Better!

260
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,700
Give me a kiss, you randy snake!

261
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
You're back?
-Yesterday?

262
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
And Alaska?
-Lovely and cold, like me!

263
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,200
You see, Sister? My exquisite daughter-in-law, my
heroic wife, and two most charming mistresses.

264
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,900
I can die in peace.
-You'll burn in the flames of hell.

265
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,900
And I won't be alone. They're safe, but given the
depravity of these two, they'll roast alongside me.

266
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,100
Whereas you'll be condemed to play the harp on a cloud

267
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,900
for eternity, seated between John Paul II,
a surly Pole, and Mother Theresa, a slimy Albanian

268
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,900
His illness has reached his brain.

269
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,200
No, it's an ethnological truth,
Louise.

270
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,300
Albanians are often slimy
and Poles are always surly.

271
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,200
"for the misfortunes of Poland
are proof of God's existence!"

272
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,800
Hello. I'd like to meet someone, a police
officer or detective in the narcotics squad.

273
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,100
Have a seat.

274
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,300
<i>Come stai</i>, you big pig?
-What are you doing here, old queer?

275
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,500
This is Alessandro.

276
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,000
We've heard all about you.

277
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,700
Gilles Levac.
My partner, Kim Delgado.

278
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,500
Have a seat.
-Thanks.

279
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,300
My father's hospitalized here
in Montreal.

280
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,200
He gets rotten care, of course,
and he's in pain.

281
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,900
A doctor friend suggested
I get him some heroin.

282
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,700
I know little about drugs.
As a student I smoked pot.

283
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,400
Drugs are sold in every city,
and the police know where.

284
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I hoped, perhaps naively, you could recommend some
spots where I can find high-quality heroin.

285
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,700
That's fascinating, except that...

286
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:48,300
our job is to arrest dealers,
not help prospective buyers.

287
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,400
think of me as a smart guy
trying to save time.

288
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Think of me as someone not too dumb
who doesen't want to read a headline:

289
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,400
"Police Help Our Journalist
to Buy Narcotics."

290
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,700
I'm no... -She and I don't want to end
our days directing traffic in Chibougamau.

291
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,500
I swear I'm not a reporter.
-Why should I believe you?

292
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,400
I'm a market operator with MacDougall Deutsch.
It's easy to check.

293
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,500
It's easy to print phony cards.

294
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,900
Sorry to disturb you.

295
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,900
I'll have to try the discos.

296
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,800
Look, the Citrouillard family!

297
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,200
Claude, I don't believe it!
How are you?

298
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,500
Heroin used to be for the rich.
Now prices have dropped and that's changed.

299
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,000
But traditionally it's the
drug of musicians and poets...

300
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,400
You mean, ask my friends?
-I don't mean anything.

301
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,300
I'm repeating rumors circulated in the media.
-Ok.

302
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,200
What exactly do you do?

303
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:31,200
My dear, I'm the director of the
Canadian University Institute of Rome.

304
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,400
What exactly does it do,
the Canadian University Institute of Rome?

305
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:46,900
In fact we're a leading cultural agency that
assists Canadian university students in Rome.

306
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,400
And how many Canadian university
students are there in Rome?

307
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,600
In fact, a few.

308
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,200
Why do you ask?

309
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,600
We like to know how our taxes
are being squandered.

310
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,500
We're a very modest operation. Naturally
the director requires paid housing...

311
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,800
...where you're always welcome,
of course.

312
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,900
You haven't been hit by cutbacks?
-Quite impossible.

313
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,300
The Institute is buried in the budgetary
quagmire of Foreign Affairs.

314
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,100
The Minister himself
has no inkling we exist.

315
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Who should I have slept with
to get that job?

316
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm afraid that people I slept with
would've been blind to your charms,

317
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
however abundant they are.

318
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Abundance has it fans, dearie.
-Not in Foreign Affairs.

319
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,100
This it?

320
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,500
Someone found it somewhere?
-That's it.

321
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,800
I have to get heroin for him.
I need someone with contacts.

322
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I've been away too long.

323
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,600
The only powder I sniff now
is "Baby's Own."

324
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,400
I could try to ask my daughter.
Remember Nathalie? -Yes, a little.

325
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,200
I can't promise anything.
I rarely hear from her.

326
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,400
Hi, sweetheart.
It's mom. It's Diane.

327
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,300
I miss you, sweetheart.

328
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,300
Look,
remember Sebastien, Remy's son?

329
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,100
You often played together as kids.

330
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,900
He wants to meet.
He needs some information.

331
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,900
So call whenever you like,
at any time.

332
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,200
If you prefer not to talk to me,
I'll leave you his number.

333
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,300
We have to hit Costco before 6.
We need a shitload of diapers.

334
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,400
Children cost so much.

335
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,000
Why do people in the Third World
have so many?

336
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,900
What a dumb thing to say.
-Your poor students, if you teach such crap!

337
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,600
Did you get that book I mentioned?
-Which one?

338
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,300
<i>Inner Healing</i> by Swami Rapudanthra.

339
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,300
No, unfortunately not.
-I'll bring it. Your body's in your head.

340
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,900
Illness starts and ends in the head.
I keep telling Pierre that.

341
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,700
Well, we'll be going.
-See you soon.

342
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,500
How old is she? It's not about age.
Her breasts outweigh her brain.

343
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,400
Cut it out. -It's true! The quantity of blood
required to irrigate the mass

344
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,600
drains the brain. It's physiological.
-I do not want any comments.

345
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,500
She's given me two girls
who've transformed my life.

346
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,300
And a mere brush of her hand
makes me as hard as a bull.

347
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,100
Which you'll agree
is a godsend at our age.

348
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,400
Nathalie?

349
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,800
I think I would recognize you. Come.

350
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,500
Do you work full-time?

351
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,800
What do you do?
-Proofreader.

352
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,800
For a publishing company?

353
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,300
Boreal Press.
-So your hours are flexible.

354
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,600
My proposal is that
I pay for your consumption,

355
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
as well as my father's. 
And a salary for the time you spend with him.

356
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,500
Want brown or white?
-I don't know anything about it.

357
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,700
To smoke or shoot up?
-I trust you.

358
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,400
You shouldn't.
-Why not?

359
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,900
You should never trust a junkie.

360
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,100
The're too used to lying.

361
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,500
It's right there.

362
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,400
How much do you need?
-$500.

363
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,400
It's pretty chilly, huh?

364
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,900
That girl's innocent. She's the daughter of 
my father's friend and shes doing me a favor.

365
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,200
Arrest me, but forget her.
-You want me to arrest you?

366
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
Think I'm a fool?
-Not at all.

367
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,800
You located Olivier in two days.
Pretty good.

368
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,300
Olivier?
-The dealer.

369
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,300
Why not arrest him?
-Want me to arrest everyone?

370
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,500
Oh wow, recognize him?
-He's Michel Richer, the biologist.

371
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,600
You never bust suppliers?

372
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,700
All the time. We work 2,3 years, and 
finally bust an Iranian gang.

373
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Everybody's happy. Then Iraqis took their place.

374
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Or the Lebanese, Turks, Italians.

375
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,700
There's too much demand.
It's an invasion.

376
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,100
What are you doing here?
I mean, now?

377
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,900
My job.
-I see.

378
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,100
Keeping the peace.

379
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,700
The fish are biting
in Zampino's pond.

380
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
Time to go fishing.

381
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,800
What did you study?

382
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,900
Why do you ask?
-Curious.

383
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,800
Criminology, minor in psych.
You?

384
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Mathematics, minor in economics.

385
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,300
Take care.
-You too.

386
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
You don't remember me?
-No.

387
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
I was close to your mom.

388
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,700
You mean you slept with her?
-Not just that.

389
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,200
Were you married?
-Yes.

390
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,900
The married ones
never stayed till morning.

391
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,000
My sister and I would see them if we woke up at night.

392
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,100
From a child's perspective,
it must seem sordid.

393
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,200
We called it
sexual liberation.

394
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,200
What's that?
-Heroin.

395
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,600
It comes from opium, right?

396
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,700
It's morphine mixed with chemicals.

397
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,400
Will you inject it?
-We'll start by inhaling and then we'll see.

398
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,100
It's incredible to...

399
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,400
Be quiet now. Try to concentrate.

400
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,500
The first time is the best.
It's the one you long for later.

401
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,500
It's called <i>riding the dragon.</i>

402
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Morning.
-Good morning.

403
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,600
It smells. Have you been smoking?
-Not on your life. Thats just a candle I light for my medi-mications.

404
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,300
Where's your IV?
-Dr Levesque had it removed.

405
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Good morning, my doctresses.

406
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,900
Take a deep breath.

407
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,200
Does it hurt here?
-Oh, yes.

408
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,000
And here too?
-There too, yes.

409
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,100
Is it unbearable?
-Goodness, no!

410
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,000
You're in high spirits.
-Couldn't be higher!

411
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,900
How do you sleep?
-Like a baby.

412
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,600
Then I won't prescribe painkillers.

413
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,900
Forget it!
-That's wonderful.

414
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,300
I always say, the longer
they stay lucid, the better.

415
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,200
I plan to remain lucid till I die.

416
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,500
Wonderful, Mr Paranteau.
-Thanks so much, Dr. Dube.

417
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,100
I'm not Dr. Dube.
-How fitting, because I'm not Mr. Parenteau.

418
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,300
Who's he?

419
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,700
So it all started
with Maria Goretti.

420
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,000
Exactly. The girl who said, No!
-Which one was Maria Goretti?

421
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,300
A Portuguese peasant.
-Portuguese? Santa Maria Goretti!

422
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,700
She was Italian?
-From Nettuno.

423
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,100
Portugal, that's Fatima, the apparitions,
the Virgin, the shepherds.

424
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,100
The secret of Fatima.
-Which only the Pope could hear.

425
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,500
Poor Canada, in 1960.
-Look, we believed it.

426
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,000
So they filmed the edifying life
of Maria Goretti.

427
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,800
Starring?
-I've racked my brains.

428
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,900
Ines Orsini.

429
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,900
Of course! The Immortal Ines Orisini!
How could I forget?

430
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,900
I saw it at school in Padua with the Jesuits.
-Me, the Jesuits at Brebeuf.

431
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,100
Me, at the Chicoutimi seminary.

432
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,800
For the whole film the
immortal Ines Orsini

433
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,900
is covered from head to toe.

434
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:40,600
But at some point they had to at least suggest
the abject nature of the bestial desire

435
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,000
<i>of the vile rapist.</i>

436
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,200
<i>So the exquisite Maria dips
her adorable toes into the ocean.</i>

437
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,500
<i>With a regal but</i> modest <i>gesture,
she lifts her skirt...</i>

438
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,500
The thighs of Ines Orsini!
-Even I remember!

439
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,100
Oh, the rivers of sperm I spilled
dreaming of her thighs.

440
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,600
So that explains the rise of the St. Lawrence 
River water basin. 

441
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:18,100
For years I'd fall asleep with
a hard-on, dreaming of Ines Orsini,

442
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,000
until the day I saw <i>Francoise Hardy
on TV singing</i> All the Boys and Girls.

443
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,200
<i>I was suddenly indifferent to Ines's holy airs.</i>
-Maria Goretti, alone,

444
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,700
<i>abandoned - the fate of womanhood</i>

445
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,100
<i>For a long time I slept with
Francoise Hardy. We were very happy.</i>

446
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,400
<i>Alas, I discovered Julie Christie in a film.
Our mad affair lasted six months,</i>

447
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,500
<i>till I met Chris Evert,
the tennis champ,</i>

448
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,000
<i>whom I left for the sublime Karen Kain</i>

449
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,800
<i>dancing carmen in Marseille.</i>

450
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,600
All my life I went to bed
with the world's most gorgeous women.

451
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,400
Then one morning I woke up realizing
I'd fallen asleep dreaming of the Caribbean Sea.

452
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,900
I'd grown old.
Women had deserted my dreams.

453
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,000
It's been so long
since I dreamed of a man.

454
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,600
Why don't you explain to me someday 
just what is it you do?

455
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,200
You're president of a Norwegian oil firm.

456
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,900
From a failing U.S. company
you've bought a North Sea oil field.

457
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,800
You can produce oil for $7 per barrel,
and you sell for $25.

458
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,900
But you want to limit your exposure
to fluctuating oil prices. How?

459
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,700
No idea.
-You see me, we do a swap.

460
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,200
What's that?
-A deal where my bank pays you

461
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,500
a fixed price
and you pay the floating price.

462
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,100
You contract to sell your oil at a fixed
price for a fixed period. In short,

463
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,600
I manage financial risk.

464
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,800
Are you good at what you do?

465
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,700
Pretty good.

466
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,900
Could you get the driver
to stop at the lake?

467
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
Probably.

468
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,800
I'd like to see the lake.

469
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,800
At Berkley I did my PhD alongside Locken and
Donaldson, two future Pulitzers.

470
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,500
They were no better than me,
but they were American.

471
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,000
Me, I came back here, I started
to teach, got married,

472
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,100
And then... then nothing else.

473
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Your affairs kept you too busy.
-That was small time, like you said.

474
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,300
No, what I lacked was extravagance.

475
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Basically all I ever succeded in was pathetic trysts
in poorly heated East End flats.

476
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,900
I was replaced by a TA within 48 hours.
The dean neglected to say goodbye.

477
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,200
The lowliest secretary
gets a cake for maternity leave.

478
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:14,200
Ladies and gentlemen, for health reasons
I'll be unable to complete this term.

479
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,300
Ms Raphaelle Metellus
will replace me.

480
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,700
Does this affect our deadlines?

481
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
No, deadlines and exam dates
remain unchanged.

482
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,300
Any other questions?

483
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,500
Good luck.
-Thanks.

484
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:48,200
So, as you saw last week, the 1840
election was particularly stormy.

485
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,900
The Whig party,

486
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,700
then newly formed, united four
distinct constituencies

487
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,200
First, the National Republicans, followers of
Adams and Clay, the party founders.

488
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,000
Irina's home, I have to go out.

489
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,900
Is Nathalie buying for you?

490
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,100
She's a friend.

491
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,500
If you're a regular,
maybe we should deal directly.

492
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,000
It's only temporary.

493
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,000
Everything in life is temporary.

494
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,900
"you can never swim
in the same river twice," said...

495
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,000
what's his face? You know...

496
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,700
You can't count on Nathalie.
She'll pull a fast one on you.

497
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,000
We'll see.

498
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,000
You know where I live.
-Sure.

499
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,900
What are you doing?
-I was waiting for you. I wanted to see you.

500
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,100
You're always on my mind.
-I know, you've told me.

501
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,200
At night I picture you bleeding
in an alley, in shooting galleries.

502
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,500
I'm always so scared.
It's unbearable.

503
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,900
You imagine too much.

504
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,100
You know this can't go on.

505
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,700
Of course I know. I know it better 
than you. You can't do anything for me.

506
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400
I know it's my fault,
that's what's killing me.

507
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,400
That doesn't change anything.
I don't need this.

508
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,900
You don't care much
about living, do you?

509
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,500
Not really.

510
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:20,200
I was like you at your age. Ready to
die at any time. I give a shit.

511
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,500
That's why the young people
make the best martyrs.

512
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,400
It's paradoxical,
but living grows on you,

513
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,200
when you begin to subtract:
I've got 20 years left, 15, 10.

514
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,200
When you realize it's for the last time.

515
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
I'm buying my last car.

516
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,900
This is my last trip
to Genoa, Barcelona...

517
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,900
I won't live that long.
-How do you know?

518
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,000
Overdoses are pretty frequent, you know.

519
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,500
But you can never tell. Maybe you'll
kick it and reach a ripe old age.

520
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,900
We can't decipher the past,
how can we know the future?

521
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,900
No one ever knows what'll happen to them.

522
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,700
Except me, now. I know.

523
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:09,100
Are you scared? -Sure am. I don't want to
stop living. I loved life so much. You can't know how much.

524
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,600
What was it you loved?
-Everything.

525
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,500
Wine, books, music, women,
above all women.

526
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,400
Their smell, their mouths,
the feel of their skin.

527
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,200
Were there many of them?
-Yes.

528
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,300
Don't they begin to seem the same?
-A bit, yes.

529
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,100
But I never get tired of them.

530
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:39,300
Still the great seducer? -No, not anymore.
With age, it's not the same thing.

531
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,000
At least you can enjoy wine just as much as before.

532
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,700
Unfortunately  not.
Not with my liver.

533
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,600
The trips you dreamed of,
did you make them?

534
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,300
Ah, in any case, nowadays there are tourists everywhere.

535
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:00,000
It's not the present you cling on,
It's your past.

536
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,900
That life is already dead.
-Perhaps.

537
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,800
I expected a musty antique dealer,
not a ravishing young lady.

538
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,000
I warn you, I'm no specialist.

539
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,400
At one time
everyone here was Catholic.

540
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,400
Like in Spain or Ireland.

541
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:28,300
At a very precise moment in 1966, in fact the
churches suddenly emptied out, in a few months.

542
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,400
A very strange phenomenon
that has yet to be explained.

543
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,100
So now we don't know
what to do with this.

544
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,900
The authorities would like to find
out if it has any value.

545
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,000
Commercial value?
-Yes.

546
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,900
Do you have any 18th-centuary
French cahlices?

547
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,900
The Americans snapped them up.
There are a few examples in the museums.

548
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,700
I'm sure this has great value
for people here, the collective memory.

549
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,800
But is there anything that we could sell?
-On the world market?

550
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,500
Honestly, I can't imagine it.

551
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,100
In other words,
this is all absolutely worthless.

552
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,100
I'll show you out.

553
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,600
Pius XII sitting on his ass
in his gilded Vatican

554
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,700
while Primo Levi was taken
to Auschwitz... That's not sad!

555
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,000
It's despicable! Hideous!

556
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:26,300
If what you say is true, and history
is a series of abominable crimes,

557
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,900
then someone has to exist
who can forgive us.

558
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,600
That's my belief.

559
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,500
I envy you.

560
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,100
If at least I'd written.

561
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,200
You wrote nothing?
-A few papers here and there, nothing serious.

562
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,000
What are you doing?

563
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,100
What are you doing?
-It bugs me.

564
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
What would you have written?

565
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,500
<i>The Gulag Archipelago,
The Periodic Table.</i>

566
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,400
Really, you think you could have done that?
-Never. -So?

567
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:12,700
At least I'd have left a mark. We need to
succeed, even on our own terms.

568
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,500
To be a able to say we did our best.
It allows us to die at peace.

569
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,700
I'm a total failure.
-At least you realize it.

570
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,200
So many professors are smug,
unbearable.

571
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:32,600
I don't know your daughter,
but Sebastien's not exactly a failure.

572
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,700
Not thanks to me.
-You don't know that.

573
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,500
We thought we'd pay a visit.
-Everyone wonders how you are.

574
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,300
Not everyone, surely.
-You'd be surprised.

575
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,200
That last day in class
no one seemed very moved.

576
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,700
We had no idea at the time.
-Exactly. Now that you're gone...

577
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,900
We see what we're missing.

578
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,700
I'm touched to hear that. Sincerely.

579
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,100
We should be going.

580
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,500
We have a lecture by Mr Roby at 4.
-Off you go.

581
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,100
Good luck.
-Thanks.

582
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,800
-Don't give up.
-I won't.

583
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,100
Well I never.
-Surprising.

584
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,500
For illiterates, they're sweet.

585
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,800
It's not their fault.
No one taught them.

586
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,500
At this price we'll come anytime.
-We'll see.

587
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,000
I don't want it.

588
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,300
We agreed.
-No, thanks.

589
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,300
Do you want to split hers?

590
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,400
We're getting married next summer,
at my parents' in France.

591
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,100
You'll see, the chapel's lovely.

592
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,800
Louise and I married on

593
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,900
a grey February day in a dismal suburb.

594
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,800
So we could sleep together
without our families hassling us.

595
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,600
I want a wedding on the Loire.

596
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,500
6 months later I cheated on her.

597
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
That was fast.
-Indeed.

598
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,400
When I met Sebastien, I said: With him
it's forever, there'll be no one else.

599
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,400
I hope it lasts, for your sake.

600
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,700
Because, you know, love...
-No, no, no! Not "love."

601
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,000
Mom and Dad
talked about nothing else. "Love."

602
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,100
I love you. I love you too much.
I don't love you.

603
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,200
You can't build a life
on pop-song philosophy.

604
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,300
<i>Love Me Tender. Love, Love Me Not.</i>
It's ridiculous.

605
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,400
My parents divorced when I was 3.

606
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,400
For several years Dad continued
to come over for Sunday lunch.

607
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,600
Half an hour before he left,
I'd vanish.

608
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,700
I'd be lying on the ground in front
of his car so he couldn't leave.

609
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,300
Its out of the question that my 
kids go through that.

610
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:49,100
So now my nocturnal pleasures are provided by
my giant-screen Toshiba at the foot of my bed.

611
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,400
No more curled-up toes?

612
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,400
That's over. I've seen enough ceilings.
-For ever?

613
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,300
I've closed the store, laid down my weapons,
hung up my skates.

614
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,300
Things are much quieter between us too.
-Well, well.

615
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,000
He's in Bologna all week
and I'm in Rome.

616
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,300
There's the weekend, but...

617
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,400
My wife falls asleep in bed
with the kids.

618
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,500
Great, you can reread Tocqueville.

619
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,600
That's what I did.
2000 pages on bible paper.

620
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,900
He's increasingly cultivated,
and his prostate increasingly swollen.

621
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,500
Sorry, I still enjoy it a lot.

622
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,700
In the country
there's an old cowboy I...

623
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,900
Cowboy? You're with a cowboy now?

624
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,900
Yes. There's an old cowboy
I invite over to shake my bush.

625
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,700
To shake your bush!
-Yes, but we had a fight.

626
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,700
I'll never understand men.
All my life I date asses

627
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,700
who thought only of escaping
after satisfying their base needs.

628
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,700
The other day, as a compliment,
I said to my cowboy:

629
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,400
To think we can still have sexual flings at our age.
He was incensed. He doesn't want to be a sex object,

630
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,300
talks about his masculinity.
-We love that!

631
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,900
Invokes father hunger goes on about exploring
his feminine side, his inner me.

632
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,500
It was unbearable.

633
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,300
The last thing I want is
a limp-dicked sentimentalist.

634
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,400
I want to be screwed forcefully.
That's all.

635
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,300
I'm sensitive
and smart enough for two.

636
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,200
A rub-down?

637
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,500
Would he like a rub-down? Does the
Muslim need to bow towards Mecca?

638
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,600
Does the Carmelite
long for the Holy Species?

639
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,700
Is this your first time here?
-Yes...

640
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,700
I don't know if you believe
in random acts of kindness,

641
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,800
but if you do,
render this sick man happy.

642
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,100
Give him the mother
of all rub-downs.

643
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,200
You will be repaid a hundredfold
in this life or another.

644
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,800
Am I in heaven already?

645
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,500
Are you my Valkyrie, my houri?

646
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,100
Oh joy!

647
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,900
Nathalie didn't show.

648
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,800
It's bad.
Your father's in withdrawal.

649
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,600
Know where Nathalie is?
-No idea.

650
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,900
She's disappeared.
-I warned you.

651
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,700
I may come back.
-Before 11.

652
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,500
I'm not supposed to do this.

653
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,200
You were right.
You said not to trust you.

654
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,900
Your dealer said that too.

655
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,400
Wake up. We've a contract.

656
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,100
What contract?
-I buy the dope, you look after Dad.

657
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,900
What's with him?
-He's waiting for you.

658
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,100
We're coming.

659
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,700
You honor a contract!

660
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:32,500
That's heavy, man.
-No its not "heavy." We had a deal. I'm counting on you.

661
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,900
At the market... my dad...
Y'know, my dad...

662
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,800
Want to trade dads?
Me, I made my life.

663
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,700
Perfect young man.

664
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,500
Perfect career.

665
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,800
Perfect fiancee.

666
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm imperfect. It's sad.
It's very sad.

667
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,000
Where have you been?
I didn't know what to do.

668
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,200
Get a spoon.
-What?

669
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,400
A spoon.

670
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,700
Fill it to thirty.

671
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,100
I can't manage.

672
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,400
What is this?
-Don't ask, we don't have time.

673
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:37,500
You have to help. I beg you. Give him this.
He needs it. Please, I'll explain later.

674
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,700
What's in it?
-Heroin.

675
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,900
I beg you.

676
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,200
Shut the door, at least.
-I'm going.

677
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,800
Just this once.
-It'll soon be over.

678
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,900
Better?

679
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,700
We sat on your pier. He was never
happier than at the lake.

714
01:07:18,002 --> 01:07:21,871
So I thought maybe could we borrow your cottage?
-Sure anytime. I'll get the keys.

680
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,200
What is it?
-The keys to the cottage.

681
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,700
What for? -I'm letting Sebastien use it.
He wants to take Remy.

682
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,300
Without asking me?
-I'm truly sorry.

683
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,200
I'm the one who decorated it.
-That's true.

684
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,400
The hours at Ikea,
don't they count.

685
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,600
Or the curtains I sewed? You lend our
house to strangers without asking!

686
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,900
Remy's not a stranger.

687
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,000
That's why Nicole
divorced Tom Cruise!

688
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,000
He'd lend their Colorado home
to anybody.

689
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Thats enough. I'm lending my house
to my friend Reamy, and you shut up.

690
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:09,300
If that's how it is, I won't stay another
second. I'm taking the girls and moving out.

691
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,300
I'm sorry. Forget it, we'll manage.

692
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,700
No way. Use it whenever you like.

693
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:23,700
Don't worry. It's always this way.
That's life. -Thanks.

694
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,200
No news from Sylvaine?

695
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,700
No, I even called
the boat's owned in Chile.

696
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I hope she's ok.
-She is, it's just the Net uplink.

697
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,200
The Pacific's big.

698
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,300
Goodbye.

699
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:01,400
Embrace the mystery
and you'll be saved.

700
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,600
Tell him you love him.

701
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,100
Tell him, and touch him.

702
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,500
Drink this one.
-Right now?

703
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,800
Here. Methadone's serious.

704
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:48,700
Now I trust you.
-Drink one a day.

705
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,900
Only one. No more, no less.
Come back on Monday.

706
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,100
If you screw up,
you're out of the program.

707
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,100
I still can't come to terms with it.
-You know you have to.

708
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,000
I can't accept it.

709
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,100
That's how it is. It's a law.

710
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,700
The very instant you shut your eyes,

711
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,600
millions more will also die at the same time.

712
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,600
But I won't be here anymore. <i>Me.</i>
I'll be gone for good.

713
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,200
If at least I'd learned something.

714
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,000
I feel as helpless
as the day I was born.

715
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,700
I haven't found a meaning. It's

716
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Thats what we have to look for.

717
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,100
I have to keep searching.

718
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
We've been everything.

719
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,900
Separatists, independantists,
sovereignists, sovereignty-associationists.

720
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,800
At first we were existentialists.

721
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
We read Sartre and Camus.

722
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,000
Then Fanon,
we became anti-colonialists.

723
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,800
We read Marcuse and became Marxists.
-Marxist-Leninists.

724
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,800
Trotskyists.
-Maoists.

725
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,500
After Solzhenitsyn we changed.
We were structuralists.

726
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,000
Situationists.
-Feminists.

727
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,900
Demonstructionists.
-Is there an "ism" we haven't worshipped.

728
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,900
Cretinism.
-God no. Think of Guo Jing.

729
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:57,200
Who was he? -An archeologist
with a skirt slit to the crotch.

730
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,400
Even you remember. -In the 70s,
China opens up to the West.

731
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:09,600
Wou Jing  comes on a cultural exchange. The
university sends its trusty radical, me...

732
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,600
I enter the dining room of her hotel.
I spot her, and die.

733
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,200
<i>Beauty that could melt Emperor Qin's
7000 terra cotta warriors.</i>

734
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,500
<i>I order tea, we make small talk.</i>

735
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,500
I can see us doing Pekinese lotus.
-The Szechuan dragon.

736
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,300
<i>To make myself appear intresting,</i>

737
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,700
I dive in: "Your country has achieved so much.

738
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,400
We're so enviable. Your
Cultural Revolution is wonderful!"

739
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,000
Her lovely black eyes glaze over.

740
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,300
I'm mortified to realize
that she's thinking,

741
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,900
"He's either a CIA agent
or the worst cretin in the West."

742
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,500
So much for the lotus and dragon.

743
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,800
For two years she'd cleaned pigsties
on a re-education farm.

744
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,700
Father murdered,
mother committed suicide.

745
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,800
And some thick French-Canadian who's
seen the films of Jean-Luc Godard

746
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,400
and read Philippe Sollers

747
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:23,000
says that the Chinese
Cultural Revolution, is wonderful!

748
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,300
Cretinism doesnt sink any lower.

749
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,100
Voluntary simplicity.

750
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,700
Scrambled eggs with ossetra caviar
and fresh truffles. -From Tuscany.

751
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:53,800
And to stay in Italy, Castello Banfi Excelsus,
a modest vintage.

752
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:58,700
Why were we so dumb?
-Are we to infer congenital stupidity?

753
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,300
Not at all.
-Intelligence isn't an individual trait.

754
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,200
It's collective,
national, intermittent.

755
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,700
Oh, a new theory!

756
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,700
Athens, 416BC
Euripides premieres his <i>Electra</i>

757
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,900
Two rivals attend,
Sophocles and Aristophanes.

758
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,500
And two friends, Socrates and Plato.
Intelligence was there.

759
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,600
Firenze, 1504, Palazzo Vecchio,

760
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:29,800
on facing walls, two painters:
Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.

761
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,700
An apprentice: Rafaello.
A manager: Niccolo Machiavelli.

762
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,500
Philadelphia, USA, 1776 - 1787.

763
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,000
Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution.

764
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,600
Adams, Franklin, Jefferson,
Washington, Hamilton and Madison.

765
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,000
No other country
has been so blessed.

766
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,700
I was born in Chicoutimi,
Canada, in 1950.

767
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,300
It's a miracle you're stupider.

768
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,700
in 1950, everyone was dumb,
in Athens and Chicoutimi.

769
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,100
In Italy you'd have supported
the Red Brigades.

770
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,200
Now it's Berlusconi.
-Philadelphia voted George Bush.

771
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,800
You see, you're not that dumb.

772
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,200
Intelligence has disappeared,
and it can take eons to come back.

773
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,900
From Tacitus to Dante was what,
11 centuries?

774
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,900
Ah but intelligence was off with the Arabs.
-True.

775
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,500
You're not hungry?

776
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,100
It won't go down.
-And you? -No thanks.

777
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:42,100
I never thought I'd see the day
you'd turn down fresh truffles.

778
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,500
Alas, that day is here.

779
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,900
A sip of wine?

780
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,300
Drink to my health
and tell me how good it is.

781
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,400
I'd like to die
just like Felix Faure.

782
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,300
Why am I not surprised?

783
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,000
I can dream.
-Who was he? Why?

784
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:42,100
Oh blessed Felix Faure, the
President of the French Republic.

785
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,700
His heart stopped beating,

786
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,700
while his mistress the admirable
Madame Steinheil, kneeling before him,

787
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:54,100
bestowed on him the most
glorious blowjob of all time.

788
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,800
My god!
-His enemies gloated:

789
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,900
"She seized him, the would-be
Caesar and he had a seizure!"

790
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,900
Henceforth Madame Steinheil
was known as the kiss of death.

791
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,300
I should be so lucky!

792
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,300
It's not our fault
if your heart is unstoppable.

793
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:25,500
I'd like to remind you that at a certain time,
I and several others here

794
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,700
blew you most heartily,
with enough force to capsize a schooner.

795
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,200
What do you know
about blowing buoys?

796
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,900
Well, sir, our efforts
earned gushing praise.

797
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,900
Heavens, that's hard to swallow.

798
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,200
I'm beat.
-Go to bed.

799
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,400
Aren't you coming?
-Not tonight.

800
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,100
The Middle Ages, the manuscripts...

801
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,100
The barbarians,
everywhere, tomorrow...

802
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,300
Their prince approaches.

803
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
Think you're funny?

804
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,000
I'm scared.

805
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,700
We'll do what you want.
It's your decision.

806
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,800
Know what I want for you?

807
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,600
To have as fine a son as you.

808
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,900
Heard from Sylvaine?
-No.

809
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,500
Tell her I thought of her.

810
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,900
I love you.

811
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,200
Not so long ago
I'd have jumped you without asking.

812
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,700
I might have let you.
-I suspected as much.

813
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,700
I wasn't here today. You didn't see me.
-Of course.

814
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,300
This just came in.

815
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:50,300
<i>On a ship,
you call it the evil eye...</i>

816
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:58,800
<i>Striking a growler - an iceberg -</i>

817
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,800
<i>at night,
or a fire from an oil leak...</i>

818
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,900
<i>It's been too long
since I've seen you.</i>

819
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,100
<i>My Daddy, my Papuschka,</i>

820
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,700
<i>I've have missed you all my life.</i>

821
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,300
<i>Tell yourself I'm a happy woman,
I've found my place.</i>

822
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:34,200
<i>I don't know how you did it, but
you managed to pass on your lust for life</i>

823
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:42,200
<i>You and Mom raised incredibly strong
children. It's a miracle really.</i>

824
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:53,100
<i>You know, the first man in a
woman's life is her father.</i>

825
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,300
<i>You'll always be with me.</i>

826
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,800
Friends, sharing this modest life
with you has been a delight.

827
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,200
I take your smiles with me.

828
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,000
Remy, Remy...

829
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,700
The man of my life.

830
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,400
My guardian angel.

831
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,800
It's a privilege to know you.

832
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,700
The privilege was all mine, Miss.

833
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,100
Mom doesn't want to live here.

834
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,100
I don't need to sell it.
You can move in for now.

835
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,200
IF THIS BE A MAN

836
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,700
HISTORIA AND UTOPIA

837
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,500
I love you.
