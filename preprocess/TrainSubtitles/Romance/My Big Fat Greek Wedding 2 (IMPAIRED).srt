Toula, do something!

491

I'll talk to her.
Everybody, out.

Hi, <i>Theia.</i>

495
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:41,032
A little present from me.
I just did your living room.

496
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,660
Ah. Thank you.
How's my mom?

497
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:48,873
Oh, your mom isn't talking to your
dad until he proposes, and your dad

498
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,502
says she's always been bossy
and he won't do it.

499

This is for you.

500

Oh, thank you.
I have tweezers.

501
00:25:57,632 --> 00:25:59,050
Oh, with a light.

502
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:02,762
All right, I'll talk to my mom
and dad after I make dinner.

503
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:04,055
(CHUCKLES) No offense.

504
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:09,144
You and your husband
look terrible.

505
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:10,854
Okay.

506
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,773
Stop trying to
fix everything.

507
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:19,195
You baby your parents because you
can't parent your baby no more.

508
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:22,574
Your generation,
you're super mommy.

509
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,910
Then one day you wake up,
you realize your baby don't need you.

510
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:27,871
You forgot how to
brush your hair.

511
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:29,497
I don't have time
to brush my hair.

512
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:32,417
Text your husband.
You're going on a date.

513
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Where?

514
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:36,963
I don't know.
Do I have to do everything?

515
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:43,303
And afterward, this will
help you sleep better. Hmm.

my hair, I need wrinkle cream...

Okay. Good talk.

Take your husband on a date.
Don't worry about anything.

534

Mana-Yiayia and I will stay with Paris.
I'll talk to her.

535
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:29,974
I'll scare her out of moving
away from her family.

One rule. Don't fight.

541
00:27:41,486 --> 00:27:44,197
Which means don't talk
about your daughter.

542
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:50,036
Remember, you were a girlfriend
before you were a mother.

You really think Paris is
gonna go away to college?

573
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:35,975
You know, Aunt Voula said that
we shouldn't talk about Paris.

I mean, I have to.

581
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,455
Me, too. How do we stop
her from moving away?

582
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,780
I was thinking that we could
act like it's okay with us.

write a letter.

we hope you accept our daughter"

got outta jail."

It's gonna be okay.

This is why Aunt Voula said,
"Don't talk about Paris."

what else do you want to talk about?

So, Persian?

681

In 334 BC,

Alexander the Great conquered the
Persian army and occupied the East.

You so Greek,
we probably related.

We had civilizations
in Persia 3,000 years

discovered rocks.

The Greeks gave the world
philosophy, democracy.

The Chinese gave the world
paper, tea and medicine.

the world wouldn't have penicillin.
