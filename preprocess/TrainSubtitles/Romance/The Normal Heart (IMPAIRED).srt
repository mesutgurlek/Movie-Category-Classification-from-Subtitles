How you doing?

14

We're doing great.

Hairy is out. Your turn, teddy bear.

18

Oh, no, I love my teddy.

<i>- Cold beer?
- No, I've already had a couple.</i>

- What? What?

32

Brucey, please, don't embarrass

Uh-oh. Gotta do it.

That's my guy.

Craig was miserable when
you weren't interested.

39
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,382
Now look. He's got Robert Redford.

40
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,551
Shows you there is a God.

41
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,087
- How's John?
- John?

42
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,456
- John.
- John? Oh, John.

43
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,725
No, I'm with Gregory now.

44
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,827
We're celebrating our
15-month anniversary.

45
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,363
15? That's a long time for you, Mickey.

46
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:04,032
Oh, please, we're lovers
and we live together.

47
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,933
It's not like we're
faithful to each other, too.

He's not even Jewish. Don't tell my rabbi.

You made us look terrible in your novel.

55

Look around you. Sex is liberating.

56

<i>All I said was having so much
sex makes finding love impossible.</i>

57

Somebody I was friends

<i>- (Faint whirring)

Uh, Ned Weeks. I spoke to
you after the "Times" article.

110
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,305
Come in. Take your clothes off.

111
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,607
I only came to ask some questions.

112
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:27,812
You are gay, aren't you?

113
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,848
Yes.

114
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,483
Take your clothes off. Don't be nervous.

115
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:34,285
I've seen more men than you have.

116
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:40,424
<i>Doctor: To answer all of
your questions, I don't know.</i>

117
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:44,028
<i>I've never seen or heard
of anything like this.</i>

118
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,730
Have you had any of the symptoms?

119
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,898
Most of the shit the "Times" said...

120
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,001
amoebas, gonorrhea, hepatitis.

121
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,603
You don't know what it's been
like since the sexual revolution.

122
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,372
What makes you think I don't?

123
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,708
Any fever, night sweats, weight loss?

124
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,177
Don't I wish. No.

125
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:02,913
And purple lesions? Open your mouth.

126
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:06,449
It's a cancer.

127
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,785
There's a strange reaction
in the immune system.

128
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:11,454
It's collapsed. Won't fight.

129
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:13,590
So the diseases most of my
patients are coming down with

130
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:16,326
are brought on by germs
that wouldn't hurt a baby.

131
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:19,295
Tick wlish.

132
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,273
At least not a baby in
New York City anyway.

133
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:24,367
The immune system is the
system we know the least about.

134
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,806
So where's this big
mouth I hear you've got?

135
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:33,076
- Is big mouth a symptom?
- No.

136
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,911
It's a cure.

137
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:37,146
This seems to only be happening to gay men.

138
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:40,349
Buzzy says you are well-known
in the gay community

139
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,752
<i>and not afraid to say what you think.</i>

140
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:45,087
I can't find any gay leaders

141
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,824
and I call gay organizations,
no one ever calls me back.

142
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:52,428
Dr. Brookner, no one with half a
brain gets involved with gay politics.

143
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:54,763
- There's no room for criticism.
- What's your criticism?

144
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,231
I hate that we play victim

145
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,999
when many of us, most of us, don't have to.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,834
Then you're exactly what's needed now.

147
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,937
Maybe they're just waiting
for someone to lead them.

148
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:03,539
I don't want to lead them.

149
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,108
What exactly are you
trying to get me to do?

150
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:08,243
Tell gay men to stop having sex.

151
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:13,014
Do you think that this cancer
is sexually transmitted?

152
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,816
I think it is, yes.

153
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,251
Can I prity it yet? No.

154
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:21,623
Do you realize that you're talking about

155
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:23,291
millions of men

156
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,226
who have singled out promiscuity

157
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:27,495
as their principal political agenda?

158
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,798
<i>- How do you deal with that?
- Tell them they may die.</i>

159
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,102
- Where?
- Down the hall. Down the hall!

160
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:37,037
It's not that simple. It's
more complicated than that.

161
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:38,839
They think sex is all they have.

162

Mr. Weeks, if having sex can kill you,

doesn't anyone with half
a brain stop fucking?

Yes, ma'am. How do you know that?

Unfortunately, we can't

Long before we isolated
the hepatitis viruses,

205
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,779
we knew about the diseases they caused

Where are the medical
journals? The "Times"?

208
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:43,752
I sent my first reports to the

No, it isn't. It's the

Sorry to hear that. What

267
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,878
I've talked to half a dozen reporters

No one here will write

You wouldn't want science to

And I had never told her I was gay.

305

I think somehow mothers always know.

Scared the shit out of me even

You can have a house anytime you want.

00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:27,376
- No fun living in it alone.
- This Bruce...

320
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,679
is he someone you're seeing?

321
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,947
I see him, he doesn't see me.

322
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,251
Ben...

323
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:38,220
could your law firm take this on for free?

324
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:40,289
What's it called? Pro bono?

325
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,924
We started an organization, I
told you there's this new disease.

326
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,960
Now this sounds like just another
excuse to keep from writing.

327
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,729
Why can't you just say "yes"?

328
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,764
I told you, because we have a committee

329
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,466
that decides that kind of thing.

330
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,634
But you're the senior partner

331
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,769
and I'm your brother.

332
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,173
Hey, Mario. How's Homer?

333
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,579
If you're not gonna help, I'm
gonna have to find somebody else.

334
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,881
- Well, you're more than free to do that.
- I don't want to do that.

335
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,383
I want my big brother's fancy, famous,

336
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,018
big-time, major law firm

337
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,886
to be the first straight New York law firm

338
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,522
to do pro bono work for a gay cause.

339
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,824
I'd be real proud of that and

340
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,728
I'll ask my partners'
approval at the next meeting.

341
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,498
I'll lobby them. You don't
sound like a very sure vote.

342
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,208
Okay.

343
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,148
You're getting better at it.

344
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:46,486
<i>Dr. Brookner: I'm seeing three
to four new patients a week.</i>

345
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:50,357
<i>I've got seven in ICU. The whole
hospital only has room for 30.</i>

346
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:51,858
I've had to admit some of them under

347
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,593
other illnesses. That's a no-no.

348
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,129
I've got 20 in private
rooms they can't afford.

349
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,898
<i>Okay, what about the guys who
don't have health insurance...</i>

350
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,333
- artists, actors?
- I've got eight of them in another ward

351
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,902
where I shouldn't put them.

352
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,114
Why don't you wear gloves and a face mask?

353
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:17,883
Never have and I never will.

354
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:20,719
And I'm still here.

355
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,054
Why is all the food sitting
outside their rooms like this?

356
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,790
- It's getting cold.
- It's always cold

357
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,926
because the appropriate staff
won't bring it into the rooms,

358
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:31,029
so it sits and rots
until one of my staff can.

359
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:35,133
<i>Sanford: Right there. Yeah, by the water.</i>

360
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:36,634
<i>Yeah, right through the tunnel.</i>

361
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:39,237
Take the tunnel. We'll take the book back.

362
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,440
I know him. Can I go inside with you?

363
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,578
Only if you wear all the protective shit.

364
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,681
If you don't, I don't.

365
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,187
<i>Sanford: Over there. Go the other way.</i>

366
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,122
<i>No, are you listening to me?</i>

367
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,857
<i>Are you listening to me? Go back.</i>

368
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:02,460
<i>- Hi, Sanford.
- You see that? Take the tunnel.</i>

369
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:04,261
Go ahead, drive straight through.

370
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:05,663
How we doing, soldier?

371
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:08,398
I want my dog. Can you
please bring me my dog?

372
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:10,901
<i>He won't be able to live without me.</i>

373
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:13,938
I want my dog. I want my dog.

374
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,706
<i>Go ahead. That's right.</i>

375
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,575
<i>Oh, good. Good. No. Take the book back.</i>

376
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,444
<i>Right there. Pull hard.</i>

377
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:22,146
<i>Right there.</i>

378
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,147
<i>Can you please bring me my dog?</i>

379
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:25,849
<i>He won't know how to live without me.</i>

380
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,951
(TV buzzing)

381
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:33,056
Don't bother.

382
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:36,460
Who's going to bring me my dog?

383
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:39,829
<i>His name is Skip. He'll
come when you call him.</i>

384
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,131
Please. (Gasping)

385
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,802
I miss him.

386
00:23:46,803 --> 00:23:49,572
(Sobbing)

387
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,278
<i>I miss him.</i>

388
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,348
Can you imagine this at 19?

389
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:02,885
Your first boyfriend you were
gonna spend your whole life with.

390
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:07,523
(Door opens)

391
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,660
<i>- Excuse me.
- Man: Yeah.</i>

392
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:13,795
You're the TV guy?

393
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,830
Please go to room 407 and fix it.

394
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,566
- No I'm not gonna do that.
- Fix the TV. It's your fucking job.

395
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:21,536
My union says I don't gotta risk my life

396
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,505
for some contagious fairy.

397
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:26,375
If I have to go in there,
then I fucking quit.

398
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:38,486
<i>So what exactly has your side been doing?</i>

399

<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

402

<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

403
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,879
- Hi.
- Hey.

404
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,148
Thanks.

405
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,783
Want some of this? A beer?

406
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:11,885
Oh, beer's fine. Thanks.

407
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,389
Oh, hey, pooch.

408
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,226
- Her name's Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

409
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,528
You know, I really used to like high-tech,

410
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,630
but I'm tired of it now.

411
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:27,267
I think I want chintz back again.

412
00:25:27,268 --> 00:25:29,235
Don't be insulted.

413
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,903
I'm not.

414
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,774
I want chintz back again, too.

415
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:37,944
So, here we are.

416
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:39,445
Two fellows who want chintz back again.

417
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:41,581
I guess this really is a date.

418
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,653
I'm starving.

419
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,489
- You glad I'm here?
- Oh...

420
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,123
I'm pleased as punch you're here.

421
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:53,459
You're very good-looking.
What are you doing here?

422
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,893
You think you're bad-looking or something?

423
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:57,196
(Groans) Where you from?

424
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:59,831
I'm from Oklahoma.

425
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:02,801
I left home at 18, put myself through...

426
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,237
what, you wanna dance?

427
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:08,306
Put myself through college.

428
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:11,409
<i>My dad worked at the refinery in West Tulsa</i>

429
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,411
and my mom was a waitress.

430
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:15,213
Had a luncheonette in Walgreens.

431
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,752
It's amazing, isn't it? How
a kid comes out of all that

432
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:22,521
and wind up on the "Times,"

433
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:24,955
dictating taste and
style to the entire world.

434
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,791
And we were just starting
to talk so nicely.

435
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,193
Talking's not my problem.

436
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,262
- Shutting up's my problem.
- (Chuckling)

437
00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:33,398
Why do you write all that
fancy ball gown bullshit?

438
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:36,200
I bet you gobble it up every day.

439
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:40,604
I know 10 people who have died.

440
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:43,273
When I came to you, it was only one.

441
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,577
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:48,679
Is that why you agreed to this date?

443
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:58,855
Fork on the left.

444
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,524
Knife on the right.

445
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:04,861
Did you know that Hitler's Final Solution

446
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,963
to eliminate the Polish Jews

447
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:09,299
was first mentioned in the
"Times"? It was on page 28.

448
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,301
On page 6 of the "Washington Post."

449
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:14,037
They are both owned by
Jews. Their very own people.

450
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,073
Scholars are finally writing honestly
about it and it's damning to everyone.

451
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:20,810
Where is the Christian churches?
The Pope? Churchill? Roosevelt?

452
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,812
A few words from any of them
would have put Hitler on notice.

453
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:26,515
Dachau was open in 1933.
Where the fuck was everybody?

454
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:31,887
This is turning out to be
a very romantic evening.

455
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:33,389
You've never had a lover, have you?

456
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,657
I suppose you've had quite a few.

457
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:37,259
I had a very good one.

458
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,896
For a number of years, thank you.

459
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:44,933
He was older than I was and
he found someone younger.

460
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:49,004
- You looking for a father?
- No, I'm not looking for a father. God.

461
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:50,839
<i>You're relentless.</i>

462
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:01,316
Okay.

463
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:02,985
That's yours.

464
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:05,520
Everybody had a million reasons
for not getting involved.

465
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:08,490
The American Jews knew
exactly what was going on.

466
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:11,926
Could you imagine if every Jew had
marched on Washington proudly, huh?

467
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,228
Ned.

468
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:18,266
You don't remember me, do you?

469

You would've thought I

481
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,142
the way you looked at me.

482
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:05,145

00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,319

(Grunts)

488
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,210
I asked what you did and
you said something like

489
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,580
you "tried a number of things" and...

490
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:43,682
I asked if that had included love.

491
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:49,687
That's when you said, "I have
to get up early in the morning."

492
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:50,955
Yeah.

493

00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,271
I think you're a bluffer.

496
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,007
How could I not remember you?

497
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:12,909
(Chuckles) I don't know.

498
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,811
It was very dark.

499
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,483
Do you think we could start over?

500
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,121
Yeah.

501
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,223
(Grunting)

502
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:32,328

505
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,842
When I was going to Yale, I thought
I was the only gay guy there.

506
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:23,111
Swear to God.

507
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:26,414
<i>Went to the shrink who tried to change me.</i>

508
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:28,449
Now they have "Gay Weeks" there

509
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,551
and they throw the best dances of anyone.

510
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:34,522
Imagine being able to dance cheek to cheek

511
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:37,959
with your boyfriend during
your bright college days.

512
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:45,766
Did you ever sleep with a woman?

513
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:52,039
What?

514
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,343
Her name was... Delilah.

515
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:57,712
Delilah?

516
00:31:57,713 --> 00:31:59,346
She was...

517
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,249
a stand-in on this movie I wrote.

518
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,986
She was very nice and pretty.

519
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:09,022
Always smiling at me.

520
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:12,792
So I... I asked a straight
friend to explain it to me.

521
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:16,730
I thought I knew, but I
just wanted to make sure.

522
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:19,499
And I had her to dinner and...

523
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,702
afterwards, what I deemed
to be a suitable moment

524
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:25,004
because I had been communicating
with it down there...

525
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:28,040
"Are you ready? Are you
absolutely certain you're ready?"

526
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:31,710
And when it appeared
"Abercrombie" was ready.

527
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:34,180
I picked her up, very Rhett Butler,

528
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:36,015
and carried her to my bed.

529
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,918
- Where I couldn't get it up.
- Oh!

530
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,953
- But...
- I can certainly relate to that.

531
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:42,621
In the middle of the
night, I woke up with this

532
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:46,825
gigantic erection, God... God knows how.

533
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:50,796
So I shake her, shouting, "Please
stick it in for me, Delilah."

534
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:54,032
I was afraid of it going
away before I could...

535
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:58,470
while I was hunting for
the right place to put it.

536
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:02,073
She did and I did, and Abercrombie did.

537
00:33:02,074 --> 00:33:05,576
- (laughing)
- Ugh...

538
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:10,115
The next morning I woke up

539
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:13,618
<i>and I, who had been under
the spell of this shrink</i>

540
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,820
who was determined to change me,

541
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:17,688
rushed into his office.

542
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:20,091
<i>And I, who had been fucking with fellows</i>

543
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:21,826
since the 7th grade,

544
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:25,129
hysterically, at the age of 32 proclaimed,

545
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,465
"Dr. Gillespie, I'm no longer a virgin!"

546
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:30,835
Oh, aw.

547
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:45,316
Henry: He's in here. I
think we'll catch him.

548
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,483
All right.

549
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,419
So, I just go over and say hello?

550
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,288
I told him I invited you
and we went to Yale together.

551
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:54,624
It's my farewell party. What's he gonna do?

552
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,392
Let's go.

553
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:57,694
Ahem.

554
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:59,996
His Honor would like you to get lost.

555
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,866
- This is my friend, Ned Weeks.
- Yeah, we know who he is.

556
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:06,102
Mr. Mayor! We need your help!

557
00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:08,572
There's this new disease.
You must have heard about it.

558
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,374
We need your help badly!
Get off me, you pigs!

559
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,875
This is America!

560
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,144
Mr. Mayor! We're dying!

561
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:17,913
(Papers rustling)

562
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:22,452
Okay, this is what Ned
wrote for us to send out.

563
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:25,588
"I am sick of guys moaning
that giving up careless sex..."

564
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:27,422
Ned: "...until this blows
over is worse than death.

565

<i>I am sick of guys that can
only think with their cocks.</i>

567
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,399
<i>when are you gonna come out?
By 1983 you could be dead."</i>

569
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:41,036
You're crazy.

570
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,771
Am I, Bruce? Do you really think so?

571
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:45,407
Aren't we supposed to
elect a president tonight?

572
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:47,775
We can't tell people how
to live their lives, Ned.

573
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:50,512
The entire gay political
movement is fucking.

574
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:52,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

575
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:54,916
You know, I'm very interested in starting
up some sort of services for the patients.

576
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,718
We've gotta start talking about them.

577
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,421
Also, there are a lot of
very scared people out there

578
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:00,855
and they're desperate for information.

579
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:03,090
I'd like to start a hotline.

580
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:04,258
Who's he?

581
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:06,227
Ooh, he does not know who I am yet.

582
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:08,696
His name is Tommy Boatwright.

583
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:11,432
<i>In real life, he is a
hospital administrator.</i>

584
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:14,101
Uh... he's here to help
and he's a Southern bitch.

585
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:16,237
- (laughter)
- Mr. Boatwright, Bruce Niles.

586
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:17,771
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

587

<i>Tommy: You're very handsome.</i>

588

00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,847
Was this your idea, Ned?

592
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,482
I'm looking. What am I not seeing?

593
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:31,318
- Keep looking.
- What we put for our return address.

594

<i>Do you mean because the word
"gay" is on the envelope?</i>

Fucking A, yes. Instead
of just our initials.

596
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:38,759
- We can't send these out.
- Excuse me.

597
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,561
If we want anybody to
show up for this dance,

598
00:35:40,562 --> 00:35:42,195
we have to get these out tonight.

599
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:44,264
We need to go through and scratch out
the word "gay" with a Magic Marker.

- Okay, ladies, behave.

bit more comfortable following him.

Well, I'm glad you asked me that question.

822
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,632
What do I think? I know that the government

823
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:37,236
is intentionally ignoring this epidemic.

824
00:49:37,237 --> 00:49:40,339
You're accusing the
government of the United States

825
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,609
of a conspiracy to murder all gay men?

826
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:51,350
Yes. Yes, you can say that.

827
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:53,385
Yes, Sarabeth, I am. Yes.

828
00:49:53,386 --> 00:49:56,088
That is a powerful accusation.

829
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:58,790
This is an epidemic and it's being ignored

830
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,292
by the United States government.

831
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:02,294
- Intentionally?
- Intentionally being ignored.

832
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:04,295
This is a national emergency.

833
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,130
This is an epidemic. It's a plague.

834
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:09,166
You can't go on national TV and
accuse the government of murder, Ned.

835
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:11,969
- Why not?
- Because one day we're gonna get money,

836
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,389
research grants.

837
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,306
Congress still hasn't appropriated a dime.

838
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:16,941
The mayor's still... on and on!

839
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:20,211
Ned, when you go public, you have no
right to speak for this organization

840
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:24,382
unless we have approved what
you have to say in advance.

841
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,984
You know, in point of fact, you aren't
even an officer of this organization

842
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,186
<i>and you shouldn't be
speaking for us at all.</i>

00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:50,507
to acknowledge and deal
with this emergency?

847
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:52,643
Well, you're implying that
the city has recognized

848
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:55,145
and acknowledged this
emergency, Malcolm. It has not.

849
00:50:55,146 --> 00:50:57,047
Why not, do you think?

850
00:50:57,048 --> 00:50:59,282
Because the mayor's gay
and he's scared shitless

851
00:50:59,283 --> 00:51:00,984
out of his panties it'll blow his cover.

Bullshit. They all know you're one of us.

857
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,960
It is totally and politically incorrect

858
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:13,429
to call someone gay who does
not self-identify as being gay.

859
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,064
I know it's been that way forever,

860
00:51:15,065 --> 00:51:17,433
but something different is
going on here now. We're dying.

861
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:19,234
The mayor, he's a personal friend of yours.

862
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:21,070
You want him to appoint you a judge.

863
00:51:21,071 --> 00:51:23,272
Do you have a little conflict
of interest going on here?

864
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:24,907
- I told you I sent him a memo.
- When?

865
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:26,408
- Through channels.
- When?

866
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:28,277
- He'll answer me.
- When?!

<i>There's 110 new cases this month!</i>

Still no meeting with our gay mayor.

869
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:35,284
No meeting with his gay assistant.

Yes. You do.

You get more with honey
than with vinegar, babe.

873

God, no one's told me that one, Tommy.

874
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:48,229
No, obviously, they haven't.

875
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,965
I never believed that bullshit, anyway.

876

We are in over our heads with
the patients we're trying to help.

Tommy, will you please read
this report out loud for Ned?

878
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:59,073
<i>Tommy: We have trained 25 crisis counselors</i>

whatever needs that they might have.

880
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,546
We have 12 group leaders who
meet with these counselors

881

at least once a week to
go over their clients.

75, Bruce!

886
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,125
You used to be a fighter once.

- Did you like being in the Green Berets?
- Yes. I loved it.

888
00:52:21,062 --> 00:52:23,096
Have you completely forgotten how to fight?

889
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:25,699
Don't tell me how to fight. I
just fight differently than you.

You have no right being on this board

<i>unless you put pressure

00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,618
That's why I asked you to join us

(Panting)

899
00:52:57,598 --> 00:52:59,699
- Ben: No, no, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

900
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,434
No, you got your free
legal work from my firm.

901

I'm not gonna be on
your board of directors.

902
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:05,571
It's only for the stationery.
You don't have to do a thing.

903
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:08,641
That is just an evasion. If you
thought this was a straight disease...

904
00:53:08,642 --> 00:53:09,919
It's got nothing to do with you being gay.

905
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,379
What else does it have to do with?

906
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:13,379
One of these days, I'm
gonna get you to agree

907
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,581
that over 20 million men
and women in this country

908
00:53:15,582 --> 00:53:18,384
don't require the
services of a psychiatrist.

909
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:19,685
Look, try to understand.

910
00:53:19,686 --> 00:53:21,887
You know, I read stuff, I see TV.

911
00:53:21,888 --> 00:53:23,889
Guys in leather and chains.

912
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,657
Dresses, high heels.

913
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:27,492
I say to myself, "This isn't Ned."

914
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:30,295
You know the media always
dramatizes the most extreme.

915
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:32,497
You guys have a dreadful image problem.

916
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:33,999
That's why it's so important

917
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,433
to have people like you supporting us.

918
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:37,135
You already have your dignity.

919
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:39,737
Ben: We better get to lunch.
I've got an important meeting.

920
00:53:39,738 --> 00:53:41,939
Do you? How important?

921
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,575
I'm asking for your support.

922
00:53:43,576 --> 00:53:46,177
In every area I consider
important, you have my support.

923
00:53:46,178 --> 00:53:49,147
<i>The only area that I consider important</i>

924
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:52,083
I don't have your support at all.

925
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:54,152
In some place deep down inside you,

926
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:55,419
you still think I'm sick, don't you?

927
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,187
I think you've adjusted
to life pretty well.

928
00:53:57,188 --> 00:54:00,591
- All things considered.
- I saw how unhappy you were.

929
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:02,192
So were you!

930
00:54:02,193 --> 00:54:05,930
You wound up going to shrinks,
too. We grew up side by side.

931
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,699
We both felt the same about Mom and Pop.

932
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,069
I'll agree to the fact that I have
any number of awful character traits,

933
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,906
<i>but not to the fact that whatever
awful things they did to us</i>

934
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:20,744
made me sick and gay while you
stayed straight and healthy.

935
00:54:20,745 --> 00:54:22,846
We don't all react the
same way to the thing.

936
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:25,215
So you became a lawyer
and I became a writer.

937
00:54:25,216 --> 00:54:27,417
Well, we have a difference
of opinion over theory.

938
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:30,120
But your theory turns
me into a man from Mars.

939
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:32,588
My theory doesn't do that to you.

940
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:34,924
Are you suggesting I did something wrong

941
00:54:34,925 --> 00:54:37,226
in sending you into therapy so young?

942
00:54:37,227 --> 00:54:38,762
I didn't know you were
gonna stay there forever.

943
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:40,463
I didn't think that I'd
had done anything wrong

944
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,431
until you sent me there.

945
00:54:42,432 --> 00:54:46,269
Ben... you mean more to me
than anyone in the whole world.

946
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,772

- Say what?

947
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:52,741
I'm the same as you. Just say it. Say it!

948

No.

949

You have my love, my legal
advice, my financial supervision.

957

I can't give you the
courage to stand up to me

958
00:55:28,077 --> 00:55:30,912
and say you don't give a
flying fuck about what I think.

959
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:32,681
Everybody's oppressed by somebody else

960

961

without the help of others.

963
00:55:40,555 --> 00:55:44,325
And stop trying to wring some kind
of admission of guilt out of me.

964
00:55:44,326 --> 00:55:47,028
Agreeing that you were born
just the same as I was born

<i>That is exactly what is going
to save my dying friends.</i>

971
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,278
it was sick to love a man.

972
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:06,380
I am trying to understand

973
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:09,750
<i>why nobody gives a shit that we're dying!</i>

974
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:15,856
$5 million for a house? We can't
even get 27 cents from the city.

975
00:56:15,857 --> 00:56:20,393
<i>I know 43 guys who have died and
you say it's my cause not yours?</i>

976
00:56:20,394 --> 00:56:23,130
<i>You still think I'm sick!</i>

977
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:27,300
I simply cannot allow it
for one single second longer.

978
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:32,572
<i>I will not speak to you again
until you accept me as your equal!</i>

979
00:56:32,573 --> 00:56:34,374
Your healthy equal!

980
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,476
Your brother!

Yeah, be careful with that, boys.

983

- That is a precious antique.
- Easy.

984
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:50,355
I'm thinking we should put
that in the grand salon.

985
00:56:50,356 --> 00:56:52,191
Do we have a basement?
That's where it should go.

986
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:54,827
Bella, I think it's time we moved
your filthy mouth above ground.

987
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,928
I'll decorate tomorrow.

988

- Hi.

993

My name is Estelle

994
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:14,112
and my best friend Harvey died last night.

995
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,718
We went everywhere together, you know?

996
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:23,587
Like Broadway and the Rockettes

997
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:25,123
and ice skating.

998
00:57:27,126 --> 00:57:30,127
He was a beautiful skater.

999
00:57:30,128 --> 00:57:31,962
I'm a klutz.

1000
00:57:31,963 --> 00:57:35,633
But he didn't care.

1001
00:57:35,634 --> 00:57:38,703
We had so much fun.

1002
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:41,372
Damn it, I wanna do something!

1003
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:42,973
Even though all my lesbian friends say,

1004
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:44,775
"What have you guys ever done for us?"

1005

But I don't care.

1006

You think you can do that?

01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:18,264
<i>It turns out he's gay and he won't...</i>

1101
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,566
don't yell at me.

1102
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:25,871
All those shrinks, they must
have done something right.

1103
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:28,541
Dr. Ritvo,

1104

Dr. Maxene, Dr. LaVerne.

1108
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:41,053
Why does that have to take so long?

1109
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:43,354
All you ever eat is desserts.

1110
01:03:43,355 --> 01:03:44,923
Sugar's the most important thing in life.

1111
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:47,458
All the rest is just to stay alive.

1112
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,128
Mm.

1113
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:56,734

(Scoffs) Shit.

1115
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,037
- Felix: What?
- The fucking board.

1116
01:04:00,038 --> 01:04:03,107
They say I'm causing a panic,
that I'm making myself a celebrity.

1117
01:04:03,108 --> 01:04:05,310
Not one of them will be
interviewed or appear on TV,

1118
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:07,745

1119
01:04:07,746 --> 01:04:10,081

1126

It's sad how much time we lost.

1127
01:04:27,132 --> 01:04:29,600
We just weren't ready then.

1129
01:04:36,574 --> 01:04:39,243
If I had it...

1130
01:04:39,244 --> 01:04:41,612
would you leave me?

1131
01:04:43,724 --> 01:04:45,358
I don't know.

1132
01:04:47,961 --> 01:04:50,296
Would you if I did?

1133
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:52,731
No.

1134
01:04:52,732 --> 01:04:54,332
How do you know?

1135
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:57,169
Because my mother ran the
local chapter of the Red Cross.

1136
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:00,305
She put me to work in the
Bloodmobile when I was eight.

1137
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,176
I'm not programmed for anything else.

1138
01:05:06,246 --> 01:05:09,781
Ned, I have something to tell you.

1139
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:12,250
- You're finally pregnant.
- (Chuckling)

1140
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:17,989
I was married once.

1141
01:05:21,727 --> 01:05:22,794
You never told me that.

1142
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:25,096
Yeah, I...

1143
01:05:25,097 --> 01:05:26,898
she said I had been unfair to her,

1144
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:29,733
which I had been.

1145
01:05:32,004 --> 01:05:34,972
- I have a son.
- You have a son.

1146
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:38,642
- She won't let me see him.
- You can't see your own son?

1147
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,245
But didn't you fight?

1148
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:42,913
That means you're ashamed.

1149
01:05:42,914 --> 01:05:45,182
So he will be, too.

1150
01:05:45,183 --> 01:05:47,484
This is why I didn't tell
you. Who says I didn't fight?

1151
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,386
<i>Ned?</i>

1152
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:52,356
What happens to people who can't
be as strong as you want them to be?

1153
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:54,692
Weakness scares the shit out of me!

1154
01:05:54,693 --> 01:05:57,861
My father was weak, and
I'm afraid I'll be like him.

1155
01:05:57,862 --> 01:06:00,831
His life didn't stand for
anything and then it was over.

1156
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,866
So I fight, constantly.

1157
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:04,567
And if I can do it, I can't understand

1158
01:06:04,568 --> 01:06:07,337
why everybody else can't do it, too, okay?

1159
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,671
Wait, where are you going?

1160
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:10,807

Not be with anybody ever?

01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:36,624
I was five years old.

1182
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:38,425
A woman from the Bahamas came to our town

1183
01:07:38,426 --> 01:07:39,592
carrying the polio virus.

1184
01:07:39,593 --> 01:07:43,030
She... stayed with friends.

1185
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:45,532
Their kid was in my kindergarten class.

1186
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:48,335
Four of us in that class got polio.

1187
01:07:50,538 --> 01:07:53,440
I was all dressed up
in my Halloween costume

1188

to go
trick-or-treating

01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:58,144
and my mother felt my
forehead, put me to bed.

1190
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:02,549
In the middle of the night,
I realized my whole body

1191
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:05,284
except my arms and my hands were paralyzed.

1192
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:07,320
I was crying out for my mother.

1193
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:10,022
"I can't move, I can't move."

1194
01:08:10,023 --> 01:08:13,725
They rushed me to the hospital,

1195
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:15,794
were told I'd be dead in 24 hours.

1196
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:17,430
I fought. I lived.

1197

Then I was in bed at home.

1200
01:08:26,006 --> 01:08:29,074
I was connected to my

and then not know what to say next.

1205
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,223

01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,475
Ned, your organization is... worthless.

1213
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:06,811
I can't get anyone important on the board.

1214

Nothing is 100% certain in science.

Don't yell at me for what I'm not doing.

Where's your A.M.A.?

1226

Does being Jewish always make you hungry?

1227
01:09:39,944 --> 01:09:42,278
I don't know. I'm not Jewish.

I'm German.

1229

I don't walk so good anymore.

1235

The mayor wants you to
know how much he cares

and how impressed he is with
how you've been shouldering

<i>- Thank you.
- Ned: Thank you?</i>

Responsibilities? Everything we're doing

is the stuff you guys should
be doing and we need help.

Uh, what Mr. Weeks is trying to say, sir,

01:14:05,868 --> 01:14:07,568
is that... we're swamped.

1305
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:11,506
We're fielding over 500 calls
a day on our emergency hotline.

1306
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:13,708
And we're providing
information that, quite frankly,

1307
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:15,843
<i>the city should be providing, and isn't.</i>

1308
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:17,978
Sir, we need office space.
We have one small room.

1309
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:20,548
We have over 100 people calling
or walking in and out every day,

1310
01:14:20,549 --> 01:14:22,717
and plus it's real hard when
people don't want to rent to us

1311
01:14:22,718 --> 01:14:24,686
because we're...
- Whoa. That's illegal discrimination.

1312
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:26,187
Yeah, we know that to be true, sir.

1313
01:14:26,188 --> 01:14:28,889
Mr. Keebler, it is not illegal to
discriminate against homosexuals.

1314
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,325
We've been waiting for 14
months to see the mayor.

1315
01:14:31,326 --> 01:14:33,493
It's taken us a year to
get this meeting with you.

1316
01:14:33,494 --> 01:14:34,600
You're an hour and a half late.

1317
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,955
Have you told the mayor
there's an epidemic going on?

1318
01:14:36,956 --> 01:14:38,199
- Uh, says who?
- The government.

1319
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,967
<i>Which government? What? Our government?</i>

1320
01:14:39,968 --> 01:14:42,303
An epidemic?
- The Centers for Disease Control declared it...

1321
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:44,338
<i>- 17 months ago.
- You can't not know this!</i>

1322
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:46,307
Could you please reduce
your level of hysteria?

1323
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:47,774
Certainly.

1324
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:52,145
New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles,

1325
01:14:52,146 --> 01:14:56,082
Chicago, Boston, Denver. Every
single major American city

1326
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:57,617
is now showing cases.

1327
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,420
At least 25 foreign
countries. But New York City,

1328
01:15:00,421 --> 01:15:02,922
our home, the city that
you have pledged to protect

1329
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:04,423
has more than half of everything.

1330
01:15:04,424 --> 01:15:06,226
Half the cases, half the dead.

1331
01:15:06,227 --> 01:15:08,995
I know 57 of the dead ones.
I don't wanna know any more.

1332
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:10,964
Now, when do we get to see the mayor?

1333
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:13,066
14 months is a long
time to be out to lunch.

1334
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:16,202
<i>- You wait a minute.
- No, you wait a minute. We can't.</i>

1335
01:15:16,203 --> 01:15:18,104
Time is not on our side.

1336
01:15:18,105 --> 01:15:20,205
Now, if you won't take word to
the mayor, what are we gonna do?

1337
01:15:20,206 --> 01:15:22,775
Hire a hunky hustler and
send him up to Gracie Mansion

1338
01:15:22,776 --> 01:15:24,643
with a plea tattooed to his cock?

1339
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:28,313
- Mayor Koch is not gay!
- Tommy: Oh, come on, "Blanche."

1340
01:15:29,783 --> 01:15:31,484
(Chuckles)

1341
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,118
Listen.

1342
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:35,921
Don't you think I want to help you?

1343
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:38,490
I have a friend who is dying of this shit,

1344
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:40,926
right now in the V.A. hospital.

1345
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,763
But it's very tricky. You can
see that. It is very tricky.

1346
01:15:44,764 --> 01:15:47,132
Tricky, shit! There are a
million gay people in New York.

1347
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:48,934
A million and one counting you!

1348
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:51,503
You know what? A fire goes
out in a school furnace

1349
01:15:51,504 --> 01:15:55,740
on the West Side. I get
3,000 calls in one day.

1350
01:15:55,741 --> 01:15:57,609
You know what I mean?

1351
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:00,912
If so many of you are so upset, why
do I only hear from this loudmouth?

1352
01:16:00,913 --> 01:16:04,482
- That's a very good question.
- Okay, so there are half a million

1353
01:16:04,483 --> 01:16:08,319
gay men in our area. 315
cases doesn't seem too high,

1354
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,721
<i>considering how many of
us... of you there are.</i>

1355
01:16:10,722 --> 01:16:13,090
- This is bullshit!
- Ned, please.

1356
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:14,992
Look, I understand this is tricky, sir.

1357
01:16:14,993 --> 01:16:17,461
- But we need your help...
- I think, that is, that the mayor thinks

1358
01:16:17,462 --> 01:16:19,163
you guys are overreacting.

1359
01:16:19,164 --> 01:16:23,734
You tell that cocksucker he is a
selfish, heartless son of a bitch!

1360
01:16:30,374 --> 01:16:32,342
You are Michael R. Marcus. You hold

1361
01:16:32,343 --> 01:16:34,678
an unsecure job with the
city's Department of Health.

1362
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,013
I'd watch out for your
friends if I were you.

(Slaps)

1364
01:16:49,093 --> 01:16:50,393
I don't believe that just happened.

and I am telling them

1367
01:16:54,598 --> 01:16:57,300
that the mayor just threatened
your job to shut us up.

1368
01:16:57,301 --> 01:16:59,435
"The Today Show"? You're gonna what?

1369
01:16:59,436 --> 01:17:02,472
They are treating us like
shit and we're allowing them.

1370

No, politicians, the only thing
they really respond to is pressure.

big debut at Carnegie Hall or some shit

1408
01:19:13,432 --> 01:19:15,934
so we could all be proud of him.

1409
01:19:18,972 --> 01:19:22,307
But he was so good.

1410
01:19:22,308 --> 01:19:24,743
He had such promise.

1411
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,582
We're losing an entire generation.

dancers, actors.

1416
01:19:45,296 --> 01:19:48,332
All those plays that won't get written now.

1417
01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:54,739
All those dances never to be danced.

1418
01:19:59,077 --> 01:20:02,646
In closing, I'm just gonna say I'm mad.

I'm fuckin' mad.

"Why is no one helping us?"

And here's the truth.

1423

Here's the answer.

1424

I get to City Hall, Hiram
keeps me waiting forever.

01:26:48,173 --> 01:26:51,075
And finally the commissioner
comes out and he says

1522
01:26:51,076 --> 01:26:55,446
that Hiram doesn't want to see me anymore.

1523
01:26:55,447 --> 01:27:01,252
I wanted to scream, "I haven't
slept in two days, you dumb fuck."

1524
01:27:01,253 --> 01:27:04,221
But I didn't. Instead I said,

1525
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:06,257
"Please, sir, then...

1526
01:27:06,258 --> 01:27:10,326
why did he make me come
all the way back from Rio?"

1527
01:27:10,327 --> 01:27:13,997
And he says, "Oh, I'm afraid he
didn't take me into his confidence."

1528
01:27:13,998 --> 01:27:16,099
And he walks off.

What's that, Mick?

1532
01:27:27,945 --> 01:27:30,947
You keep trying to get us to say
things that we don't wanna say

1533
01:27:30,948 --> 01:27:32,549
and I don't think we can afford

1534

before we have enough friends.

Baby, it takes time.

1543
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:02,844

No, we mustn't forget
about fucking and sucking

that just nobody... nobody noticed it.

1561
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:58,431
Maybe it's predisposition
or the theory of the herd...

1562
01:28:58,432 --> 01:29:02,903
only so many of us are going to
get it, then the pool's used up.

1563
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:05,338
What if it's monogamy? Bruce, you and I

1564
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,674
<i>could actually be worse off</i>

1565
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,310
because of constant bombardment
from a single source...

1566
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,212
our lovers.

1567
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:13,813
So maybe the guys who go to the baths,

1568
01:29:13,814 --> 01:29:15,515
maybe they've built up the best immunity.

1569
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,918
I don't know what to tell anybody
anymore and everybody asks me.

1570
01:29:18,919 --> 01:29:20,487
Who's right? I don't know.

1571
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:22,421
Who's wrong? I feel...

1572
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:25,124
I feel so fucking inadequate.

1573
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,260
How can we tell people, "Stop"?

1574
01:29:28,261 --> 01:29:32,131
(Stammers) It's just... I
don't... it might be caused by...

1575
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:33,700
I don't know. I don't know.

1576
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:36,535
That's exactly how I feel.

1577
01:29:36,536 --> 01:29:38,870
And maybe he's right.

1578
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:40,472
And that scares me.

1579
01:29:40,473 --> 01:29:42,841
Neddy, you scare me.

1580
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:45,244
You really think the president...

1581
01:29:45,245 --> 01:29:48,180
that he wants this to happen?
You really think the CIA

1582
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:50,115
has unleashed germ warfare

1583
01:29:50,116 --> 01:29:53,118
to kill off all the queers
that Jerry Falwell doesn't want?

1584
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:56,487
- Mick. Try to hold on.
- To what?

1585
01:29:56,488 --> 01:29:58,389
I used to love my country.

1586
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,391
The "Native" received an
anonymous letter describing

1587
01:30:00,392 --> 01:30:03,795
top-secret Defense Department
experiments at Fort Detrick, Maryland...

1588
01:30:03,796 --> 01:30:07,498
that have produced a virus that
can destroy the immune system.

1589
01:30:07,499 --> 01:30:09,634
<i>Its codename was "Firm Hand."</i>

1590
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:12,637
They started testing it
in 1978 on a group of gays.

1591
01:30:12,638 --> 01:30:13,971
I never used to believe shit like that...

1592
01:30:13,972 --> 01:30:15,940
they're gonna persecute us!

1593
01:30:15,941 --> 01:30:17,775
They're gonna cancel our health insurance,

1594
01:30:17,776 --> 01:30:19,477
they're gonna put us into camps,
they're gonna quarantine us.

1595
01:30:19,478 --> 01:30:21,346
<i>And you think that I'm killing people?</i>

1596
01:30:21,347 --> 01:30:24,982
- That is not what I said.
- It is, you know you said it.

1597
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,753
I've spent 15 years of my life

1598
01:30:28,754 --> 01:30:30,554
fighting for our right to be free

1599
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,522
and to make love wherever, whenever.

1600
01:30:32,523 --> 01:30:34,058
And you're telling me all those years

1601
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:37,061
<i>of what being gay stood for is wrong!</i>

1602
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:40,765
And that I'm a murderer.

1603
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:45,101
We have been so oppressed.
Don't you remember?

1604
01:30:45,102 --> 01:30:49,239
<i>Can't you see how important
it is for us to love openly,</i>

1605
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,342
without hiding, without guilt?

1606
01:30:52,343 --> 01:30:54,711
(Sobbing) Why can't you see that?

1607
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,648
I went to the top of the
Empire State Building.

1608
01:31:01,649 --> 01:31:03,031
Okay, I'm taking you home.

1609
01:31:03,032 --> 01:31:04,754
You can jump off from
there when nobody's looking.

1610
01:31:04,755 --> 01:31:07,056
<i>Tommy: All right, Mickey,
let's go home. Right now.</i>

1611
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:15,364
Ned, I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

1612
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:19,868
All my life I've been hated for being gay,

1613
01:31:19,869 --> 01:31:21,637
for being short...

1614
01:31:21,638 --> 01:31:23,306
Jewish.

1615
01:31:23,307 --> 01:31:24,873
So go ahead, you tell everybody.

1616
01:31:24,874 --> 01:31:27,042
Tell everybody that we
were wrong and I'm sorry.

1617
01:31:27,043 --> 01:31:29,578
Someday, somebody's gonna come along

1618
01:31:29,579 --> 01:31:31,380
and they're gonna stick the knife in you

1619
01:31:31,381 --> 01:31:34,616
and tell you everything you
fought for your whole life is shit!

1620
01:31:34,617 --> 01:31:35,784
Mickey!

1621
01:31:35,785 --> 01:31:38,520
Mickey! Get up!

1622
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:40,189
- Get up. Come here.
- It's okay.

1623
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:42,357
Come on.

1624
01:31:42,358 --> 01:31:45,493
I'm gonna take you home now, okay?

1625
01:31:45,494 --> 01:31:49,564
I don't wanna go home.
Take me to St. Vincent's.

1626
01:31:49,565 --> 01:31:52,834
Okay. That's fine. Come. Let's go.

1627
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:57,839
Look, we're all real tired, you hear me?

1628
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,477
We got ourselves here a
lot of bereavement overload.

1629
01:32:08,884 --> 01:32:11,785
We're the fighters. Aren't we?

1630
01:32:11,786 --> 01:32:14,421
We're the fi...
- You bet, sweetness.

1631
01:32:14,422 --> 01:32:17,225
And you're a hero.?

1632
01:32:17,226 --> 01:32:21,162
You're a hero whether you know that or not.

1633
01:32:21,163 --> 01:32:23,164
You're our first hero.

1634
01:32:23,165 --> 01:32:25,265
Let's go.

1635
01:32:30,705 --> 01:32:32,406
<i>(Door closes)</i>

1636

You wanna be president?

1637
01:32:36,544 --> 01:32:38,912

01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:56,296
Hiram, old buddy. How's it hanging?

1641
01:33:04,605 --> 01:33:06,005
Mm.

1642
01:33:10,577 --> 01:33:13,145
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1643
01:33:13,146 --> 01:33:15,114
The mayor's found a secret little fund

1644
01:33:15,115 --> 01:33:17,482
for giving away money secretly.

1645
01:33:17,483 --> 01:33:19,885
We are not allowed to tell
anyone where we got it,

1646
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:22,988
and if we do, we'll never get any more.

1647
01:33:22,989 --> 01:33:25,690
- How much?
- $9,000.

1648

Ned.

1649
01:33:32,097 --> 01:33:34,165
Albert's dead.

1650

His mother wanted to see him
in Phoenix before he died.

1651
01:33:41,474 --> 01:33:44,743
And this was the last
week, when it was obvious.

1652
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:49,180
So I got permission from Emma

1655
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:05,629

<i>You would have been very proud of me, Ned.</i>

1657

01:38:03,894 --> 01:38:06,462
You want me to get better
and I'm not getting better

1714
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:09,065
and I feel so fucking guilty.

1715
01:38:21,444 --> 01:38:24,613
You have a lunch meeting
with Bill Blass on Friday.

1716
01:38:24,614 --> 01:38:27,950
- Fancy.
- Mm...

1717
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:30,219
I'm call with my regrets.

1718
01:38:32,788 --> 01:38:34,250
What are you doing?

1719
01:38:34,251 --> 01:38:36,274
Making a date with you two months from now.

1720
01:38:36,859 --> 01:38:39,361
I've been invited to
speak at Yale's Gay Week.

1721
01:38:39,362 --> 01:38:42,997
And we're going. Remember how I told
you they have those dances there now?

1722
01:38:42,998 --> 01:38:45,467
You're my date.

1723
01:38:57,213 --> 01:38:59,214
(Sobbing)

1724
01:39:14,796 --> 01:39:17,365
I want you to live so much.

1725
01:39:17,366 --> 01:39:19,933
I'm not supposed to say that.

1726
01:39:22,737 --> 01:39:25,472
(Sighs)

1727
01:39:25,473 --> 01:39:28,575
Oh, please, God. Give us one more year.

1728
01:39:32,247 --> 01:39:34,948
I promise I'll eat my spinach.

1729
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:02,008
<i>Emma: I am taking care</i>

1730
01:40:02,009 --> 01:40:03,976
of more victims of this disease

1731
01:40:03,977 --> 01:40:05,611
<i>than anyone in the world.</i>

1732
01:40:05,612 --> 01:40:07,780
<i>We have more frozen blood samples,</i>

1733
01:40:07,781 --> 01:40:09,915
<i>more data of every kind,</i>

1734
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:12,551
<i>and much more experience.</i>

1735
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:18,624
Dr. Brookner, the
government's position is this.

1736
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:22,461
There are $5 million in the
pipeline for which we have received

1737
01:40:22,462 --> 01:40:25,096
over $55 million worth of requests.

1738
01:40:25,097 --> 01:40:28,867
5 million doesn't seem quite
right for some 2,000 cases.

1739
01:40:28,868 --> 01:40:33,805
The government spent 3 million
investigating seven deaths from Tylenol.

1740
01:40:33,806 --> 01:40:36,607
- We're entering the third year.
- We voted to reject

1741
01:40:36,608 --> 01:40:39,077
your application for funding.

1742
01:40:39,078 --> 01:40:41,546
Oh?

1743
01:40:41,547 --> 01:40:43,013
I'd like to hear your reasons.

1744
01:40:43,014 --> 01:40:45,249
The direction of the
research you're suggesting

1745
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:48,118
is imprecise and unfocused.

1746
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:50,688
Oh, it is, is it?

1747
01:40:50,689 --> 01:40:52,957
You don't know what's
going on any more than I do.

1748
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:56,461
<i>Could you tell me precisely
why you're blocking my efforts?</i>

1749
01:40:56,462 --> 01:40:59,129
Dr. Brookner. There are
now other investigators.

1750
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:02,366
<i>This is no longer only your disease,
though you seem to think it is.</i>

1751
01:41:02,367 --> 01:41:03,800
Oh, I do, do I?

1752
01:41:03,801 --> 01:41:06,603
And you're here to take it
away from me, is that it?

1753
01:41:06,604 --> 01:41:09,273
Well, I'll let you in on
a little secret, Doctor.

1754
01:41:09,274 --> 01:41:11,041
You can have it. I didn't
want it in the first place.

1755
01:41:11,042 --> 01:41:13,477
You think it's a privilege
to watch young men die?

1756
01:41:13,478 --> 01:41:15,479
What am I arguing with you for?

1757
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,748
You do not know enough
to study boiled water.

1758
01:41:17,749 --> 01:41:20,016
How dare you come down here and judge me?!

1759
01:41:20,017 --> 01:41:22,986
We only serve on this peer review
panel at the behest of Dr. Murray.

1760
01:41:22,987 --> 01:41:26,923
Another idiot... and, by the
way, a closeted homosexual

1761
01:41:26,924 --> 01:41:31,127
doing everything in his power
to sweep this under the rug.

1762
01:41:31,128 --> 01:41:34,430
And I vowed I'd never say
anything like that in public.

1763
01:41:34,431 --> 01:41:36,032
How does it always happen

1764
01:41:36,033 --> 01:41:38,434
that all of the idiots
are always on your team?

1765
01:41:38,435 --> 01:41:41,837
How can you refuse to fund my research

1766
01:41:41,838 --> 01:41:45,041
or not invite me to participate in yours?

1767
01:41:45,042 --> 01:41:47,377
Your National Institutes of Health

1768
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:50,546
received my first request
for money two years ago.

1769
01:41:50,547 --> 01:41:54,082
It took you one year just to
print up application forms.

1770
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:56,886
It's taken you three years
from my first reported case

1771
01:41:56,887 --> 01:42:00,790
just to show up here for a look,
and the paltry amount of money

1772
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:04,493
<i>you are forcing us to beg
for out of the $4 billion</i>

1773
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:07,095
you now receive each and every year

1774
01:42:07,096 --> 01:42:10,865
to protect the health of American people

1775
01:42:10,866 --> 01:42:13,768
<i>won't come to anyone
before only God knows when.</i>

1776
01:42:13,769 --> 01:42:16,638
A promising virus has
been discovered in France.

1777
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,407
Why do you refuse to
cooperate with the French?

1778
01:42:18,408 --> 01:42:22,109
<i>Why are we told not to
cooperate with the French?</i>

1779
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:24,446
Just so you can steal a Nobel Prize

1780
01:42:24,447 --> 01:42:28,483
while something is being
passed around that causes death!

1781
01:42:30,085 --> 01:42:32,487
Women have been discovered
to have it in Africa

1782
01:42:32,488 --> 01:42:35,323
where it is clearly
transmitted heterosexually.

1783
01:42:35,324 --> 01:42:37,158
It is only a question of time.

1784
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:39,660
<i>We could all be dead
before you do anything.</i>

1785
01:42:39,661 --> 01:42:42,229
You want my data? You want my ideas?

1786
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:44,131
You want my patients? Take them!

1787
01:42:44,132 --> 01:42:46,700
(Screams) Just do something with them!

1788
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,674
You're fucking right! I am...

1789
01:42:53,675 --> 01:42:57,711
imprecise and unfocused
and you are all idiots!

1790
01:43:12,059 --> 01:43:14,095
Dick: Did you organize
that picketing of the mayor?

1791
01:43:14,096 --> 01:43:15,040
Ned: Yes.

1792
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:17,263
- And the signs?
- Yes.

1793
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:19,799
And your next play is about a First Lady

1794
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,502
- who gave the best blow jobs in Hollywood.
- Yes.

1795
01:43:22,503 --> 01:43:25,738
- This place is perfect for our new office.
- Yes.

1796
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:38,885
So tidy.

1797
01:43:38,886 --> 01:43:41,787
Here.

1798
01:43:41,788 --> 01:43:43,523
I got him.

1799
01:43:43,524 --> 01:43:45,190
Come on. Let's get you back to bed.

1800
01:43:45,191 --> 01:43:47,559
Okay.

1801
01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:50,828
Here you go.

1802
01:43:50,829 --> 01:43:53,931
Estelle made you some
stuffed cabbage for later.

1803
01:43:56,502 --> 01:43:58,669
<i>Ned: There's this new drug in Paris.</i>

1804
01:43:59,738 --> 01:44:02,306
Kessler's lover is flying out to get it.

1805
01:44:04,276 --> 01:44:07,978
Here it is. HPA-23.

1806
01:44:10,615 --> 01:44:12,616
Ned.

1807
01:44:14,853 --> 01:44:17,555
- He looks awful
- You this is anything

1808
01:44:17,556 --> 01:44:20,190
or is it just another shit
drug like all the rest?

1809
01:44:24,662 --> 01:44:27,830
I think you need to prepare
yourself for letting go.

1810
01:44:30,301 --> 01:44:33,903
You can't stop fighting
for the ones you love.

1811
01:44:33,904 --> 01:44:37,207
Haven't you ever had to
fight for somebody you love?

1812
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:49,786
Tommy. You gotta start
putting yourself out there

1813
01:44:49,787 --> 01:44:52,855
in a way that everyone
else could see what I see.

1814
01:44:56,426 --> 01:44:59,861
What kind of a fucked-up
love scene is this?

1815
01:44:59,862 --> 01:45:02,631
(Chuckles)

1816
01:45:03,733 --> 01:45:05,734
<i>(Telephone ringing)</i>

1817
01:45:10,574 --> 01:45:12,808
Yes?

1818
01:45:12,809 --> 01:45:15,410
Yes, ma'am?

1819
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:17,412
4:30 tomorrow?

1820
01:45:17,413 --> 01:45:19,615
Yes, ma'am.

1821
01:45:20,817 --> 01:45:23,151
The fucking White House.

1822
01:45:23,152 --> 01:45:26,321
Fuck the mayor. I've just been
invited to the White House.

1823
01:45:26,322 --> 01:45:27,923
They're gonna do something!

1824
01:45:33,162 --> 01:45:34,629
<i>Ned: Oh, just so I understand,</i>

1825
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:37,432
<i>what exactly does your title mean</i>

1826
01:45:37,433 --> 01:45:39,834
in terms of our plague?

1827
01:45:39,835 --> 01:45:43,037
We prefer not to use negative
terms. It only scares people.

1828
01:45:43,038 --> 01:45:46,741
Well, there's 3,339 cases so far.

1829
01:45:46,742 --> 01:45:49,543
<i>1,122 dead.</i>

1830
01:45:49,544 --> 01:45:51,679
Sounds like a plague to me. I'm scared.

1831
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,580
Aren't you?

1832
01:45:53,581 --> 01:45:55,415
What does your title mean again?

1833
01:45:55,416 --> 01:45:57,718
I come up with ideas for the president

1834
01:45:57,719 --> 01:45:59,654
about what he ought to
be doing and not doing.

1835
01:45:59,655 --> 01:46:01,321
Okay, good. Got it.

1836
01:46:01,322 --> 01:46:04,124
So, the money's there, right?
It just hasn't been spent.

1837
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:07,227
So there's this new drug in France.

1838
01:46:07,228 --> 01:46:08,862
Why doesn't the N.I.H. study it?

1839
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:12,432
<i>I mean, what I want, what we
want, what we desperately need</i>

1840
01:46:12,433 --> 01:46:14,768
is for somebody to help us
cut through all this red tape.

1841
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:17,103
I can asure you that not a week goes by

1842
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:20,073
that I don't bring new information
and reports to the president.

1843
01:46:20,074 --> 01:46:21,607
The progress that's
been made on this disease

1844
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,810
- is unprecedented.
- But it's contagious.

1845
01:46:23,811 --> 01:46:25,645
Can't you see that because it's contagious,

1846
01:46:25,646 --> 01:46:28,548
(Stammers) you... you have to work faster?

1847
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:32,285
Do you really believe that anybody

1848
01:46:32,286 --> 01:46:35,421
<i>in a serious public policy
position in their heart of hearts</i>

1849
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:37,657
or even in their most closeted meetings

1850
01:46:37,658 --> 01:46:39,458
says to each other, "Hey, guys,

1851
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:41,494
let's not get too upset about this"?

1852
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:44,564
Yes, your boss hasn't said
the word "AIDS" out loud.

1853
01:46:57,476 --> 01:47:00,612
Answer me this one question.

1854
01:47:00,613 --> 01:47:02,715
This shit, can... can hookers get it?

1855
01:47:02,716 --> 01:47:05,084
Or, you know, someone
who had a one-night stand?

1856
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:06,819
- Of course.
- You can't prove that.

1857
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,020
I mean, from what I
understand, what I've read,

1858
01:47:09,021 --> 01:47:11,055
female-to-male
transmissions through normal

1859
01:47:11,056 --> 01:47:13,991
vaginal intercourse does not
seem to be very efficient.

1860
01:47:15,561 --> 01:47:17,262
It's a virus, y it doesn't discriminate.

1861
01:47:17,263 --> 01:47:18,963
Yes, but...

1862
01:47:18,964 --> 01:47:21,700
it's very difficult. Isn't it?

1863
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:25,436
It's almost impossible
for a straight, you know,

1864
01:47:25,437 --> 01:47:28,239
regular heterosexual guy
to get it, am I right?

1865
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:31,042
- I'm sorry?
- There's no documented cases, am I right?

1866
01:47:31,043 --> 01:47:33,144
There's not a single documented case

1867
01:47:33,145 --> 01:47:35,980
of a heterosexual man getting it?

1868
01:47:35,981 --> 01:47:39,283
<i>Not from fucking or a blow job?</i>

1869
01:47:39,284 --> 01:47:41,818
I don't have that information.

1870
01:47:47,459 --> 01:47:49,860
Great, that's what I thought.

1871
01:47:55,734 --> 01:47:57,468
Susan, call my meeting.

1872
01:47:57,469 --> 01:48:00,804
I'll be about 15 minutes late. Thanks.

1873
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:08,178
- Thank you so much.
- Wait, please.

1874
01:48:08,179 --> 01:48:10,847
<i>- Call me anytime.
- Sir. Wait.</i>

1875
01:48:10,848 --> 01:48:12,448
<i>(Telephone ringing)</i>

1876
01:48:17,554 --> 01:48:20,990
(yelling) 100 million predicted

1877
01:48:20,991 --> 01:48:24,694
and nobody is paying any attention!

1878
01:48:24,695 --> 01:48:27,997
Hi, I need security on the second floor.

1879
01:48:45,548 --> 01:48:48,350
<i>(Door creaks)</i>

1880
01:48:57,126 --> 01:48:58,760
Why you sitting on the floor?

1881
01:48:58,761 --> 01:49:02,197
I fell down trying to
get from there to here.

1882
01:49:07,436 --> 01:49:09,037
Oh, don't touch me! God.

1883
01:49:09,038 --> 01:49:11,139
<i>(Sighs sharply)</i>

1884
01:49:13,342 --> 01:49:15,443
I hate it when you look at me.

1885
01:49:19,014 --> 01:49:22,216
You hungry? I'm hungry, how about you?

1886
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:27,355
I looked in all my datebooks.

1887
01:49:27,356 --> 01:49:29,490
No one else I slept with is sick.

1888
01:49:29,491 --> 01:49:31,592
Maybe you're the carrier.

1889
01:49:37,565 --> 01:49:41,301
We don't have to do this to each other.

1890
01:49:41,302 --> 01:49:44,071
You're gonna get better, Felix. You are.

1891
01:49:47,508 --> 01:49:50,244
Emma says the N.I.H. is
finally starting research.

1892
01:49:50,245 --> 01:49:51,979
- We have to hope.
- Oh, do we?

1893
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:55,314
- Yes, we do.
- Do we? And how am I supposed to do that?

1894
01:49:55,315 --> 01:49:56,949
Huh?

1895
01:50:01,321 --> 01:50:03,456
Stop eating that shit!

1896
01:50:03,457 --> 01:50:06,426
- Give it to me.
- No!

1897
01:50:07,895 --> 01:50:09,996
You know how important it
is to watch your nutrition.

1898
01:50:09,997 --> 01:50:11,998
I have a life expectancy
of 10 more minutes.

1899
01:50:11,999 --> 01:50:14,233
I'll eat what I wanna eat.

1900
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:19,238
(Groans)

1901
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:24,810
Ned.

1902
01:50:24,811 --> 01:50:28,313
It's getting messier. Okay?

1903
01:50:28,314 --> 01:50:31,149
I don't wanna make you see it.

1904
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:32,451
Nobody can make me do anything.

1905
01:50:32,452 --> 01:50:34,119
You should know that better than anybody.

1906
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,522
Now you gonna sit there on the
floor for the rest of your life?

1907
01:50:36,523 --> 01:50:37,923
<i>- Do you hear me?
- Do you hear me?</i>

1908
01:50:37,924 --> 01:50:39,558
<i>- No!
- No?</i>

1909
01:50:39,559 --> 01:50:42,761
I've had over 40 treatments. No?

1910
01:50:42,762 --> 01:50:47,632
I've had three... no, four
different kinds of chemo. No!

1911
01:50:47,633 --> 01:50:49,200
<i>I've had three different experimentals.</i>

1912
01:50:49,201 --> 01:50:51,836
Emma has spent more time
on me than anyone else.

1913
01:50:51,837 --> 01:50:53,604
And it hasn't done a thing!

1914
01:50:55,841 --> 01:50:57,608
You cannot force the
goddamn sun to come out!

1915
01:50:57,609 --> 01:51:01,446
I am so sick of fighting

1916
01:51:01,447 --> 01:51:03,648
and everybody's stupidity

1917
01:51:03,649 --> 01:51:05,516
and blindness and guilt trips.

1918
01:51:05,517 --> 01:51:07,284
You can't eat the food? Don't eat the food.

1919
01:51:07,285 --> 01:51:10,120
I don't care. Take your
poison, I don't care.

1920
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:11,722
Fish is good for you.

1921
01:51:11,723 --> 01:51:13,390
Don't want any of that, do we?

1922
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:15,660
<i>No green salad!</i>

1923
01:51:15,661 --> 01:51:18,429
No broccoli! No vegetables!

1924
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:20,831
No bread with seven grain!

1925
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,000
Why would anyone ever want any milk?

1926
01:51:23,001 --> 01:51:25,869
- You might get some calcium in your bones!
- (Yelps)

1927
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:28,172
- (Crashes)
- Do you wanna die, Felix?

1928
01:51:28,173 --> 01:51:29,974
Die!

1929
01:51:45,089 --> 01:51:47,357
(Sobs)

1930
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:59,969
(Whimpers) Please don't leave me, Felix.

1931
01:52:06,710 --> 01:52:09,745
<i>(Crowd chanting) Keep out! Keep out!</i>

1932
01:52:09,746 --> 01:52:11,346

Keep out! Keep out!

1947
01:52:33,469 --> 01:52:35,003
- Keep out!
- (Grunts)

1948
01:52:35,004 --> 01:52:36,505
Assholes.

1949
01:52:36,506 --> 01:52:39,440
Gay Men's Health Crisis.

1950
01:52:39,441 --> 01:52:41,007
Thrush is a fungus, yes.

1951
01:52:41,008 --> 01:52:42,501
Can you tell him that
we'll be picketing there

1952
01:52:42,502 --> 01:52:44,045
and not afraid of arrest
or police brutality.

1953
01:52:44,046 --> 01:52:45,212
<i>- Gay Men's Health Crisis.
- That's right.</i>

1954
01:52:45,213 --> 01:52:47,582
The mayor has four more
hours before we carry out

1955
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:49,984
our threats of civil disobedience
if he doesn't meet with us.

1956
01:52:49,985 --> 01:52:52,186
Tommy got the call yesterday, Ned.

1957
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:57,058
Why didn't you tell me?!

1958
01:52:57,059 --> 01:52:58,792
You see, it works!

1959
01:52:58,793 --> 01:53:02,430
<i>- When? When?
- Only two can go to the meeting, Ned.</i>

1960
01:53:03,865 --> 01:53:05,732
- When?
- Tommy's executive director.

1961
01:53:05,733 --> 01:53:08,902
I'm going.

1962
01:53:08,903 --> 01:53:10,938
- I polled the fucking board, Ned.
- I wrote that letter

1963
01:53:10,939 --> 01:53:12,973
to the mayor. That meeting is mine.

1964
01:53:12,974 --> 01:53:15,842
I am going to go and
represent this organization

1965
01:53:15,843 --> 01:53:18,511
that I have spent every
minute of my life fighting for

1966
01:53:18,512 --> 01:53:20,480
<i>and that was started in my living room</i>

1967
01:53:20,481 --> 01:53:22,348
or I quit.

1968
01:53:28,389 --> 01:53:30,290
You'd let me quit?

1969
01:53:39,567 --> 01:53:41,367
The board asked me to
read this out loud to you.

1970
01:53:41,368 --> 01:53:43,869
- Read what?
- A letter.

1971
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:45,972
Ahem.

1972
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:52,611
Go on, read it.

1973
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,116
"We are circulating this
letter widely among people

1974
01:53:58,117 --> 01:54:01,586
of judgment and good sense.

1975
01:54:01,587 --> 01:54:06,324
You are on a colossal
ego trip we must curtail.

1976
01:54:06,325 --> 01:54:09,293
To manipulate fear as
you have done repeatedly

1977
01:54:09,294 --> 01:54:13,131
is to us, sheer barbarism.

1978
01:54:13,132 --> 01:54:15,799
<i>To exploit the deaths of
gay men as you have done</i>

1979

on television and in
publications all over America

1980
01:54:19,204 --> 01:54:22,740
is to us, an act of vandalism.

1981
01:54:23,775 --> 01:54:27,144
<i>And after years of liberation,</i>

1982
01:54:27,145 --> 01:54:30,748
<i>you helped make sex dirty again for us...</i>

1983
01:54:30,749 --> 01:54:34,317
terrible and forbidden.

1984
01:54:34,318 --> 01:54:37,121
We are more angry at you

1985
01:54:37,122 --> 01:54:40,290
than ever in our lives toward anyone.

1986

<i>We think you want to lead us all.</i>

1987
01:54:44,028 --> 01:54:45,828
Well...

1988
01:54:45,829 --> 01:54:49,299
we do not want you to lead us.

1989
01:54:52,703 --> 01:54:57,206
In accordance with our bylaws
as drawn up by Weeks, Frankel,

1990

Levinstein,

1991
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:01,744
Mr. Ned Weeks is hereby removed

<i>as a director of Gay Men's Health Crisis.</i>

1993
01:55:05,549 --> 01:55:09,585
We beg that you leave us quietly

1994
01:55:09,586 --> 01:55:13,722
and not destroy us and
what good work we manage

1995
01:55:13,723 --> 01:55:16,358
despite your disapproval.

1996

<i>Tommy: Ned.</i>

2000
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:46,387
The executive director isn't
on the board, you know that.

2001
01:55:46,388 --> 01:55:48,022
I don't have a vote.

<i>(Stammers) What could...
what could I have done?</i>

2003
01:55:49,491 --> 01:55:51,892
- You didn't support me.
- That's not true.

2004
01:55:51,893 --> 01:55:53,328
You're all nothing but undertakers.

2005
01:55:53,329 --> 01:55:55,062
This whole organization
is a funeral parlor.

2006
01:55:55,063 --> 01:55:57,832
Ned...
- All you do is take care of the dying.

2007
01:55:57,833 --> 01:56:00,101
Who's fighting so the
living can go on living?

2008
01:56:00,102 --> 01:56:02,203
Who's fighting for my Felix?

2009
01:56:02,204 --> 01:56:05,272
Tommy. We need you upstairs.

2010
01:56:10,411 --> 01:56:13,214
I belong to a culture that
includes Marcel Proust,

2011
01:56:13,215 --> 01:56:16,617
Walt Whitman, Tennessee
Williams, Alexander the Great,

2012
01:56:16,618 --> 01:56:19,453
so many popes and cardinals
you wouldn't believe.

2013
01:56:19,454 --> 01:56:22,522
Mr. Green Beret, did you know that
it was an openly gay Englishman

2014
01:56:22,523 --> 01:56:25,158
who's responsible for winning World War II?

2015
01:56:25,159 --> 01:56:28,762
His name's Alan Turing and he
cracked the Germans' Enigma code.

2016
01:56:28,763 --> 01:56:30,664
After the war was over,
he committed suicide

2017
01:56:30,665 --> 01:56:33,667
because he was so hounded for being gay.

2018
01:56:33,668 --> 01:56:36,335
<i>Why didn't they teach
any of that in schools?</i>

2019
01:56:36,336 --> 01:56:40,706
A gay man is responsible
for winning World War II!

2020
01:56:42,009 --> 01:56:43,777
If they did, maybe he
wouldn't have killed himself

2021
01:56:43,778 --> 01:56:47,046
and you wouldn't be so
terrified of who you are.

2022
01:56:50,417 --> 01:56:53,452
That's how I want to be remembered.

2023
01:56:53,453 --> 01:56:55,521
As one of the men who won the war.

2024
01:56:59,459 --> 01:57:03,562
Bruce, I know that I am an asshole.

2025
01:57:03,563 --> 01:57:07,132
But please don't shut me out.

2026
01:57:43,635 --> 01:57:46,070
Go.

2027
01:57:59,951 --> 01:58:02,185
Your brother and I are lovers.

2028
01:58:03,888 --> 01:58:06,590
I'm dying and I need to make a will.

2029
01:58:09,126 --> 01:58:11,194
- Please.
- Thank you.

2030
01:58:24,641 --> 01:58:27,978
I want to leave everything to Ned.

2031
01:58:30,647 --> 01:58:34,984
- How's my brother?
- Well, he blames himself for everything

2032
01:58:34,985 --> 01:58:39,989
from my dying to the
state of the entire world.

2033
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:43,359
All that plus you two still not talking.

2034
01:58:45,863 --> 01:58:48,364
You must be as stubborn as he is.

2035
01:58:50,433 --> 01:58:52,134
I'll call him right away.

2036
01:58:52,135 --> 01:58:55,304
Do. He's at home packing.

2037
01:58:55,305 --> 01:58:58,874
We're going to Yale in a few days.

2038
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:01,977
For Gay Week. (Chuckles)

2039
01:59:01,978 --> 01:59:03,812
He says he can't believe it.

2040
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:09,117
He tried to kill himself
there when he was a freshman.

2041
01:59:13,923 --> 01:59:16,491
I haven't much...

2042
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:20,862
except for a beautiful piece of land

2043
01:59:20,863 --> 01:59:23,764
on the Cape in Wellfleet.

2044
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:27,668
Ned doesn't know about it.

2045
01:59:27,669 --> 01:59:29,603
It was to have been a surprise

2046
01:59:29,604 --> 01:59:31,940
for when we lived there together

2047
01:59:31,941 --> 01:59:36,144
or riding away happily ever after.

2048
01:59:36,145 --> 01:59:39,547
I also have an insurance policy,

2049
01:59:39,548 --> 01:59:42,850
uh... with the "Times." I'm a reporter...

2050
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:44,585
for "The New York Times."

2051
01:59:44,586 --> 01:59:48,456
It's meant to come to my next of kin.

2052
01:59:48,457 --> 01:59:50,090
I'm afraid they might not give it to him.

2053
01:59:50,091 --> 01:59:52,225
Well, if he's listed as
a beneficiary, they must.

2054
01:59:52,226 --> 01:59:54,661
You're smarter than
that. Don't be so naive.

2055
01:59:54,662 --> 01:59:58,398
I assure you, I will fight
to make sure that they do.

2056
02:00:01,635 --> 02:00:05,005
I was hoping you'd say that.

2057
02:00:05,006 --> 02:00:07,207
(Coughing)

2058
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:14,313
Felix...

2059
02:00:16,116 --> 02:00:18,718
I wish we'd met sooner.

2060

2063

It should... it should be something

2065
02:01:21,813 --> 02:01:27,217
Perry Ellis ran up for me personally.

2066
02:01:34,092 --> 02:01:36,226
Ned?

2067
02:01:40,731 --> 02:01:43,567
You find a way to fight again.
