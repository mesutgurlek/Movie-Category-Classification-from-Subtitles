implant it in his groin...

- Mm-hmm.
- ...so that it wouldn't die...

327
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,126
You were crazy about him
two days ago.

328
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,528
And it can't be the sex,
because you were a lot nicer

329
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,197
and your hair was way more shiny.

330
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,466
He's got a wife, okay?
He's married.

331
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,501
And you don't think
you can take her?

332
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,037
That's not the point.
I don't do married guys.

333
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,873
I don't need to wreck
someone's home for a date.

334
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:28,540
Not always a wreck.

335
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,376
Stan and I were married
when we met.

336
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,877
We weren't happy.
Now we are.

337
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,212
You wrecked two marriages.

338
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:36,215
First of all, one of them
was mine, so that doesn't count.

339
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,082
Second of all,

340
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,385
Stan's wife was a fat Canadian
with no sexual charisma.

341
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,086
That marriage was doomed
from the beginning.

342
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,321
It doesn't even count as cheating.

343
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,956
I don't think that's how it works.

All I'm saying

345
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,059
is that I think married guys would
be the perfect fit for you.

346
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,496
I mean, Mark was able to lead
a whole other life

347
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,597
without you even noticing.

348
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,165
I think you need someone
with something

349
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,600
that's gonna keep them busy.

350
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,467
Not a wife!

I don't do this.

352
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,171
I'm too old for this shit.

353
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,472
I've been dating for decades.

354
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,075
I'm over it.
I don't need this anymore.

355
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,277
Okay. Somebody's being negative.

356
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,211
I'm gonna go.

357
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,614
But I'll tell you
what my mother told me,

358
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,549
and these are words to live by:

359
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,084
"Selfish people

360
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,385
live longer."

361
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,554
I'm just saying.

I'm Kate. I met you on Friday.

and my husband
been seeing each other?

So when... Did you
just start sleeping together?

00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,591
Well, we were gonna try
to hold off for prom,

442
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,926
but we kind of got carried away.

443
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,495
We're adults. We had sex.

444
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,330
- Okay.
- I really don't think that the details matter.

445
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,466
The details do matter
because there's a difference

446

50 times?

458

Don't you have a job?

459
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,862

Yeah, no.

I am part of Team King.

I quit my job so that
we could focus on his job.

I put off having kids

467

how far away China is?

to go on dates.

480
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,869
The last time I was single,
I was 24

481
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,271
and the dating pool was everyone.

482
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,941

00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,813
and I don't want to do that.

486
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,683
I know that you think
that it's that bad,

487
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,784
but honestly,

488
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,385
it's a lot worse.

489

You know why?

490
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,754
Because even
if you meet a nice guy...

491
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,755
and when I mean "nice,"

492
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,525
I mean that he's, like,
not an obvious sociopath...

493

you can't even actually
get excited about it.

494

You know why?

495
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,565
Because it's just a matter of time
before someone gets bored and unhappy

496
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,401
and is saying that it's over,
and that's a happy ending.

497
00:18:56,402 --> 00:19:00,405
A shitty ending is that
there's lying and cheating

498
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,807
and you ambush

So you're saying
I should stay with him?

501
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,546
I'm saying that
everything fails eventually,

502
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,381
and monogamy is not natural.

503
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,750
If you can live with that, like the
French, then go ahead and stay put,

504
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,553
but if you can't, then I suggest
that you get a game plan

00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,086
What is your deal?

650
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,322
Do you not get how weird this is?

651
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,091
I just thought we...
Maybe we could talk,

652
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,626
because, um, I, um,

653
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,094
(GASPING):
because...

654
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,931
(CRYING): because my whole
world just blew up,

655
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,299
and I don't have a job,

656
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,068
and I have no money

657
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:06,371
of my own,
and I honestly do not know

658
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,073
what I'm gonna do at all,

659
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,374
and I have no friends to talk to

660
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,077
because all of my friends
are Mark's friends,

661
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,144
and they'll blab,

662
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,213
and you are literally
the only person

663
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,749
in the whole world
who knows what's happening

664
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,319
besides me, and if I keep
talking to myself about it,

665
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,954
I'm gonna go crazy.

666
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,055
For real.

667
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,890
- Like, really.
- I can't

668
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,860
talk to you until you stop crying.

669
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,328
(MUFFLED CRYING)

670
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,096
I want to.

671
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,101
Let me just...

672
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,602
I'm sorry.

673
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,737
I just am sad.

674
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,006
Then cry on the inside
like a winner.

675
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,875
Okay.
- You cannot take care of yourself

676
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,843
unless you toughen up,

677
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:46,678
and as far as talking to somebody

678
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,847
who won't blab,
I can give you the names

679
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,215
of three different lawyers.

680
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,016
Lawyers cost money.

681
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,852
You have money;
you have half of what Mark has.

682
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,420
Okay, thank you.

683
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,656
You're welcome. Are we done?

684
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:58,189
Done?

685
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,257
That wasn't even a conversation.

686
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,960
You mostly just yelled at me
the whole time.

687
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,561
(THUNDER WHIMPERS)

688
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,133
Okay, look.

689
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:08,867
Yeah?

690
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,869
All right, if I let you in,
we are not

691
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,937
braiding each other's hair
and drinking cosmos.

692
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,572
- No.
- You have one hour.

693
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,874
- Okay.
- And I get first dibs

694
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,742
of whatever's in that bag.

695
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,710
Sure thing.

696
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,912
You can have a seat,
but please keep your dog

697
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,113
off of my furniture.

That's great.

707

He's just a puppy.

708
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,840
Okay...

709
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:53,210
Well, have a seat.

710
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,946
Okay, well, I don't want
to sit someplace

711
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,582
where you and Mark had sex.

Mm...

715
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,389

- I just...
- Are you serious?

719
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:15,967
It's a window.

720
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,869
People can see in here.

721
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,071
Look, you're just gonna have
to pick a spot

722
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,039
and be okay with it.

723
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,107

(BUZZING CONTINUES)

727
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:39,958
Yes, it is.

728
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,727
Mark is in Miami, so why is
he calling you from Miami?

729
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,395
I didn't
even know he was in Miami.

730
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,064
Well, why is he
calling you at all?

731
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,999
I don't know that either.
I usually don't

732
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,001
call my boyfriends back after I
find out that they have a wife.

733
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,804
So you haven't called him
at all, full silent treatment,

734
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:53,471
and he's still calling you?

735
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,273
I'm pretty certain
that's why he's still calling.

736
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,475
But what if he's calling to say
that he's in love with you

737
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,177
- and he wants to be with you.
- I don't care.

738
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,179
Well, what if he's in love
with you and what?

739
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,615
I mean, has he ever said
that he-he loves you

740
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:06,751
and has he talked
to you like that? Or has he...

741
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,854
I mean, do you think
that he still loves me?

742
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:16,126
If we're gonna do this,
I-I need a drink.

743
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,763
- I get it.
- What do you get?

744
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,366
Okay, you have the perfect place,

745
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,801
and you are the perfect girl,

746
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:26,337
and you could probably take off
all of your clothes right now

747
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,974
and have, like,
no flab and not need a wax

748
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,545
or anything and
just be ready to go.

at all times.

It's true.

751
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:39,751
And see, I am not situated.

752
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:43,154
I-I can't even remember
to shave my legs.

753
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:47,091
I need, like, at least
a week of prep, minimum.

754
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,528
Doesn't Mark see you naked
all the time?

755
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,496
No.

756
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,931
He doesn't?

757
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:53,998
No.

758
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,001
It's... No.

759
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:57,869
What's it like?

760
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,872
Is it, like, a '70s situation?
Is it like a...

761
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,207
It is like...

762
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,442
and I'm totally serious,

763
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,244
like, not...

764
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,649
No man likes that.

765
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,384
It's like a...

766
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,185
Just not...

767
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,054
I'm not saying
that you have to be bald

or anything like that.

769

That's all they want.

about Martha Stewart.

- Thank you.
- That's right.

- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

I still think, though,
that I am not ready

to compete with women like you.

785

I have been competing

We're not in competition.

so I'm not a mistress.

Can you say that, please?

799

Seriously, can you just please
say I'm not a mistress?

Oh, you're not a mistress.

What it does is hold your tits up.

That's so awesome.

who love feng shui,

1134
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,596
and feng shui is not
what you think it is,

1135
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,598
- and I hate that you keep saying...
- Katie...

- ...that it's dumb.
- I didn't mean it.

Feng shui is so good
'cause it's important to know

1138
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,304
- where to place things...
- Mm-hmm... Okay...

She's Mark's girlfriend,
and not "friend friend,"

1151
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,162

- Or more probably.

1155
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,936
Carmela, but only
her real name is Carly.

1156

Is this some sort of Tyler
Durden<i> Fight Club</i> thing?

- Are you Carly?

1158

- No...
- Is anyone Carly?

1159
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,377
- Phil, please focus, okay?
- I am focused.

1160
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,713
I-I don't want to keep
explaining this to you.

1161
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,414

that girl?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I never liked that guy.

1167
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,927
I never liked that guy;
I told you that

1168
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:51,061
before you married him, didn't I?

1169
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,330
I sat you down.
What a piece of shit.

1170
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,832
Did you know she was his mistress

1171
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,367
when she was in the house?
When she was working here?

1172
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,302
Okay, here's the thing.

1173
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,037
I thought she was
his ex-mistress,

1174
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:02,840
but it turns out
they're still seeing each other.

1175
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,241
- That makes sense.
- So I heard him

1176
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:05,275
on the phone with her,

1177
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,344
and then he comes to me,
and he's like,

1178
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:08,912
"Oh, I have to go golfing

1179
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:09,913
in Connecticut

1180
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,082
with the Canadian crew."
Right?

- Ca?

1184
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:17,788
Ca.

1185
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,490
- Ca.
- Car...

1186
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,358
- Carly. Carmela.
- Carmela.

1187
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,526
- You're talking about Carmela.
- Right.

1188
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:26,130
And then she doesn't even know that
I know that they're still together,

1189
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:27,831
and so she's pretending
to be friends with me,

1190
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,134
but she's spying on me
like a double agent.

1191
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,468
And you're letting her
pretend because...

1192
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,070
Because that's how you run
a double agent.

1193
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:34,605
- Oh.
- I don't even know

1194
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,006
if she's American.

1195
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,007
I don't even know.

1196
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,076
Listen, Katie,
if she's full of shit,

1197
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:40,210
call her out on it.

1198
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,745
Take care of that.
Deal with her.

1199
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,881
And then deal
with the real problem.

1200
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:44,982
Oh, Mark.

1201
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:46,116
Yes, Mark.

1202
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,251
Yes.

1203

Okay, right. Mm-hmm.

- I don't know.

we're doing this.

an apology for the other night.

00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,619
he'd lie to me.

1445
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,122
I really thought
we were soul mates.

1446
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,990
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

1447

I can't believe I just said that.

1448

You're his soul mate;
I'm a whore.

1449
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:06,963
- No.
- You must hate me so much right now.

1450
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,632
But if it's any consolation,
right now, I hate me more.

1451
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:12,035
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you at all.

1452
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,003
I got all of that out of my system

1453
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,138
with that one.
How can you be

1454
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:18,541
so amazing you could be friends
with your husband's mistress?

1455
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,843
Yeah, it's like a dream come true.

1456
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:21,578
- Seriously?
- You know what, ignore her.

1457
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:25,148
She's just working through
some stuff right now. She's...

1458
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:26,483
she's kind of troubled.

1459
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,619
But you smell amazing.

1462
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:34,524
about this is?
You seem so nice,

1463
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,593
and this whole time
he had me believing

1464
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:37,427
you were the devil.

1465
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:38,528
- Wait, what?
- He said that

1466
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,631
you cheated on him
and then asked for a divorce.

1467
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,066
He said that I...
(STAMMERING)

1468
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,935
I was the cheater?
That's what he said?

1469
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:46,402
Yeah.

1470
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,538

I'm so sorry.

Okay, well, that's...

1472
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,208
What an asshole!

1473
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,077
He's a liar, Kate.
Who cares what he says?

1474
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:56,145
Because it's not fair.
And he made me

1475
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,581
the bad guy.
And he's divorcing me?

1476
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,583
You know it's not actually
happening, right?

1477
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,218
Okay, but he could have
picked any scenario,

1478
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,553
and he picks that one?

1479
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:04,721
And he makes me the villain?

1480
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:07,290
And then divorces me
for fake cheating?

1481
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,325
I shouldn't have told you.
I'm so sorry.

1482

Honey, it's not your fault
that I married a monster.

You are innocent in all of this.

01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,367
What are you guys doing?

1598
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:48,137
Phil went for a run, and
Amber's making frittatas.

1599
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:48,838
Have you packed your shit?

1600
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:51,507
'Cause I want to get on the
road before traffic starts.

1601
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,475
No. 'Cause that means

1602
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:54,010
I have to go home
and deal with Mark.

1603
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:56,279
You know what sucks?
I was thinking...

1604
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,548
is that he should be
the one freaking out,

1605
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:00,149
not me, because
I didn't do anything,

1606
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,451
and instead, he's totally fine,
and I'm sitting here

1607
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:05,087
with the two of you,
pretending not even

1608
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,455
to know you, and then

1609
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,892
on top of it, I have to
get my ducks in a row.

1610
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:13,062
- So what do you want to do?
- Okay, this may sound wrong,

1611
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,398
but I kind of want him to hurt.

1612
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,800
I want to be the one who makes him

1613
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,135
start a whole new life

1614
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:21,270
because I took it away from him.

1615
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:24,907
I want him to feel
what I feel, but worse.

1616
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:28,077
So you're talking about
maximum pain, right?

1617
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,745
We should kick him in the balls.

1618
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:32,615
You know, that's, like,
a really good thought,

1619
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,317
and actually, I like the way
your brain works,

1620
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:35,218
but I think we're thinking

1621
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:38,154
about... something a little bit bigger than that.
- Yeah.

1622
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,022
You know what, it doesn't
really matter anyway,

1623
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,624
because he's always
gonna wind up on top,

1624
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,292
because he's a killer and I'm not.

1625
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:44,093
That's not true.

1626
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,162

You're not alone in this.

- Exactly.

the wife and the boobs together,

1629
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,101
you got the perfect
killing machine.

1630
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:52,902
- I do?
- Yes.

1631

- And you know how Mark does everything,

1633
01:02:58,175 --> 01:02:59,875
and Amber knows...

1634
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,245
- We're gonna find out what Amber knows.
- AMBER: Yeah.

1635
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:03,412
Wait a sec, what are you saying?

1636
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:06,482
What I'm saying is that
if you want to take him down,

1637
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:08,217
then let's take him down.

1638

- The three of us.

just as shady as he can.

<i>Hi! Hi!</i>

2071
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:07,569
I'm so glad you're here!

2072
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:08,570
We have so much to tell you.

2073
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,538
Major breakthroughs.
Whoa.

2074
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,173
Major breakthroughs.
What is all of this?

2075
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,742
Amber got Mark's password
off the nanny cam,

2076
01:20:13,743 --> 01:20:15,443
hacked into his computer
the night she was supposed

2077
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:17,379
to have sex with him.
- So you saw him?
- Yeah.

2078
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,748
He came over after work and
he had his computer with him.

2079
01:20:19,749 --> 01:20:21,149
Did you have sex?

2080
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:21,650
No.

2081
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:22,617
I know I said I would,

2082
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:23,919
but you looked so sad when I won,

2083
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,186
and I couldn't do it.
No.

2084
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,554
Tell her what you did.
I chickened out,

2085
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:30,025
and I said I had chlamydia.
That's right, bitch, chlamydia!

2086
01:20:30,026 --> 01:20:31,259
No.
She gave him chlamydia.

2087
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,360
AMBER:
He can't even have any sex

2088
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,495
till he finishes his Z-Pak.

2089
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:34,863
(LAUGHS) Yay.
CARLY: Mark's not just

2090
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:37,198
a cheating scumbag,
he's also a thief.

2091
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:37,933
Look what I found.

2092
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:40,702
This is a list of all
of the start-up companies

2093
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:41,670
that Mark has invested in.

2094
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,639
Three are offshore, but only
one was a blind filing.

2095
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,174
No board of directors.

2096
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,176
It has a P.O. box
for an address,

2097
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,612
and it's been operating at
a total loss in the Bahamas.

2098
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:51,579
ServiceCircuit.

2099
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,548
This is it, Kate.
No, that can't be right.

2100
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:56,084
Mark was talking about
ServiceCircuit last night.

2101
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,152
They're putting more money

2102
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:58,520
into it.
That's part of the con.

2103
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,822
All we have to do is find out
the bank he's using.

2104
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,457
No, I was with the
board last night,

2105
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,692
and they seem really happy.

2106
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,260
Mark is making them rich.

2107
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,128
He's stealing, Kate,
and making money for them

2108
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,297
is just one of the ways
that he does it.

2109
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,333
Okay, wait, Kate, what's going on?

2110
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,734
Nothing, I just think

2111
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,536
that it's more complicated

2112
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,438
than we thought.

2113
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,174
You slept with him, didn't you?

2114
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:19,774
One night?

2115
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:21,276
You go right back
to being a Stepford?

2116
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:23,044
What am I supposed to do?
That's great.

2117
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,480
He must have literally
screwed your brains out.

2118
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,683
So what? Maybe you just have
to forgive people

2119
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:29,417
in order to move forward.

2120
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,353
But he didn't ask you for
forgiveness, now, did he?

2121
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:32,320
Maybe if you
had something to lose,

2122
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:35,256
- you would understand how hard this is for me?
- CARLY: Like what?

2123
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,424
Like a cheating husband of my own?

2124
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:37,559
Both of you, stop.
You know what,

2125
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,227
things shifted this weekend.

2126
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,161
It was different.

2127
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,630
So you don't know.
Really?

2128
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,501
What are you doing?

2129
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,703
I'm gonna see
if Mark wants to hang out.

2130
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:50,271
What's wrong with you?

2131
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,239
KATE:
Everything.

2132
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,273
Everything is wrong with you,

2133
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,943
and you know what,
I feel like an idiot right now

2134
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,845
for trusting you over him.

2135
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:59,613
I am done.

2136
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,853
Kate, wait.

2137
01:22:04,854 --> 01:22:07,921

2139
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:47,796
But nothing from Amber either?

2140
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,365
No, and I feel like
if Amber won't talk to me,

2141
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:53,835
then... I obviously
I did something wrong.

2142
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:57,005
I think you're being hard
on yourself.

2143
01:22:57,006 --> 01:22:58,773
I don't know, I can't tell.

I care so much,

2146
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:04,479
and-and then it just comes out
so harsh.

2147
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,115
Well, you know,
what the hell do you know?

2148
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:09,449
You get it wrong all the time.

2149
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:13,054
Sorry.

2150
01:23:13,055 --> 01:23:15,490
I'm usually a fun date.
I am.

2151
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,858
I'm having fun.
Yeah?

2152
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:20,827
Not a lot of it, but some.

2153
01:23:20,995 --> 01:23:23,498
You should think
about being nicer to me.

2154
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:26,901
'Cause I'm not certain
I really like you yet.

2155
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:28,803
I think you like me.

01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,015
Mmm.

No, don't get too close to me.

2164
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:48,823
I think I'm getting sick.

2165
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:49,958
What's wrong?

2166
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:51,693
I went to the doctor.

2167
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:52,727
He gave me a Z-Pak.

2168
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:54,996
He said there's something
nasty going around,

2169
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,499
and that you should take one, too.

2170
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,533
That's for you.

2171
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,135
A Z-Pak? I'm not sick, though.

2172
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:02,036
Well, that's why you
take it beforehand,

2173
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,538
so you don't get sick.

2174
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,772
It's prophylactic.

Oh, honey,

2176
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,484
I need you to sign

it today, that'd be great.

There's no need to read it;
it's just the usual stuff.

2179
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:24,959
It's, uh, boring stuff
from the accountant.

2180

Also, I'm traveling.

2182

I'm going to Miami and the Bahamas.

2183

Did you just say something
about the Bahamas?

You were right about everything,

2189
01:24:58,661 --> 01:24:59,928
and he's still lying to me,

2190
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,897
and he's still treating me
like I'm blind, and I'm not.

2191
01:25:02,898 --> 01:25:05,365
You're not.
You're not.

2192
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,469
Okay, I found this.

2193
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,138
They're wire transfer instructions

2194
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:11,973
for a company in the Bahamas.

2195
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:13,775
Mark is flying down this week.

2196
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:14,976
You said that all we had to do

2197
01:25:14,977 --> 01:25:16,644
was find out where he banks, right?

2198
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,613
So let's go to the Bahamas

2199
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,215
and let's get him.

2200
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:23,451
Kate, I'm sorry, but I...

2201
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,419
I can't.

2202
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,121
I can't stay in this
Mark moment forever.

2203

I can't,
and if I'm investigating him

2204
01:25:30,025 --> 01:25:31,859
or if go to the Bahamas,

2205
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,896
then I'm still involved, and...

2206
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:38,431
I just can't do that anymore.

2207

No, okay.

forcing me to be your friend.

with me, too.
