00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,191
- Ohh!

- [screamimimimimiming]

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,168
- Enjoying family time?

6
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:35,809
My family has other plans.

7
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:37,944
- [screaming]

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,284
- Batman.

9
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:45,719
I was wondering when--

10
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:48,255
- Ha ha ha!

11
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,363
- Oh. Boy Wonder.

12
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,865
The Bat sent you to drag
me off to prison?

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,101
Frankly, I'm underwhelmed.

14
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,270
- Great, but I'm kind of
in a hurry here.

15
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:06,740
- Kids--always in such a rush.

16
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:10,877
I prefer to preserve
these moments forever.

17
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,447
- Not talking to you.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sync an corected by
www.addic7ed.com

19
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:31,565
- Ha ha ha!

20
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,233
Unh!

21
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,035
Ohh!

22
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:43,276
Finally! I was wondering
what a guy had to do to get

23
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:46,847
A little attention
around here.

24
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:48,749
Unh!

25
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,884
- Junior's doing
this for attention?

26
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,623
I'm telling you now.

27
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,992
This little distraction
better not interfere.

28
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,776
- Ha ha ha! Kid had
a glass jaw.

29
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,511
- Hilarious. Can we go?

30
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,312
Today's the day.

31
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,360
- Don't tell me
you're not excited.

32
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:37,063
- Right now, my king, I'm more
focused on the matter at hand.

33
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,844
- Unh!

34
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:55,515
- Well?

35
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,150
- Yes, I'm excited.

36
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,052
Today's the day.

37
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,662
- Stealing ice? Seriously?

38
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,433
Isn't that a bit cliche
even for Captain Cold?

39
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,436
- Come on. We don't
have time for this!

40
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,779
- Err!

41
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,180
- Calm down, kid.

42
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,715
- Oh, please!

43
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:30,684
You'll chat it up with
the cops, with bystanders,

44
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,152
With cold even.

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,987
No. No way!

46
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,989
Today is the day!

47
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,644
- Today is the day.

48
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,546
- Welcome to the
hall of justice.

49
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,648
- Headquarters of
the Justice League.

50
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,483
- Oh, man!

51
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,420
I knew we'd be the
last ones here.

52
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,292
- Is that Batman?

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,994
- I see Flash and Flash jr.

54
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,328
- His name's Speedy. Duh.

55
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:17,264
- No. Speedy's
green arrow's sidekick.

56
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,699
- Well, that makes no sense.

57
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,334
- Ready to see
the inner sanctum?

58
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,602
- Born that way.

59
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,104
- I'm glad we're all here.

60
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,172
- Have all 4 sidekicks
ever been in the same place

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
At the same time?

62
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,677
- Don't call us
sidekicks, not after today.

63
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,413
- Sorry. First
time at the hall.

64
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,081
I'm a little overwhelmed.

65
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,150
- You're overwhelmed,
freeze was underwhelmed.

66
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:40,020
Why isn't anyone
ever just whelmed?

67
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,794
Oh. Maybe that's why.

68
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:59,034
- Robin, Speedy, Aqualad,
Kid Flash, welcome.

69
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:03,944
You now have unlimited access
to the gym, our fully stocked

70
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:08,348
Galley, and of
course our library.

71
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:14,020
- Make yourselves at home.

72
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:17,257
- Quick debrief to discuss the
coincidence of 4 ice villains

73
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,359
Attacking on the same day.

74
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:21,361
We shouldn't be long.

75
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:32,405
- Recognized: Batman, 0-2;
Aquaman, 0-6; Flash, 0-4;

76
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:37,277
Green Arrow, 0-8;
Martian Manhunter, 0-7;

77
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:40,246
Red Tornado, 1-6.

78
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:42,182
- That's it?

79
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,818
You promised us a real look
inside, not a glorified

80
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,386
Backstage pass.

81
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:47,854
- It's a first step.

82
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,190
You've been granted
access few others get.

83
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:52,325
- Oh, really?

84
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,694
Who cares which side of
the glass we're on?

85
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,097
- Roy, you just need
to be patient.

86
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:59,633
- What I need is respect.

87
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,301
They're treating us like kids.

88
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:03,703
Worse--like sidekicks!

89
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,072
We deserve better than this.

90
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:09,609
You're kidding, right?

91
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,044
You're playing their game?

92
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,747
Why? Because you
think they play fair?

93
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,517
Today was supposed to be the
day, step one in becoming

94
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,686
Full-fledged members
of The League.

95
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,890
- Well, sure, but I thought
step one was a tour of the hq.

96
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,726
- Except the hall isn't
The League's real hq.

97
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,762
I bet they never told you
it's just a false front

98
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,498
For tourists and a pit stop
for catching zeta beam

99
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:35,535
Teleporter tubes to the real
thing, an orbiting satellite

100
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,904
Called the watchtower.

101
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:42,342
- I know, I know, but I
thought maybe we could make

102
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,277
An exception.

103
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:48,181
Or not.

104
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,583
- You're not helping
your cause here, son.

105
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,218
Stand down or--

106
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,987
- Or what? You'll send
me to my room?

107
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,689
And I'm not your son!

108
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:57,357
I'm not even his.

109
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:01,995
I thought I was his
partner, but not anymore.

110
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:11,938
Guess they're
right about you 3.

111
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:13,940
You're not ready.

112
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,680
[alarm blaring]

113
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,048
- Superman to Justice League.

114
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,117
There's been an explosion
at project Cadmus.

115
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,218
It's on fire.

116
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:27,687
- I've had my
suspicions about Cadmus.

117
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,756
This may present the
perfect opportunity to in--

118
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,324
- Zatara to Justice League.

119
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:34,327
The sorcerer wotan is using
the amulet of attan to blot

120
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,395
Out the sun.

121
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,263
Requesting full
League response.

122
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,298
- Superman?

123
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:39,566
- It's a small fire.

124
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,267
Local authorities have
it under control.

125
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,403
- Then Cadmus can wait.

126
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,238
All leaguers rendezvous
at Zatara's coordinates.

127
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:47,674
Batman out.

128
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:48,808
Stay put.

129
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,310
- What? Why?

130
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,845
- This is a League mission.

131
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:54,047
- You're not trained.
- Since when?

132
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:56,049
- I meant you're not trained
to work as part of this team.

133
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,852
- There will be other
missions when you're ready.

134
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,255
- But for now, stay put.

135
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,593
- Glad you didn't
bring you know who?

136
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,261
- Indeed.

137
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,874
- When we're ready?

138
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,810
How are we ever supposed to be
ready when they treat us like--

139
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,713
Like sidekicks?

140
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,750
- My mentor, my king, I
thought he trusted me.

141
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:33,353
- Trust? They don't even
trust us with the basics!

142
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,090
They've got a
secret hq in space!

143
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,159
- What else aren't
they telling us?

144
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,960
- I have a better question.

145
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,263
Why didn't we
leave with Speedy?

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,502
- What is project Cadmus?

147
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,772
- Don't know,
but I can find out.

148
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,144
- Access denied.

149
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:00,146
- Heh. Want to bet?

150
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:05,151
- Whoa! How are
you doing that?

151
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:08,221
- Same system as the batcave.

152
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:11,791
- Access granted.

153
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:13,326
- All right. Project Cadmus.

154
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,695
Genetics lab here in d.C.

155
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,332
That's all there is, but if
Batman's suspicious, maybe we

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Should investigate.

157
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,869
- Solve their case
before they do.

158
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,470
It would be poetic justice.

159
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:27,507
- Hey. They're
all about justice.

160
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,042
- But they said stay put.

161
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,878
- For the blotting out the
sun mission, not this.

162
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,546
- Wait. Are you
going to Cadmus?

163
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:37,050
Because if you're
going, I'm going.

164
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:40,053
- Just like that we're
a team on a mission?

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,088
- We didn't come for
a play date.

166
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,460
[sirens]

167
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,998
- Help!
- Get us down!

168
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:55,268
- Stay put.
We will get you out.

169
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,178
- Ohh, ohh!

170
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:07,747
- It's what's his
name--Flash boy!

171
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,350
- Kid Flash! Why
is that so hard?

172
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,018
- So smooth.

173
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:13,887
- Does he always have
to run ahead?

174
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,021
We need a plan.

175
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,890
We--Robin?

176
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,858
- Ha ha ha!

177
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,867
- I need to borrow that.

178
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:37,543
Step aboard now.

179
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,112
- Ohh!

180
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,156
- Appreciate the help.

181
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:51,257
- You handled it.

182
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,293
Besides, we're here
to investigate.

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,096
Poetic justice, remember?

184
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,831
[beep]

185
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,037
- There was something
in the--

186
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,872
- Elevators should
be locked down.

187
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:12,679
- This is wrong.

188
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:16,549
Thought so.

189
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:18,751
This is a high-speed
express elevator.

190
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,887
It doesn't belong in a
two-story building.

191
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,356
- Neither does what I saw.

192
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,124
Unh!

193
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,331
- And that's why they need
an express elevator.

194
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:49,949
I'm at the end of my rope.

195
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:59,058
Bypassing security.

196
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,027
There! Go!

197
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,065
Welcome to project Cadmus.

198
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,005
- Wait!

199
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,539
- Aah!

200
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,480
Ohh.

201
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,921
[growling]

202
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,792
[hiss]

203
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,429
- No. Nothing odd
going on here.

204
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,923
[beep beep]

205
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,358
- Dr. Desmond.

206
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,061
- Tell me, guardian, what part
of no interruptions did you

207
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:11,664
Not understand?

208
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:14,467
If you're here to tell me what
caused the street level fire,

209
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:15,635
It can wait.

210
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,537
- Fire department's
still cleaning up.

211
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,539
I'll begin my
investigation when they leave.

212
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:20,740
- Then what?

213
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,843
- A g-gnome on sub-level
26 reports 3 intruders.

214
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:28,081
- Ohh. Did I miss a
perimeter breach alert?

215
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,048
- No.

216
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:30,650
- Then the g-gnome's confused.

217
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,286
Whatever might occur in our
faux lab above ground,

218
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:38,157
The real Cadmus is the most
secure facility in d.C.

219
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,226
- My job to keep it that way.

220
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:43,596
- Fine. Take a squad.

221
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:47,300
- Might I recommend guardian
leave his g-gnome behind?

222
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,769
If violence should occur...

223
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,504
- The little guy would
be in my way.

224
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:55,441
- No. The advantage of instant
telepathic communication

225
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:59,145
Outweighs other concerns.

226
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,447
[hiss]

227
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,686
- I need my g-gnome with
me at all times.

228
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:21,734
- Ok. I'm officially whelmed.

229
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,812
- This is how they hid this
massive underground facility

230
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,480
From the world.

231
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,449
The real Cadmus
isn't on the grid.

232
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:40,219
It generates its own
power with these things.

233
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,288
Must be what they're bred for.

234
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:44,557
- Of course. Even the
name is a clue.

235
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,827
The Cadmus of myth created a
new race by sowing dragons'

236
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,162
Teeth into the earth.

237
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:53,232
- And this Cadmus
creates new life, too.

238
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,301
Let's find out why.

239
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:59,672
They call them genomorphs.

240
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,276
Whoa! Look at the stats on
these things--superstrength,

241
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:04,544
Telepathy, razor claws.

242
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,245
These are living weapons!

243
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:09,482
- They're engineering
an army, but for who?

244
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,816
- Wait. There's
something else.

245
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:13,052
Project Kr.

246
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,354
Ugh! The file's
triple-encrypted. I can't--

247
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:16,689
- Don't move!

00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:19,091
[growling]

249
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,162
Wait. Robin,
Aqualad, Kid Flash?

250
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,898
- At least he got
your name right.

251
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,099
- I know you.

252
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,968
Guardian, a hero.

253
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:30,236
- I do my best.

254
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,404
- Then what are
you doing here?

255
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,272
- I think that's
my question, boys.

256
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,740
I'm chief of security.

257
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,310
You're trespassing, but we
can call the Justice League,

258
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:38,578
Figure this out.

259
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,046
- You think The League's
gonna approve of you

260
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,314
Breeding weapons?

261
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:47,381
- Weapons? What are
you--what have I--ugh.

262
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,356
My head.

263
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:51,958
Take them down hard!

264
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:53,025
No mercy!

- Way to be a
team player, rob!

269
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:38,104
- Weren't you right behind me?

270
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,516
- We're headed down?

271
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:52,218
- Dude, out is up.

272
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:56,589
- Excuse me? Project Kr,
it's down on sub-level 52.

273
00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:59,058
- This is out of control.

274
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:05,126
Perhaps--perhaps we
should contact The League.

275

[ding]

276
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,376
- We are already here.

00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,978
- [sighs]

278
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,784
Which way?

279
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:26,485
- Yeah. Bizarre-looking
hallway one

280
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:28,421
Or bizarre-looking hallway two?

281
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:29,922
- Halt!

282
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:45,404
They are headed
for project Kr!

283
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:56,382
- Aah!

284
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:05,424
- [grunting]

285
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,093
Hurry!

286
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:18,637
- I disabled the door.

287
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:19,672
We're safe.

288
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,873
- We're trapped.

289
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,976
- Uh, guys. You'll
want to see this.

290
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,351
- Whoa!

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,537
- Big "k," little "r," the
atomic symbol for krypton.

292
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:51,571
Clone?

293
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:52,672
- Robin, hack.

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,474
- Oh. Right, right.

Weapon designation Superboy,

In...16 weeks?

00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,421
From DNA acquired
from Superman.

298
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,090
- Stolen from Superman.

299
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:12,058
- No way the big guy
knows about this.

300
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,160
- Solar suit allows him
to absorb yellow sun

301
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,996
Radiation 24/7.

302
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:18,365
- And these creatures?

303
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:21,801
- Genomorph gnomes,
telepathic, force-feeding him

304
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,169
An education.

305
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,437
- And we can guess what else.

306
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:30,043
They're making a slave out
of, well, Superman's son.

307
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,145
- Now we contact The League.

308
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:35,915
- No signal.

309
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:38,485
- We're in too deep literally.

310
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,387
[growl]

311
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,525
- They're still in
there with the weapon?

312
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:47,193
- We can't get the door open.

313
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,062
- Use your telekinesis!

314
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,464
- I have tried to no avail.

315
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,700
- Useless. This is a debacle.

316
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:56,836
Get some g-trolls down here
to muscle the door open now!

317
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,705
- Already on their way.

318
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:01,274
- You realize once we get
in there we can't ever let

319
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,475
Them leave.

320
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:05,779
- Doc, these aren't your
typical meddling kids.

321
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,314
You don't want to get on
the wrong side

322
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:08,782
Of the Justice League.

323
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,817
- Better than getting on the
wrong since of the Cadmus

324
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:13,119
Board of directors, believe me.

325
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,291
Contact the
g-gnomes inside Kr.

326

[hiss]

327

00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:26,066
- We can't leave
him like this.

329
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,568
- Set him free. Do it.

330
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:41,881
[hissing]

331
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,220
Unh!

332
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,092
- Whoa! Hang on, Supey.

333
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,361
- We're on your side.

334
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:55,929
- Ohh!

335
00:20:58,165 --> 00:20:59,866
- I don't want to do this.

336
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:02,569
Unh!

337
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:20,186
- Enough!

338
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:22,522
- [groaning]

339
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:29,896
- We are trying to help you.

340
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,843
- Aah!

341
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,905
- Attaboy.

342
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:38,133
- Dr. Desmond, you require
an audience with the light?

343
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:41,970
- Yes. Very sorry to disturb
you at this late hour.

344
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,404
- Just make your report.

345
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:45,773
- Of course. Ahem.

346
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:49,877
Well, we had a small fire
here at project Cadmus.

347
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:52,780
The origin of the incident is
still unclear, but it seems to

348
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,149
Have attracted some...

349
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:57,485
Unwanted attention.

350
00:22:57,553 --> 00:23:02,023
3 sidekicks--Robin,
Aqualad, and Kid Flash--

351
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:03,691
Breached security.

352
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,462
They found and released
the weapon, the Superboy.

353
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,732
Of course the clone is under
our telepathic control and as

354
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,768
Ordered turned against
his would-be liberators.

355
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:16,371
The 3 are contained, and we
don't believe The League knows

356
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,506
They're here.

357
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:23,978
Uh, what should I
do with them?

358
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:25,446
- Clone them.

359
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:29,717
The substitutes will serve
the light and only the light.

360
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:33,054
- And the originals?

361
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,622
- Dispose of them.

362
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,391
Leave no trace.

363
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,667
- Time runs short.

364
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,936
You must awaken.

365
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:51,439
You must awaken now!

366
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:59,447
- What? What do you want?

367
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:01,949
Quit staring.
You're creeping me out.

368
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:05,019
- Uh, KF, how about we not
tick off the guy who can fry

369
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,654
Us with a look?

370
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:09,123
- Prepare the cloning
procedure for the new project

371
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:12,760
Sidekick now.

372
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,495
- Almost done here, doc.

373
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,969
- Where's the weapon?

374
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,971
- Superboy? He carried
the intruders to

375
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,073
The cloning chamber.

376
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,974
- We have genomorphs for that!

377
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,410
Get the weapon back
in its pod now!

378
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:30,912
- I don't see the harm
in letting the kid

379
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,213
Stretch his legs.

380
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,015
- Don't you now?

381
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,583
[hiss]

382
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:41,489
- That clone
belongs in a cage!

383
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:48,029
- We only sought to help you.

384
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:49,897
- Yeah. We free you,
and you turn on us.

385
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:50,965
How's that for grat--

386
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,201
- Kid, please, be quiet now.

387
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:56,070
I believe our new friend
is not in full control

388
00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:57,872
Of his actions.

389
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,277
- Wha--what if--
what if I wasn't?

390
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:05,146
- He can talk?

391
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:09,283
- Yes, he can.

392
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,252
- Not like I said, "it."

393
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,554
- The genomorphs taught
you telepathically.

394
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:15,423
- They taught me much.

395
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:17,859
I can read, write.

396
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:19,360
I know the names of things.

397
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:20,962
- But have you seen them?

398
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:25,933
Have they ever actually let
you see the sky or the sun?

399
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:30,738
- Images are implanted
in my mind, but no.

400
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:32,306
I have not seen them.

401
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:34,876
- Do you know what
you are, who you are?

402
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:38,112
- I am the Superboy, a
genomorph, a clone made from

403
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,182
The DNA of the Superman,
created to replace him should

404
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,621
He perish, to destroy him
should he turn from the light.

405
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:50,558
- To be like Superman is a
worthy aspiration, but like

406
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:54,262
Superman, you deserve a life
of your own beyond that

407
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:58,866
Solar suit, beyond your
pod, beyond Cadmus.

408
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,968
- I live because of Cadmus!

409
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,136
It is my home!

410
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:03,971
- Your home is a test tube.

411
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,773
We can show you the sun.

412
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,709
- Uh, pretty sure it's after
midnight, but we can show

413
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:09,877
You the moon.

414
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:14,615
- We can show you,
introduce you to Superman.

415
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:17,685
- No, they can't.

416
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,688
They'll be otherwise occupied.

417
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:22,456
Activate the cloning process.

418
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,759
- Pass. Batcave's
crowded enough.

419
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:28,095
- And get the weapon
back in its pod!

420
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:30,831
- Hey. How come he gets
to call Supey an it?

421
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:36,971
- Help us.

422
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,007
- Don't start thinking now.

423
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:41,642
[hiss]

424
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:45,012
See, you're not a real boy.

425
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,016
You're a weapon, and
you belong to me!

426
00:26:49,084 --> 00:26:51,485
Well, to Cadmus. Same thing.

427
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:53,621
Now get back to your pod!

428
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:09,103
- Aah!
- Unh!

429
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:11,606
[all groaning]

430
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,445
- Where's dubbilex?

431
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:21,015
Ooh! Lurking as usual.

432
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,684
Get the g-gnomes
downloading their memories.

433
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:26,287
When that's done and when
you're sure the clones are

434
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:30,491
Viable, delete the
source material.

435
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:38,799
[screaming]

436
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:43,104
- Superboy, you live.

437
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:45,906
That gives you the right
to follow your own path.

438
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:51,212
A weapon or a person, the
choice is yours, but ask

439
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,548
Yourself, "what
would Superman do?"

440
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:01,922
[boom]

441
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,901
- I told you to get
back to your--

442
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,840
- Don't give me orders.

443
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,979
- You here to help
us or fry us?

444
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:30,418
- Huh. I don't seem to have
heat vision, so I suppose

445
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,687
Helping is my only option.

446
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:37,958
- Ahh. Finally!

447
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,593
Lucky Batman isn't here.

448
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:41,495
He'd have my head
for taking so long.

449
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:44,098
- Seriously, that's what
you're worried about?

450
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:47,034
The whole League will have
our heads after tonight.

451
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:50,104
- Free Aqualad.

452
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,572
I'll get kid mouth.

453
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,208
- Don't you give
me orders either.

454
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,579
- Thank you.

455
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:05,286
- You--you'll never
get out of here!

456
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:07,855
I'll have you back in
pods before morning.

457
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:10,925
- That guy is not whelmed,
not whelmed at all.

458
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:12,960
- What is it with you
and this whelmed thing?

459
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:25,506
- Activate every
genomorph in Cadmus.

460
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:27,708
[hissing]

461
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,949
- We are still 42 levels
below ground, but if we can

462
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,917
Make the elevator...

463
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,186
[growling]

464
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:53,952
[growling]

465
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,489
- Aah!

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,969
- Superboy, the goal
is escape, not to bury

467
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:12,237
Ourselves here.

468
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:14,773
- You want escape?

469
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,741
Aah!

470
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:31,022
I--I'm falling.

471
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:37,228
Superman can fly.

472
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:38,596
Why can't I fly?

473
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:40,265
- Don't know, but it looks
like you can leap tall

474
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,633
Buildings in a single bound.

475
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:44,669
Still cool.

476
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:45,870
- Thank you.

477
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:48,373
- Guys, this will have
to be our exit.

478
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,451
- Turn left, brother.

479
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:04,222
- Go left! Left!

480
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,390
- Turn right.

481
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,992
- Right!

482
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:11,129
- Great directions, Supey.

483
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:12,697
You trying to get us repodded?

484
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,799
- No. I don't understand.

485
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:18,069
- Don't apologize.
This is perfect!

486
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,271
[growling]

487
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,642
- At this rate,
we'll never get out.

488
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,545
- Shh. Listen.

489
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,349

- Someone--Robin, I'd
wager--hacked our systems,

491
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:38,223
Deactivating internal security
cameras, but he neglected

492
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,891
The motion sensors.

493
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:42,794
The genomorphs are closing in.

494
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:44,496
They're all
coming out in here.

495
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,197
We have them cornered.

496
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:58,510
Ohh! He hacked the
motion sensors.

497
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,011
- I hacked the motion sensors.

498
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,881
- Sweet. Still plenty of
them between us and out.

499
00:32:02,948 --> 00:32:05,050
- But I've finally
got room to move.

500
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:15,860
- More behind us.

501
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,836
- We'll cut them off
at sub-level 1.

502
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:29,904
- We'd better, or the board
will have our heads, my head.

503
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:34,579
I need to get something
from project Blockbuster

504
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:35,747
Just in case.

505
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:37,749
I'll meet you at sub-level 1.

506
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:43,822
- Oh, crud.

507
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,393
- We're cut off
from the street.

508
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:50,862
- Thanks. My head
hadn noticed.

509
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,334
- Can't hack this fast enough.

510
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:58,269
[growling]

511
00:32:58,337 --> 00:32:59,904
This way!

512
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,865
- Perhaps for the sake of
all genomorphs, our brother

513
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:31,069
Superboy should make
up his own mind.

514
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:32,337
- It was you.

515
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:35,840
- Yes, brother. I set the fire
and lured your new friends

516
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:39,544
Down into Cadmus, woke them
when they were in danger...

517
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:41,913
- And guided me. Why?

518
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:46,484
- Because you are our
hope, the genomorph hero.

519
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:50,255
You will blaze a trail for all
our brothers, showing us

520
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,491
The way to freedom.

521
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,627
- What's going on?

522
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:04,802
- What is your
choice, brother?

523
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,706
- I...Choose...Freedom.

524
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:16,381
- Feels like fog lifting.

525
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,416
- Guardian?

526
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:21,119
- Go. I'll deal with Desmond.

527
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:24,489
- I think not.

528
00:34:24,557 --> 00:34:28,893
Project Blockbuster will give
me the power to restore order

529
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,762
To Cadmus.

530
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,035
[groaning]

531
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,848
[growling]

532
00:34:57,223 --> 00:34:59,525
- [growling]

533
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,300
- Everyone back!

534
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,871
Aah!

535
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:14,406
- Arrgh!

536
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,955
- Ok. That's one way to
bust through the ceiling.

537
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,623
- You think lab
coat planned that?

538
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:35,160
- I doubt he is planning
anything anymore.

539
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,363
- [growling]

540
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,821
- Learned that one
in kindergarten.

541
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:19,738
- Unh!

542
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:30,949
- Aah!

543
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:32,418
- Unh!

544
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:42,194
- Of course.

545
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:44,229
KF, get over here!

546
00:36:58,244 --> 00:36:59,611
- Got it?
- Got it.

547
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,013
- Go!

548
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:08,554
- Got your nose.

549
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:17,930
- Superboy, Aqualad!

550
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:21,600
- Come and get me,
you incredible bulk!

551
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:23,068
Ohh!

552
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,373
- This one and that one.

553
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:34,880
- Sorry. Try again.

554
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:53,432
- Ha!

555
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,801
- [roaring]

556
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:58,737
- Move!

557
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:00,873
[beeping]

558
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:08,981
- [roars]

559
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:40,445
- We did it.

560
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:42,981
- Was there ever any doubt?

561
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:56,762
- See? The moon.

562
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,075
Oh. And Superman.

563
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:12,244
Do we keep our
promises or what?

564
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:01,326
- Is that what I think it is?

565
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:03,595
- He doesn't like
being called an it.

566
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:05,631
- I'm Superman's clone.

567
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,940
- Start talking.

568
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:36,962
- [sighs]

569
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,831
Well, uh--we'll figure
something out for you.

570
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:41,600
The League will, I mean.

571
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:46,038
For now, I'd better make sure
they get that Blockbuster

572
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:50,409
Creature squared away.

573
00:40:50,476 --> 00:40:54,980
- Cadmus will be investigated,
all 52 levels, but let's make

574
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:56,214
One thing clear.

575
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:57,616
- You should have called.

576
00:40:57,684 --> 00:41:00,319
- End results aside,
we are not happy.

577
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:03,021
You hacked Justice League
systems, disobeyed direct

578
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:05,857
Orders, and endangered lives.

579
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:10,195
You will not be
doing this again.

580
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:13,098
- I am sorry, but we will.

581
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,834
- Aqualad, stand down.

582
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:20,272
- Apologies, my king, but no.

583
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,343
We did good work here tonight,
the work you trained us to do.

584
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,715
Together on our own we forged
something powerful, important.

585
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:31,516
- If this is about your
treatment at the hall,

586
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:32,484
The 3 of you--

587
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:34,252
- The 4 of us, and it's not.

588
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,856
- Batman, we're ready to use
what you taught us, or why

589
00:41:37,924 --> 00:41:41,660
Teach us at all?

590
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:44,096
- Why let them tell
us what to do?

591
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:45,664
It's simple.

592
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:48,900
Get on board or get
out of the way.

593
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,884
- This cave was the
original secret sanctuary

594
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:08,053
Of the Justice League.

595
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:10,222
We're calling it
into service again.

596
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:12,824
Since you 4 are determined
to stay together and fight

597
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:17,729
The good fight, you'll do
it on League terms.

598
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:19,898
Red Tornado volunteered
to live here and be

599
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:21,233
Your supervisor.

600
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,602
Black canary's in
charge of training.

601
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,871
I will deploy you on missions.

602
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:27,406
- Real missions?

603
00:42:27,473 --> 00:42:29,708
- Yes, but covert.

604
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:31,910
- The League will still
handle the obvious stuff.

605
00:42:31,978 --> 00:42:34,880
There's a reason we have these
big targets on our chests.

606
00:42:34,947 --> 00:42:37,649
- But Cadmus proves the bad
guys are getting smarter.

607
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:40,285
Batman needs a team that
can operate on the sly.

608
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:42,454
- The 5 of you will
be that team.

609
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:46,958
- Cool! Wait. 5?

610
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:49,528
- This is the Martian
Manhunter's niece

611
00:42:49,595 --> 00:42:50,796
Miss Martian.

612
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:52,397
- Hi.

613
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:54,966
- Liking this gig
more every minute.

614
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:57,602
Welcome aboard. I'm Kid Flash.

615
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,904
That's Robin, Aqualad.

616
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:00,572
It's cool if you
forget their names.

617
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,908
- I'm honored to be included.

618
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,415
- Hey, Superboy.
Come meet miss M.

619
00:43:14,787 --> 00:43:16,922
- I like your t-shirt.

620
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:24,062
- Today is the day.

621
00:43:32,371 --> 00:43:35,173
- Cadmus changes today.

622
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:37,476
With Desmond out of the
picture, the board's placed me

623
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:38,510
In charge.

624
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:40,712
Dr. Spence, you're
acting chief scientist.

625
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,281
No more g-gnomes suppressing
our wills, no more secret

626
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:44,683
Breeding projects.

627
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,520
This is a kinder,
gentler Cadmus.

628
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:53,959
- Then I will of course help
in any way I can, brother.

629
00:43:54,026 --> 00:43:56,261
- Can the light afford to
leave guardian in charge

630
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,330
Without the g-gnomes?

631
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:01,333
- We have subtler
means of control.

632
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,003
What concerns me
is the children.

633
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:07,072
We now know The League is
willing to employ young heroes

634
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:09,307
To do their dirty work.

635
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,775
That's a dark twist.

636
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:14,746
- Yes, but one that can be
played to our advantage.

637
00:44:14,814 --> 00:44:19,384
Even the temporary loss of
the weapon may prove useful.

638
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:23,955
Eventually everyone
sees the light.
